    "abstract": "Systems like the prototypical lac operon can reliably hold the repression of transcription upon DNA replication across cell cycles with just ten repressor molecules per cell and, in addition, behave as if they were at equilibrium. The origin of this type of phenomena is still an unresolved question of major implications. Here, we develop a general theory to analyze strong perturbations in quasi-equilibrium systems and use it to quantify the effects of DNA replication in gene regulation. We find a scaling law that connects actual transcription with its predicted equilibrium values in terms of a single kinetic parameter. We show that even the simplest, exceptionally reliable natural system functions beyond the physical limits of naive regulation through compensatory mechanisms that suppress nonequilibrium effects. We validate the approach with both in vivo cell-population and single-cell characterization of the lac operon. Analyses of synthetic systems without adjuvant activators, such as the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), do not show this reliability. Our results provide a rationale for the function of CRP, beyond just being a tunable activator, as a mitigator of cell cycle perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) leads to Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is one of the major causes for low objective response rates of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Here, we report that chemical inhibition of p38 reverses this MDSC-induced immunosuppressive TME and improves the immunotherapy efficacy in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Firstly, by combining the tumor immunological phenotype (TIP) gene signature and high throughput sequencing based high throughput screening (HTS2), we identified that ponatinib significantly inhibits the expression of \"cold\" tumor associated chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 in cancer cells. This inhibition decreases the infiltration of MDSCs and consequently increased the accumulation of \"hot\" tumor associated T cells and NK cells and thus reverses the immunosuppressive TME. Then, by multiple preclinical models, we found that ponatinib significantly inhibits tumor growth in a TME-dependent manner and enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy on TNBC in vivo. Notably, ponatinib exhibits no significant inhibition on immune cells in mouse spleens. Mechanistically, ponatinib directly inhibits the kinase activity of p38, which results in the reduction of the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727, and thus the decreased expression of CXCL1 and CXCL2 in cancer cells. Our study provided the therapeutic potential of combining p38 inhibition with ICB for the treatment of TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Parasitism has strong effects on community dynamics. Given the detrimental effects parasites have on host health, infection or infestation might be expected to reduce upper thermal limits, increasing the vulnerability of host species to future climate change. Copepods are integral components of aquatic food webs and biogeochemical cycles. They also serve as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of parasitic isopods in the family Bopyridae. Given the important effects both copepods and isopod parasites play in aquatic communities, it is important to understand how the interaction between parasite and host affects thermal limits in order to better predict how community dynamics may change in a warming climate. Here we examined the effect of infestation by larvae of a bopyrid isopod on cosmopolitan copepod Acartia tonsa to test the hypothesis that infestation reduces thermal limits. To aid with this work, we developed an affordable, highly portable system for measuring critical thermal maxima of small ectotherms. We also used meta-analysis to summarize the effects of parasitism on critical thermal maxima in a wider range of taxa to help contextualize our findings. Contrary to both our hypothesis and the results of previous studies, we observed no reduction of thermal limits by parasitism in A. tonsa. These results suggest that life history of the host and parasite may interact to determine how parasite infestation affects environmental sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease and challenging to treat due to its mixture of transcriptional subtypes and subtype transitions. Transcription factor (TF) networks have been the focus of studies to identify SCLC subtype regulators via systems approaches. Yet, their structures, which can provide clues on subtype drivers and transitions, are barely investigated. Here, we analyze the structure of an SCLC TF network by using graph theory concepts and identify its structurally important components responsible for complex signal processing, called hubs. We show that the hubs of the network are regulators of different SCLC subtypes by analyzing first the unbiased network structure and then integrating RNA-seq data as weights assigned to each interaction. Data-driven analysis emphasizes MYC as a hub, consistent with recent reports. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the pathways connecting functionally distinct hubs may control subtype transitions and test this hypothesis via network simulations on a candidate pathway and observe subtype transition. Overall, structural analyses of complex networks can identify their functionally important components and pathways driving the network dynamics. Such analyses can be an initial step for generating hypotheses and can guide the discovery of target pathways whose perturbation may change the network dynamics phenotypically.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia triggers a powerful inflammatory reaction involving both peripheral leukocytes and brain resident cells. Recent evidence indicates that their differentiation into a variety of functional phenotypes contributes to both tissue injury and repair. However, the temporal dynamics and diversity of post-stroke immune cell subsets remain poorly understood. To address these limitations, we performed a longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic study of both brain and mouse blood to obtain a composite picture of brain-infiltrating leukocytes, circulating leukocytes, microglia and endothelium diversity over the ischemic/reperfusion time. Brain cells and blood leukocytes isolated from mice 2 or 14 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham surgery were purified by FACS sorting and processed for droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics. The analysis revealed a strong divergence of post-ischemic microglia, macrophages, and neutrophils over time, while such diversity was less evident in dendritic cells, B, T and NK cells. Conversely, brain endothelial cells and brain associated-macrophages showed altered transcriptomic signatures at 2 days post-stroke, but low divergence from sham at day 14. Pseudotime trajectory inference predicted the in-situ longitudinal progression of monocyte-derived macrophages from their blood precursors into day 2 and day 14 phenotypes, while microglia phenotypes at these two time points were not connected. In contrast to monocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils were predicted to be continuously de-novo recruited from the blood. Brain single-cell transcriptomics from both female and male aged mice did not show major changes in respect to young mice, but aged and young brains differed in their immune cell composition. Furthermore, blood leukocyte analysis also revealed altered transcriptomes after stroke. However, brain-infiltrating leukocytes displayed higher transcriptomic divergence than their circulating counterparts, indicating that phenotypic diversification into cellular subsets occurs within the brain in the early and the recovery phase of ischemic stroke. In addition, this resource report contains a searchable database https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/ to allow user-friendly access to our data. The StrokeVis tool constitutes a comprehensive gene expression atlas that can be interrogated at the gene and cell type level to explore the transcriptional changes of endothelial and immune cell subsets from mouse brain and blood after stroke.",

Here, we report the development of a recombinant prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-subunit-based COVID-19 vaccine produced in the mammalian cell line. The gene encoding ectodomain (ECD) of the spike protein was engineered and cloned into Freedom pCHO 1.0, a mammalian expression vector, and subsequently expressed in the Chinese Hamster Ovary suspension cell line (CHO-S). The recombinant S protein ectodomain (hereafter referred to as IMT-CVAX) was purified using a combination of tangential flow filtration and liquid chromatography. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of IMT-CVAX was done to ensure its vital quality attributes. Intramuscular immunization of mice with two doses of adjuvanted IMT-CVAX elicited a strong anti-Spike IgG response. In pseudovirus-based assays, IMT-CVAX- immune mice sera exhibited a broad-spectrum neutralization of several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs). Golden Syrian Hamster immunized with IMT-CVAX provided excellent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, hamster immune sera neutralized the live SARS-CoV-2 virus. The adjuvanted IMT-CVAX induced robust Tfh-cells response and germinal center (GC) reaction in human ACE2 receptor-expressing transgenic mice. The findings of this study may pave the way for developing next-generation protein subunit-based vaccines to combat the existing SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging VoCs. The IMT-CVAX is produced using a scalable process and can be used for large-scale vaccine production in an industrial setup.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how birds annually allocate energy to cope with changing environmental conditions and physiological states is a fundamental question in avian ecology. The two main hypotheses to explain annual patterns in energy use are \"reallocation\" and \"increased demand\". The reallocation hypothesis suggests equal energetic costs in winter and breeding seasons, while the increased demand suggests that energy demand should be highest during breeding. Under the standard aerobic capacity model of endothermy, birds are expected to adjust the mass and/or metabolic intensity of their bodies in ways that are consistent with expected cold- and/or activity-induced costs. Here, we look for metabolic signatures of reallocation versus increased demands in the energy requirements of a small, resident passerine of a temperate-zone (great tit, Parus major). To do so, we measured whole-body and mass-independent basal (BMR), summit (Msum), and field (FMR) metabolic rates during late winter and during the chick-rearing period (breeding). We also assessed whether, and to what extent, metabolic rates conform to the predictions of the aerobic capacity model of endothermy. We found that great tits showed no substantial differences in energy expenditure between winter and the breeding season, providing support for the reallocation hypothesis. Only mass-independent Msum showed seasonal variation, with significantly higher values ([~]4%) in winter compared to the breeding season. Our results also lend support to the predictions of the aerobic capacity model for the evolution of endothermy, as we found that whole-body BMR and Msum were positively related. We argue that both energy reallocation and the limited increase in mass-independent Msum are consistent with the relatively mild winter temperatures recorded during our study period. Our results confirm that both BMR and Msum are flexible traits that vary in ways that are consistent with expected cold- and/or activity-induced costs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIf plant defenses experience positive selection when they first evolve, evidence of selection on a gene can place the origin of novel defenses on a phylogeny. Prior research on pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), rare specialized metabolites of Apocynaceae, reconstructed evolution of homospermidine synthase (HSS), an enzyme of PA biosynthesis, to infer a single origin of PAs by showing a single duplication in the MRCA of all known PA-producing species that gave rise to an enzyme with the predicted motif (VXXXD) of a functionally optimized HSS. We follow up by testing the effect of amino acid motif on HSS function, revisiting motif evolution in HSS-like genes, and testing for selection to infer evolution of HSS function. Some evidence supports a single origin of PAs: an IXXXD HSS, similar in function to VXXXD HSS, evolved in the MRCA of all PA-producing species; loss of optimized HSS function occurred multiple times via pseudogenization and perhaps via evolution of an IXXXN motif. Other evidence indicates multiple origins: the VXXXD motif, present in all PA-producing species, evolved two or three times independently; branch-site models suggest that the ancestral IXXXD branch was not under positive selection while some VXXXD branches were; there is no evidence of relaxed selection on putatively impaired HSS-like genes (IXXXN motif); substitutions at sites experiencing positive selection occurred on multiple branches in the HSS-like gene tree, suggesting that HSS function may have been optimized in multiple independent lineages. We discuss how complexity of genotype-phenotype maps confounds inference of phenotypic from genic evolution.",

    "abstract": "The dilute black (bd) of the silkworm Bombyx mori is a recessive mutant that produces a grayish-black color in the larval integument, instead of the characteristic white color found in wild-type larvae. In addition, eggs produced by bd females are sterile due to a deficiency in the micropylar apparatus. We identified candidate genes responsible for the bd phenotype using publicly available RNA-seq data. One of these candidate genes was homologous to the maternal gene required for meiosis (mamo) of Drosophila melanogaster, which encodes a broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac-zinc finger (BTB-ZF) transcription factor essential for female fertility. In three independent bd strains, the expression of the B. mori mamo (Bmmamo) was downregulated in the larval integument. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout strategy, we found that Bmmamo knockout mutants exhibit a grayish-black color in the larval integument and female infertility. Moreover, larvae obtained from the complementation cross between bd/+ mutants and heterozygous knockouts for the Bmmamo also exhibited a grayish-black color, indicating that Bmmamo is responsible for the bd phenotype. Gene expression analysis using Bmmamo knockout mutants suggested that the BmMamo protein suppresses the expression of melanin synthesis genes. Previous comparative genome analysis revealed that the Bmmamo was selected during silkworm domestication, and we found that Bmmamo expression in the larval integument is higher in B. mori than in the wild silkworm B. mandarina, suggesting that the Bmmamo is involved in domestication-associated pigmentation changes of the silkworm.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=65 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/535244v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cd37a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ff5b23org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b87dcforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14bd742_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The European bison was saved from the brink of extinction due to considerable conservation efforts since the early 20th century. The current global population of > 9,500 individuals is the result of successful ex situ breeding based on a stock of only 12 founders, resulting in an extremely low level of genetic variability. Due to the low allelic diversity, traditional molecular tools, such as microsatellites, fail to provide sufficient resolution for accurate genetic assessments in European bison, let alone from non-invasive samples. Here, we present a SNP panel for accurate high-resolution genotyping of European bison, which is suitable for a wide variety of sample types. The panel accommodates 96 markers allowing for individual and parental assignment, sex determination, breeding line discrimination, and cross-species detection. Two applications were shown to be utilisable in further Bos species with potential conservation significance. The new SNP panel will allow to tackle crucial tasks in European bison conservation, including the genetic monitoring of reintroduced populations, and a molecular assessment of pedigree data documented in the worlds first studbook of a threatened species.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesProgressive Pseudorheumatoid Arthropathy of Childhood (PPAC), caused by deficiency of WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 3 (WISP3), has been challenging to study because no animal model of the disease exists and cartilage recovered from affected patients is indistinguishable from common end-stage osteoarthritis. Therefore, to gain insights into why precocious articular cartilage failure occurs in this disease, we made in vitro derived articular cartilage using isogenic WISP3-deficient and WISP3-sufficient human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs).\n\nMethodsWe generated articular cartilage-like tissues from induced-(i)PSCs from 2 patients with PPAC and 1 wild-type human embryonic stem cell line in which we knocked out WISP3. We compared these tissues to in vitro-derived articular cartilage tissues from 2 isogenic WISP3-sufficient control lines using histology, bulk RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, and in situ hybridization.\n\nResultsWISP3-deficient and WISP3-sufficient hPSCs both differentiated into articular cartilage-like tissues that appeared histologically similar. However, the transcriptomes of WISP3-deficient tissues differed significantly from WISP3-sufficient tissues and pointed to increased TGF{beta}, TNF/NFkB, and IL-2/STAT5 signaling and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. Single cell sequencing and in situ hybridization revealed that WISP3-deficient cartilage contained a significantly higher fraction ([~] 4-fold increase, p < 0.001) of superficial zone chondrocytes compared to deeper zone chondrocytes than did WISP3-sufficient cartilage. Conclusions WISP3-deficient and WISP3-sufficient hPSCs can be differentiated into articular cartilage-like tissues, but these tissues differ in their transcriptomes and in the relative abundances of chondrocyte sub-types they contain. These findings provide important starting points for in vivo studies when an animal model of PPAC or presymptomtic patient-derived articular cartilage becomes available.\n\nKEY MESSAGES What is already known on this topicO_LILoss-of-function mutations in WISP3 cause Progressive Pseudorheumatoid Arthropathy of Childhood (PPAC), yet the precise function of WISP3 in cartilage is unknown due to the absence of cartilage disease Wisp3 knockout mice and the lack of available PPAC patient cartilage that is not end-stage. Thus, most functional studies of WISP3 have been performed in vitro using WISP3 over-expressing cell lines (i.e., not wild-type) and WISP3-deficient chondrocytes.\nC_LI\n\nWhat this study addsO_LIWe describe 3 new WISP3-deficient human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines and show they can be differentiated into articular cartilage-like tissue.\nC_LIO_LIWe compare in vitro-derived articular cartilage made from WISP3-deficient and isogenic WISP3- sufficient hPSCs using bulk RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, and in situ hybridization.\nC_LIO_LIWe observe significant differences in the expression of genes previously associated with cartilage formation and homeostasis in the TGF{beta}, TNF/NFkB, and IL-2/STAT5 signaling pathways. We also observe that WISP3-deficient cartilage-like tissues contain significantly higher fractions of chondrocytes that express superficial zone transcripts. These data suggest precocious cartilage failure in PPAC is the result of abnormal articular cartilage formation, dysregulated homeostatic signaling, or both.\nC_LI\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policyO_LIThis study uses in vitro-derived articular cartilage to generate hypotheses for why cartilage fails in children with PPAC. This work prioritizes downstream studies to be performed when pre-symptomatic patient-derived cartilage samples or animal model of PPAC becomes available. It is essential to know how WISP3 functions in cartilage to develop therapies that benefit patients with PPAC and other degenerative joint diseases.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Gekko japonicus possess excellent flexible climbing and detoxification ability under insectivorous habits, and its chromosomes and the genetic evolutionary mechanisms behind these traits are still unclarified. Here, we assembled a chromosome-level genome of G. japonicus with a total size of 2.53 Gb contained in 19 pairs of chromosomes. The evolutionary breakpoint regions (EBRs) are significantly enriched for some repetitive elements compared to the rest of genome and the genes located in the EBRs are enriched in defense response pathway. G. japonicus specific gene families, expanded gene families and positively selected genes are mainly enriched in some pathways related to the immune, sensory and nervous systems. These results from comprehensive comparative genomics and evolutionary genomics analyses indicated that bitter taste receptor type 2 (T2Rs) expanded in different lineages by tandem gene duplication. The expansion and independent duplication events of T2Rs and positively selected branches were predominantly present in insectivorous species, suggests that T2Rs are associate with clearance of bitter toxins in gekkotans. Detoxification genes in detox and biosynthetic cytochrome P450 of G. japonicas have frequent duplication and loss events, suggests that they undergo more birth and death processes compared to biosynthesis type genes. Pro, Cys, Gly and Ser are the most abundant amino acids in 66 epidermis formation corneous beta proteins (CBPs) of G. japonicas, the abundance of Gly and Cys in CBPs implying significant effects on the flexibility and setae adhesiveness of gekkotans. Some thermosensitive thermoregulatory transient receptor potential channels under relaxed purifying selection or positive selection in G. japonicus, implying that one of the important factors improve the ability to adapt to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological innovations have enabled the high-throughput quantification of gene expression and epigenetic regulation within individual cells, transforming our understanding of how complex tissues are constructed. Missing from these measurements, however, is the ability to routinely and easily spatially localise these profiled cells. We developed a strategy, Slide-tags, in which single nuclei within an intact tissue section are  tagged with spatial barcode oligonucleotides derived from DNA-barcoded beads with known positions. These tagged nuclei can then be used as input into a wide variety of single-nucleus profiling assays. Application of Slide-tags to the mouse hippocampus positioned nuclei at less than 10 micron spatial resolution, and delivered whole-transcriptome data that was indistinguishable in quality from ordinary snRNA-seq. To demonstrate that Slide-tags can be applied to a wide variety of human tissues, we performed the assay on brain, tonsil, and melanoma. We revealed cell-type-specific spatially varying gene expression across cortical layers and spatially contextualised receptor-ligand interactions driving B-cell maturation in lymphoid tissue. A major benefit of Slide-tags is that it is easily adaptable to virtually any single-cell measurement technology. As proof of principle, we performed multiomic measurements of open chromatin, RNA, and T-cell receptor sequences in the same cells from metastatic melanoma. We identified spatially distinct tumour subpopulations to be differentially infiltrated by an expanded T-cell clone and undergoing cell state transition driven by spatially clustered accessible transcription factor motifs. Slide-tags offers a universal platform for importing the compendium of established single-cell measurements into the spatial genomics repertoire.",

Here, we systematically identified over 11,039 circRNAs expressed in vulnerable dopamine and pyramidal neurons laser-captured from 190 human brains and non-neuronal cells using ultra-deep, total RNA sequencing. 1,526 and 3,308 circRNAs were custom-tailored to the cell identity of dopamine and pyramidal neurons and enriched in synapse pathways. 88% of Parkinsons and 80% of Alzheimers disease-associated genes produced circRNAs. circDNAJC6, produced from a juvenile-onset Parkinsons gene, was already dysregulated during prodromal, onset stages of common Parkinsons disease neuropathology. Globally, addiction-associated genes preferentially produced circRNAs in dopamine neurons, autism-associated genes in pyramidal neurons, and cancers in non-neuronal cells.

    "abstract": "Chromatin organization is nowadays accessible from population and single cell Hi-C data in the form of large contact matrices. Yet reconstructing the three-dimensional chromatin structure remains challenging and relies on polymer models and numerical simulations to account for these Hi-C data. Here we propose a novel optimization algorithm to identify cross-linker ensemble reproducing the experimental contact matrix. Furthermore, based on the polymer configurations extracted from the optimization procedure, we identify high changing curvature (HCC) regions in the chromatin, detected both in population and in single cell Hi-C, that we also compare to Topological Associated Domains (TADs). We report here that the HCC regions correlate with gene expression and CTCF high density distribution. Interestingly, the HCC region locations are heterogeneous across one cell repeats, revealing cell-to-cell variability. To conclude, HCC regions appear both in single and population Hi-C polymer reconstruction and can provide a possible unit for gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Rotating magnetic fields (RMFs), when used to actuate biomedical microrobots for targeted delivery to tumors, have been shown to enable them to overcome physiological barriers and promote their accumulation and penetration into tissue. Nevertheless, directly applying a RMF to a deeply situated target site also leads to off-target actuation in surrounding healthy tissue. Here, we investigate an open-loop control strategy for delivering torque density to diffuse distributions of microrobots at focal points by combining RMFs with magnetostatic gating fields. Taking magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) as a model biohybrid microrobotic system for torque-based actuation, we first use simulation to elucidate off-target torque suppression and find that resolution is set by the relative magnitude of the magnetostatic field and RMF. We study focal torque delivery in vitro, observing off-target suppression of translational velocity of MTB, convection-driven accumulation of companion nanoparticles, and tumor spheroid colonization. We then design, construct, and validate a mouse-scale torque-focusing apparatus incorporating a permanent magnet array, three-phase RMF coils, and offset coils to maneuver the focal point. Our control scheme enables the advantages of torque-based actuation to be combined with spatial targeting, and could be broadly applied to other microrobotic designs for improved drug delivery.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCombining rotating magnetic fields with gating fields enables focused delivery of torque density to dispersed microrobots.",

Opto-lipidomic imaging of transient cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in a murine model of ischemic stroke demonstrates the visualisation and identification of lipids in disease with unprecedented molecular specificity using light. Furthermore, we deploy opto-lipidomics in a handheld fiber-optic Raman probe and demonstrate real-time classification of bulk brain tissues based on specific lipid abundances.

    "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and provide adjunct therapies for other prevalent psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. However, they also induce debilitating extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS), such as Parkinsonism, in a significant minority of patients. The majority of antipsychotic drugs function as dopamine receptor antagonists in the brain while the most recent  third-generation, such as aripiprazole, act as partial agonists. Despite showing good clinical efficacy, these newer agents are still associated with EPS in [~]5-15% of patients. However, it is not fully understand how these movement disorders develop. Here, we combine clinically-relevant drug concentrations with mutliscale model systems to show that aripiprazole and its primary active metabolite induce mitochondrial toxicity inducing robust declines in cellular ATP and viability. Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine were shown to directly inhibit respiratory complex I through its ubiquinone-binding channel. Importantly, all three drugs induced mitochondrial toxicity in primary embryonic mouse neurons, with greater bioenergetic inhibition in ventral midbrain neurons than forebrain neurons. Finally, chronic feeding with aripiprazole resulted in structural damage to mitochondria in the brain and thoracic muscle of adult Drosophila melanogaster consistent with locomotor dysfunction. Taken together, we show that antipsychotic drugs acting as partial dopamine receptor agonists exhibit off-target mitochondrial liabilities targeting complex I.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a leading cause of death with 1.6 million deaths worldwide reported in 2021. Oral pyrazinamide (PZA) is an integral part of anti-TB regimens, but its prolonged use has the potential to drive development of PZA resistant Mtb. PZA is converted to the active moiety pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the Mtb pyrazinamidase encoded by pncA, and mutations in pncA are associated with the majority of PZA resistance. Conventional oral and parenteral therapies may result in subtherapeutic exposure in the lung, hence direct pulmonary administration of POA may provide an approach to rescue PZA efficacy for treating pncA-mutant PZA-resistant Mtb.\n\nThe objectives of the current study were to i) develop novel dry powder POA formulations ii) assess their feasibility for pulmonary delivery using physicochemical characterization, iii) evaluate their pharmacokinetics (PK) in the guinea pig model and iv) develop a mechanism based pharmacokinetic model (MBM) using in vivo PK data to select a formulation providing adequate exposure in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and lung tissue.\n\nWe developed three POA formulations for pulmonary delivery and characterized their PK in plasma, ELF, and lung tissue following passive inhalation in guinea pigs. Additionally, the PK of POA following oral, intravenous and intratracheal administration was characterized in guinea pigs. The MBM was used to simultaneously model PK data following administration of POA and its formulations via the different routes. The MBM described POA PK well in plasma, ELF and lung tissue.\n\nPhysicochemical analyses and MBM predictions suggested that POA maltodextrin was the best among the three formulations and an excellent candidate for further development as it has: (i) the highest ELF-to-plasma exposure ratio (203) and lung tissue-to-plasma exposure ratio (30.4) compared with POA maltodextrin and leucine (75.7/16.2) and POA leucine salt (64.2/19.3); (ii) the highest concentration in ELF (CmacELF: 171 nM) within 15.5 minutes, correlating with a fast transfer into ELF after pulmonary administration (kPM: 22.6 1/h).\n\nThe data from the guinea pig allowed scaling, using the MBM to a human dose of POA maltodextrin powder demonstrating the potential feasibility of an inhaled product.\n\nTable of Contents (TOC)/Abstract Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/534965v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c548fforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3b8efborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@281d94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae07a2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In this study, 10 drugs with substantial differences in human hepatocyte intrinsic metabolic clearance (CLint) and fraction unbound in plasma (fu) between laboratories were selected. The average and maximum ratios between highest and lowest reported predicted in vivo hepatic metabolic clearance (CLH) for the drugs were 529- and 2436-fold, respectively. The in vivo CLH was predicted using in vitro CLint and fu data from the various highly sources and using our in silico methodology. The main aim was to compare the predictive accuracies for the in vitro and in silico methodologies. Prediction errors for in vitro methodology ranged from 1.1-to 578-fold, with an average of 150-fold for lowest predicted estimates and 16-fold for highest predicted estimates. The in vitro based predictions produced 36-to 38-fold higher average and maximum prediction errors than the in silico methodology, respectively. Mean and maximum in silico prediction errors were 4.2- and 15-fold, respectively, which is consistent with earlier results. In contrast to the in vitro methodology the in silico models did not predict high hepatic extraction ratio for drugs with low CLH. Overall, the in silico method clearly outperformed in vitro data for prediction of CLH in man for 10 drugs with large interlaboratory variability.",

    "abstract": "Blocking inflammatory pathways, such as the inflammasome or IL-1{beta}, is a promising therapeutic target in both ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure (HF). We hypothesize that IL-1{beta} may stimulate cardiac lymphangiogenesis, driven by left ventricular dilation in HF. Thus, blocking IL-1{beta} signaling may reduce lymphangiogenesis, which could delay resolution of myocardial edema and inflammation, aggravate cardiac fibrosis, and accelerate HF development.\n\nHere, we investigated the effects of early versus late anti-IL-1{beta} treatment during pressure-overload induced by transaortic constriction (TAC) in Balb/c mice prone to left ventricular (LV) dilation. We also investigated links between perivascular lymphatics and fibrosis in ischemic versus dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) HF patients.\n\nWe found that early treatment transiently delayed LV dilation, but did not alter cardiac hypertrophy or dysfunction at 8 weeks post-TAC. Late treatment reduced cardiac lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic CCL21 gradients. Surprisingly, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction were not aggravated despite reduced lymphatic density. Further, similar as in mice, increased perivascular lymphatic density in HF patients was associated with less perivascular fibrosis.\n\nIn conclusion, we found limited functional cardiac benefit of IL-1{beta} blockage when initiated before onset of lymphangiogenesis post-TAC in Balb/c mice. In contrast, late treatment reduced cardiac lymphangiogenesis. HF onset was however not significantly accelerated, likely reflecting lymphatic transport dysfunction post-TAC. Taken together, the therapeutic window for anti-IL-1{beta} treatment appears crucial, as initiation of treatment during the lymphangiogenic response, induced by LV dilation, may limit the potential cardiac benefit in HF patients. Further, our data indicate that IL-1{beta}-independent perivascular lymphangiogenesis may limit perivascular fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Electrospray ionization is a powerful and prevalent technique used to ionize analytes in mass spectrometry. The distribution of charges that an analyte receives (charge state distribution, CSD) is an important consideration for interpreting mass spectra. However, due to an incomplete understanding of the ionization mechanism, the analyte properties that influence CSDs are not fully understood. Here, we employ a machine learning-based high-throughput approach and analyze CSDs of hundreds of thousands of peptides. Interestingly, half of the peptides exhibit charges that differ from what one would naively expect (number of basic sites). We find that these peptides can be classified into two regimes--undercharging and overcharging--and that these two regimes display markedly different charging characteristics. Strikingly, peptides in the overcharging regime show minimal dependence on basic site count, and more generally, the two regimes exhibit distinct sequence determinants. These findings highlight the rich ionization behavior of peptides and the potential of CSDs for enhancing peptide identification.",

    "abstract": "The balance of pro-inflammatory T helper type 17 (Th17) and anti-inflammatory T regulatory (Treg) cells is crucial in maintaining immune homeostasis in health and disease conditions. Differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th17/Treg cells is dependent upon T cell receptor (TCR) activation and cytokine signaling, which includes the kinase ITK. Signals from ITK can regulate the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cell fate choice, however, the mechanism remains to be fully understood. We report here that in the absence of ITK activity, instead of developing into Th17 cells under Th17 conditions, naive CD4+ T cells switch to cells expressing the Treg marker Foxp3 (Forkhead box P3). These switched Foxp3+ Treg like cells retain suppressive function and resemble differentiated induced Tregs in their transcriptomic profile, although their chromatin accessibility profiles are intermediate between Th17 and induced Tregs cells. Generation of the switched Foxp3+ Treg like cells was associated with reduced expression of molecules involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, with reduced activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, and reduced expression of BATF. This ITK dependent switch between Th17 and Treg cells was reversed by increasing intracellular calcium. These findings suggest potential strategies for fine tune the TCR signal strength via ITK to regulate the balance of Th17/Treg cells.",

    "abstract": "Dengue represents a growing public health burden worldwide, accounting for approximately 100 million symptomatic cases and tens of thousands of fatalities yearly. Prior infection with one serotype of dengue virus (DENV) is the greatest known risk factor for severe disease upon secondary infection with a heterologous serotype, a risk which increases as serotypes co-circulate in endemic regions. This disease risk is thought to be mediated by IgG-isotype antibodies raised during a primary infection, which poorly neutralize heterologous DENV serotypes and instead opsonize virions for uptake by Fc{gamma}R-bearing cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection leads to a larger proportion of susceptible cells infected, higher viremia and greater immunopathology. We have previously characterized the induction of a serum IgA response, along with the typical IgM and IgG responses, during dengue infection, and have shown that DENV-reactive IgA can neutralize DENV and competitively antagonize IgG-mediated ADE. Here, we evaluate the potential for IgA itself to cause ADE. We show that IgG, but not IgA, mediated ADE of infection in cells expressing both FcR and Fc{gamma}Rs. IgG-mediated ADE stimulated significantly higher pro-inflammatory cytokine production by primary human macrophages, while IgA did not affect, or slightly suppressed, this production. Mechanistically, we show that DENV/IgG immune complexes bind susceptible cells significantly more efficiently than DENV/IgA complexes or virus alone. Finally, we show that over the course of primary dengue infection, the expression of Fc{gamma}RI (CD64) increases during the period of acute viremia, while Fc{gamma}RIIa (CD32) and FcR (CD89) expression decreases, thereby further limiting the ability of IgA to facilitate ADE in the presence of DENV. Overall, these data illustrate the distinct protective role of IgA during ADE of dengue infection and highlight the potential therapeutic and prognostic value of DENV-specific IgA.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a fungal pathobiont colonising mucosal surfaces of the human body, including the oral cavity. Under certain predisposing conditions, C. albicans invades mucosal tissues activating EGFR-MAPK signalling pathways in epithelial cells via the action of its peptide toxin candidalysin. However, our knowledge of the epithelial mechanisms involved during C. albicans colonisation is rudimentary. Here, we describe the role of the transcription factor early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) in human oral epithelial cells (OECs) in response to C. albicans. EGR1 expression increases in OECs when exposed to C. albicans independently of fungal viability, morphology, or candidalysin release, suggesting EGR1 is involved in the fundamental recognition of C. albicans, rather than in response to invasion or  pathogenesis. Upregulation of EGR1 is mediated by EGFR via Raf1, ERK1/2 and NF-{kappa}B signalling but not PI3K/mTOR signalling. Notably, EGR1 mRNA silencing impacts on anti-C. albicans immunity, reducing GM-CSF, IL-1 and IL-1{beta} release, and increasing IL-6 and IL-8 production. These findings identify an important role for EGR1 in priming epithelial cells to respond to subsequent invasive infection by C. albicans and elucidate the regulation circuit of this transcription factor after contact.",

    "abstract": "Hyalomma marginatum is an important tick species which is the main vector of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and spotted fever. The species is predominantly distributed in parts of Southern Europe, North Africa and West Asia. However, due to ongoing climate change and increasing reports of H. marginatum in central and northern Europe, the expansion of this range poses a potential future risk. In this study, we employed an Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) approach to model the current and future climatic suitability of H. marginatum. Using high resolution climatic variables from the Chelsa dataset and an updated list of locations for H. marginatum, we constructed 2 models under current environmental conditions using MaxEnt: a more specific model for only current conditions, and a more general model for both current conditions and future projections under the ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios. Our models show that the climatically suitable region for H. marginatum matches the current distributional area in the Mediterranean basin and West Asia. When applied to future projections, our models suggest a considerable expansion of H. marginatums range in the north in Europe as a result of rising temperatures. However, they also predict a decline in central Anatolia, potentially due to the exacerbation of drought conditions in that region.\n\nSubjectsEcology, Entomology, Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases, Climate Change Biology",

A key characteristic of CLTI is the failure of the innate regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, single-cell transcriptome analysis of ischemic and non-ischemic muscle from the same CLTI patients demonstrated that ischemic-damaged tissue is enriched with pro-inflammatory macrophages. Comparable results were also observed in a murine CLTI model. Importantly, integrated analyses of both human and murine data revealed premature differentiation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) in damaged tissue and indications of defects in intercellular signaling communication between MuSCs and their inflammatory niche. Collectively, our research provides the first single-cell transcriptome atlases of skeletal muscle from CLTI patients and murine models, emphasizing the crucial role of macrophages and inflammation in regulating muscle regeneration in CLTI through interactions with MuSCs.",

    "abstract": "While the human body has many different examples of perfusable structures with complex geometries, biofabrication methods to replicate this complexity are still lacking. Specifically, the fabrication of self-supporting, branched networks with multiple channel diameters is particularly challenging. Here, we present the Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing (GUIDE-3DP) approach for constructing perfusable networks of interconnected channels with precise control over branching geometries and vessel sizes. To achieve user-specified channel dimensions, this technique leverages the predictable diffusion of crosslinking reaction-initiators released from sacrificial inks printed within a hydrogel precursor. We demonstrate the versatility of GUIDE-3DP to be adapted for use with diverse physiochemical crosslinking mechanisms by designing seven printable material systems. Importantly, GUIDE-3DP allows for the independent tunability of both the inner and outer diameters of the printed channels and the ability to fabricate seamless junctions at branch points. This 3D bioprinting platform is uniquely suited for fabricating lumenized structures with complex shapes characteristic of multiple hollow vessels throughout the body. As an exemplary application, we demonstrate the fabrication of vasculature-like networks lined with endothelial cells. GUIDE-3DP represents an important advance toward the fabrication of self-supporting, physiologically relevant networks with intricate and perfusable geometries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLack of Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11) expression has been recently identified as a dominant genomic determinant of response to DNA damaging agents in numerous cancer types. Thus, strategies aimed at increasing SLFN11 could be used to restore chemosensitivity of refractory cancers.\n\nAs oncogenic downregulation is often driven by methylation of the promotor region, we explore the demethylation effect of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine), on the SLFN11 gene methylation. Since SLFN11 has been reported as an interferon inducible gene, and interferon is secreted during an active anti-tumor immune response, we investigated the in vitro effect of IFN-{gamma} on SLFN11 expression in breast cancer cell lines. A second broader approach to show cross talk between immune cells and SLFN11 expression is indirect co-culture of breast cancer cells with activated PBMCs and evaluate if this can drive SLFN11 upregulation. Finally, as a definitive and specific way to modulate SLFN11 expression we implemented SLFN11 dCas9 (dead CRISPR associated protein 9) systems to specifically increase or decrease SLFN11 expression.\n\nResultsWe first confirmed a correlation previously reported between methylation of SLFN11 promoter and its expression across multiple cell lines. We showed in-vitro that decitabine and IFN-{gamma} could increase moderately the expression of SLFN11 in both BT- 549 and T47D cell lines, but not in strongly methylated cell lines such as MDA-MB-231. Though, in-vitro, the co-culture of the same cell lines with CD8-CD25 activated PBMC failed to increase SLFN11 expression. On the one hand, the use of a CRISPR-dCas9 UNISAM system could increase SLFN11 expression significantly (up to 5-fold), stably and specifically in BT-549 and T47D cancer cell lines. Though, this system also failed to force a strong expression of SLFN11 in cell lines with robust SLFN11 promoter methylation such as MDA-MB-231. On the other hand, the use of CRISPR-dCas9 KRAB could significantly reduce the expression of SLFN11 in BT-549 and T47D. We then used the modified cell lines to confirm the alteration in chemo sensitivity of those cells to treatment with DNA Damaging Agents (DDAs) such as Cisplatin and Epirubicin or DNA Damage Response (DDRs) drugs like Olaparib. RNAseq was used to elucidate the mechanisms of action affected by the alteration in SLFN11 expression.\n\nConclusionTo our knowledge this is the first report of the stable non-lethal increase of SLFN11 expression in a cancer cell line. Our results show that induction of SLFN11 expression can enhance DDA and DDR sensitivity in breast cancer cells and dCas9 systems may represent a novel approach to increase SLFN11 and achieve higher sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, improving outcome or decreasing required drug concentrations. SLFN11-targeting therapies might be explored pre-clinically to develop personalized approaches.",

Currently complications of DES have been at least partially attributed to the drugs that are used: paclitaxel and sirolimus and its derivatives like everolimus. We compared the effects of atRA, paclitaxel and everolimus on the proliferation and viability of human leukemia cells (HL60).\n\nMethodsCells were cultured with 0.1M and 10M of atRA, paclitaxel or everolimus. Cell proliferation and viability was evaluated with trypan blue at 24, 48 and 72 hours.\n\nResultsAll drugs caused a statistically significant, dose-dependent reduction of cell proliferation rate from the first 24 hours. atRA and everolimus did not affect cell viability as the treated cells showed high viability (95-98%), while paclitaxel decreased significantly the viability to below 16% at 72 hours. Unlike the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel on HL60, atRA demonstrated a cytostatic effect comparable to everolimus.\n\nConclusionThe ability of atRA to limit cell proliferation without affecting cell viability in a manner similar to everolimus, highlights its potential to be used on DES as a novel drug for treatment of restenosis with potentially minimal side-effects.

    "abstract": "Bacteria of the Salmonella genus are intracellular pathogens, which cause gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in animals and humans, and are responsible for millions of infections and thousands of deaths across the world every year. Furthermore, Salmonella has played the role of a model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions. Taking these two aspects into account, enormous efforts in the literature are devoted to study this intracellular pathogen. Within epithelial cells, there are two distinct subpopulations of Salmonella: (i) a large fraction of Salmonella, which are enclosed by vacuoles, and (ii) a small fraction of hyper-replicating cytosolic Salmonella. Here, by considering the infection of epithelial cells by Salmonella as a discrete-state, continuous-time Markov process, we propose a stochastic model of infection, which includes the invasion of Salmonella into the epithelial cells by a cooperative strategy, the replication inside the Salmonella-containing vacuole, and the bacterial proliferation in the cytosol. The xenophagic degradation of cytosolic bacteria is considered, too. The stochastic approach provides important insights into stochastic variation and heterogeneity of the vacuolar and cytosolic Salmonella populations on a single-cell level over time. Specifically, we predict the percentage of infected human epithelial cells depending on the incubation time and the multiplicity of infection, an d the bacterial load of the infected cells at different post-infection times.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents with progressive motor, mental, and cognitive impairment leading to early disability and mortality. The accumulation of mutant huntingtin protein aggregates in neurons is a pathological hallmark of HD. The glymphatic system, a brain-wide perivascular network, facilitates the exchange of interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), supporting interstitial solute clearance including abnormal proteins from mammalian brains. In this study, we employed dynamic glucose-enhanced (DGE) MRI to measure D-glucose clearance from CSF as a tool to assess CSF clearance capacity to predict glymphatic function in a mouse model of HD. Our results demonstrate significantly diminished CSF clearance efficiency in premanifest zQ175 HD mice. The impairment of CSF clearance of D-glucose, measured by DGE MRI, worsened with disease progression. These DGE MRI findings in compromised glymphatic function in HD mice were further confirmed with fluorescence-based imaging of glymphatic CSF tracer influx, suggesting an impaired glymphatic function in premanifest stage of HD. Moreover, expression of the astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the perivascular compartment, a key mediator of glymphatic function, was significantly diminished in both HD mouse brain as well as postmortem human HD brain. Our data, acquired using a clinically translatable MRI approach, indicate a perturbed glymphatic network in the HD brain as early as in the premanifest stage. Further validation of these findings in clinical studies should provide insights into potential of glymphatic clearance as a HD biomarker and for glymphatic functioning as a disease-modifying therapeutic target for HD.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents with progressive motor, mental, and cognitive impairment leading to early disability and mortality. The accumulation of mutant huntingtin protein aggregates in neurons is a pathological hallmark of HD. The glymphatic system, a brain-wide perivascular network, facilitates the exchange of interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), supporting interstitial solute clearance including abnormal proteins from mammalian brains. In this study, we employed dynamic glucose-enhanced (DGE) MRI to measure D-glucose clearance from CSF as a tool to assess CSF clearance capacity to predict glymphatic function in a mouse model of HD. Our results demonstrate significantly diminished CSF clearance efficiency in premanifest zQ175 HD mice. The impairment of CSF clearance of D-glucose, measured by DGE MRI, worsened with disease progression. These DGE MRI findings in compromised glymphatic function in HD mice were further confirmed with fluorescence-based imaging of glymphatic CSF tracer influx, suggesting an impaired glymphatic function in premanifest stage of HD. Moreover, expression of the astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the perivascular compartment, a key mediator of glymphatic function, was significantly diminished in both HD mouse brain as well as postmortem human HD brain. Our data, acquired using a clinically translatable MRI approach, indicate a perturbed glymphatic network in the HD brain as early as in the premanifest stage. Further validation of these findings in clinical studies should provide insights into potential of glymphatic clearance as a HD biomarker and for glymphatic functioning as a disease-modifying therapeutic target for HD.",

    "abstract": "During delayed ballistic reaches, motor areas consistently display movement-specific activity patterns prior to movement onset. It is unclear why these patterns arise: while they have been proposed to seed an initial neural state from which the movement unfolds, recent experiments have uncovered the presence and necessity of ongoing inputs during movement, which may lessen the need for careful initialization. Here, we modelled the motor cortex as an input-driven dynamical system, and we asked what the optimal way to control this system to perform fast delayed reaches is. We find that delay-period inputs consistently arise in an optimally controlled model of M1. By studying a variety of network architectures, we could dissect and predict the situations in which it is beneficial for a network to prepare. Finally, we show that optimal input-driven control of neural dynamics gives rise to multiple phases of preparation during reach sequences, providing a novel explanation for experimentally observed features of monkey M1 activity in double reaching.",

Here we combine cell type-specific mitochondrial proteomics with in vivo biosensor imaging to dissect how inflammation alters the molecular composition and functional capacity of neuronal mitochondria. We show that neuroinflammatory lesions in the mouse spinal cord cause widespread and persisting axonal ATP deficiency, which precedes mitochondrial oxidation and calcium overload. This axonal energy deficiency is associated with impaired electron transport chain function, but also an upstream imbalance of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, with several, including key rate-limiting, enzymes being depleted in neuronal mitochondria in experimental models and in MS lesions. Notably, viral overexpression of individual TCA enzymes can ameliorate the axonal energy deficits in neuroinflammatory lesions, suggesting that TCA cycle dysfunction in MS may be amendable to therapy.",

Here, we describe an auditory discrimination paradigm for studying response priming in freely-moving mice. We find a priming effect in success rate in all mice tested on the task. In contrast to humans, we do not find a priming effect in response times. Compared to non-primed discrimination trials, the addition of incongruent prime stimuli reduces success rate more than congruent prime stimuli, suggesting a cognitive mechanism based on differential interference. The results establish the short-term priming phenomenon in rodents, and the paradigm opens the door to studying the cellular-network basis of priming.",

    "abstract": "High levels of proinflammatory cytokines induce neurotoxicity and catalyze inflammation-driven neurodegeneration, but the specific release mechanisms from microglia remain elusive. We demonstrate that secretory autophagy (SA), a non-lytic modality of autophagy for secretion of vesicular cargo, regulates neuroinflammation-mediated neurodegeneration via SKA2 and FKBP5 signaling. SKA2 inhibits SA-dependent IL-1{beta} release by counteracting FKBP5 function. Hippocampal Ska2 knockdown in mice hyperactivates SA resulting in neuroinflammation, subsequent neurodegeneration and complete hippocampal atrophy within six weeks. The hyperactivation of SA increases IL-1{beta} release, initiating an inflammatory feed-forward vicious cycle including NLRP3-inflammasome activation and Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated neurotoxicity, which ultimately drives neurodegeneration. Results from protein expression and co-immunoprecipitation analyses of postmortem brains demonstrate that SA is hyperactivated in Alzheimers disease. Overall, our findings suggest that SKA2-regulated, hyperactive SA facilitates neuroinflammation and is linked to Alzheimers disease, providing new mechanistic insight into the biology of neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiological origins of social behaviors are incompletely understood. Here we utilized synthetic biology approaches to reprogram the function of ZFP189, a transcription factor whose expression and function in the rodent prefrontal cortex was previously determined to be protective against stress-induced social deficits. We created novel synthetic ZFP189 transcription factors including ZFP189VPR, which activates the transcription of target genes and therefore exerts opposite functional control from the endogenous, transcriptionally repressive ZFP189WT. Upon viral delivery of these synthetic ZFP189 transcription factors to mouse prefrontal cortex, we observe that ZFP189-mediated transcriptional control promotes mature dendritic spine morphology on transduced pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, dysregulation of ZFP189-mediated transcription in this brain area, achieved by delivery of synthetic ZFP189VPR, precipitates social behavioral deficits in terms of social interaction, motivation, and the cognition necessary for the maintenance of social hierarchy, without other observable behavioral deficits. By performing RNA sequencing in virally manipulated prefrontal cortex tissues, we discover that ZFP189 transcription factors of opposing regulatory function have opposite influence on the expression of genetic transposable elements as well as genes that participate in immune functions. Collectively, this work reveals that ZFP189 function in the prefrontal cortex coordinates structural and transcriptional neuroadaptations necessary for social behaviors by binding transposable element-rich regions of DNA to regulate immune-related genes. Given the evidence for a co-evolution of social behavior and the brain immune response, we posit that ZFP189 may have evolved to augment brain transposon-associated immune function as a way of enhancing an animals capacity for functioning in social groups.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and accurate large-scale networks are a fundamental tool in modelling brain areas, to advance our understanding of neuronal dynamics. However, their implementation faces two key issues: computational efficiency and heterogeneity. Computational efficiency is achieved using simplified neurons, whereas there are no practical solutions available to solve the problem of reproducing in a large-scale network the experimentally observed heterogeneity of the intrinsic properties of neurons. This is important, because the use of identical nodes in a network can generate artifacts which can hinder an adequate representation of the properties of a real network.\n\nTo this aim, we introduce a mathematical procedure to generate an arbitrary large number of copies of simplified hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons models, which exhibit the full range of firing dynamics observed in these cells - including adapting, non-adapting and bursting. For this purpose, we rely on a recently published adaptive generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (A-GLIF) modeling approach, leveraging on its ability to reproduce the rich set of electrophysiological behaviours of these types of neurons under a variety of different stimulation currents.\n\nThe generation procedure is based on a perturbation of models parameters related to the initial data, firing block, and internal dynamics, and suitably validated against experimental data to ensure that the firing dynamics of any given cell copy remains within the experimental range. This allows to obtain heterogeneous copies with mathematically controlled firing properties. A full set of heterogeneous neurons composing the CA1 region of a rat hippocampus (approximately 500K neurons), are provided in a database freely available in the live paper section of the EBRAINS platform.\n\nBy adapting the underlying A-GLIF framework, it will be possible to extend the numerical approach presented here to create, in a mathematically controlled manner, an arbitrarily large number of non-identical copies of cell populations with firing properties related to other brain areas.",

    "abstract": "Sleep in mammals can be broadly classified into two different physiological categories: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS), and accordingly REM and SWS are thought to achieve a different set of functions. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is increasingly being used as a model to understand sleep functions, although it remains unclear if the fly brain also engages in different kinds of sleep as well. Here, we compare two commonly used approaches for studying sleep experimentally in Drosophila: optogenetic activation of sleep-promoting neurons and provision of a sleep-promoting drug, Gaboxadol. We find that these different sleep-induction methods have similar effects on increasing sleep duration, but divergent effects on brain activity. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that drug-induced deep sleep ( quiet sleep) mostly downregulates metabolism genes, whereas optogenetic  active sleep upregulates a wide range of genes relevant to normal waking functions. This suggests that optogenetics and pharmacological induction of sleep in Drosophila promote different features of sleep, which engage different sets of genes to achieve their respective functions.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of human connectomes is crucial for understanding the influence of genetic and environmental factors on variability in connectomes, and their implications for behavior and disease. However, current methods for studying heritability assume an associational rather than a causal effect, or rely on strong distributional assumptions that may not be appropriate for complex, high-dimensional connectomes. To address these limitations, we propose two solutions: first, we formalize heritability as a problem in causal inference, and identify measured covariates to control for unmeasured confounding, allowing us to make causal claims. Second, we leverage statistical models that capture the underlying structure and dependence within connectomes, enabling us to define different notions of connectome heritability by removing common structures such as scaling of edge weights between connectomes. We then develop a non-parametric test to detect whether causal heritability exists after taking principled steps to adjust for these commonalities, and apply it to diffusion connectomes estimated from the Human Connectome Project. Our findings reveal that heritability can still be detected even after adjusting for potential confounding like neuroanatomy, age, and sex. However, once we address for rescaling between connectomes, our causal tests are no longer significant. These results suggest that previous conclusions on connectome heritability may be driven by rescaling factors. Together, our manuscript highlights the importance for future works to continue to develop data-driven heritability models which faithfully reflect potential confounders and network structure.",

Here, using in vivo imaging of neuronal calcium dynamics in mice, we report that nitrous oxide, a general anesthetic that reduces pain affect, paradoxically, increases ACC spontaneous activity. As expected, a noxious stimulus also increased ACC activity. However, as nitrous oxide increases baseline activity, the relative change in activity from pre-stimulus baseline was significantly less than the change in the absence of the general anesthetic. We suggest that this relative change in activity represents a neural signature of the affective pain experience. Furthermore, this signature of pain persists under general anesthesia induced by isoflurane, at concentrations in which the mouse is unresponsive. We suggest that this signature underlies the phenomenon of connected consciousness, in which use of the isolated forelimb technique revealed that pain percepts can persist in anesthetized patients.",

The predictive coding hypothesis proposes that the brain generates predictions and continuously compares them with bottom-up sensory inputs to guide behavior. However, how the brain reconciles conflicting top-down predictions and bottom-up sensory information during behavior remains unclear. To address this question, we simultaneously imaged neuronal populations in the mouse somatosensory cortex and the posterior parietal cortex during an auditory-cued texture discrimination task. After mice learnt the task with fixed tone-texture matching, mismatched pairing caused conflicting tone-based texture predictions and actual texture inputs. When top-down interaction was dominant, texture representations in both areas were modified and mice decided based on the predicted rather than actual texture, whereas dominant bottom-up interaction corrected the representations as well as behavioral choice. Our findings provide evidence for hierarchical predictive coding in the mouse neocortex and open new avenues for understanding higher cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding (PC) is an influential theory in neuroscience, which suggests the existence of a cortical architecture that is constantly generating and updating predictive representations of sensory inputs. Owing to its hierarchical and generative nature, PC has inspired many computational models of perception in the literature. However, the biological plausibility of existing models has not been sufficiently explored due to their use of artificial neural network features such as a non-linear, continuous, and clock-driven function approximator as basic unit of computation. Therefore, we have developed a spiking neural network for predictive coding (SNN-PC), in which neurons communicate using event-driven and asynchronous spikes. While adopting the hierarchical structure and Hebbian learning algorithms from previous PC neural network models, SNN-PC introduces two novel features: 1) a fast feedforward sweep from the input to higher areas, which generates a spatially reduced and abstract representation of input (i.e., a neural code for the gist of a scene) and provides a neurobiological alternative to an arbitrary choice of priors; and 2) a separation of positive and negative error-computing neurons, which counters the biological implausibility of a bi-directional error neuron with a very high basal firing rate. After training with the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, SNN-PC developed hierarchical internal representations and was able to reconstruct samples it had not seen during training. SNN-PC suggests biologically plausible mechanisms by which the brain may perform perceptual inference and learning in an unsupervised manner. In addition, it may be used in neuromorphic applications that can utilize its energy-efficient, event-driven, local learning, and parallel information processing nature.\n\nAuthor summaryHow does the brain seamlessly perceive the world, in the midst of chaotic sensory barrage? Rather than passively relaying information that sensory organs pick up from the external world along the cortical hierarchy for a series of feature extractions, it actively gathers statistical regularities from sensory inputs to track causal relationships between physical properties of external objects and the body. In other words, the brains perceptual apparatus is constantly trying to make sense of the incoming streams of sensory input and represent the subjects current situation by building and maintaining internal models of the world and body. While this constructivist theme in understanding perception has been pervasive across multiple disciplines from philosophy to psychology to computer science, a comprehensive theory of brain function called predictive coding aims at unifying neural implementations of perception. In this study, we present a biologically plausible neural network for predictive coding that uses spiking neurons, Hebbian learning, and a feedforward visual pathway to perform perceptual inference and learning on images. Not only does the model show that predictive coding is well behaved under the biological constraint of spiking neurons, but it also provides deep learning and neuromorphic communities with novel paradigms of learning and computational architectures inspired by the natures most intelligent system, the brain.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dynamics plays a key role in neuronal communication. Due to its high-dimensionality, the main fundamental mechanisms triggering different synaptic dynamics and its relation with the neurotransmitters release regimes (facilitation, biphasic, and depression) are still elusive. For a general set of parameters, and by means of an approximated solution for a set of differential equations associated with a synaptic model, we obtain a discrete map that provides analytical solutions that shed light into the dynamics of synapses. Assuming that the presynaptic neuron perturbing the neuron whose synapse is being modelled is spiking periodically, we derive the stable equilibria and the maximal values for the release regimes as a function of the percentage of neurotransmitter released and the mean frequency of the presynaptic spiking neuron. Assuming that the presynaptic neuron is spiking stochastically following a Poisson distribution, we demonstrate that the equations for the time average of the trajectory are the same as the map under the periodic presynaptic stimulus, admitting the same equilibrium points. Thus, the synapses under stochastic presynaptic spikes, emulating the spiking behaviour produced by a complex neural network, wander around the equilibrium points of the synapses under periodic stimulus, which can be fully analytically calculated.\n\nAuthor summaryBased on the model proposed by Tsodyks et al., we obtained a map approximation to study analytically the dynamics of short-term synaptic plasticity. We identified the synaptic regimes named facilitation, depression, and biphasic in the parameters space, and determined the maximal and equilibrium points of active neurotransmitters for presynaptic neurons spiking periodically and stochastically following a Poisson process. Besides that, we verify that the time average of the variables for the synaptic dynamics driven by presynaptic neurons spiking following a Poisson distribution presents the equilibrium points obtained for the synaptic driven by periodic presynaptic neurons, spiking with a frequency that is the mean frequency of the Poisson distribution. These results shed analytical light into the understanding of synaptic dynamics.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that neural mass models (NMMs) can effectively simulate the mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics of electroencephalography (EEG), including epileptic EEG. However NMMs are characterized by a high-dimensional parameter space and a lack of knowledge on what NMM parameters can be reliably estimated, thus limiting their application to clinical EEG data. In this article, we analyze the parameter sensitivity of Jansen and Rit NMM (JR NMM) in order to identify the most sensitive NMM parameters for reliable parameter estimation from EEG data. We also propose a joint estimation method for NMM states and parameters based on expectation-maximization combined with unscented Kalman smoother (UKS-EM). Global sensitivity analysis methods including Morris method and Sobol method are used to perform sensitivity analysis. Results from both the Morris and Sobol method show that the average inhibitory synaptic gain, B and the time constant of the average inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (PSPs), b-1 have significant impact on the JR NMM output along with having the least interaction with other model parameters. The UKS-EM method for estimating the parameters B and b is validated using simulations under varying levels of measurement noise. Finally we apply the UKS-EM algorithm to intracranial EEG data from 16 epileptic patients. Our results, both at individual and group-level show that the parameters B and b change significantly between the pre-seizure and seizure period, and between the seizure and post-seizure period, with transition to seizure characterized by decrease in average B and high frequency activity in seizure characterized by an increase in b. These results establish sensitivity analysis guided Bayesian parameter estimation as a powerful tool for reducing the parameter space of high dimensional NMMs enabling reliable and efficient estimation of the most sensitive NMM parameters, with the potential for online and fast tracking of NMM parameters in applications such as seizure tracking and control.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the motor deficits, selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and the brain accumulation of -synuclein (-syn)-composed protein aggregates called Lewy bodies (LBs). Whereas dysfunction in the protein degradation pathway, like autophagy in neurons, has been demonstrated as a critical mechanism for eliminating protein aggregates in PD, how protein aggregates are eliminated in the other brain cell type, glia, is less well characterized. In the present study, we show that Atg9, the only transmembrane protein in the core autophagy pathway, is highly expressed in Drosophila adult brain glia. Results from immunostaining and live-cell imaging analysis reveal that a significant portion of Atg9 localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), autophagosomes, and lysosomes in glia; Atg9 is persistently in contact with these organelles. Lacking glial atg9 reduces the number of omegasome and autophagosome and impairs autophagic substrate degradation, suggesting that glial Atg9 participates in the early steps of autophagy, hence the control of autophagic degradation. Importantly, loss of glial atg9 induces parkinsonian symptoms in Drosophila including progressive DA neuron loss and locomotion deficits. Our findings identify a functional role of Atg9 in glial autophagy and establish a potential link between glial autophagy and PD. These results provide new insights on the underlying mechanism of PD.",

    "abstract": "What determines when neural representations of memories move together (integrate) or apart (differentiate)? Classic supervised learning models posit that, when two stimuli predict similar outcomes, their representations should integrate. However, these models have recently been challenged by studies showing that pairing two stimuli with a shared associate can sometimes cause differentiation, depending on the parameters of the study and the brain region being examined. Here, we provide a purely unsupervised neural network model that can explain these and other related findings. The model can exhibit integration or differentiation depending on the amount of activity allowed to spread to competitors -- inactive memories are not modified, connections to moderately active competitors are weakened (leading to differentiation), and connections to highly active competitors are strengthened (leading to integration). The model also makes several novel predictions -- most importantly, that differentiation will be rapid and asymmetric. Overall, these modeling results provide a computational explanation for a diverse set of seemingly contradictory empirical findings in the memory literature, as well as new insights into the dynamics at play during learning.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes strongly promote the formation and maturation of synapses by secreted proteins. To date, several astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic proteins controlling different stages of excitatory synapse development have been identified. However, the identities of astrocytic signals that induce inhibitory synapse formation remain elusive. Here, through a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we identified Neurocan as an astrocyte-secreted inhibitory synaptogenic protein. Neurocan is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is best known as a protein localized to the perineuronal nets. However, Neurocan is cleaved into two after secretion from astrocytes. We found that the resulting N- and C-terminal fragments have distinct localizations in the extracellular matrix. While the N-terminal fragment remains associated with perineuronal nets, the Neurocan C-terminal fragment localizes to synapses and specifically controls cortical inhibitory synapse formation and function. Neurocan knockout mice lacking the whole protein or only its C-terminal synaptogenic region have reduced inhibitory synapse numbers and function. Through super-resolution microscopy and in vivo proximity labeling by secreted TurboID, we discovered that the synaptogenic domain of Neurocan localizes to somatostatin-positive inhibitory synapses and strongly regulates their formation. Together, our results unveil a mechanism through which astrocytes control circuit-specific inhibitory synapse development in the mammalian brain.",

    "abstract": "Dominant motor control theories propose that the brain predicts and attenuates the somatosensory consequences of actions, referred to as somatosensory attenuation. Support comes from psychophysical and neuroimaging studies showing that touch applied on a passive hand elicits attenuated perceptual and neural responses if it is actively generated by ones other hand, compared to identical touch from an external origin. However, recent experimental findings have challenged this view by providing psychophysical evidence that the perceived intensity of touch on the passive hand is enhanced if the active hand does not receive touch simultaneously with the passive hand (somatosensory enhancement) and by further attributing attenuation to the double tactile stimulation of the hands upon contact. Here, we directly contrasted the hypotheses of the attenuation and enhancement models regarding how action influences somatosensory perception by manipulating whether the active hand contacts the passive hand. We further assessed somatosensory perception in the absence of any predictive cues in a condition that turned out to be essential for interpreting the experimental findings. In three preregistered experiments, we demonstrate that action does not enhance the predicted touch (Experiment 1), that the previously reported \"enhancement\" effects are driven by the reference condition used (Experiment 2), and that self-generated touch is robustly attenuated regardless of whether the two hands make contact (Experiment 3). Our results provide conclusive evidence that action does not enhance but attenuates predicted touch and prompt a reappraisal of recent experimental findings upon which theoretical frameworks proposing a perceptual enhancement by action prediction are based.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDominant motor control theories propose that action attenuates or cancels predicted touch.\nC_LIO_LIRecent theories propose that action enhances predicted touch.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that action does not enhance but attenuates predicted touch.\nC_LI",

Recent evidence suggests pH homeostasis is a new cellular mechanism important for BBB integrity. In the current study, we investigated the function of an astrocyte-specific pH regulator, Slc4a4, in BBB maintenance and repair. We show that astrocytic Slc4a4 is required for normal astrocyte morphological complexity and BBB function. Multi-omics analyses identified increased astrocytic secretion of CCL2 coupled with dysregulated arginine-NO metabolism after Slc4a4 deletion. Using a model of ischemic stroke, we found that loss of Slc4a4 exacerbates BBB disruption and reactive gliosis, which were both rescued by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the NO-CCL2 pathway in vivo. Together, our study identifies the astrocytic Slc4a4-NO-CCL2 axis as a pivotal mechanism controlling BBB integrity and repair, while providing insights for a novel therapeutic approach against BBB-related CNS disorders.",

Image quality, however, often degrades in deeper portions of the cerebral cortex. Strategies to improve deep imaging are therefore needed. We introduce such a strategy using gates of high repetition rate ultrafast pulse trains to increase signal level.\n\nAimWe investigate how signal generation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal-to-background ratio (SBR) improve with pulse gating while imaging in vivo mouse cerebral vasculature.\n\nApproachAn electro-optic modulator is used with a high-power (6 W) 80 MHz repetition rate ytterbium fiber amplifier to create gates of pulses at a 1 MHz repetition rate. We first measure signal generation from a Texas Red solution in a cuvette to characterize the system with no gating and at a 50%, 25%, and 12.5% duty cycle. We then compare signal generation, SNR, and SBR when imaging Texas Red-labeled vasculature using these conditions.\n\nResultsWe find up to a 6.73-fold increase in fluorescent signal from a cuvette when using a 12.5% duty cycle pulse gating excitation pattern as opposed to a constant 80 MHz pulse train. We verify similar increases for in vivo imaging to that observed in cuvette testing. For deep imaging we find pulse gating to result in a 2.95-fold increase in SNR and a 1.37-fold increase in SBR on average when imaging mouse cortical vasculature at depths ranging from 950 m to 1050 m.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that a pulse gating strategy can either be used to limit heating when imaging superficial brain regions or used to increase signal generation in deep regions. These findings should encourage others to adopt similar pulse gating excitation schemes for imaging neural structure through two-photon microscopy.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionChondroitin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been associated with Alzheimers Disease (AD), and the impact of modified chondroitin sulfates is being investigated in several animal and cell-based models of AD. Published reports have shown the role of accumulation of chondroitin 4-sulfate and decline in Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; B-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) in other pathology, including nerve injury, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. However, the impact of ARSB deficiency on AD pathobiology has not been reported, although changes in ARSB were associated with AD in two prior reports. The enzyme ARSB removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate and is required for their degradation. When ARSB activity declines, these sulfated glycosaminoglycans accumulate, as in the inherited disorder Mucopolysaccharidosis VI.\n\nMethodsReports about chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and chondroitin sulfatases in Alzheimers Disease were reviewed. Measurements of SAA2, iNOS, lipid peroxidation, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, and other parameters were performed in cortex and hippocampus from ARSB-null mice and controls by QRT-PCR, ELISA, and other standard assays.\n\nResultsSAA2 mRNA expression and protein, CSPG4 mRNA, chondroitin 4-sulfate and i-NOS were increased significantly in ARSB-null mice. Measures of lipid peroxidation and redox state were significantly modified.\n\nDiscussionFindings indicate that decline in ARSB leads to changes in expression of parameters associated with AD in the hippocampus and cortex of the ARSB-deficient mouse.\n\nConclusionsFurther investigation of the impact of decline in ARSB on the development of AD may provide a new approach to prevent and treat AD.",

    "abstract": "SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-expressing lung epithelial cells through its spike (S) protein. The S protein is highly glycosylated and could be a target for lectins. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a collagen-containing C-type lectin, expressed by mucosal epithelial cells and mediates its antiviral activities by binding to viral glycoproteins. This study examined the mechanistic role of human SP-A in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. The interactions between human SP-A and SARS-CoV-2 S protein and hACE2 receptor, and SP-A level in COVID-19 patients were assessed by ELISA. The effect of SP-A on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was analyzed by infecting human lung epithelial cells (A549-ACE2) with pseudoviral particles and infectious SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant) pre-incubated with SP-A. Virus binding, entry, and infectivity were assessed by RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and plaque assay. The results showed that human SP-A can bind SARS-CoV-2 S protein/RBD and hACE2 in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.01). Human SP-A inhibited virus binding and entry, and reduce viral load in lung epithelial cells, evidenced by the dose-dependent decrease in viral RNA, nucleocapsid protein, and titer (p<0.01). Increased SP-A level was observed in the saliva of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.05), but severe COVID-19 patients had relatively lower SP-A levels than moderate COVID-19 patients (p<0.05). Therefore, SP-A plays an important role in mucosal innate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by directly binding to the S protein and inhibiting its infectivity in host cells. SP-A level in the saliva of COVID-19 patients might serve as a biomarker for COVID-19 severity.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVESpinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the PPP2R2B gene. Here we tested the hypothesis that the PPP2R2B antisense (PPP2R2B-AS1) transcript containing a CUG repeat is expressed and contributes to SCA12 pathogenesis.\n\nMETHODSExpression of PPP2R2B-AS1 transcript was detected in SCA12 human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), iPSC-derived NGN2 neurons, and SCA12 knock-in mouse brains using strand-specific RT-PCR (SS-RT-PCR). The tendency of expanded PPP2R2B-AS1 (expPPP2R2B-AS1) RNA to form foci, a marker of toxic processes involving mutant RNAs, was examined in SCA12 cell models by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The toxic effect of expPPP2R2B-AS1 transcripts on SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells was evaluated by caspase 3/7 activity. Western blot was used to examine the expression of repeat associated non-ATG-initiated (RAN) translation of expPPP2R2B-AS1 transcript in SK-N-MC cells.\n\nRESULTSThe repeat region in PPP2R2B gene locus is bidirectionally transcribed in SCA12 iPSCs, iPSC-derived NGN2 neurons, and SCA12 mouse brains. Transfected expPPP2R2B-AS1 transcripts are toxic to SK-N-MC cells, and the toxicity may be mediated, at least in part, by the RNA secondary structure. The expPPP2R2B-AS1 transcripts form CUG RNA foci in SK-N-MC cells. expPPP2R2B-AS1 transcript is translated in the Alanine ORF via repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation, which is diminished by single nucleotide interruptions within the CUG repeat, and MBNL1 overexpression.\n\nINTERPRETATIONThese findings suggest that PPP2R2B-AS1 contributes to SCA12 pathogenesis, and may therefore provide a novel therapeutic target for the disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnchialine environments, in which oceanic water mixes with freshwater in coastal aquifers, are characterised by stratified water columns with complex physicochemical profiles. These environments, also known as subterranean estuaries, support an abundance of endemic macro and microorganisms. There is now growing interest in characterising the metabolisms of anchialine microbial communities, which is essential for understanding how complex ecosystems are supported in extreme environments, and assessing their vulnerability to environmental change. However, the diversity of metabolic strategies that are utilised in anchialine ecosystems remains poorly understood.\n\nResultsHere, we employ shotgun metagenomics to elucidate the key microorganisms and their dominant metabolisms along a physicochemical profile in Bundera Sinkhole, the only known continental subterranean estuary in the Southern Hemisphere. Genome-resolved metagenomics suggests that the communities are largely represented by novel taxonomic lineages, with 75% of metagenome-assembled genomes assigned to entirely new or uncharacterised families. These diverse and novel taxa displayed depth-dependent metabolisms, reflecting distinct phases along dissolved oxygen and salinity gradients. In particular, the communities appear to drive nutrient feedback loops involving nitrification, nitrate ammonification, and sulphate cycling. Genomic analysis of the most highly abundant members in this system suggests that an important source of chemotrophic energy is generated via the metabolic coupling of nitrogen and sulphur cycling.\n\nConclusionThese findings substantially contribute to our understanding of the novel and specialised microbial communities in anchialine ecosystems, and highlight key chemosynthetic pathways that appear to be important in these energy-limited environments. Such knowledge is essential for the conservation of anchialine ecosystems, and sheds light on adaptive processes in extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Conjugative plasmids play a key role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes across bacterial pathogens. AMR plasmids are widespread in clinical settings, but their distribution is not random, and certain associations between plasmids and bacterial clones are particularly successful. For example, the globally spread carbapenem resistance plasmid pOXA-48 can use a wide range of enterobacterial species as hosts, but it is usually associated with a small number of specific Klebsiella pneumoniae clones. These successful associations represent an important threat for hospitalized patients. However, knowledge remains limited about the factors determining AMR plasmid distribution in clinically relevant bacteria. Here, we combined in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches to analyze pOXA-48-associated AMR levels and conjugation dynamics in a collection of wild type enterobacterial strains isolated from hospitalized patients. Our results reveal significant variability in these traits across different bacterial hosts, with Klebsiella spp. strains showing higher pOXA-48-mediated AMR and conjugation frequencies than Escherichia coli strains. Using experimentally determined parameters, we developed a simple mathematical model to interrogate the contribution of AMR levels and conjugation permissiveness to plasmid distribution in bacterial communities. The simulations revealed that a small subset of clones, combining high AMR levels and conjugation permissiveness, play a critical role in stabilizing the plasmid in different polyclonal microbial communities. These results help to explain the preferential association of plasmid pOXA-48 with K. pneumoniae clones in clinical settings. More generally, our study reveals that species- and strain-specific variability in plasmid-associated phenotypes shape AMR evolution in clinically relevant bacterial communities.\n\nSignificance statementConjugative plasmids disseminate AMR genes across bacterial pathogens. Understanding the rules governing plasmid dynamics in bacterial communities is therefore crucial to controlling the global AMR crisis. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of an AMR plasmid of great clinical relevance, pOXA-48, in a collection of wild type bacteria recovered from hospitalized patients. We reported a high degree of variability in two key plasmid-associated phenotypes, AMR level and conjugation ability, across the collection of clinical bacteria. Using simulations based on the experimental results, we studied how successful associations between AMR plasmids and clinical strains can arise in bacterial communities. Our results revealed that accounting for variability in plasmid-associated phenotypes help to understand the evolution of AMR in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Use of experimental cats and dogs in veterinary heartworm preclinical drug research is increasing. As a potential alternative primary in vivo heartworm preventative drug screen, we assessed lymphopenic mice with ablation of the interleukin-2/7 common gamma chain ({gamma}c) as susceptible to the larval development phase of D. immitis. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) Severe Combined ImmunoDeficient (SCID){gamma}c-/-(NSG / NXG) mice consistently yielded viable D. immitis larvae at 2-4 weeks post-infection across multiple experiments, different batches of infectious larvae inoculates, different isolates of D. immitis and at independent laboratories. Mice did not display any overt clinical signs associated with infection up to 4 weeks. Developing larvae were found in subcutaneous and muscle fascia tissues, the natural site of this stage of heartworm in dogs. Larvae retrieved from NSG / NXG mice were mid-L4 stage of development. Compared with 14-day in vitro propagated larvae, in vivo derived L4 were significantly larger and contained expanded Wolbachia endobacteria titres, determined by QPCR and Fluorescent in situ Hybridisation (FISH). We established an ex vivo 6-day L4 paralytic screening system against nematodicidal agents (moxidectin, levamisole) which highlighted discrepancies in relative drug sensitivities in comparison with in vitro reared L4 D. immitis. We demonstrated effective depletion of Wolbachia by 70-90% in D. immitis L4 following 2-7 day oral in vivo exposures of NSG / NXG infected mice with doxycycline or the rapid-acting investigational anti-Wolbachia drug, AWZ1066S. We validated the NSG / NXG mouse model as a filaricide drug screen by in vivo treatments with single injections of moxidectin, which mediated 60-88% reduction in L4 larvae at 14-28 days. Future adoption of the mouse model as a first-line efficacy screen will benefit end-user laboratories conducting research and development of novel heartworm preventatives via increased access, rapid turnaround and reduced costs whilst simultaneously decreasing need for experimental cat or dog use.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) are produced in all three domains of life, and their biogenesis have common ancient origins in eukaryotes and archaea. Although bacterial vesicles were discovered several decades ago and multiple roles have been attributed to them, no mechanism has been established for vesicles biogenesis in bacteria. For this reason, there is a significant level of skepticism about the biological relevance of bacterial vesicles. In Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt), a prominent member of the human intestinal microbiota, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have been proposed to play key physiological roles. By employing outer membrane- and OMV-specific markers fused to fluorescent proteins we visualized OMV biogenesis in live-cells. We performed comparative proteomic analyses to demonstrate that Bt actively tailors its vesicle cargo to optimize the breakdown of diet- and host-derived complex glycans. Surprisingly, our data suggests that OMV are not employed for mucin degradation. We also show that, in Bt, a negatively-charged N-terminal motif acts as a signal for protein sorting into OMVs irrespective of the nutrient availability. We conclude that OMVs are the result of an exquisitely orchestrated mechanism. This work lays the foundation for further investigations into the physiological relevance of OMVs and their roles in gut homeostasis. Furthermore, our work constitutes a roadmap to guide EV biogenesis research in other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Efflux pumps are well known to be an important mechanism for removing noxious substances such as antibiotics from bacteria. Given that many antibiotics function by accumulating inside bacteria, efflux pumps contribute to resistance. Efflux pump inactivation is a potential strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance, as bacteria would not be able to pump out antibiotics. We recently discovered that the impact of loss of efflux function is only apparent in actively growing cells. We demonstrated that the global transcriptome of Salmonella Typhimurium is drastically altered during slower growth leading to stationary phase cells having a re-modelled, less permeable, envelope that prevents antibiotics entering the cell. Here, we investigated the effects of deleting the major efflux pump of Salmonella Typhimurium, AcrB, on global gene transcription across growth. We revealed that an acrB knockout entered stationary phase later than the wild type strain SL1344, and displayed increased and prolonged expression of genes responsible for anaerobic energy metabolism. We devised a model linking efflux and membrane potential, whereby deactivation of AcrB prevents influx of protons across the inner membrane and thereby hyperpolarisation. Knockout or deactivation of AcrB was demonstrated to increase membrane potential. We propose that the global transcription regulator ArcBA senses changes to the redox state of the quinol pool (linked to the membrane potential of the bacterium) and coordinates the shift from exponential to stationary phase via the key master regulators RpoS, Rsd, and Rmf. Inactivation of efflux pumps therefore influences the fundamental physiology of Salmonella, with likely impacts on multiple phenotypes.\n\nImportanceWe demonstrate for the first time that deactivation of efflux pumps brings about changes to gross bacterial physiology and metabolism. Rather than simply being a response to noxious substances, efflux pumps appear to play a key role in maintenance of membrane potential and thereby energy metabolism. This discovery suggests that efflux pump inhibition or inactivation might have unforeseen positive consequences on antibiotic activity. Given that stationary phase bacteria are more resistant to antibiotic uptake, late entry into stationary phase would prolong antibiotic accumulation by bacteria. Furthermore, membrane hyperpolarisation could result in increased generation of reactive species proposed to be important for the activity of some antibiotics. Finally, changes in gross physiology could also explain the decreased virulence of efflux mutants.",

    "abstract": "Oxymel, a combination of honey and vinegar, has been used as a remedy for wounds and infections from antiquity to the present day. While honey is now clinically used to treat infected wounds, this use of a complex, raw natural product (NP) mixture is unusual in modern western medicine. Research into the antimicrobial activity of NPs more usually focusses on finding a single active compound. The acetic acid in vinegar is known to have antibacterial activity at low concentrations and is in clinical use to treat burn wound infections. Here, we investigated the potential for synergistic activity of different compounds present in a complex ingredient used in historical medicine (vinegar) and in an ingredient mixture (oxymel). We conducted a systematic review to investigate published evidence for antimicrobial effects of vinegars against human pathogenic bacteria and fungi. No published studies explicitly compared the activity of vinegar with that of a comparable concentration of acetic acid. We then characterised selected vinegars by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and assessed the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of the vinegars and acetic acid, alone and in combination with medical-grade honeys, against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. We found that some vinegars have antibacterial activity that exceeds that predicted by their acetic acid content alone, but that this depends on the bacterial species being investigated and the growth conditions (media type, planktonic vs. biofilm). Pomegranate vinegars may be particularly interesting candidates for further study. We also conclude that there is potential for acetic acid, and some vinegars, to show synergistic antibiofilm activity with manuka honey.\n\nData SummaryRaw quantitative data and R code for analyses are provided in the supplementary data (Document S1).",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of invasive fungal pathogens are dramatically changing the clinical landscape of infectious diseases and are an imminent burden to public health that lack the resources (i.e., robust antifungals) to tackle this threat. Specifically, the human opportunistic pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, expresses elaborate virulence mechanisms and is equipped with sophisticated adaptation strategies to survive in harsh host environments. In this study, we extensively characterize Wos2, an Hsp90 co-chaperone homologue, featuring bilateral functioning for both cryptococcal adaptation and virulence strategies. Here, we evaluated the proteome and secretome signatures of Wos2 in enriched and infection-mimicking conditions to reveal a Wos2-dependent regulation of oxidative stress response. The wos2{Delta} strain reports defective intracellular and extracellular antioxidant protection systems measurable through a decreased abundance of critical antioxidant enzymes and reduced growth in the presence of peroxide stress. Additional Wos2-associated stress phenotypes were observed upon fungal challenge with heat shock, osmotic, and cell wall stressors. We demonstrate the importance of Wos2 for C. neoformans intracellular lifestyle during in vitro macrophage infection and provide evidence for wos2{Delta} reduced phagosomal replication levels. Accordingly, wos2{Delta} featured significantly reduced virulence in a murine model of cryptococcosis. Our study highlights a vulnerable point in the fungal chaperone network that offers a powerful druggable opportunity to interfere with both virulence and fitness.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe global impact of fungal pathogens, both emerging and emerged, is undeniable and the alarming increase in antifungal resistance rates hampers our ability to protect the global population from deadly infections. For cryptococcal infections, a limited arsenal of antifungals and resistance demands alternative therapeutic strategies, including an anti-virulence approach, which disarms the pathogen of critical virulence factors, empowering the host to remove the pathogen and clear the infection. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based proteomics to interrogate the impact of a recently defined novel co-chaperone, Wos2, towards cryptococcal virulence using in vitro and in vivo models of infection. We defined global proteome and secretome remodeling driven by the protein and uncovered a novel role in modulating the fungal oxidative stress response. Complementation of the proteome findings with in vitro infectivity assays demonstrated a protective role for Wos2 within the macrophage phagosome, influencing fungal replication and survival. These results underscore differential cryptococcal survivability and weakened patterns of dissemination in the absence of wos2. Overall, our study establishes Wos2 as an important contributor to fungal pathogenesis and warrants further research into critical proteins within global stress response networks as potential druggable targets to reduce fungal virulence and clear the infection.",

    "abstract": "The concern of colistin-resistant bacteria in animal-food-environmental-human ecosystems prompted the poultry sector to implement colistin restrictions and explore alternative trace metals/copper feed supplementation. The impact of these strategies on the selection and persistence of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) in the whole poultry-production chain needs clarification. We assessed colistin-resistant and copper-tolerant Kp occurrence in chicken raised with inorganic and organic copper-formulas from one-day-old chicks to meat (7 farms/2019-2020), after long-term colistin withdrawal (>2-years). Clonal diversity and Kp adaptive features were characterized by cultural, molecular, and whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) approaches. Most chicken-flocks (75%) carried Kp at early+pre-slaughter stages, with a significant decrease (p<0.05) in meat batches (17%) and sporadic water/feed contamination. High rates (>50%) of colistin-resistant/mcr-negative Kp were observed among faecal samples, independently of feed. Most samples carried multidrug-resistant (90%) and copper-tolerant isolates (81%; pco+sil/MICCuSO4 [&ge;]16mM). WGS revealed accumulation of colistin resistance associated mutations and F-type multireplicon plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance and metal/copper-tolerance genes. The Kp population was polyclonal, with various lineages dispersed throughout poultry production. ST15-KL19, ST15-KL146 and ST392-KL27, and IncF plasmids were similar to those from global human clinical isolates, suggesting chicken-production as a reservoir/source of clinically-relevant Kp lineages and genes with potential risk to humans through food and/or environmental exposure. Despite long-term colistin ban limited mcr spread, it was ineffective in controlling colistin-resistant/mcr-negative Kp, regardless of feed. This study provides crucial insights into the persistence of clinically-relevant Kp in the poultry-production chain and highlights the need for continued surveillance and proactive food safety actions within a One-Health perspective.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe spread of bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotics such as colistin throughout the food chain is a serious concern for public health. The poultry sector has responded by restricting colistin use and exploring alternative trace metals/copper feed supplements. However, it is unclear how and to which extent these changes impact the selection and persistence of clinically-relevant Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) throughout poultry chain. We found a high occurrence of copper-tolerant and colistin-resistant/mcr-negative Kp in chicken flocks, regardless of inorganic and organic copper-formulas and long-term colistin ban. Despite the high Kp diversity, the occurrence of identical lineages and plasmids across samples and/or clinical isolates suggests poultry as a potential source of human Kp exposure. This study highlights the need for continued surveillance and proactive farm-to-fork actions to mitigate the risks to public health, relevant for stakeholders involved in food industry and policymakers tasked with regulating food safety.",

To fill this gap, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on wildtype mice and mouse model of CRC. We find that Fn and ETBF exacerbate cancer-like transcriptional phenotypes in transit-amplifying and mature enterocytes in a mouse model of CRC. We also observed increased T cells in the pathobiont-exposed mice, but these pathobiont-specific differences observed in wildtype mice were abrogated in the mouse model of CRC. Although there are similarities in the responses provoked by each organism, we find pathobiont-specific effects in Myc-signaling and fatty acid metabolism.

    "abstract": "Increasingly many studies reveal how ribosome composition can be tuned to optimally translate the transcriptome of individual cell types. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern, structure within the ribosome and effect on protein synthesis of the ribosomal protein paralog 39L (RPL39L). With a novel mass spectrometric approach we have quantified the expression of RPL39L in human pluripotent cells, cancer cell lines and tissue samples, and in mouse germ cells. We generated RPL39L knock-out mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines and demonstrated that RPL39L impacts the dynamics of translation, to support the pluripotency and differentiation, spontaneous and along the germ cell lineage. Most differences in protein abundance between WT and RPL39L KO lines were explained by widespread proteasomal activity. By CryoEM analysis of purified RPL39 and RPL39L-containing ribosomes we found that, unlike RPL39, RPL39L has two distinct conformations in the exposed segment of the nascent peptide exit tunnel, creating a distinct hydrophobic patch that has been predicted to support the efficient co-translational folding of alpha helices. Our study shows that ribosomal protein paralogs provide switchable modular components that can tune translation to the protein production needs of individual cell types.",

    "abstract": "The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a conserved enzyme that tri-methylates Lysine 27 on Histone 3 (H3K27me3) to promote gene silencing. PRC2 is remarkably responsive to the expression of certain long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In the most notable example, PRC2 is recruited to the X-chromosome shortly after expression of the lncRNA Xist begins during X-chromosome inactivation. However, the mechanisms by which lncRNAs recruit PRC2 to chromatin are not yet clear. We report that a broadly used rabbit monoclonal antibody raised against human EZH2, a catalytic subunit of PRC2, cross-reacts with an RNA-binding protein called Scaffold Attachment Factor B (SAFB) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) under buffer conditions that are commonly used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Knockout of EZH2 in ESCs demonstrated that the antibody is specific for EZH2 by western blot (no cross-reactivity). Likewise, comparison to previously published datasets confirmed that the antibody recovers PRC2-bound sites by ChIP-Seq. However, RNA-IP from formaldehyde-crosslinked ESCs using ChIP wash conditions recovers distinct peaks of RNA association that co-localize with peaks of SAFB and whose enrichment disappears upon knockout of SAFB but not EZH2. IP and mass spectrometry-based proteomics in wild-type and EZH2 knockout ESCs confirm that the EZH2 antibody recovers SAFB in an EZH2-independent manner. Our data highlight the importance of orthogonal assays when studying interactions between chromatin-modifying enzymes and RNA.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a large global disease burden for which treatment regimens are protracted and monitoring of disease activity difficult. Existing detection methods rely almost exclusively on bacterial culture from sputum which limits sampling to organisms on the pulmonary surface. Advances in monitoring tuberculous lesions have utilized the common glucoside [18F]FDG, yet lack specificity to the causative pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and so do not directly correlate with pathogen viability. Here we show that a close mimic that is also positron-emitting of the non-mammalian Mtb disaccharide trehalose - 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxytrehalose ([18F]FDT) - can act as a mechanism-based enzyme reporter in vivo. Use of [18F]FDT in the imaging of Mtb in diverse models of disease, including non-human primates, successfully co-opts Mtb-specific processing of trehalose to allow the specific imaging of TB-associated lesions and to monitor the effects of treatment. A pyrogen-free, direct enzyme-catalyzed process for its radiochemical synthesis allows the ready production of [18F]FDT from the most globally-abundant organic 18F-containing molecule, [18F]FDG. The full, pre-clinical validation of both production method and [18F]FDT now creates a new, bacterium-specific, clinical diagnostic candidate. We anticipate that this distributable technology to generate clinical-grade [18F]FDT directly from the widely-available clinical reagent [18F]FDG, without need for either bespoke radioisotope generation or specialist chemical methods and/or facilities, could now usher in global, democratized access to a TB-specific PET tracer.",

Therefore, better biomarkers are needed, and with this in mind we carried out quantitative phospho-proteomic screening for ATR biomarkers that are highly sensitive to berzosertib and gartisertib. Screening identified novel ATR-dependent targets in three broad classes: i) targets whose phosphorylation is highly sensitive to ATRi; ii) novel targets with known genome maintenance roles; iii) novel targets whose cellular roles are unclear, including SCAF1. We show that SCAF1 interacts with RNAPII in a phospho-dependent manner and suppresses homologous recombination in cells lacking the BRCA1 tumour suppressor.

    "abstract": "N-terminal acetylation is a chemical modification carried out by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). A major member of this enzyme family, NatB, acts on much of the human proteome, including -synuclein (S), a synaptic protein that mediates vesicle trafficking. NatB acetylation of S modulates its lipid vesicle binding properties and amyloid fibril formation, which underlies its role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease. Although the molecular details of the interaction between human NatB (hNatB) and the N-terminus of S have been resolved, whether the remainder of the protein plays a role in interacting with the enzyme is unknown. Here we execute the first synthesis, by native chemical ligation, of a bisubstrate inhibitor of NatB consisting of coenzyme A and full-length human S, additionally incorporating two fluorescent probes for studies of conformational dynamics. We use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize the structural features of the hNatB/inhibitor complex and show that, beyond the first few residues, S remains disordered when in complex with hNatB. We further probe changes in the S conformation by single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to reveal that the C-terminus expands when bound to hNatB. Computational models based on the cryo-EM and smFRET data help to explain the conformational changes and their implications for hNatB substrate recognition and specific inhibition of the interaction with S. Beyond the study of S and NatB, these experiments illustrate valuable strategies for the study of challenging structural biology targets through a combination of protein semi-synthesis, cryo-EM, smFRET, and computational modeling.",

    "abstract": "Misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins are degraded through a process called endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Soluble, lumenal ERAD targets are recognized, retrotranslocated across the ER membrane, ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome using an ERAD pathway containing a ubiquitin ligase called Hrd1. To determine how Hrd1 mediates these processes, we developed a deep mutational scanning approach to identify residues involved in Hrd1 function, including those exclusively required for lumenal degradation. We identified several regions required for different Hrd1 functions. Most surprisingly, we found two cytosolic regions of Hrd1 required for lumenal ERAD substrate degradation. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we defined roles for disordered regions between structural elements that were required for Hrd1s ability to autoubiquitinate and interact with substrate. Our results demonstrate that disordered cytosolic regions promote substrate retrotranslocation by controlling Hrd1 activation and establishing directionality of retrotranslocation for lumenal substrate across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe mechanisms determining vascular tone are still not completely understood, even though it is a significant factor in blood pressure management. Many circulating proteins have a significant impact on controlling vascular tone. Progranulin (PGRN) displays anti-inflammatory effects and has been extensively studied in neurodegenerative illnesses. We investigated whether PGRN sustains the vascular tone that helps regulate blood pressure.\n\nMethodsWe used male and female C57BL6/J wild type (PGRN+/+) and B6(Cg)-Grntm1.1Aidi/J (PGRN-/-) to understand the impact of PGRN on vascular contractility and blood pressure.\n\nResultsWe found that male and female PGRN-/- mice display elevated blood pressure followed by hypercontractility to noradrenaline in mesenteric arteries, which are restored by supplementing the mice with recombinant PGRN (rPGRN). In ex vivo experiments, rPGRN attenuated the vascular contractility to noradrenaline in male and female PGRN+/+ arteries, which was blunted by blocking EphrinA2 or Sortlin1. To understand the mechanisms whereby PGRN evokes anti-contractile effects, we inhibited endothelial factors. L-NAME [nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitor] prevented the PGRN effects, whereas indomethacin (cyclooxygenases inhibitor) only affected the contractility in arteries incubated with vehicle, indicating the PGRN increases nitric oxide and decreases contractile prostanoids. Finally, rPGRN induced endothelial NOS (eNOS) phosphorylation and NO production in isolated mesenteric endothelial cells.\n\nConclusionCirculating PGRN regulates vascular tone and blood pressure via EphrinA2 and Sortlin1 receptors and eNOS activation. Collectively, our data suggest that deficiency in PGRN is a cardiovascular risk factor and that PGRN might be a new therapeutic avenue to treat high blood pressure.\n\nClinical PerspectiveWhat is new?\n\nO_LIPGRN displays vascular anti-contractile effects dependent on EphrinA2 and Sortilin1 receptors and nitric oxide formation in male and female\nC_LIO_LIDeficiency in PGRN triggers high blood pressure and induces vascular dysfunction characterized by hypercontractility to noradrenaline\nC_LIO_LIPGRN supplementation restores blood pressure and vascular dysfunction in PGRN-deficient mice\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the clinical implications?\n\nO_LIPGRN deficiency is associated with neurodegenerative diseases including neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

When the most skeptical researchers say they do not believe in Noetic Science but use a placebo in their research, they generate an apparent contradiction. The present study aimed to understand the noetic influence on high-level athletes, using a sportomics strategy, statistical exploratory techniques of machine learning and holistic analysis.\n\nMethodsThe study included 14 volunteer volleyball athletes. Each volunteer was submitted to four running tests of 3,000 meters, on a 400-meter track, with one test each subsequent day. On the first day, the athletes performed the first test of 3,000, aiming to adapt to the trial (ADAPT 1), and on the second day, the same adaptation (ADAPT 2). On the third and fourth days, the placebos were introduced, and on the third day, the athletes received the information that that would be just a placebo, which was called (CONTROL). On the fourth day, when the identical placebo was given, the athletes received the information that it would be a new cutting-edge nutritional supplement being studied (PLACEBO).\n\nResultsMen might be up to eight times more affected by the control effect and three times more by the placebo effect than women. Regarding performance, there was an antagonistic behavior concerning gender for the control effect and an agonistic effect for the placebo effect, but with less impact on women. Men also showed a faster adaptation to the test.\n\nConclusionNoetic science, always considered but never assumed by researchers, is confirmed when the present study reveals that men are more affected by the control effect and the placebo effect than women, with antagonistic behavior concerning gender for the control effect and an agonist effect for the placebo effect, but with less impact on women about performance.",

    "abstract": "Hyperactive Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 signaling has long been appreciated as a driver of autoimmune disease by breaking tolerance to self-nucleic acids in mouse models1-5. Recently, mutations in TLR7 or its associated regulator UNC93B16, 7, were identified as monogenic causes of human lupus; the unifying feature of these mutations being TLR7 gain-of-function. TLR7 is an intracellular transmembrane receptor, sensing RNA breakdown products within late endosomes8, 9. Hence, its function depends on intricate transport mechanisms and membrane interactions within the endomembrane network. Whether perturbations of any of these endosome-related processes can give rise to TLR7 gain-of-function and facilitate self-reactivity has not been investigated. Here, we show that a dysregulated endosomal compartment leads to unrestricted TLR7 signaling and human lupus. The late endosomal BLOC-1-related protein complex (BORC) together with the small Arf1-like GTPase Arl8b controls TLR7 protein levels, and a direct interaction between Arl8b and Unc93b1 is required to regulate TLR7 turnover. We identified an amino acid insertion in UNC93B1 in a patient with childhood-onset lupus, which reduces the interaction with the BORC-Arl8b complex and leads to endosomal TLR7 accumulation. Therefore, a failure to control the proper progression of TLR7 through its endocytic life cycle is sufficient to break immunological tolerance to nucleic acids in humans. Our results highlight the importance of an intact endomembrane system to prevent autoimmune disease. As the cellular mechanisms restricting TLR7 signaling can be manifold, identifying and stratifying lupus patients based on a TLR7-driven pathogenesis could be a viable strategy towards a targeted therapy.",

We utilize these advances to show that a passive spiral microfluidic device can effectively concentrate marine nanoflagellates within the 3-20 micron size range without harm to cells, while reducing background bacteria levels.

However, the strains and whether their resistance genes are plasmid or chromosomally located have not been well characterised. Our study examined the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistant E. coli isolated from young calves ([&le;] 14 days old). Recto-anal swab enrichments from 40 dairy calves located on four dairy farms were examined for tetracycline, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and third-generation cephalosporin resistant E. coli. Fifty-eight percent (23/40) of calves harboured antimicrobial resistant E. coli: 18/40 (45%) harboured tetracycline resistant and 25% (10/40) harboured chromosomal mediated AmpC producing E. coli. Whole genome sequencing of 27 isolates revealed five sequence types, with ST88 being the dominant ST (17/27, 63% of the sequenced isolates) followed by ST1308 (3/27, 11%), along with the extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineages ST69 (3/27), ST10 (2/27, 7%), and ST58 (1/27, 4%). Additionally, 16 isolates were MDR, harbouring additional resistance genes that were not tested phenotypically. Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technologies enabled the location of multiple resistant gene cassettes in IncF plasmids to be determined. A phylogenetic comparison of the ST10 and ST69 isolates demonstrated that the calf derived isolates were distinct from other New Zealand animal, human, and environmental isolates. and highlights the importance of understanding the sources of antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "The emerging and global spread of a novel plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, threatens human health. It is accepted that MCR-1 affects bacterial fitness, and this fitness cost correlates with bacterial membrane lipid A perturbation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we screened out a novel MCR-1 variant, named M6, with a two-point mutation that rendered a low level of co-resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. Compared to wild-type (WT) MCR-1, this variant caused severe lipid A perturbation resulting in peptidoglycan layer remodelling and thus resulted in phenotypic co-resistance to {beta}-lactams. Moreover, we found that a lipid A loading cavity is localized at the linker domain of MCR-1 and governs colistin resistance and bacterial membrane permeability, and the mutated pocket of M6 facilitates the binding affinity of lipid A. More importantly, synthetic peptides derived from M6 achieved broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. These findings provide insights into a potential vulnerability that could be exploited in future antimicrobial drug design.",

    "abstract": "Nitrofurantoin is a broad-spectrum first-line antimicrobial used for managing uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Loss-of-function mutations in chromosomal genes nfsA, nfsB, and ribE of Escherichia coli are known to reduce nitrofurantoin susceptibility. Here, we report monoclonal nitrofurantoin heteroresistance in E. coli and a novel genetic mechanism associated with this phenomenon.\n\nSubpopulations with reduced nitrofurantoin susceptibility in cultures of two E. coli blood strains were identified using population analysis profiling. Four colonies of each strain growing on agar with 0.5xMIC nitrofurantoin were sub-cultured in broth with 0.5xMIC nitrofurantoin (n=2) or without nitrofurantoin (n=2). Moreover, one colony of each strain growing without nitrofurantoin exposure was selected as a reference for genomic comparison. Whole-genome sequencing of all isolates were conducted on Illumina and Nanopore MinION systems.\n\nBoth strains had a nitrofurantoin MICs of 64 mg/L. The proportion of cells grown at 0.5xMIC was two and 99 per million, respectively, which is distinct to that of a homogeneously susceptible or resistant isolate. All isolates grown at 0.5xMIC had 11-66 kbp deletions in chromosomal regions harbouring nfsB, and all these deletions were immediately adjacent to IS1-family insertion sequences.\n\nAlthough this study is limited to E. coli and nitrofurantoin, our findings suggest IS1-associated genetic deletion represents a hitherto unrecognised mechanism of heteroresistance that could compromise infection management and impact conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\n\nImpact statementNitrofurantoin is widely used for treating and preventing urinary tract infection. Prevalence of nitrofurantoin resistance generally is low in E. coli. Here, we report nitrofurantoin heteroresistance in two E. coli blood strains and attribute this phenotype to IS1-associated deletion of chromosomal regions harbouring oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase gene nfsB. Our discoveries demonstrate a novel genetic mechanism of heteroresistance and suggest detecting nitrofurantoin heteroresistance in E. coli urinary isolates for improving prescribing.\n\nData summaryWhole-genome sequencing reads and genome assemblies generated in this study have been deposited under BioProject PRJEB58678 in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).

    "abstract": "Complexome profiling (CP) is a powerful tool for systematic investigation of protein interactors that has been primarily applied to study the composition and dynamics of mitochondrial protein complexes. Here, we further optimised this method to extend its application to survey mitochondrial DNA- and RNA-interacting protein complexes. We established that high-resolution clear native gel electrophoresis (hrCNE) is a better alternative to preserve DNA- and RNA-protein interactions that are otherwise disrupted when samples are separated by the widely used blue native gel electrophoresis (BNE). In combination with enzymatic digestion of DNA, our CP approach improved the identification of a wide range of protein interactors of the mitochondrial gene expression system without compromising the detection of other multi-protein complexes. The utility of this approach was particularly demonstrated by analysing the complexome changes in human mitochondria with impaired gene expression after transient, chemically-induced mtDNA depletion. Effects of RNase on mitochondrial protein complexes were also evaluated and discussed. Overall, our adaptations significantly improved the identification of mitochondrial DNA- and RNA-protein interactions by CP, thereby unlocking the comprehensive analysis of a near-complete mitochondrial complexome in a single experiment.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are membrane bound organelles which compartmentalize diverse metabolic processes in eukaryotic cells. Having no protein synthetic abilities, peroxisomes import all required enzymes from the cytosol through a peroxin (Pex) import system. In the first step, the Peroxisome Targeting Sequence 1 (PTS1)-marked cargo is recognized by soluble receptor, Pex5. The cargo-Pex5 complex then docks at the peroxisomal membrane translocon containing Pex14 and Pex13 and translocates into peroxisomal lumen, but the structural understanding is elusive. Here, we report a cryo-EM structure of cargo-Pex5-Pex14 ternary complex from Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of human Chagas disease. Malate dehydrogenase (cargo) - Pex5 interface is characterized by a swinging motion of Pex5 restricted by secondary, PTS1 independent interactions. The Pex5-Pex14 interface reveals a noncanonical contact surface adjacent to the previously identified Wxxx(F/Y) motif. Mutational analysis demonstrates that noncanonical interactions did not evolve to increase the affinity, but rather to restrict the dynamics at the cost of affinity. Consequences for the peroxisomal transport are discussed.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS1. The structure of a ternary complex (MDH-Pex5-Pex14) enabling cargo translocation via peroxisomal membrane was determined using cryo-EM.\n2. Pex5 interface with the cargo (MDH) is characterized by significant conformational dynamics restricted by PTS1 independent interactions\n3. Wxxx(F/Y) motif mediated docking of Pex14 at Pex5 is complemented by interactions at the noncanonical site.",

    "abstract": "Efficient metabolic engineering and the development of mitochondrial therapeutics often rely upon the specific and strong import of foreign proteins into mitochondria. Fusing a protein to a mitochondria-bound signal peptide is a common method to localize proteins to mitochondria, but this strategy is not universally effective with particular proteins empirically failing to localize. To help overcome this barrier, this work develops a generalizable and open-source framework to design proteins for mitochondrial import and quantify their specific localization. By using a Python-based pipeline to quantitatively assess the colocalization of different proteins previously used for precise genome editing in a high-throughput manner, we reveal signal peptide-protein combinations that localize well in mitochondria and, more broadly, general trends about the overall reliability of commonly used mitochondrial targeting signals.",

    "abstract": "Engineering of biosynthetic enzymes is increasingly employed to synthesize structural analogues of antibiotics. Of special interest are non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) responsible for production of important antimicrobial peptides. Here, directed evolution of an adenylation domain of a Pro-specific NRPS module completely switched substrate specificity to the non-standard amino acid piperazic acid (Piz) bearing a labile N-N bond. This success was achieved by LC-MS/MS based screening of small, rationally designed mutant libraries and can presumably be replicated with a larger number of substrates and NRPS modules. The evolved NRPS produces a Piz-derived gramicidin S analog. Thus, we give new impetus to the too-early dismissed idea that widely accessible low-throughput methods can switch the specificity of NRPSs in a biosynthetically useful fashion.",

    "abstract": "Encapsulated cell-based therapies involve the use of genetically-modified cells embedded in a material in order to produce a therapeutic agent in a specific location in the patients body. This approach has shown great potential in animal model systems for treating diseases such as type I diabetes or cancer, with selected approaches having been tested in clinical trials. Despite the promise shown by encapsulated cell therapy, though, there are safety concerns yet to be addressed, such as the escape of the engineered cells from the encapsulation material and the resulting production of therapeutic agents at uncontrolled sites of the body. For that reason, there is great interest in the implementation of safety switches that protect from those side effects. Here, we develop a material-genetic interface as safety switch for engineered mammalian cells embedded into hydrogels. Our switch allows the therapeutic cells to sense whether they are embedded in the hydrogel by means of a synthetic receptor and signaling cascade that link transgene expression to the presence of an intact embedding material. The system design is highly modular, allowing its flexible adaptation to other cell types and embedding materials. This autonomously acting switch constitutes an advantage over previously described safety switches, which rely on user-triggered signals to modulate activity or survival of the implanted cells. We envision that the concept developed here will advance the safety of cell therapies and facilitate their translation to clinical evaluation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/535359v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e5005org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d793a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d92f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b8128_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
