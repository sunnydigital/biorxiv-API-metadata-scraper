    "abstract": "Background and purposePsychological disorders, such as anxiety and anhedonia are pain comorbidities, however how pain affects male and female individuals and through which mechanism is not well understood. Previous research show pain-induced alterations in the dynorphinergic pathway in the mesocorticolimbic system (MCLS) together with a relationship between corticotropin-releasing system and dynorphin release in the MCLS. Here, we analyse the sex and time course-dependent effects of pain on negative affect. Additionally, we study the implication of dynorphinergic and corticotropin releasing factor involvement in these pain related behaviours.\n\nExperimental approachWe used behavioural pharmacology and biochemical tools to characterize negative affective states induced by inflammatory pain in male and female rats, and the alterations in dynorphinergic and corticotropin systems in the MCLS.\n\nKey resultsFemale rats showed a persistent anxiety-like together with a reversible anhedonia-like behaviours derived from inflammatory pain. Additionally, we found alterations of in both dynorphin and corticotropin releasing factor in NAc and amygdala that suggest sex-dependent dynamic adaptations. Finally blockade on the kappa opioid receptor in the NAc confirmed its role in pain-induced anxiety-like behaviour in female rats.\n\nConclusions and implicationsOur results show sex and time dependent anxiety- and anhedonia-like behaviours induced by the presence of pain in female rats. Furthermore, we replicated previous data pointing to the KOR/dyn recruitment in the NAc as key neurological substrate mediating these behaviours. This research encourages the study the mechanisms underlying these behaviours, to better understand the emotional dimension of pain.",

    "abstract": "Under adverse environmental conditions, nematodes arrest into dauer, an alternative developmental stage for diapause. Dauer endures unfavorable environments and interacts with host animals to access favorable environments, thus playing a critical role in survival. Here, we report that in Caenorhabditis elegans, daf-42 is essential for development into the dauer stage, as the null mutant of daf-42 exhibited a \"no viable dauer\" phenotype in which no viable dauers were obtained in any dauer-inducing conditions. Long-term time lapse microscopy of synchonized larvae revealed that daf-42 is involved in developmental changes from the pre-dauer L2d stage to the dauer stage. daf-42 encodes large, disordered proteins of various sizes that are expressed in and secreted from the seam cells within a narrow time window shortly before the molt into dauer stage. Transcriptome analysis showed that the transcription of genes involved in larval physiology and dauer metabolism are highly affected by the daf-42 mutation. Contrary to the notion that essential genes that control the life and death of an organism may well be conserved across diverse species, daf-42 is an evolutionarily young gene conserved only in the Caenorhabditis genus. Our study shows that dauer formation is a vital process that is controlled not only by conserved genes but also by newly emerged genes, providing important insights into evolutionary mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "As professional secretory cells, beta cells require adaptable mRNA translation to facilitate a rapid synthesis of proteins, including insulin, in response to changing metabolic cues. Specialized mRNA translation programs are essential drivers of cellular development and differentiation. However, in the pancreatic beta cell, the majority of factors identified to promote growth and development function primarily at the level of transcription. Therefore, despite its importance, the regulatory role of mRNA translation in the formation and maintenance of functional beta cells is not well defined. In this study, we have identified a translational regulatory mechanism in the beta cell driven by the specialized mRNA translation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), which facilitates beta cell maturation. The mRNA translation function of eIF5A is only active when it is post-translationally modified (\"hypusinated\") by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS). We have discovered that the absence of beta cell DHPS in mice reduces the synthesis of proteins critical to beta cell identity and function at the stage of beta cell maturation, leading to a rapid and reproducible onset of diabetes. Therefore, our work has revealed a gatekeeper of specialized mRNA translation that permits the beta cell, a metabolically responsive secretory cell, to maintain the integrity of protein synthesis necessary during times of induced or increased demand.\n\nARTICLE HIGHLIGHTSO_LIPancreatic beta cells are professional secretory cells that require adaptable mRNA translation for the rapid, inducible synthesis of proteins, including insulin, in response to changing metabolic cues. Our previous work in the exocrine pancreas showed that development and function of the acinar cells, which are also professional secretory cells, is regulated at the level of mRNA translation by a specialized mRNA translation factor, eIF5AHYP. We hypothesized that this translational regulation, which can be a response to stress such as changes in growth or metabolism, may also occur in beta cells.\nC_LIO_LIGiven that the mRNA translation function of eIF5A is only active when the factor is post-translationally modified (\"hypusinated\") by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), we asked the question: does DHPS/eIF5AHYP regulate the formation and maintenance of functional beta cells?\nC_LIO_LIWe discovered that in the absence of beta cell DHPS in mice, eIF5A is not hypusinated (activated), which leads to a reduction in the synthesis of critical beta cell proteins that interrupts pathways critical for identity and function. This translational regulation occurs at weaning age, which is a stage of cellular stress and maturation for the beta cell. Therefore without DHPS/eIF5AHYP, beta cells do not mature and mice progress to hyperglycemia and diabetes.\nC_LIO_LIOur findings suggest that secretory cells have a mechanism to regulate mRNA translation during times of cellular stress. Our work also implies that driving an increase in mRNA translation in the beta cell might overcome or possibly reverse the beta cell defects that contribute to early dysfunction and the progression to diabetes.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During embryogenesis the nascent Caenorhabditis elegans epidermis secretes an apical extracellular matrix (aECM) that serves as an external stabilizer, preventing deformation of the epidermis by mechanical forces exerted during morphogenesis. We showed that two conserved proteins linked to this process, SYM-3/FAM102A and SYM-4/WDR44, colocalize to intracellular and membrane-associated puncta and likely function together in a complex. Proteomics data also suggested potential roles for FAM102A and WDR44 family proteins in intracellular trafficking, consistent with their localization patterns. Nonetheless, we found no evidence to support a clear function for SYM-3 or SYM-4 in the apical deposition of two aECM components, FBN-1 and NOAH. Surprisingly, loss of MEC-8/RBPMS2, a conserved splicing factor and regulator of fbn-1, had little effect on the abundance or deposition of FBN-1 to the aECM. Using a focused screening approach, we identified 32 additional proteins that likely contribute to the structure and function of the embryonic aECM. Lastly, we examined morphogenesis defects in embryos lacking mir-51 microRNA family members, which display a related embryonic phenotype to mec-8; sym double mutants. Collectively, our findings add to our knowledge of pathways controlling embryonic morphogenesis.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe identify new proteins in apical ECM biology in C. elegans and provide evidence that SYM-3/FAM102A and SYM-4/WDR44 function together in trafficking but do not regulate apical ECM protein deposition.",

    "abstract": "The RB and Hippo pathways interact to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. However, their mechanism of interaction is not fully understood. Drosophila photoreceptors with inactivated RB and Hippo pathways specify normally but fail to maintain neuronal identity and dedifferentiate. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to elucidate the cause of dedifferentiation and the fate of these cells. We find that dedifferentiated cells adopt a progenitor-like fate due to inappropriate activation of the retinal differentiation suppressor homothorax (hth) by Yki/Sd. This results in activation of the Yki/Hth transcriptional program, driving photoreceptor dedifferentiation. We show that Rbf physically interacts with Yki which, together with the GAGA factor, inhibits hth expression. Thus, RB and Hippo pathways cooperate to maintain photoreceptor differentiation by preventing inappropriate expression of hth in differentiating photoreceptors. Our work accentuates the importance of both RB and Hippo pathway activity for maintaining the state of terminal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Drug administration in preclinical rodent models is essential for research and development of novel therapies. Compassionate administration methods have been developed, but these are mostly incompatible with water-insoluble drugs such as tamoxifen or do not allow for precise timing or dosing of the drugs. For more than two decades, tamoxifen has been administered by oral gavage or injection to CreERT2/loxP gene-modified mouse models to spatiotemporally control gene expression, with the numbers of such models steadily increasing in recent years. Animal-friendly procedures for accurately administering tamoxifen or other water-insoluble drugs would therefore have an important impact on animal welfare. Based on a previously published micropipette feeding protocol, we developed palatable formulations to encourage voluntary consumption of tamoxifen. We evaluated the acceptance of the new formulations by mice during training and treatment and assessed the efficacy of tamoxifen-mediated induction of CreERT2/loxP dependent reporter genes. Both sweetened milk and syrup-based formulations encouraged mice to consume tamoxifen voluntarily, but only sweetened milk formulations were statistically non-inferior to oral gavage in inducing CreERT2-mediated gene expression. Serum concentrations of tamoxifen metabolites, quantified using an in-house developed cell assay, confirmed the lower efficacies of syrup- as compared to sweetened milk-based formulations. We found dosing with a micropipette to be more accurate, with the added advantage that the method requires little training for the experimenter. The new palatable solutions encourage voluntary consumption of tamoxifen without loss of efficacy compared to oral gavage and thus represent a refined administration method.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms have an increasing influence in biomedical and other disciplines of science and public health. While Twitter has been a popular platform for scientific communication, changes in ownership have led some users to consider migrating to other platforms such as Mastodon. We aimed to investigate how many top-cited scientists are active on these social media platforms, the magnitude of the migration to Mastodon, and correlates of Twitter presence. A random sample of 900 authors was examined among those who are at the top-2% of impact based on a previously validated composite citation indicator using Scopus data. Searches for their personal Twitter accounts were performed in early December 2022, and re-evaluations were performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 months (February 6, 2023). 262/900 (29.1%) of highly-cited scholars had Twitter accounts, and only 9/800 (1%) had Mastodon accounts. Female gender, North American and Australia locations, younger publication age, and clinical medicine or social science expertise correlated with higher percentages of Twitter use. The vast majority of highly-cited author users of Twitter had few followers and tweets. Only 6 had more than 10,000 followers and none had more than 100,000. One limitation of our study is that it is possible that some accounts, especially with Mastodon, could not be detected. However, the study suggests that Twitter remains the preferred social media platform for highly-cited authors, and Mastodon has not yet challenged Twitters dominance. Moreover, most highly-cited scientists with Twitter accounts have limited presence in this medium.",

Unidirectional chemogenetic blockade of the interhemispheric pathway from the contralesional to ipsilesional premotor cortex impaired dexterous hand movements during the early recovery stage after lesioning the lateral corticospinal tract in macaques. Furthermore, electrocorticographical recording showed that the low frequency band activity of the ipsilesional premotor cortex around the movement onset was decreased by the blockade during the early recovery stage, while it was increased by blockade during the intact state and the late recovery stage. These results demonstrate that the action of the interhemispheric pathway changed from inhibition to facilitation, leading to the involvement of the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex in hand movements during the early recovery stage. The present study offers new insights into the state-dependent role of the interhemispheric pathway and a therapeutic target in the early recovery stage after lesioning of the corticospinal tract.",

The proposed approach utilizes the powerful representational capabilities of living beings neuronal circuitry to design and generate improved deep learning systems with a topology similar to natural networks. The Caenorhabditis elegans connectome is used as a reference due to its completeness, reasonable size, and functional neuron classes annotations. It is demonstrated that the connectome of simple organisms exhibits specific functional relationships between neurons, and once transformed into learnable tensor networks and integrated into modern architectures, it offers bio-plausible structures that efficiently solve complex tasks. The performance of the models is demonstrated against randomly wired networks and compared to artificial networks ranked on global benchmarks. In the first case, ElegansNet outperforms randomly wired networks. Interestingly, ElegansNet models show slightly similar performance with only those based on the Watts-Strogatz small-world property. When compared to state-of-the-art artificial neural networks, such as transformers or attention-based autoencoders, ElegansNet outperforms well-known deep learning and traditional models in both supervised image classification tasks and unsupervised hand-written digits reconstruction, achieving top-1 accuracy of 99.99% on Cifar10 and 99.84% on MNIST Unsup on the validation sets.",

We sampled momentary craving as three groups of participants (alcohol drinkers, cannabis users, and binge eaters; total n=202) performed a probabilistic learning task in which they received either monetary or group-specific addictive cue rewards. Using computational modeling, we found that momentary craving dynamically biased towards faster learning during addictive but not monetary decision-making across all groups. Conversely, we also found that prediction errors modulated perceived craving. Computational parameters underlying these latent mechanisms were reliably predictive of clinical severity. These findings provide a computational mechanism for the interaction between craving and choice behavior that is generalizable across addictive domains.",

In addition to generating new neurons, NSPCs may alter their niche via secretion of growth factors and cytokines. We recently showed that adult DG NSPCs secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is critical for maintaining adult neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether NSPC-derived VEGF alters hippocampal function independent of adult neurogenesis. We found that loss of NSPC-derived VEGF acutely impaired hippocampal memory, caused neuronal hyperexcitability and exacerbated excitotoxic injury. We also found that NSPCs generate substantial proportions of total DG VEGF and VEGF disperses broadly throughout the DG, both of which help explain how this anatomically-restricted cell population could modulate function broadly. These findings suggest that NSPCs actively support and protect DG function via secreted VEGF, thereby providing a non-neurogenic functional dimension to endogenous NSPCs.",

Neural correlates of choice competition are observed across frontal cortex and downstream superior colliculus (SC) during decision-making, yet how these regions interact to mediate choice competition remains unresolved. Here we report that cell types within SC can bidirectionally modulate choice competition and drive choice activity in frontal cortex. In the mouse, topographically matched regions of frontal cortex and SC formed a descending motor pathway for directional licking and a re-entrant loop via the thalamus. During decision-making, distinct neuronal populations in both frontal cortex and SC encoded opposing lick directions and exhibited push-pull dynamics. SC GABAergic neurons encoded ipsilateral choice and glutamatergic neurons encoded contralateral choice, and activating or suppressing these cell types could bidirectionally drive push-pull choice activity in frontal cortex. These results thus identify SC as a major locus to modulate choice competition within the broader action selection network.",

The brain regions where IIS are largest are not known but are important because such data would suggest sites that contribute to IIS generation. Because hippocampus and cortex exhibit altered excitability in AD models, we asked which areas dominate the activity during IIS along the cortical-CA1-dentate gyrus (DG) dorso-ventral axis. Because medial septal (MS) cholinergic neurons are overactive when IIS typically occur, we also tested the novel hypothesis that silencing the MS cholinergic neurons selectively would reduce IIS.\n\nWe used mice that simulate aspects of AD: Tg2576 mice, presenilin 2 (PS2) knockout mice and Ts65Dn mice. To selectively silence MS cholinergic neurons, Tg2576 mice were bred with choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT)-Cre mice and offspring were injected in the MS with AAV encoding inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). We recorded local field potentials along the cortical-CA1-DG axis using silicon probes during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.\n\nWe detected IIS in all transgenic or knockout mice but not age-matched controls. IIS were detectable throughout the cortical-CA1-DG axis and occurred primarily during REM sleep. In all 3 mouse lines, IIS amplitudes were significantly greater in the DG granule cell layer vs. CA1 pyramidal layer or overlying cortex. Current source density analysis showed robust and early current sources in the DG, and additional sources in CA1 and the cortex also. Selective chemogenetic silencing of MS cholinergic neurons significantly reduced IIS rate during REM sleep without affecting the overall duration, number of REM bouts, latency to REM sleep, or theta power during REM. Notably, two control interventions showed no effects.\n\nConsistent maximal amplitude and strong current sources of IIS in the DG suggest that the DG is remarkably active during IIS. In addition, selectively reducing MS cholinergic tone, at times when MS is hyperactive, could be a new strategy to reduce IIS in AD.",

    "abstract": "Mammary gland is a unique organ that undergoes dynamic alterations throughout a female's reproductive life, making it an ideal model for developmental, stem cell and cancer biology research. Mammary gland development begins in utero and proceeds via a quiescent bud stage before the initial outgrowth and subsequent branching morphogenesis. How mammary epithelial cells transit from quiescence to an actively proliferating and branching tissue during embryogenesis and, importantly, how the branch pattern is determined remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence indicating that epithelial cell proliferation, segregation into basal and luminal lineages that characterize the postnatal mammary duct, and onset of branching are independent processes, yet partially coordinated by the Eda signaling pathway. By performing heterotypic and heterochronic epithelial-mesenchymal recombination experiments between mammary and salivary gland tissues and ex vivo live imaging, we demonstrate that unlike previously concluded, the mode of branching is an intrinsic property of the mammary epithelium while the growth pace and density of the mammary ductal tree are governed by the mesenchyme. Transcriptomic profiling and ex vivo and in vivo functional studies disclose that mesenchymal Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, and in particular IGF-1 downstream of it critically regulate mammary gland growth. These results underscore the general need to carefully decompose the different developmental processes producing branched organs.",

    "abstract": "The ability to perform genomic sequencing on long-dead organisms is opening new frontiers in evolutionary research. These opportunities are especially profound in the case of museum collections, from which countless documented specimens may now be suitable for genomic analysis. Here, we report 25 newly sequenced genomes from museum specimens of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including the oldest extant specimens of this species. By comparing historical samples ranging from the early 1800s to 1933 against modern day genomes, we document evolution across thousands of generations, including time periods that encompass the species initial occupation of northern Europe and an era of rapidly increasing human activity. At the genome-wide level, we find that historical flies from the same time and place show much greater evidence for relatedness than flies from modern collections, and some show evidence of inbreeding as well, potentially reflecting either much smaller local population sizes in the past or else the specific circumstances of the collections. We also find that the Lund, Sweden population underwent local genetic differentiation during the early 1800s to 1933 interval (potentially due to accelerated drift) but then became more similar to other European populations thereafter (potentially due to increased migration). Within each time period, our temporal sampling allows us to document compelling candidates for recent natural selection. In some cases, we gain insights regarding previously implicated selection candidates, such as ChKov1, for which our inferred timing of selection favors the hypothesis of antiviral resistance over insecticide resistance. Other candidates are novel, such as the circadian-related gene Ahcy, which yields a selection signal that rivals that of the DDT resistance gene Cyp6g1. These insights deepen our understanding of recent evolution in a model system, and highlight the potential of future museomic studies.",

We focused on the movements of antennae of the honey bee, which are used for not only multimodal sensory perception but also interactions between individuals. We developed an experimental system for analyzing the antennal responses (ARs) of the honey bee using DeepLabCut, a markerless posture-tracking tool using deep learning. The tracking of antennal movements during the presentation of vertical (downward and upward) motion stimuli using DeepLabCut successfully detected the ARs reported in the previous studies, where bees tilted their antennae in the direction opposite to the motion stimuli. In addition, we successfully detected ARs in response to horizontal (forward and backward) motion stimuli. An investigation of the developmental maturation of honey bee ARs showed that ARs to motion stimuli were not detected in bees immediately after emergence but became detectable through post-emergence development in an experience-independent manner. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering analysis using multidimensional data created by processing tracking data using DeepLabCut classified antennal movements into different clusters, suggesting that data-driven behavioral classification can apply to AR paradigms. These results reveal novel AR to visual stimuli and developmental maturation of ARs and suggest the efficacy of data-driven analysis for behavioral classification in behavioral studies of the honey bee.\n\nSummary statementAutomated tracking using DeepLabCut was successfully applied to measure the antennal response to motion stimuli and unsupervised classification of antennal movements in honey bees.",

Yet the field of RNA-seq simulators has progressed little in the last decade. To address this need we have developed BEERS2, which combines a flexible and highly configurable design with detailed simulation of the entire library preparation and sequencing pipeline. BEERS2 takes input transcripts (typically fully-length mRNA transcripts with polyA tails) from either customizable input or from CAMPAREE simulated RNA samples. It produces realistic reads of these transcripts as FASTQ, SAM, or BAM formats with the SAM or BAM formats containing the true alignment to the reference genome. It also produces true transcript-level quantification values. BEERS2 combines a flexible and highly configurable design with detailed simulation of the entire library preparation and sequencing pipeline and is designed to include the effects of polyA selection and RiboZero for ribosomal depletion, hexamer priming sequence biases, GC-content biases in PCR amplification, barcode read errors, and errors during PCR amplification. These characteristics combine to make BEERS2 the most complete simulation of RNA-seq to date. Finally, we demonstrate the use of BEERS2 by measuring the effect of several settings on the popular Salmon pseudoalignment algorithm.",

However, the bioinformatics pipelines currently used to analyse GeoMx data often fail to successfully account for the technical variability within the data and the complexity of experimental designs, thus limiting the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analysis. Carefully designed quality control workflows, that include in-depth experiment-specific investigations into technical variation and appropriate adjustment for such variation can address this issue. Here we present standR, a R/Bioconductor package that enables an end-to-end analysis of GeoMx DSP data.

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) signaling is critical for microglial maturation during development and the maintenance of microglial homeostasis in adulthood. It remains unclear whether regional susceptibilities to the loss of TGF-{beta} signaling in microglia also exist, and the contributing factors have yet to be identified. We find that deletion of Tgfbr2 on microglia leads to microglial activation and demyelination in mouse spinal cords, primarily in the dorsal column (DC). Tgfbr2-deficient microglia exhibit distinct transcriptomic changes, and those sorted from the DC display a more proinflammatory profile compared to those from the ventral column (VC) and grey matter (GM). Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the spinal cord uncovers a microglial subtype that emerges exclusively following Tgfbr2 deletion (termed TGF{beta} signaling-suppressed microglia, TSM), exhibiting high expression of Mmp12, Gpnmb, Lgals3, Mgll, and Alcam, predominantly located in the DC. Phenotypically, disruption of microglial TGF-{beta} signaling results in behavioral deficits that are more severe in female and older mice, whereas young male mice are less affected. Mechanistically, we reveal a significantly higher level of TGF-{beta}1/TGFBR2 in the spinal cords of normal older mice compared to the young mice, with the DC region richer in genes of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway than the VC and GM regions. This indicates that older mice and the DC region require more TGF{beta}1 to maintain tissue homeostasis and, reciprocally, are more responsive and sensitive to the disruption of TGF-{beta} signaling in microglia. Herein, we report a demyelinating disease with region-specificity and its susceptibility to the loss of microglial TGF-{beta} signaling with gender and age differences. Our findings contribute valuable information to our understanding of the importance of microglia in regulating myelin health, especially during the aging process.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoV), including SARS-CoV-2, modulate host proteostasis through activation of stress-responsive signaling pathways such as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which remedies misfolded protein accumulation by attenuating translation and increasing protein folding capacity. While CoV nonstructural proteins (nsps) are essential for infection, little is known about the role of nsps in modulating the UPR. We characterized the impact of SARS-CoV-2 nsp4, a key driver of replication, on the UPR using quantitative proteomics to sensitively detect pathway-wide upregulation of effector proteins. We find nsp4 preferentially activates the ATF6 and PERK branches of the UPR. Previously, we found an N-terminal truncation of nsp3 (nsp3.1) can suppress pharmacological ATF6 activation. To determine how nsp3.1 and nsp4 tune the UPR, their co-expression demonstrated that nsp3.1 suppresses nsp4-mediated PERK, but not ATF6 activation. Re-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection proteomics data revealed time-dependent activation of PERK targets early in infection, which subsequently fades. This temporal regulation suggests a role for nsp3 and nsp4 in tuning the PERK pathway to attenuate host translation beneficial for viral replication while avoiding later apoptotic signaling caused by chronic activation. This work furthers our understanding of CoV-host proteostasis interactions and highlights the power of proteomic methods for systems-level analysis of the UPR.",

    "abstract": "Published evidence indicates that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes endothelial cell (EC) injury in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Endothelial junctions (EJ) are crucial to maintain EC integrity and normal microvascular functions due to the adhesive properties of Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin to glue EC together. Here we report studies in vitro and in vivo that indicate VE-cadherin to be a target for cleavage by ACE2. We have identified that the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin contains these two amino acid sequences at the positions 256P-F257 and 321PMKP-325L for ACE2 substrate recognition. Incubation of purified sVE with ACE2 revealed a dose-dependent loss of immunoreactivity detected with an antibody directed against the Extracellular domain 1 (EC1) domain of sVE. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 on ECs using immunofluorescence studies, and by western blotting on ECs extracts. We also present evidence from patients with severe COVID-19 disease for a circulating form of ACE2. Its apparent molecular weight of 70 kDa is in agreement with a previously described extracellular form of ACE2 bearing the catalytic site of the ectopeptidase. Consistent with the experimental evidence for our hypothesis, the level of circulating soluble VE-cadherin fragments was increased in the blood of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Further studies are needed to determine if increased circulating fragments of ACE2 and VE-cadherin may contribute to the future development of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome characterized by vascular endothelial injury, hypoxia, and inflammatory state.\n\nImpact StatementSARS-CoV-2 infection promotes vascular dysfunction but the processes are not completely understood. The vascular endothelium is composed of a monolayer of endothelial cells (ECs) that exclusively express VE-cadherin at adherens junctions (AJs). The published structure of VE-cadherin has revealed crucial residues in the domains EC1-2 for ECs adhesiveness. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that VE-cadherin is a target for ACE2 ectoenzyme in the domains EC2-3. In addition, in COVID-19 patients blood, we identify truncated forms of ACE2 and VE-cadherin that are correlated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because the turnover rate of ECs is very low, this could provide part of the explanation for Long CoVID-19 disease. These exciting results highlight the role of proteases and AJs, and the need for continuing efforts to elucidate whether these circulating proteins might be of prime significance for clinicians to facilitate personalized medicine.",

In addition of being overexpressed in cancer cells, TMPRSS2 plays a further fundamental role in favoring viral infections by allowing the fusion of the virus envelope and the cellular membrane, notably in SARS-CoV-2. In this contribution we resort to multiscale molecular modeling to unravel the structural and dynamical features of TMPRSS2 and its interaction with a model lipid bilayer. Furthermore, we shed light into the mechanism of action of a potential inhibitor (Nafamostat), determining the free-energy profile associated with the inhibition reaction, and showing the facile poisoning of the enzyme. Our study, while providing the first atomistically resolved mechanism of TMPRSS2 inhibition, is also fundamental in furnishing a solid framework for further rational design targeting transmembrane proteases in a host-directed antiviral strategy.\n\nTOC GRAPHICS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=193 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537985v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (108K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19dd8c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@394c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ad383org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@347a8c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Inducible gene expression systems are important for studying bacterial gene function, yet most exhibit leakage. In this study, we engineered a leakage-free hybrid system for precise gene expression controls in Fusobacterium nucleatum by integrating the xylose-inducible expression system with the theophylline-responsive riboswitch. This innovative method enables concurrent control of target gene expression at both transcription and translation initiation levels. Using luciferase and the indole-producing enzyme tryptophanase (TnaA) as reporters, we demonstrated that the hybrid system displays virtually no observable signal in the absence of inducers. We employed this system to express FtsX, a protein related to fusobacterial cytokinesis, in an ftsX mutant strain, unveiling a dose-dependent manner in FtsX production. Without inducers, cells form long filaments, while increasing FtsX levels by increasing inducers concentrations led to a gradual reduction in cell length until normal morphology was restored. Crucially, this system facilitated essential gene investigation, identifying the signal peptidase lepB gene as vital for F. nucleatum. LepBs essentiality stems from depletion, affecting outer membrane biogenesis and cell division. This novel hybrid system holds the potential for advancing research on essential genes and accurate gene regulation in F. nucleatum.",

    "abstract": "The net blotches are among the most economically significant diseases of barley worldwide. There are two forms of the disease: net-form net-blotch (NFNB, causal agent Pyrenophora teres f. sp. teres [Ptt]) and spot-form net blotch (SFNB, causal agent Pyrenophora teres f. sp. maculata [Ptm]). Alongside varietal choice and cultural practices, fungicides form an important part of the regime for net blotch control. The succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) are a key class of fungicides used in net blotch management. However, resistance to this group of compounds has emerged in the net blotches in recent years. Here, we describe the first cases of resistance to SDHIs in Australian populations of net blotches. This study was prompted by reports of field failures of SDHI fungicides in controlling NFNB in South Australia and SFNB in Western Australia. Target site mutations in the Sdh complex genes, previously associated with reduced sensitivity in European net blotch populations, were found in Australian isolates, and two mutations which have not been previously observed in P. teres, are also described. The mutations found in Ptt included H134R and S135R in SdhC; and H134Y and D145G in SdhD; the SdhC-H134R mutation was the most frequently observed. In Ptm, the mutations found included H277L in SdhB; S73P, N75S, H134R and S135R in SdhC; and D145G in SdhD; the SdhC-N75S mutation was the most common. These mutations were correlated with reduced in vitro SDHI fungicide sensitivity by microtiter assay. The highest resistance factors to fluxapyroxad and bixafen, the most important SDHI fungicides for net blotch control in Australia, were associated with the SdhC-H134R and SdhC-S135R mutations in Ptt, and with the SdhB-H277L, SdhC-H134R, and SdhC-S135R mutations in Ptm. Modelling of the P. teres Sdh complex showed that the two novel mutations, H277L in SdhB and H134Y in SdhD, result in a highly altered binding mode and lower binding affinity of the SDHI compound compared to the wild-type.",

    "abstract": "RCK domains or proteins are important regulatory components of cation and K+ channels and transporters both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. A lasting unanswered question about bacterial RCK proteins relates to the physiological role of the multiple, sometimes closely related, RCK genes encoded in the genome. We explored this question with the Ktr channels of Bacillus subtilis that include two genes encoding RCK proteins (KtrA and KtrC) and two genes encoding their membrane protein partners (KtrB and KtrD). Using a combination of in vivo characterization and in vitro functional analysis, we determined that the two RCK proteins are neither physiologically redundant or functionally equivalent. Instead, KtrC is the physiologically dominant RCK protein due to its ability to mediate K+ transport inactivation by c-di-AMP, a bacterial second messenger that is the master regulator of the K+ machinery in many species, while KtrA assembled channels are very insensitive to the dinucleotide. Moreover, KtrC and KtrA can form heteromeric assemblies that can control the Ktr channel activity and are sensitive to c-di-AMP inhibition. In parallel, we showed that conditions with a large number of Ktr channels assembled with KtrA, or with RCK proteins that do not mediate c-di-AMP inhibition, are toxic to the cell. Altogether, we have demonstrated that c-di-AMP regulation of Ktr channels goes beyond affecting transcription and functional activity, it also determines the hierarchical organization of bacterial RCK proteins.",

    "abstract": "M5717 is a promising antimalarial drug under development thatacts against multiple stages of the life cycle of Plasmodium parasites by inhibiting the translation elongation factor 2 (PfeEF2), thereby preventing protein synthesis. The parasite clearance profile after drug treatment in preclinical studies in mice, and clinical trials in humans showed a notable delayed clearance phenotype whereby parasite infected red blood cells (iRBCs) persisted in the bloodstream for a significant period before eventual clearance. In a normal P. falciparum infection iRBCs sequester in the deep circulation by cytoadherence, allowing them to avoid surveillance and clearance in the spleen. In this work we show that M5717 treatment renders iRBCs invisible to normal splenic clearance mechanisms. We found that M5717 blocks parasite modification of their host red blood cells (RBCs) by preventing synthesis of new exported proteins, rather than by directly blocking the export of these proteins into the RBC compartment. Using in vitro models, we demonstrated that M5717 treated ring/trophozoite stage iRBCs became less rigid, and cytoadhered less well compared to untreated iRBCs. This indicates that in vivo persistence of M5717 treated iRBCs in the blood stream is likely due to reduced cytoadherence and splenic clearance.",

Vaccines and antivirals are sorely lacking and developments in these areas are hampered by the lack of an adequate cell culture system to investigate human norovirus replication and pathogenesis. Herein, we describe how the model norovirus, Mouse norovirus (MNV), produces a viral protein, NS3, with the functional capacity to attenuate host protein translation which invokes the activation cell death via apoptosis. We show that this function of NS3 is conserved between human and mouse viruses and map the protein domain attributable to this function.

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive pathogen responsible for life-threatening infections that are difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance. The identification of new vulnerabilities in essential processes like cell envelope biogenesis represents a promising avenue towards the development of anti-staphylococcal therapies that overcome resistance. To this end, we performed cell sorting-based enrichments for S. aureus mutants with defects in envelope integrity and cell division. We identified many known envelope biogenesis factors as well as a large collection of new factors with roles in this process. Mutants inactivated for one of the hits, the uncharacterized SAOUHSC_01855 protein, displayed aberrant membrane invaginations and multiple FtsZ cytokinetic ring structures. This factor is broadly distributed among Firmicutes, and its inactivation in B. subtilis similarly caused division and membrane defects. We therefore renamed the protein FacZ (Firmicute-associated coordinator of Z-rings). In S. aureus, inactivation of the conserved cell division protein GpsB suppressed the division and morphological defects of facZ mutants. Additionally, FacZ and GpsB were found to interact directly in a purified system. Thus, FacZ is a novel antagonist of GpsB function with a conserved role in controlling division site placement in S. aureus and other Firmicutes.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are self-transmissible mobile elements that transfer functional genetic units across broad phylogenetic distances. Accessory genes shuttled by ICEs can make significant contributions to bacterial fitness, yet ICEs that carry accessory genes encoding functions other than antimicrobial resistance remain poorly characterized.\n\nRecent observation of the rapid acquisition of ICEs in a pandemic lineage of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidae led to investigation of the structural and functional diversity of these elements among a diverse array of P. syringae. Fifty-three unique ICE types were identified across multiple phylogroups. These ICEs display distinct evolutionary histories compared to their bacterial hosts, are highly recombinogenic, exhibit a conserved structure and are punctuated by hotspots of accessory gene integration. Many carry a 16 kb transposon-like entity (Tn6212) that shows little polymorphism indicating recent dissemination. Deletion of Tn6212 did not alter pathogen growth in planta, but mutants displayed significant fitness defects when grown on TCA cycle intermediates. These were largely attributable to a single LysR regulator. RNA-seq analysis of a set of nested Tn6212 deletions confirmed a central role of LysR in enhanced expression of more than 300 genes and down-regulation of genes controlling expression of energetically demanding loci. Together the transcriptional data indicate a major role for Tn6212 in manipulation of bacterial metabolism with primary effects on RNA degradation, protein synthesis and potential diversion of ATP to growth.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas system functions as a prokaryotic immune system and is highly diverse, with six major types and numerous sub-types. The most abundant are type I CRISPR systems, which utilise a multi-subunit effector, Cascade, and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to detect invading DNA species. Detection leads to DNA loading of the Cas3 helicase-nuclease, leading to long range deletions in the targeted DNA, thus providing immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGE). Here, we focus on the type I-G system, a streamlined, 4- subunit complex with an atypical Cas3 enzyme. We demonstrate that Cas3 helicase activity is not essential for immunity against MGE in vivo and explore applications of the Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus Cascade effector for genome engineering in Escherichia coli. Long range, bidirectional deletions were observed when the lacZ gene was targeted. Deactivation of the Cas3 helicase activity dramatically altered the types of deletions observed, with small deletions flanked by direct repeats that are suggestive of microhomology mediated end joining. When donor DNA templates were present, both the wild-type and helicase deficient systems promoted homology-directed repair (HDR), with the latter system providing improvements in editing efficiency, suggesting that a single nick in the target site may promote HDR in E. coli using the type I-G system. These findings open the way for further application of the type I-G CRISPR systems in genome engineering.",

Here, we performed competition and survival experiments to confirm that deletion of ravA-viaA increases tolerance of the Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae to low and high aminoglycoside concentrations, during aerobic growth. Using high throughput strategies in this species, we identify Cpx and Zra2 two-component systems as new partners of RavA-ViaA. We show that the aminoglycoside tolerance of{Delta} ravvia requires the presence of these membrane stress sensing two-component systems. We propose that deletion of the RavA-ViaA function facilitates the response aminoglycosides because of a pre-activated state of Cpx and Zra2 membrane stress response systems. We also find an impact of these genes on polymyxin B sensitivity and vancomycin resistance, and we show that simultaneous inactivation of ravvia function together with envelope stress response systems leads to outer membrane permeabilization. Vancomycin is mostly used for Gram-positive because of its low efficiency for crossing the Gram-negative outer membrane. Targeting of the ravA-viaA operon for inactivation could be a future strategy to allow uptake of vancomycin into multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.",

Different genotyping methods are used and may impede the comparison of drug efficacy estimates in space and time, particularly in patients from high transmission settings with polyclonal infections.\n\nWe compared five different genotyping methods currently used to assess their sensitivity in detecting minority clones in polyclonal infections, their robustness, and the genetic diversity of the markers used. Our study utilized four well-characterized P. falciparum laboratory strains mixed in varying ratios, and 20 paired patient samples collected from a clinical trial.\n\nWe found that high-resolution capillary electrophoresis (H-CE) using length-polymorphic markers, as well as targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-rich markers, revealed the highest sensitivity in detecting minority clones, while also exhibiting robustness, and high genetic diversity in the used markers. Moreover, markers used by TADS gave more consistent results. We observed that microsatellites had a lower genetic diversity compared to markers such as msp1, msp2, glurp and SNP-rich markers, with some genotypes having allelic frequencies of > 30 %.\n\nThe replacement of glurp by microsatellites did not result in a change in the genotyping outcome, probably due to the lower genetic diversity of microsatellites used in comparison to glurp. More studies with large sample sizes are necessary to identify the most suitable microsatellites that could replace glurp as per the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) on genotyping to distinguish recrudescence from new infections in high transmission settings. Our study indicates that TADS should be considered the gold standard for genotyping to differentiate recrudescence from new infection and should be used to validate other techniques.",

Here we address the role of the cortical microtubules in parasite motility, invasion, and egress by utilizing a previously generated mutant (dubbed \"TKO\") in which these microtubules are destabilized in mature parasites. We found that the cortical microtubules in ~ 80% of the non-dividing (i.e. daughter-free) TKO parasites are much shorter than normal. The extent of depolymerization is further exacerbated upon commencement of daughter formation or cold treatment, but parasite replication is not affected. In a 3-D Matrigel matrix, the TKO mutant moves directionally over long distances, but along trajectories significantly more linear (i.e. less helical) than those of wild-type parasites. Interestingly, this change in trajectory does not impact either movement speed in the matrix or the speed and behavior of the parasites entry into and egress from the host cell.",

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b (hereafter H5N1) is causing vast impacts on biodiversity and poultry around the globe. In Chile it was first reported on December 7th, 2022, in a pelican (Pelecanus thagus) found dead in the northern city of Arica. In the following months, lethal H5N1 cases were reported in a wide range of wild bird species, marine mammals, backyard and industrial poultry, and in a human. Despite its high impact and spread, it is not well-known what environmental factors are associated with outbreaks. This study describes the spatio-temporal patterns of the current epizootic of H5N1 in Chile and test ecological and anthropogenic drivers that could be associated with outbreak occurrence. We used H5N1 cases reported by the Chilean national animal health authority to the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) from December 9th, 2022, to March 3rd, 2023. These included bird cases confirmed through avian influenza specific real-time PCR assay (qPCR), obtained from passive and active surveillance. Data was analyzed to detect the presence of H5N1 clusters under space-time permutation probability modelling, H5N1 association between distance and days since first outbreak through linear regression, and correlation between H5N1 presence with a range of ecological and anthropogenic variables by general linear modelling. From the 197 H5N1 identified outbreaks, involving 478 individual cases among wild and domestic birds, a wave-like steady spread of H5N1 from north to south was identified, that can help predict hotspots of outbreak risk and establish targeted preventive measures. For instance, 14 statistically significant clusters were identified, with the largest located in central Chile (18-29 km in radius) where poultry production is concentrated. Also, one of the clusters was identified in Tocopilla, location where the H5N1 human case occurred time later. In addition, the presence of H5N1 outbreaks was positively correlated with bird richness, human footprint, precipitation of the wettest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, and mean diurnal temperature. In contrast, presence of H5N1 was negatively correlated to distance to the closest urban center, precipitation seasonality and isothermality. Preventive actions based on our modeling approach include developing wildlife surveillance diagnostic capabilities in Chilean regions concentrating outbreaks. It is urgent that scientists, the poultry sector, local communities and national health authorities co-design and implement science-based measures from a One Health perspective to avoid further H5N1 spillover from wildlife to domestic animals and humans, including rapid removal and proper disposal of wild dead animals, and the closure of public areas (i.e., beaches) reporting high wildlife mortalities.",

    "abstract": "BRAF is a key member in the MAPK signaling pathway essential for cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Dysregulation or mutation of BRAF is often the underlying cause of various types of cancer. RAS, a small GTPase protein that acts upstream of BRAF, has been identified as a driver of up to one-third of all cancers. When BRAF interacts with RAS via the RAS binding domain (RBD) and membrane recruitment, BRAF undergoes a conformational change from an inactive, autoinhibited monomer to an active dimer and subsequently phosphorylates MEK to propagate the signal. BRAF domains are involved in specific functions of the regulatory mechanism, as exampled by maintenance of the autoinhibited conformation through interactions between the Cysteine Rich Domain (CRD) and the Kinase Domain (KD) of BRAF. Despite the central role of BRAF in cellular signaling, the exact order and magnitude of its activation steps has yet to be confirmed experimentally. We employed pulldown assays, open surface plasmon resonance (OpenSPR), and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to investigate the roles of the regulatory regions in BRAF activation and autoinhibition. Our results demonstrate that the BRAF specific region (BSR) and CRD play a crucial role in regulating the activity of BRAF. Moreover, we quantified the autoinhibitory binding affinities between the N-terminal domains of BRAF and the KD and revealed the individual roles of the BRAF regulatory domains. Furthermore, we quantified the relief of autoinhibition between the N-terminal domains of BRAF and the KD upon RAS binding, providing direct evidence that RAS binding initiates RAF activation. Additionally, our findings provide evidence that the BSR negatively regulates BRAF activation in a RAS isoform-specific manner and highlight the importance of considering the specific isoform pairs when developing inhibitors targeting RAF-RAS interactions. Our findings also indicate that oncogenic BRAF-KDD594G mutant has a lower affinity for the regulatory domains, implicating that pathogenic BRAF acts through decreased propensity for autoinhibition. Collectively, our study provides valuable insights into the activation mechanism of BRAF kinase and may help to guide the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels shape action potentials that propagate signals along cells. When the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold, the channels open and allow sodium ions to flow through the membrane depolarizing it, followed by the deactivation of the channels. Opening and closing of the channels is important for cellular signalling and regulates various physiological processes in muscles, heart and brain. Mechanistic insights into the voltage-gated channels are difficult to achieve as the proteins are typically extracted from membranes for structural analysis which results in the loss of the transmembrane potential. Here, we report the structural analysis of a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel, NaChBac, reconstituted in liposomes under an electrochemical gradient by cryo electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. We show that the small channel, most of the residues of which are embedded in a membrane, can be localized using a genetically fused GFP. GFP can aid the initial alignment to an average resulting in a correct structure, but does not help for the final refinement. At a moderate resolution of [~]16 [A] the structure of NaChBac in an unrestricted membrane bilayer is 10% wider than the structure of a purified protein previously solved in nanodiscs, suggesting the potential movement of the peripheral voltage-sensing domains.

    "abstract": "Cdc42 is a small Rho-type GTPase and the main regulator of cell division in eukaryotes. It is surrounded by a large network of regulatory proteins. To understand the processes around cell division, in-depth understanding of Cdc42 and its regulation is required. In vitro reconstitutions are a suitable tool for such detailed mechanistic studies, as they allow a high level of control over the conditions and components used and. For these Cdc42 and its regulators need to be expressed, purified, and tested for their activity. There are many methods described for this, but their details, possible difficulties, and points of failure are rarely discussed. This makes in vitro studies on Cdc42 less accessible to scientists that have a background different from biochemistry. We here present our experience with working with Cdc42 in vitro. We describe the recombinant expression and purification behaviour of 12 Cdc42, six Cdc42-mNeonGreenSW and four Cdc42-sfGFPSW constructs in E. coli. We explore Cdc42 dimerisation in vitro and assess its activity using GTPase Glo assays and Flag-pulldown assays. GTPase Glo assays turn out to be a reliable tool to quantitatively asses GTPase activities, wheareas pulldown experiments are more error prone. We find that most Cdc42 constructs, with the exception of those with an N-terminal Twin-Step-tag, show a similar GTPase activity and interaction with the GDP/GTP exchange factor Cdc24. We close with using enterokinase and TEV protease to generate untagged Cdc42. Enterokinase also cuts Cdc42 in an undesired position. TEV protease leads to the desired product, which retains its GTPase activity but shows a reduced Cdc24 interaction. The work presented here acts as a guide for scientists desiring to work with Cdc42 in vitro through describing Cdc42s properties in detail and examining assays that can be used to study its behaviour or act as activity checks.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@680b09org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac8f91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105b67corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8b84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@90b340_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "V-ATPases are highly conserved multi-subunit enzymes that maintain the distinct pH of eukaryotic organelles. The integral membrane a-subunit is encoded by tissue and organelle specific isoforms, and its cytosolic N-terminal domain (aNT) modulates organelle specific regulation and targeting of V-ATPases. Organelle membranes have specific phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipid enrichment linked to maintenance of organelle pH. In yeast, the aNT domains of the two a-subunit isoforms bind PIP lipids enriched in the organelle membranes where they reside; these interactions affect activity and regulatory properties of the V-ATPases containing each isoform. Humans have four a-subunit isoforms. We hypothesize that the aNT domains of the human isoforms will also bind to specific PIP lipids. The a1 and a2 isoforms of human V-ATPase a-subunits are localized to endolysosomes and Golgi, respectively. Bacterially expressed Hua1NT and Hua2NT bind specifically to endolysosomal PIP lipids PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 and Golgi enriched PI(4)P, respectively. Despite the lack of canonical PIP binding sites, potential binding sites in the HuaNT domains were identified by sequence comparisons and existing subunit structures and models. Mutations at a similar location in the distal loops of both HuaNT isoforms compromise binding to their cognate PIP lipids, suggesting that these loops encode PIP specificity of the a-subunit isoforms. These data also suggest a mechanism through which PIP lipid binding could stabilize and activate V-ATPases in distinct organelles.",

    "abstract": "Casein kinase 1 {delta} (CK1{delta}) controls essential biological processes, including circadian rhythms and Wnt signaling, but how its activity is regulated is not well understood. CK1{delta} is inhibited by autophosphorylation of its intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail. Two CK1 splice variants, {delta}1 and {delta}2, differ only in the last 16 residues of the tail and have different activity in vivo, suggesting that the extreme C-terminus (XCT) of CK1 plays a role in autoinhibition. Using NMR and HDX-MS, we show that the {delta}1 XCT is preferentially phosphorylated by the kinase and the {delta}1 tail makes more extensive interactions across the kinase domain. Mutation of {delta}1-specific XCT phosphorylation sites disrupts its interaction with the kinase domain and increases kinase activity in vitro and in cells. {delta}1 autoinhibition relies on conserved anion binding sites around the CK1 active site, demonstrating a common mode of product inhibition of CK1{delta}. These findings demonstrate how a phosphorylation cycle controls the activity of this essential kinase.",

    "abstract": "In the Neurospora circadian system, the White Collar Complex (WCC) drives expression of the principal circadian negative arm component frequency (frq). FRQ interacts with FRH (FRQ-interacting helicase) and CK-1 forming a stable complex that represses its own expression by inhibiting WCC. In this study, a genetic screen identified a gene, designated as brd-8, that encodes a conserved auxiliary subunit of the NuA4 histone acetylation complex. Loss of brd-8 reduces H4 acetylation and RNA polymerase (Pol) II occupancy at frq and other known circadian genes, and leads to a long circadian period, delayed phase, and defective overt circadian output at some temperatures. In addition to strongly associating with the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, BRD-8 is also found complexed with the transcription elongation regulator BYE-1. Expression of brd-8, bye-1, histone hH2Az, and several NuA4 subunits is controlled by the circadian clock, indicating that the molecular clock both regulates the basic chromatin status and is regulated by changes in chromatin.\n\nTaken together, our data identify new auxiliary elements of the fungal NuA4 complex having homology to mammalian components, which along with conventional NuA4 subunits, are required for timely and dynamic frq expression and thereby a normal and persistent circadian rhythm.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of tau aggregates is associated with neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies. Tau aggregates isolated from different tauopathies such as Alzheimers disease, corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy have distinct cryo-electron microscopy structures with respect to their packed fibril cores. To understand the mechanisms by which tau can be sensitized to form distinct aggregate conformations, we created a panel of tau variants encoding for individual disease-associated missense mutations in full-length 0N4R tau (wild-type and 36 mutants). We developed a high-throughput protein purification platform for direct comparison of tau variants in biochemical assays. Structural analysis of the protease-resistant core of tau aggregates formed in vitro reveals that mutations can promote aggregate core packing distinct from that produced by WT tau. Comparing aggregate structure changes with aggregation kinetic parameters for tau mutants revealed no clear linkage between these two aggregation properties. We also found that tau mutation-dependent alterations of tau aggregate structure are not readily explained by current tau fibril structure data. This is the first study to show the broad potential of tau mutations to alter the packed core structures contained within aggregated tau and sheds new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of tau aggregate structures that may drive their associated pathology in disease.",

Oncoretroviral overexpression of wildtype Hoxa1 cDNA (WT-Hoxa1), which generates both Hoxa1 isoforms, in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) perturbed hematopoiesis, resulting in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in mice. Overexpression of a mutated Hoxa1 cDNA (MUT-Hoxa1) that generates Hoxa1-FL but not Hoxa1-T led to a more severe MDS capable of transforming to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Similar to human MDS, DNA damage repair pathways were downregulated in Hoxa1-overexpressing hematopoietic progenitor cells. Conditional knock-in mouse models revealed a Hoxa1-FL dosage-dependent effect on MDS disease severity.

Loss of SPEG is associated with defective triad formation, abnormal excitation-contraction coupling, and calcium mishandling in skeletal muscles. To elucidate the underlying molecular pathways, we have utilized multi-omics tools and analysis to obtain a comprehensive view of the complex biological processes. We identified that SPEG interacts with myospryn complex proteins (CMYA5, FSD2, RyR1), and SPEG deficiency results in myospryn complex abnormalities. In addition, transcriptional and protein profiles of SPEG-deficient muscle revealed defective mitochondrial function including aberrant accumulation of enlarged mitochondria on electron microscopy. Furthermore, SPEG regulates RyR1 phosphorylation at S2902, and its loss affects JPH2 phosphorylation at multiple sites. On analyzing the transcriptome, the most dysregulated pathways affected by SPEG deficiency included extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors signaling, which may be due to defective triad and mitochondrial abnormalities. In summary, we have elucidated the critical role of SPEG in triad as it works closely with myospryn complex, phosphorylates JPH2 and RyR1, and demonstrated that its deficiency is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities.

Establishing autoimmunity in ILD impacts prognosis and treatment. ILD patients are screened for autoimmunity by assaying for anti-nuclear autoantibodies, rheumatoid factors and other non-specific tests. However, this approach has not been rigorously validated and may miss autoimmunity that manifests as autoantibodies to tissue antigens not previously defined in ILD. Here, we use Phage Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) to conduct a large, multi-center unbiased autoantibody discovery screen of ILD patients and controls. PhIP-Seq identified 17 novel autoreactive targets, and machine learning classifiers derived from these targets discriminated ILD serum from controls. Among these 17 candidates, we validated Cadherin Related Family Member 5 (CDHR5) as an autoantigen and found CDHR5 autoantibodies in patients with rheumatologic disorders and importantly, subjects not previously diagnosed with autoimmunity. Lung tissue of CDHR5 autoreactive patients showed transcriptional profiles consistent with activation of NF{kappa}B signaling and upregulation of chitotriosidase (CHIT1), a molecular pathway linked to fibrosis. Our study shows PhIP-Seq uncovers novel autoantibodies in ILD patients not revealed by standard clinical tests.

    "abstract": "The infection course of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is highly dynamic and comprises sequential stages that require damaging and crossing of several membranes to enable the translocation of the bacteria into the cytosol or their escape from the host. Many important breakthroughs such as the restriction of vacuolar and cytosolic mycobacteria by the autophagy pathway and the recruitment of sophisticated host repair machineries to the Mycobacterium-containing vacuole have been gained in the Dictyostelium discoideum/M. marinum system. Despite the availability of well-established light and advanced electron microscopy techniques in this system, a correlative approach that integrates both methodologies with almost native ultrastructural preservation is still lacking at the moment. This is most likely due to the low ability of D. discoideum to adhere to surfaces, which results in cell loss even after fixation. To address this problem, we improved the adhesion of cells and developed a straightforward and convenient workflow for 3D-correlative light and electron microscopy. This approach includes high-pressure freezing, which is an excellent technique for preserving membranes. Thus, our method allows to monitor the ultrastructural aspects of vacuole escape which is of central importance for the survival and dissemination of bacterial pathogens.",
