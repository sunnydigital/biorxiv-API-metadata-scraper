    "abstract": "Gastroenteritis causing pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) during its infection in host cells thrives in a vacuolated compartment, Salmonella Containing Vacuole (SCV), which sequentially acquires host endosomal and lysosomal markers. Long tubular structures, called as Salmonella induced filaments (SIFs), are known to be required for SCVs nutrient acquisition, membrane maintenance and stability. A tightly coordinated interactions involving prominent effector SifA and various host adapters PLEKHM1, PLEKHM2 and Rab GTPases govern SCV integrity and SIF formation. Here, we report for the first time, the functional regulation of SifA is modulated by its SUMOylation at lysine 11. S. Tm expressing lysine 11 mutant SifA (SifAK11R) is defective in intracellular proliferation due to compromised SIF formation and enhanced lysosomal acidification. Furthermore, murine competitive index experiments reveal defective in vivo proliferation and weakened virulence of SifAK11R mutant. Concisely, our results demonstrate that SUMO deficient SifA mutant nearly behaves like a SifA knockout strain which impacts PLEKHM2-M6PR mediated lysosomal acidification pathway. Thus, our results bring forth a novel S. Tm-host crosstalk mechanism involving host mediated effector SUMOylation critical for pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 represented a challenge to the treatment of COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies. Only Sotrovimab maintained partial activity, allowing it to be used in high-risk patients infected with the Omicron variant. However, the reports of resistance mutations to Sotrovimab call for efforts to better understand the intra-patient emergence of this resistance. A retrospective genomic analysis was conducted on respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who received Sotrovimab at our hospital between December 2021 and August 2022. The study involved 95 sequential specimens from 22 patients (1-12 samples/patient; 3-107 days post-infusion (Ct [&le;] 32)). Resistance mutations (in P337, E340, K356, and R346) were detected in 68% of cases; the shortest time to detection of a resistance mutation was 5 days after Sotrovimab infusion. The dynamics of resistance acquisition were highly complex, with up to 11 distinct amino acid changes in specimens from the same patient. In two patients, the mutation distribution was compartmentalized in respiratory samples from different sources. This is the first study to examine the acquisition of resistance to Sotrovimab in the BA.5 lineage, enabling us to determine the lack of genomic or clinical differences between Sotrovimab resistance in BA.5 relative to BA.1/2. Across all Omicron lineages, the acquisition of resistance delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance (40.67 vs 19.5 days). Close, real-time genomic surveillance of patients receiving Sotrovimab should be mandatory to facilitate early therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Since their discovery, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have changed our view on how organisms interact with their extracellular world. EVs are able to traffic a diverse array of molecules across different species and even domains, facilitating numerous functions. In this study, we investigate EV production in Haloferax volcanii, as representative for Euryarchaeida. We uncover that EVs enclose RNA, with specific transcripts preferentially enriched, including those with regulatory potential, and conclude that EVs can act as an RNA communication system between haloarchaea. We demonstrate the key role of an EV-associated Ras superfamily GTPase for EV formation in H. volcanii that is also present across other diverse evolutionary branches of Archaea. Ras superfamily GTPases are key players in eukaryotic intracellular vesicle formation and trafficking mechanisms that have been crucial for the emergence of Eukaryotes. Therefore, we propose that archaeal EV formation could reveal insights into the origin of the compartmentalized eukaryotic cell.",

    "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is often associated with the degeneration of human intervertebral discs (IVDs). However, the pain-inducing mechanism in degenerating discs remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified a subtype of locally residing nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs), generated by the environmental stress in degenerating discs, that triggered the onset of discogenic LBP. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human tissues showed a strong correlation between this specific pain-triggering subtype and the pain conditions in human degenerated discs. Next, we recreated this pain-triggering subtype by applying known exogenous stressors to healthy NPCs in vitro. The recreated pain phenotype activated functional sensory neurons response in vitro and induced local inflammatory responses, hyperalgesia, and mechanical sensitivity in a healthy rat IVD in vivo. Our findings provide strong evidence of a previously unknown pain-inducing mechanism mediated by NPCs in degenerating IVDs. This newly defined pathway will aid in the development of NPC-targeted therapeutic strategies for clinically unmet need to attenuate discogenic LBP.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDiscogenic low back pain can be initiated by a stress-induced subtype of nucleus pulposus cells present in human degenerating intervertebral discs",

    "abstract": "Receptor-interacting protein kinases (RIPK) -1 and -3 are master regulators of cell fate decisions in response to diverse stimuli and are subjected to multiple checkpoint controls. Earlier studies have established the presence of distinct IKK1/2 and p38/MK2-dependent checkpoints which suppress RIPK1 activation by directly phosphorylating it at different residues. In the present study, we investigated TNF-induced death in MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2)-deficient cells and show that MK2-deficiency or inactivation predominantly results in necroptotic cell death, even in the absence of caspase inhibition. While MK2-deficient cells can be rescued from necroptosis by RIPK1 inhibitors, RIPK3 inhibition seems to revert the process triggering apoptosis. To understand the mechanism of this necroptosis switch, we screened a 149-compound kinase inhibitor library for compounds which preferentially sensitize MK2-deficient MEFs to TNF-induced cell death. The most potent inhibitor identified was 5-Iodotubericidin, an adenosine analogue acting as adenosine kinase and protein kinase inhibitor. 5-ITu also potentiated LPS-induced necroptosis when combined with MK2 inhibition in RAW264.7 macrophages. Further mechanistic studies revealed that 5-Iodotubericidin induces RIPK1-dependent necroptosis in the absence of MK2 activity by suppressing IKK signaling. The identification of this role for the multitarget kinase inhibitor 5-ITu in TNF-, LPS- and chemotherapeutics-induced necroptosis will have potential implications in RIPK1-targeted therapies.",

In this study, we have developed a scalable and feeder-free method to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into endocardial cells. Importantly, we show that these endocardial cells are transcriptionally and phenotypically distinct from vascular endothelial cells and can be directed to undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) to generate cardiac valve cell populations. Following this, we identified two distinct populations--one population undergoes EndMT to become valvular interstitial cells (VICs), while the other population reinforces their endothelial identity to become valvular endothelial cells (VECs). Lastly, we confirmed the identities of our iPSC-derived cell populations and identified putative markers through transcriptomic analyses. By increasing the accessibility to these cell populations, we aim to accelerate discoveries for cardiac valve biology and disease.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, agricultural intensification and climate change have led to vegetation shifts in Europe. However, functional trade-offs linking traits responding to climate and farming practices are rarely analyzed, especially on large-scale empirical studies. Here we used a standardized yearly monitoring effort of agricultural field margin flora at the national scale to assess the spatio-temporal response of diversity and functional traits to climatic and agricultural variations. We examined temporal trends in climate (temperature, soil moisture), intensity of agricultural practices (herbicides, fertilization, margin management), plant species richness, and community-weighted means and variances of traits expected to vary both with climate and practices (e.g. seed mass, specific leaf area), across 555 sites in France between 2013 and 2021. We found that temperatures have increased while soil moisture has decreased, reflecting current climate change, whereas the intensity of agricultural practices did not show clear temporal trends over the past decade. Functional changes in plant communities were significant, showing an increase of thermophilic species with a conservative resource acquisition strategy mainly explained by climate change. The impact of agricultural practices was more limited and mainly exerted through field margin management and fertilization that shifted vegetation towards species with a ruderal syndrome. Responses to climate change differed according to crop type (vineyards versus annual crops), region (Mediterranean versus continental), and species life cycle (annual versus perennial). Our findings suggest that species adapted to climate change (including Mediterranean and conservative species) have increased in proportion. Importantly, we identified functional trade-offs indicating that these species are also the most vulnerable to intensive agricultural practices, as they are less adapted to high levels of resources and disturbances. We put these results into the conceptual framework of Grimes CSR triangle and revealed a decline of competitive and ruderal species in favor of stress-tolerant species better adapted to climate change. By choosing less intensive management, we can promote diverse communities with a wide range of CSR strategies, thereby increasing the presence of species adapted to climate change.",

    "abstract": "The eddy covariance technique has revolutionized our understanding of ecosystem-atmosphere interactions. Eddy covariance studies often use a \"paired\" tower design in which observations from nearby towers are used to understand how different vegetation, soils, hydrology, or experimental treatment shape ecosystem function and surface-atmosphere exchange. Paired towers have never been formally defined and their global distribution has not been quantified. We compiled eddy covariance tower information to find towers that could be considered paired. Of 1233 global eddy covariance towers, 692 (56%) were identified as paired by our criteria. Paired towers had cooler mean annual temperature (mean = 9.9 {degrees}C) than the entire eddy covariance network (10.5 {degrees}C) but warmer than the terrestrial surface (8.9 {degrees}C) from WorldClim 2.1, on average. The paired and entire tower networks had greater average soil nitrogen (0.57-0.58 g/kg) and more silt (36.0-36.4%) than terrestrial ecosystems (0.38 g/kg and 30.5%), suggesting that eddy covariance towers sample richer soils than the terrestrial surface as a whole. Paired towers existed in a climatic space that was more different from the global climate distribution sampled by the entire eddy covariance network, as revealed by an analysis of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, but the edaphic space sampled by the entire network and paired towers was similar. The lack of paired towers with available data across much of Africa, northern, central, southern, and western Asia, and Latin America with few towers in savannas, shrublands, and evergreen broadleaf forests point to key regions, ecosystems, and ecosystem transitions in need of additional research. Few if any paired towers study the flux of ozone and other atmospherically active trace gases at the present. By studying what paired towers measure - and what they do not - we can make infrastructural investments to further enhance the value of FLUXNET as it moves toward its fourth decade.",

Due to high linkage disequilibrium (LD), a great number of trait-associated SNPs are correlated with ERAP2 expression, however their functional mechanisms remain unidentified. We used genome editing and functional genomics to identify causal variants that remain obscured by LD. We demonstrate by reciprocal allelic replacement that ERAP2 expression is directly controlled by the genotype of splice region SNP rs2248374. However, we demonstrate that autoimmune disease-risk SNPs located near the downstream LNPEP gene promoter are independently associated with ERAP2 expression. Allele-specific conformation capture assays revealed long-range chromatin contacts between the LNPEP promoter region and the ERAP2 promoter and showed that interactions were stronger in patients carrying the alleles that increase susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Replacing the disease-associated SNPs in the LNPEP promoter by reference sequences lowered ERAP2 expression. These findings show that clustered GWAS signals associated with diverse autoimmune conditions and lethal infections act in concert to control ERAP2 expression and that disease-associated variants can convert a gene promoter region into a potent enhancer of a distal gene.",

We report complete genomic characterization of HPAI/H5N1 viruses in five species of marine mammals and seabirds (dolphins, sea lions, sanderlings, pelicans and cormorants) sampled since November 2022. All Peruvian viruses belong to the HPAI A/H5N1 lineage 2.3.4.4b, but they are 4:4 reassortants where 4 genomic segments (PA, HA, NA and MP) position within the Eurasian lineage that initially entered North America from Eurasia, while the other 4 genomic segments (PB2, PB1, NP and NS) position within the American lineage (clade C) that was already circulating in North America. These viruses are rapidly accruing mutations as they spread south.

We studied 95 pigs involved in a project on the genetic basis of PE on a 20% protein restricted diet to investigate the phenotypic connection between PE and welfare. These pigs represented natural PE variations in the population. At around 100 days, before their PE was known, we observed their behaviors. Only three pigs engaged in tail biting and manipulation of vulnerable regions, but this was not associated with PE. There was no clear link between PE and manipulating pen mates less vulnerable regions. Such behaviors are normal but can cause stress and injury if carried out excessively due to boredom or stress. Overall, pigs with higher PE showed no major behavioral abnormalities in this study. Considering the lack of genetic knowledge, the risk of increased harmful behaviors when selecting for higher PE appears low when inferred from this purely phenotypic association.",

    "abstract": "Aging elicits numerous effects that impact both musculoskeletal structure and walking function. Tendon stiffness (kT) and push-off propulsive force (FP) both impact the metabolic cost of walking and are diminished by age, yet their interaction has not been studied. We combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate whether age-related changes in function (adopting smaller FP) may be adopted to mitigate the metabolic consequences arising from changes in structure (reduced kT). We recruited 12 young adults and asked them to walk on a force-sensing treadmill while prompting them to change FP ({+/-}20% & {+/-}40% of typical) using targeted biofeedback. In models driven by experimental data from each of those conditions, we altered the kT of personalized musculoskeletal models across a physiological range (2-8% strain) and simulated individual-muscle metabolic costs for each kT and FP combination. We found that kT and FP independently affect walking metabolic cost, increasing with higher kT or as participants deviated from their typical FP. Our results show no evidence for an interaction between kT and FP in younger adults walking at fixed speeds. Individual lower body muscles showed unique effects across the kT and FP landscape. Our simulations suggest that reducing FP during walking would not mitigate the metabolic consequences of lower kT. Wearable devices and rehabilitative strategies can focus on either kT or FP to reduce age-related increases in walking metabolic cost.\n\nAuthor SummaryOur muscles and tendons are affected by aging. Tendon stiffness and push-off forces both impact the energy cost of walking, which in turn increases with age. We investigated whether age-related changes in function (less push-off force) may be adopted to mitigate the metabolic consequences arising from structural changes (lower tendon stiffness). Reducing push-off force during walking would not mitigate the metabolic consequences of lower tendon stiffness. Wearable devices and rehabilitative strategies can focus on either tendon stiffness or push off intensity to reduce age-related increases in walking metabolic cost.",

    "abstract": "STARR-seq and its variants have been widely used to characterize enhancers. However, it has been reported that up to 87% of STARR peaks are located in repressive chromatins and are not functional in the tested cells. While some of the STARR peaks in repressive chromatins might be active in other cell/tissue types, some others might be false positives. Meanwhile, many active enhancers may not be identified by the current STARR-seq methods. However, the prevalence of and underlying causes for the artifacts are not fully understood. Based on predicted cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and non-CRMs in the human genome as well as predicted active CRMs and non-active CRMs in a few human cell lines with STARR-seq data available, we reveal prevalent false positives and false negatives in STARR peaks and possible underlying causes.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a complex, debilitating and escalating health problem worldwide, impacting one in five adults. Current treatment is compromised by dose-limiting side effects including high abuse liability, loss of ability to function socially and professionally, fatigue, drowsiness, and apathy. PICK1 has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of chronic pain conditions. Here, we develop and characterize a cell-permeable fatty acid conjugated bivalent peptide inhibitor of PICK1 and assess its effects on chronic pain. The myristoylated myr-NPEG4-(HWLKV)2, (mPD5), self-assembles core-shell micelles that provide favourable pharmacodynamic properties and relieves ongoing and evoked mechanical hypersensitivity, thermal hypersensitivity as well as anxio-depressive symptoms in an inflammatory pain model following subcutaneous administration. Further, mPD5 dose-dependently relieves pain in two neuropathic pain models without affecting motor behaviour. Finally, neuropathic pain was relieved far into the chronic phase (18 weeks post SNI surgery) and while the effect of a single injection ceased after a few hours repeated administration provided pain relief lasting up to 20 hrs after last injection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe objective of this investigation was to demonstrate that in vivo induction of hypertension (HTN) and in vitro cyclic stretch of aortic VSMCs can cause SGK-1-dependent production of cytokines to promote macrophage accumulation as agents of vascular remodeling.\n\nMethodsHTN was induced in C57Bl/6 mice with AngiotensinII (AngII) infusion (1.46mg/kg/day x 21 days) with or without systemic infusion of EMD638683 (2.5mg/kg/day x 21 days), a selective SGK-1 inhibitor. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was recorded on days 0 and 21. At terminal study, abdominal aortas were harvested to quantify SGK-1 activity (pSGK-1:SGK-1) by immunoblot. Additional replicates were digested and analyzed by flow cytometry for abundance of CD11b+/F4-80+ cells (macrophages). Plasma was analyzed by ELISA to quantify IL-6 and MCP-1. Aortic VSMCs from wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to 12% biaxial cyclic stretch for 3 or 12 hours +/- EMD638683 (10M) and +/- SGK-1siRNA with subsequent QPCR for IL-6 and MCP-1 expression. Culture media was analyzed by ELISA for IL-6 and MCP-1. Aortic VSMCs from SGK-1flox+/+ mice were transfected with Cre-Adenovirus to knockout SGK-1 (SGK-1KO VSMCs) and underwent parallel tension experimentation. Computational modeling was employed to simulate VSMC signaling due to mechanical strain and AngII. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with significance at p<0.05.\n\nResultsSGK-1 activity (pSGK-1:SGK-1) was upregulated in the abdominal aorta of mice with HTN and significantly reduced by treatment with EMD638683. Concurrently, increased CD11b+/F4-80+ cells and plasma IL-6 levels in the HTN group and reduction with EMD638683 was observed. This mirrored the increased abundance of IL-6 in media from Stretch WT VSMCs, and attenuation of the effect with EMD638683. Treating WT VSMCs with SGK-1siRNA likewise inhibited IL-6 expression. MCP-1 also demonstrated increased expression and secretion into the media in WT VSMCs with Stretch. Further supporting the integral role of mechanical signaling through SGK-1, target gene expression and cytokine secretion was unchanged in SGK-1KO VSMCs with Stretch, and computer modeling confirmed SGK-1 as an intersecting node of signaling due to mechanical strain and AngII. In summation, this data suggests a biomechanical link between aortic VSMC mechanotransduction and cytokine production to promote macrophage accumulation, mediated in-part by SGK-1 activation.\n\nConclusionMechanotransduction through SGK-1 is instrumental in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and aortic macrophage accumulation in systemic HTN, therefore further investigation into targeting this kinase may present opportunities to modulate hypertensive vascular remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the brains primary immune cells, transform in response to changes in sensory or neural activity, like sensory deprivation. However, little is known about how specific frequencies of neural activity, or brain rhythms, impact microglia and cytokine signaling. Using visual noninvasive flickering sensory stimulation (flicker) to induce electrical neural activity at different frequencies, 40Hz, within the gamma band and 20Hz, within the beta band, we discovered these brain rhythms differentially affect microglial morphology and cytokine expression in healthy animals. We found that flicker induced expression of certain cytokines, including IL-10 and M-CSF, that was independent of microglia. Because NF{kappa}B is activated by synaptic activity and regulates cytokines, we hypothesized this pathway plays a causal role in frequency-specific cytokine and microglial responses. Indeed, we found that after flicker, phospho-NF{kappa}B co-labeled with neurons more than microglia. Furthermore, inhibition of NF{kappa}B signaling by a small molecule inhibitor down-regulated flicker-induced cytokine expression and attenuated flicker-induced changes in microglia morphology. These results reveal a new mechanism through which brain rhythms affect brain function by altering microglia morphology and cytokines via NF{kappa}B.\n\nTeaserFrequency-specific brain rhythms regulate cytokine expression, microglia morphology, and microglia-independent expression of M-CSF and IL10 via NF{kappa}B.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is estimated to affect 20% of the adult population, and the burden on individual patients and society caused by chronic pain is escalating. Current treatments, including opioids, anti-convulsants, and anti-depressants, are only moderately effective and limited by severe side effects and addiction liability. The inadequate state of current treatment, the chronic nature of particularly neuropathic pain, and the high impact on quality of life render chronic pain conditions relevant for gene therapy. Here, we describe the development of a self-assembling, bivalent peptide inhibitor of the pain-associated scaffold protein PICK1, delivered by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This strategy prevents mechanical allodynia in mouse inflammatory and neuropathic pain models and reverses neuropathic pain in advanced stages for an entire year. Pain relief was obtained by selective targeting of several relays along the somatosensory pain pathways without observed side effects. Importantly, full pain relief was also achieved by selective transduction of peripheral neurons, which is highly attractive for therapeutic intervention since it is less likely to cause intolerable side effects.",

    "abstract": "The mature human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer, which consists of non-covalently associated gp120 exterior and gp41 transmembrane subunits, mediates virus entry into cells. The pretriggered (State-1) Env conformation is the major target for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), whereas receptor-induced downstream Env conformations elicit immunodominant, poorly neutralizing antibody (pNAb) responses. To examine the contribution of membrane anchorage to the maintenance of the metastable pretriggered Env conformation, we compared wild-type and State-1-stabilized Envs solubilized in detergents or in styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymers. SMA directly incorporates membrane lipids and resident membrane proteins into lipid nanodiscs (SMALPs). The integrity of the Env trimer in SMALPs was maintained at both 4{degrees}C and room temperature. By contrast, Envs solubilized in Cymal-5, a non-ionic detergent, were unstable at room temperature, although their stability was improved at 4{degrees}C and after incubation with the entry inhibitor BMS-806. Envs solubilized in ionic detergents were relatively unstable at either temperature. Comparison of Envs solubilized in Cymal-5 and SMA at 4{degrees}C revealed subtle differences in bNAb binding to the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER), consistent with these distinct modes of Env solubilization. Otherwise, the antigenicity of the Cymal-5- and SMA- solubilized Envs was remarkably similar, both in the absence and presence of BMS-806. However, both solubilized Envs were recognized differently from the mature membrane Env by specific bNAbs and pNAbs. Thus, detergent-based and detergent-free solubilization at 4{degrees}C alters the pretriggered membrane Env conformation in consistent ways, indicating that loss of Env association with the membrane results in default state(s).\n\nIMPORTANCEThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins (Envs) in the viral membrane mediate virus entry into the host cell and are targeted by neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection or vaccines. Detailed studies of membrane proteins rely on purification procedures that allow the proteins to maintain their natural conformation. In this study, we show that a styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymer can extract HIV-1 Env from a membrane without the use of detergents. The Env in SMA is more stable at room temperature than Env in detergents. The purified Env in SMA maintains many but not all of the characteristics expected of the natural membrane Env. Our results underscore the importance of the membrane environment to the native conformation of HIV-1 Env. Purification methods that bypass the need for detergents could be useful tools for future studies of HIV-1 Env structure and its interaction with receptors and antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Energetic insufficiency, excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and aberrant signalling partially account for the diverse pathology of mitochondrial diseases. Whether interventions affecting ROS, a regulator of stem-cell pools, could modify somatic stem-cell homeostasis remains unknown. Previous data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutator mice showed that increased ROS leads to oxidative damage in erythroid progenitors, causing lifespan-limiting anemia. Also unclear is how ROS-targeted interventions affect terminally differentiated tissues. Here, we set out to test in mtDNA mutator mice how ubiquitous expression of the Ciona intestinalis alternative oxidase (AOX), which attenuates ROS production, affects murine stem-cell pools. We found that AOX does not affect neural stem cells but delays the progression of mutator-driven anemia. Furthermore, when combined with the mutator, AOX potentiates mitochondrial stress and inflammatory responses in skeletal muscle. These differential cell-type-specific findings demonstrate that AOX expression is not a global panacea for the cure of mitochondrial dysfunction. ROS attenuation needs to be carefully studied regarding specific underlying defects before AOX can be safely used in therapy.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530968v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17bfd6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1338f2aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc269borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14abc5e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Extracellular vesicles, especially small exosomes, have been extensively studied in connection with various diseases. In contrast, larger microvesicles are often overlooked. In this work, we compared the ability of large extracellular vesicles (lEVs) and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) to spread prions in cell culture. We utilized CAD5 cell culture model of prion infection and isolated lEVs by 20,000 x g force and sEVs by 110,000 x g force. The lEV fraction was enriched in {beta}-1 integrin with a vesicle size starting at 100 nm. The fraction of sEVs was depleted of {beta}-1 integrin with a mean size of 79 nm. Both fractions were enriched in prion protein, but the lEVs contained a higher prion-converting activity. In addition, lEV infection led to stronger prion signals in both cell cultures, as detected by cell and western blotting. These results were verified on N2a-PK1 cell culture. Our data suggest the importance of lEVs in the trafficking and spread of prions over extensively studied small EVs.",

    "abstract": "Chagas disease can lead to life-threatening cardiac manifestations that occur more frequently in geographic areas more prevalent with the TcI/II circulating genetic strains. To elucidate the differential transcriptomic signatures of the cardiomyocyte resulting from infection with TcI/II or TcVI T. cruzi strains and explore their relationships with pathogenesis, HL-1 rodent cardiomyocytes were infected with TcI/II or TcVI T. cruzi trypomastigotes. RNA was isolated serially post-infection for microarray analysis. Enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes (fold-change [&ge;]2 or [&le;] 0.5) highlighted the over-represented biological pathways. We found that Oxidative stress-related GO terms,  Hypertrophy model,  Apoptosis, and  MAPK signaling pathways (all with p<0.01) were upregulated.  Glutathione and one-carbon metabolism pathway, and  Cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process GO term (all with p <0.001) were upregulated exclusively in the cardiomyocytes infected with the TcI/II strains. Upregulation in the oxidative stress-related and hypertrophic responses are shared hallmarks with viral myocarditis, another inflammatory cardiac pathology. Nitrogen metabolism upregulation and Glutathione metabolism imbalance may implicate the relation of nitrosative stress and poor oxygen radicals scavenging in the unique pathophysiology of chagasic cardiomyopathy development.\n\nImportanceChagas disease affects more than 6 million people worldwide. One-third of those chronically infected will develop the life-threatening condition Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCM). Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), grouped based on their genetic variability into six discrete typing units (DTU), are associated with DTU-specific clinical phenotypes. The diverse genetic make-up of parasite virulence factors shall evoke unique host defense responses of variable magnitude, collectively affecting the phenotypic expression of CCM. To address this, we performed a transcriptome analysis of cardiomyocytes infected with three different T. cruzi strains each belonging to a different DTU. As a result, we were able to point out dysregulation in nitrogen metabolic processes, Glutathione, and one-carbon metabolism pathways as main features in the host response against cardiomyopathy-prone T. cruzi strains. Further research on these pathways could serve not only in the lookout for progression biomarkers but also in the lead toward the discovery of new therapeutic targets.",

A three-dimensional pore network allows cell accommodation and supports extracellular matrix (ECM) production by chondrocytes. Ligand coating and biomechanical properties of scaffolds guide regeneration of functional cartilage by mediating cell attachment and establishing the local strain environment. Poly(glycerol-dodecanedioate) (PGD) is a novel biodegradable elastomer with nonlinear-elastic properties similar to native cartilage. However, its harsh curing environments limit the feasibility of common strategies for pore creation in polymeric scaffolds. Herein, we developed porous PGD (pPGD) scaffolds with tailorable pore structures using an inverse molding method and evaluated the range of scaffold structural parameters achievable and their subsequent mechanical properties. The influence of coating PGD with various ECM ligands on the cell shape, metabolic activity, and ECM production of human articular chondrocytes (hACs) was evaluated. pPGD scaffolds were created with pore sizes ranging from 250 - 1000 m, resulting in 20 - 50% porosity. The morphology and metabolic activity of hACs on PGD were regulated by the type of ligand coating used. When compared to tissue culture plastic, PGD enhanced ECM production in monolayer cultures. Finite element analysis showed that the tensile strains that developed on the pores surfaces were at levels shown to be anabolic for hACs. The predicted strain profile varied with pore size and porosity under load, demonstrating that the pore structural parameters could be tuned to optimize cellular-level strains. These results suggest that pPGD scaffolds have the potential to guide cartilage regeneration.\n\nStatement of SignificancePrevious studies have established the importance of designing pore geometry and surface properties in engineered cartilage tissue constructs. This work reports the development and assessment of pPGD scaffolds with tunable pore and surface parameters for cartilage regeneration. The cellular-level strain that cells may experience inside the pores was influenced by the scaffolds pore geometry. Ligand coating on PGD balanced out the less ideal properties of the material itself and regulated the shape, attachment, metabolic activity, and ECM production of hACs during in vitro culture. These findings highlight how intelligent design of scaffold parameters can optimize chondrocyte function during 3D culture by tuning ligand presentation and cellular-level strain profiles.",

    "abstract": "The cellular and molecular consequences of lack of dystrophin in humans are only partially known, which is crucial for the development of new therapies aiming to slow or stop the progression Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. We analyzed muscle biopsies of DMD patients and controls using single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and correlated the results with clinical data. DMD samples displayed an increase in regenerative fibers, satellite cells and fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs) and a decrease in slow fibers and smooth muscle cells. Samples from patients with stable mild weakness were characterized by an increase in regenerative fibers, while those from patients with progressive weakness had fewer muscle fibers and increased FAPs. DMD muscle fibers displayed a strong regenerative signature, while DMD FAPs upregulated genes producing extracellular matrix and molecules involved in several signaling pathways. An analysis of intercellular communication profile identified FAPs as a key regulator of cell signaling in DMD samples. We show significant differences in the gene expression profiled of the different cell populations present in DMD muscle samples compared to controls.",

    "abstract": "Non-natural amino acids are increasingly used as building blocks in the development of peptide-based drugs, as they expand the available chemical space to tailor function, half-life and other key properties. However, while the chemical space of modified amino acids (mAAs) is potentially vast, experimental methods for measuring the developability properties of mAA-containing peptides are expensive and time consuming. To facilitate developability programs through computational methods, we present CamSol-PTM, a method that enables the fast and reliable sequence-based prediction of the solubility of mAA-containing peptides. From a computational screening of 50,000 mAA-containing variants of three peptides, we selected five different mAAs for a total number of 30 peptide variants for experimental validation. We demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions by comparing the calculated and experimental solubility values. Our results indicate that the computational screening of mAA-containing peptides can extend by over four orders of magnitude the ability to explore the solubility chemical space of peptides.

    "abstract": "The neural activity patterns associated with advanced cognitive processes are characterized by a high degree of collective organization, which raises the question of whether macroscopic quantum phenomena play a significant role in cortical dynamics. In order to pursue this question and scrutinize the feasibility of macroscopic quantum coherence in the brain, a model is developed regarding the functioning of microcolumns, which are the basic functional units of the cortex. This model assumes that the operating principle of a microcolumn relies on the interaction of a pool of neurotransmitter (glutamate) molecules with the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, termed zero-point field (ZPF). Quantitative calculations reveal that the coupling strength of the glutamate pool to the resonant ZPF modes lies in the critical regime in which the criterion for the initiation of a phase transition is fulfilled, driving the ensemble of initially independent molecules toward a coherent state and resulting in the formation of a coherence domain that extends across the full width of a microcolumn. The formation of a coherence domain turns out to be an energetically favored state shielded by a considerable energy gap that protects the collective state against thermal perturbations and entails decoherence being greatly slowed down. These findings suggest that under the special conditions encountered in cortical microcolumns the emergence of macroscopic quantum phenomena is feasible. This conclusion is further corroborated by the insight that the presence of a coherence domain gives rise to downstream effects which may be crucial for the cortical communication and the formation of large-scale activity patterns. Taken together, the presented model sheds new light on the fundamental mechanism underlying cortical dynamics and suggests that long-range synchronization in the brain results from a bottom-up orchestration process involving the ZPF.",

    "abstract": "A persistent mystery in the melanoma field has been the function of one of the first melanoma tumor antigens characterized, namely p97 (melanotransferrin; MTf). While MTf expression increases melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanism responsible is unknown. On the other hand, N-myc down-stream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a potent metastasis suppressor and WNT antagonist. Expression of NDRG1 in melanoma cells suggests a role in inhibiting metastasis, with this study investigating MTfs role in oncogenic signaling. We demonstrate MTf acts as a pro-oncogenic WNT agonist, which down-regulates NDRG1, while silencing MTf increases NDRG1 expression. In contrast, silencing NDRG1 increases MTf expression. These observations demonstrate a bidirectional negative feedback loop and \"Yin-Yang\" relationship between MTf and NDRG1. Mechanistically, MTf was directly associated with the WNT co-receptor, lipoprotein-receptor 6 (LRP6), and increased total LRP6 expression, activated p-LRP6 (Ser1490), {beta}-catenin, and activated {beta}-catenin (Ser552) levels, with MTf expression inducing their nuclear accumulation. Additionally, MTf expression increased downstream WNT targets, namely cyclin D1 and c-Myc, with c-Myc down-regulating NDRG1 expression. Silencing c-Myc prevented the Yin-Yang relationship between NDRG1 and MTf, indicating c-Myc played a key role in their inverse regulation. Melanoma patient specimens demonstrated that a low NDRG1/MTf ratio was significantly (p = 0.008) associated with lower survival and metastasis. Chemotherapeutic agents that up-regulated NDRG1 depressed MTf and nuclear LRP6 and potently inhibited melanoma xenograft growth in vivo. This study demonstrates MTf acts as a WNT agonist, with a Yin-Yang relationship being observed with the WNT antagonist, NDRG1.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are infected with the whipworm Trichuris trichiura. Novel treatments are urgently needed as current drugs, such as albendazole, have relatively low efficacy. We have investigated whether drugs approved for other human diseases could be repurposed as novel anti-whipworm drugs. In a previous comparative genomics analysis, we identified 409 drugs approved for human use that we predicted to target parasitic worm proteins. Here we tested these ex vivo by assessing motility of adult worms of Trichuris muris, the murine whipworm, an established model for human whipworm research. We identified 14 compounds with EC50 values of[&le;] 50 M against T. muris ex vivo, and selected nine for testing in vivo. However, the best worm burden reduction seen in mice was just 19%. The high number of ex vivo hits against T. muris shows that we were successful at predicting parasite proteins that could be targeted by approved drugs. In contrast, the low efficacy of these compounds in mice suggest challenges due to their chemical properties (e.g. lipophilicity, polarity, molecular weight) and pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) that may (i) promote absorption by the host gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing availability to the worms embedded in the large intestine, and/or (ii) restrict drug uptake by the worms. This indicates that identifying structural analogues that have reduced absorption by the host, and increased uptake by worms, may be necessary for successful drug repurposing against whipworms. Therefore, we recommend that prior to in vivo studies, future researchers first assess drug absorption by the host, for example, using human intestinal organoids or cell lines, and drug uptake by whipworms using intestinal organoids infected with T. muris.",

    "abstract": "An essential adaptive strategy in insects is the evolution of olfactory receptors (ORs) to recognize important volatile environmental chemical cues. Our model species, Ceratosolen fusciceps, a specialist wasp pollinator of Ficus racemosa, likely possesses an OR repertoire that allows it to distinguish fig-specific volatiles in highly variable environments. Using a newly assembled genome-guided transcriptome, we annotated 63 ORs in the species and reconstructed the phylogeny of Ceratosolen ORs in conjunction with other hymenopteran species. Expression analysis showed that though ORs were mainly expressed in the antennae, 20 percent were also expressed in non-antennal tissues such as the head, thorax, abdomen, legs, wings, and ovipositor. Specific upregulated expression was observed in OR30C in the head and OR60C in the wings. We identified OR expression from all major body parts of C. fusciceps, suggesting novel roles of ORs throughout the body. Further examination of OR expression of C. fusciceps in widely separated geographical locations, i.e., south (urban) and northeast (rural) India, revealed distinct OR expression levels in different locations. This discrepancy likely parallels the observed variation in fig volatiles between these regions and provides new insights into the evolution of insect ORs and their expression across geographical locations and tissues.",
