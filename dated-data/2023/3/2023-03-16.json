    "abstract": "Bidirectional flow of information shapes the outcome of the host-pathogen interactions and depends on the genetics of each organism. Recent work has begun to use co-transcriptomic studies to shed light on this bidirectional flow, but it is unclear how plastic the co-transcriptome is in response to genetic variation in both the host and pathogen. To study co-transcriptome plasticity, we conducted transcriptomics using natural genetic variation in the pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, and large effect genetic variation abolishing defense signaling pathways within the host, Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that genetic variation in the pathogen has a greater influence on the co-transcriptome than mutations that abolish defense signaling pathways in the host. Genome wide association mapping using the pathogens genetic variation and both organisms transcriptomes allowed an assessment of how the pathogen modulates plasticity in response to the host. This showed that the differences in both organisms responses were linked to trans-eQTL hotspots within the pathogens genome. These hotspots control gene sets in either the host or pathogen and show differential allele sensitivity to the hosts genetic variation rather than qualitative host specificity. Interestingly, nearly all the trans-eQTL hotspots were unique to the host or pathogen transcriptomes. In this system of differential plasticity, the pathogen mediates the shift in the co-transcriptome more than the host.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the RNA/DNA-binding proteins FUS and TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with distinct neuropathological features. It is currently unclear how these gene mutations lead to selective motor neuron death and if there are common mechanisms across disease causations. Using single cell RNA sequencing of neurons derived from isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell lines, we demonstrate that motor neurons harbouring FUS P525L or FUS R495X mutations show a 4.9- to 15.5-fold larger transcriptional response than interneurons. About 20% of transcripts were coregulated across FUS mutations in motor neurons and about half of these were caused by FUS gain-of-function. Comparison with TDP-43 M337V motor neurons, identified common mitochondrial dysfunction across gene mutations. Metabolic assessment confirmed a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and ATP turnover in mutant FUS and TARDBP motor neurons and live cell microscopy revealed impaired mitochondrial motility across ALS motor axons. Thus, we have identified early mitochondrial dysfunction in motor neurons shared across ALS-causative mutations, that could have major implications for their survival and which could be targeted therapeutically.",

Nevertheless, the pathological processes associated with spore ingestion and germination remain poorly understood. Here, we show that while ingestion of vegetative bacteria leads to their elimination from the midgut and small intestines of Drosophila and mice, respectively, a single ingestion of spores leads to the persistence of bacteria for at least 10 days. Using Drosophila genetics, we demonstrate that spores escape the innate immune response of the anterior midgut. Once in the posterior midgut, spores germinate, and the vegetative cells dampen the immune signaling through the induction of amidases which are negative regulators of the immune response. This study provides evidence for how B. cereus spores hijack the intestinal immune defenses allowing the localized birth of vegetative bacteria responsible for the digestive symptoms associated with foodborne illness outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Immunological control of viral infection in the brain is essential for immediate protection, but also for long-term maintenance of brain integrity. As the primary resident immune cell of the brain, microglia protect against viral infections through key macrophage functions, including release of the antiviral type I interferons (IFN-I) and clearance of infected cells. Microglia express the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which can bind viral DNA leading to signaling through stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and downstream immune activation. Here we report that herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 infection of microglia leads to activation of IFN-I genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, HSV1 also down-regulated expression of a subset of genes, including genes in the pathway engaged by the microglial receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2). Knockdown experiments revealed that TREM2 is important for viral activation of cGAS-STING signaling in microglia, induction of IFN-I, and phagocytosis of HSV1 infected neurons. Consequently, TREM2 depletion increased susceptibility to HSV1 infection in human microglia-neuron co-cultures and mice in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that TREM2 is essential for phosphorylation of STING, and downstream activation of the IFN-inducing transcription factor IRF3. We conclude that TREM2 is a novel component of the antiviral immune response in microglia, crucial for immediate host defense against HSV1 in the brain. Since both TREM2 loss-of-function mutations and HSV1 serological status are linked to development of Alzheime[r]s disease (AD), this work opens the question whether defects in TREM2 could predispose to impaired viral clearance and post-infection pathological neurological changes.",

We present a highly-sensitive metaproteomic workflow using the extra information captured by Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation (PASEF) technology. The comparison of different acquisition modes and data analysis software packages showed that DIA-PASEF and DIA-NN doubled protein identifications of mouse gut microbiota and, importantly, also of the host proteome. DIA-PASEF significantly improved peptide detection reproducibility and quantification accuracy, which resulted in more than twofold identified taxa, reaching depths comparable to metagenomic studies. Consequently, DIA-PASEF exhibited improved coverage of functional networks revealing 131 additional pathways compared to DDA-PASEF. We applied our optimized workflow to a pre-clinical mouse model of chronic pain, in which we deciphered novel host-microbiome interactions. In summary, we present here a metaproteomic approach that paves the way for increasing the functional characterization of microbiome ecosystems and is applicable to diverse fields of biological research.",

    "abstract": "As one of main causes of athrogenic contracture, joint capsule fibrosis which is described as a condition with excessive deposition of collagen components and extracellular matrix (ECM) in joint capsule, is a response to long-time immobilization. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect and the underlying mechanism of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) in treating knee joint capsule fibrosis. A rabbit model of knee joint capsule fibrosis induced by 6w-immobilization was employed in this study. The degree of knee joint capsule fibrosis was assessed by measurement of arthrogenic contracture and Masson-staining. Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured to assess the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Apart from these, the activation of TGF-{beta}1/Smad signaling pathway was determined through western blot analysis contained TGF-{beta}1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, p-Smad3 and Smad4, and immunohistochemical staining for p-Smad2/3 positive cells. After 6 wk-immobilization, the degree of arthrogenic contracture and the collagen density were increased. Moreover, the activity of MDA was upregulated and the content of SOD was downregulated. Correspondingly, the TGF-{beta}1/Smad signaling pathway was significantly activated. After 2 wk-LIPUS treatment, the degree of arthrogenic contracture and the collagen density were lower than 2 wk-remobilizaiton. Relatively, the activity of MDA was decresed and the content of SOD was increased compared with 2 wk-remobilizaiton. Importantly,the TGF-{beta}1/Smad signaling pathway was significantly inhibited compared with 2 wk-remobilizaiton. Our findings thus conclude that high level ROS and hyperactive TGF-{beta}1/Smad signaling pathway might be one of the causes of knee joint capsule fibrosis induced by immobilization and LIPUS attenuated the severity of immobilization-induced knee joint capsule fibrosis through inhibition of the production of ROS and the activation of TGF-{beta}1/Smad signaling pathway. Our findings might provide a theoretical basis for knee joint capsule fibrosis after immobilization and provide the potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Discovering determinants of cardiomyocyte maturity and the maintenance of differentiated states is critical to both understanding development and potentially reawakening endogenous regenerative programs in adult mammalian hearts as a therapeutic strategy. Here, the RNA binding protein Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) was identified as a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiated states and their regenerative potential through transcriptome-wide control of RNA stability. Targeted MBNL1 overexpression early in development prematurely transitioned cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic growth, hypoplasia, and dysfunction, whereas loss of MBNL1 function increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and proliferation through altered cell cycle inhibitor transcript stability. Moreover, MBNL1-dependent stabilization of the estrogen-related receptor signaling axis was essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte maturity. In accordance with these data, modulating MBNL1 dose tuned the temporal window of cardiac regeneration, where enhanced MBNL1 activity arrested myocyte proliferation, and MBNL1 deletion promoted regenerative states with prolonged myocyte proliferation. Collectively these data suggest MBNL1 acts as a transcriptome-wide switch between regenerative and mature myocyte states postnatally and throughout adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive translation is a widespread phenomenon that plays an important role in de novo gene birth; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Based on multiple Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-Seq) datasets, we investigated the RiboSeq landscape of coding and noncoding regions of yeast. Therefore, we developed a representation framework which allows the visual representation and rational classification of the entire diversity of Ribo-Seq signals that could be observed in yeast. We show that if coding regions are restricted to specific areas of the Ribo-Seq landscape, noncoding regions are associated with a wide diversity of translation signals and, conversely, populate the entire yeast Ribo-Seq landscape. Specifically, we reveal that noncoding regions are associated with canonical translation signals, but also with non-canonical ones absent from coding regions, and which appear to be a hallmark of pervasive translation. Notably, we report thousands of translated noncoding ORFs among which, 251 led to detectable products with Mass Spectrometry while being characterized by a wide range of translation specificities. Overall, we show that pervasive translation is not random with noncoding ORF translation signals being consistent across Ribo-Seq experiments. Finally, we show that the translation signal of noncoding ORFs is not explained by features related to the emergence of function, but rather determined by the translation start codon and the codon distribution in their two alternative frames. Overall, our results enable us to propose a topology of the pervasive Ribo-Seq landscape of a species, and open the way to future comparative analyses of this translation landscape under different conditions.",

    "abstract": "Herbivorous insects are exceptionally diverse, accounting for a quarter of all known eukaryotic species, but the genetic basis of adaptations that enabled this dietary transition remains poorly understood. Many studies have suggested that expansions and contractions of chemosensory and detoxification gene families - genes directly mediating interactions with plant chemical defenses - underlie successful plant colonization. However, this hypothesis has been challenging to test because the origins of herbivory in many lineages are ancient (>150 million years ago [mya]), obscuring genomic evolutionary patterns. Here, we characterized chemosensory and detoxification gene family evolution across Scaptomyza, a genus nested within Drosophila that includes a recently derived (<15 mya) herbivore lineage of mustard (Brassicales) specialists and carnation (Caryophyllaceae) specialists, and several non-herbivorous species. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that herbivorous Scaptomyza have among the smallest chemosensory and detoxification gene repertoires across 12 drosophilid species surveyed. Rates of gene turnover averaged across the herbivore clade were significantly higher than background rates in over half of the surveyed gene families. However, gene turnover was more limited along the ancestral herbivore branch, with only gustatory receptors and odorant binding proteins experiencing strong losses. The genes most significantly impacted by gene loss, duplication, or changes in selective constraint were those involved in detecting compounds associated with feeding on plants (bitter or electrophilic phytotoxins) or their ancestral diet (yeast and fruit volatiles). These results provide insight into the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of plant-feeding adaptations and highlight strong gene candidates that have also been linked to other dietary transitions in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is a major environmental variable influencing the distribution and behavior of plants. Recent advances have led to the identification of a role for the circadian clock in sensing temperature in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elongation growth and flowering are accelerated at warmer temperatures, and these effects are mediated by the circadian clock gene EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). ELF3 exists with a tripartite protein complex called the Evening Complex (EC) that functions as a DNA transcription repressor targeting growth-related genes. ELF3, a large scaffold protein with disordered domains, binds to the transcription factor LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX) and ELF4 to form the EC. A crucial feature of ELF3 is that it acts as a highly sensitive thermosensor that responds directly and rapidly to small increases of temperature of about 5 {o}C and is rapidly reversible. At temperatures of about 22 {o}C and below, the EC is active, binding and repressing the promoters of multiple growth promoting genes, reducing their expression and cell elongation. At around 27 {o}C and above ELF3 undergoes rapid and reversible phase change and protein condensate formation. This temperature-dependent activity causes EC occupancy on target genes to decrease at 27 {o}C, allowing their increased expression. A C-terminal prion-like domain (PrD) is sufficient for ELF3 phase change and temperature responsiveness. The PrD region contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat of variable length, the size of which has been found to modulate the thermal responsiveness as measured by hypocotyl (stem) elongation and condensate formation. How the PrD is able to respond to temperature is however poorly understood. To understand the underlying biophysical basis for ELF3 thermal responsiveness, we use a polymer chain growth approach to build large ensembles and characterize monomeric ELF3-PrD at a range of polyQ lengths and temperatures. We then explore temperature-dependent dynamics of wild-type ELF3-PrD, ELF3-PrD with the variable polyQ tract removed, and a mutant (F527A) using chain growth structures as initial conformations for replica exchange (REST2) simulations. In addition to different mechanisms of temperature sensing with and without the variable polyQ tract, we find increased solvent accessibility of expanded polyQ tracts, promotion of temperature-sensitive helices adjacent to polyQ tracts, and exposure of a cluster of aromatic residues at increased temperature, all three of which promote inter-protein interaction. These results suggest a set of potential design principles for the engineering of temperature dependent molecular interactions. This has considerable potential for biotechnological application in medicine and agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Polypeptide chains experiences mechanical tension while translocating through cellular tunnel. In this scenario, interaction of tunnel-associated chaperones with the emerging polypeptide occurs under force; however, this force-regulated chaperone behaviour is not fully understood.\n\nWe studied the mechanical chaperone activity of two tunnel-associated chaperones BiP and ERdj3 both in the absence and presence of force; and compared to their respective cytoplasmic homologs DnaK and DnaJ. We found that BiP/ERdj3 shows strong foldase activity under force; whereas their cytoplasmic homolog DnaK/DnaJ behave as holdase. Importantly, these tunnel-associated chaperones (BiP/ERdj3) revert to holdase in the absence of force, suggesting that mechanical chaperone activity differs depending on the presence or absence of force. This tunnel-associated chaperone-driven folding event generates additional mechanical energy of up to 54 zJ that could help protein translocation. The mechanical-chaperone behaviour can be explained by strain theory: chaperones with higher intrinsic deformability function as mechanical foldase (BiP, ERdj3), while chaperones with lower intrinsic deformability act as holdase (DnaK and DnaJ). Our study thus unveils the underlying mechanism of mechanically regulated chaperoning activity and provides a novel mechanism of co-translocational protein folding.\n\nSignificanceThe mechanical-activity of chaperones, located at the edge of a tunnel, could be different from their cytoplasmic homologs. Translocating substrates within the tunnel are known to experience mechanical constraints, whereas the cytosolic substrates interact with the chaperones in the absence of force.\n\nTo understand this phenomenon, we investigated two tunnel-associated chaperones BiP/ERdj3 and their cytosolic homologs-DnaK/DnaJ. We observed that BiP/ERdj3 possess strong foldase activity while their substrates are under force; whereas DnaK/DnaJ possess holdase function. Notably all these chaperones function as holdase in the absence of force, which suggest that mechanical chaperone activity is different with and without force. We explained this mechanical behaviour using strain theory, providing a physical mechanism of chaperone-assisted co-translocational protein folding.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of resistance remains one of the primary challenges for modern medicine from infectious diseases to cancers. Many of these resistance-conferring mutations often carry a substantial fitness cost in the absence of treatment. As a result, we would expect these mutants to undergo purifying selection and be rapidly driven to extinction. Nevertheless, pre-existing resistance is frequently observed from drug-resistant malaria to targeted cancer therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma. Solutions to this apparent paradox have taken several forms from spatial rescue to simple mutation supply arguments. Recently, in an evolved resistant NSCLC cell line, we found that frequency-dependent ecological interactions between ancestor and mutant ameliorate the cost of resistance in the absence of treatment. Here, we hypothesize that frequency-dependent ecological interactions in general may play a major role in the prevalence of pre-existing resistance. We combine numerical simulations with robust analytical approximations to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for studying the effects of frequency-dependent ecological interactions on the evolutionary dynamics of pre-existing resistance. First, we find that ecological interactions significantly expand the parameter regime under which we expect to observe pre-existing resistance. Even when positive ecological interactions between mutants and ancestors are rare, these clones provide the primary mode of evolved resistance because their positive interaction leads to significantly longer extinction times. Next, we find that even in the case where mutation supply is sufficient to predict pre-existing resistance, frequency-dependent ecological forces still contribute a strong evolutionary pressure that selects for increasingly positive ecological effects. Finally, we genetically engineer several of the most common clinically observed resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies in NSCLC, a treatment notorious for pre-existing resistance, and where our theory predicts positive ecological interactions to be common. We find that all three engineered mutants display a positive ecological interaction with their ancestor, as predicted. Strikingly, as with our originally evolved resistant mutant, two of the three engineered mutants have ecological interactions that fully compensate for their substantial fitness costs. As a whole, these results suggest that frequency-dependent ecological effects may provide the primary mode by which pre-existing resistance emerges.",

    "abstract": "Chemodiversity is a fundamental trait acquired by plants during their lands colonization. This resulted from an evolutionary process leading to the increase in the number of homologues from a distinct set of protein superfamilies, many of them associated to the specialized metabolism, which allowed the expansion of the chemical space to cope with several environmental cues. BAHD acyltransferases are among these important superfamilies, catalyzing a reaction leading to the acylation of acceptor metabolites with Coenzyme A-activated donors. BAHD acyltransferases can use a wide variety of substrates and they often times display substrate permissiveness towards a wide variety of substrates. Together, these factors complicates the reliable identification and functional annotation of BAHD homologues, also due to the (relatively) limited amount of biochemical data on BAHD acyltransferases. In this work, we take a phylogenomics and computational approach to study the BAHD superfamily in land plants. Using a clustered training set with 27 proteomes, followed by the classification of additional 191 proteomes, we obtained a final BAHDome with 15607 homologues. The training set was clustered in 16 groups, that, together with the identification of cluster of orthologues from the complete BAHDome, were partially assigned functionally to different families guided by the characterized activities (in terms of metabolites used) present in each group. However, the function assignation was not direct in several cases, due to large sequence number, taxonomical distribution on the group, and high sequence variability intra-group. Finally, we used the different families (and functional subfamilies) identified to detect specificity determining positions (SDPs), that may account to explain the functional diversity by finding key positions in, for example, substrate interaction. However, only a handful of the SDPs identified in this work are linked to the substrate binding pocket. Together, these results allow to partially annotate functional BAHD families, which have evolved in a complex pattern of taxonomical and functional signals to allow interaction with multiple substrates, more likely associated to protein dynamics rather than direct substrate interaction.",
