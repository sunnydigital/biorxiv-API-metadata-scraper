    "abstract": "Nuclear processes depend on the organization of chromatin, whose basic units are cylinder-shaped complexes called nucleosomes. A subset of mammalian nucleosomes in situ (inside cells) resembles the canonical structure determined in vitro 25 years ago. Nucleosome structure in situ is otherwise poorly understood. Using cryo-ET and 3-D classification analysis of budding yeast cells, here we find that canonical nucleosomes account for less than 10% of total nucleosomes expected in situ. In a strain in which H2A-GFP is the sole source of histone H2A, class averages that resemble canonical nucleosomes both with and without GFP densities are found ex vivo (in nuclear lysates), but not in situ. These data suggest that the budding yeast intranuclear environment favors multiple non-canonical nucleosome conformations. Using the structural observations here and the results of previous genomics and biochemical studies, we propose a model in which the average budding yeast nucleosomes DNA is partially detached in situ.",

    "abstract": "Coastal lagoons are an important habitat for endemic and threatened species in California that have suffered impacts from urbanization and increased drought. Environmental DNA has been promoted as a way to aid in the monitoring of biological communities, but much remains to be understood on the biases introduced by different protocols meant to overcome challenges presented by unique systems under study. Turbid water is one methodologic challenge to eDNA recovery in these systems as it quickly clogs filters, preventing timely processing of samples. We investigated biases in community composition produced by two solutions to overcome slow filtration due to turbidity: freezing of water prior to filtration (for storage purposes and long-term processing), and use of sediment (as opposed to water samples). Bias assessments of community composition in downstream eDNA analysis was conducted for two sets of primers, 12S (fish) and 16S (bacteria and archaea). Our results show that freezing water prior to filtration had different effects on community composition for each primer, especially for the 16S, when using a filter of larger pore size (3 m). Nevertheless, pre-freezing water samples can still be a viable alternative for storage and processing of turbid water samples when focusing on fish communities (12S). The use of sediment samples as an alternative to processing water samples should be done with caution, and at minimum the number of biological replicates and/or volume sampled should be increased.",

    "abstract": "Tropical forests are a major component of the global carbon cycle and home to two-thirds of terrestrial species. Upper-canopy trees store the majority of forest carbon and can be vulnerable to drought events and storms. Monitoring their growth and mortality is essential to understanding forest resilience to climate change, but in the context of forest carbon storage, large trees are underrepresented in traditional field surveys, so estimates are poorly constrained. Aerial photographs provide spectral and textural information to discriminate between tree crowns in diverse, complex tropical canopies, potentially opening the door to landscape monitoring of large trees. Here we describe a new deep convolutional neural network method, Detectree2, which builds on the Mask R-CNN computer vision framework to recognise the irregular edges of individual tree crowns from airborne RGB imagery. We trained and evaluated this model with 3,797 manually delineated tree crowns at three sites in Malaysian Borneo and one site in French Guiana. As an example application, we combined the delineations with repeat lidar surveys (taken between 3 and 6 years apart) of the four sites to estimate the growth and mortality of upper-canopy trees. Detectree2 delineated 65,000 upper-canopy trees across 14 km2 of aerial images. The skill of the automatic method in delineating unseen test trees was good (F1 score = 0.64) and for the tallest category of trees was excellent (F1 score = 0.74). As predicted from previous field studies, we found that growth rate declined with tree height and tall trees had higher mortality rates than intermediate-size trees. Our approach demonstrates that deep learning methods can automatically segment trees in widely accessible RGB imagery. This tool (provided as an open-source Python package) has many potential applications in forest ecology and conservation, from estimating carbon stocks to monitoring forest phenology and restoration.\n\nPython package available to install at https://github.com/PatBall1/Detectree2",

    "abstract": "Plant viruses account for enormous agricultural losses worldwide, and the most effective way to combat them is to identify genetic material conferring plant resistance to these pathogens. Aiming to identify genetic associations with responses to infection, we screened a large panel of Arabidopsis thaliana natural inbred lines for four disease-related traits caused by infection by A. thaliana-naive and -adapted isolates of the natural pathogen turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). We detected a strong, replicable association in a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 2 with a 10-fold increase in relative risk of systemic necrosis. The region contains several plausible causal genes as well as abundant structural variation, including an insertion of a Copia transposon into a Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR-NBS-LRR) coding for a gene involved in defense, that could be either a driver or a consequence of the disease-resistance locus. When inoculated with TuMV, loss-of-function mutant plants of this gene exhibited different symptoms than wild-type plants, being the magnitude and sign of the difference dependent on the degree of adaptation of the viral isolate to A. thaliana. This increase in symptoms severity was specific for infections with the adapted isolate. Necrosis-associated alleles are found worldwide, and their distribution is consistent with a trade-off between resistance during viral outbreaks and a cost of resistance otherwise, leading to negative frequency-dependent selection.",

    "abstract": "Bone is highly susceptible to cancer metastasis, and both tumour and bone cells enable tumour invasion through a \"vicious cycle\" of biochemical signalling. Tumor metastasis into bone also alters biophysical cues to both tumour and bone cells, which are highly sensitive to their mechanical environment. However, the mechanobiological feedback between these cells that perpetuates this cycle has not been studied. Here, we develop highly novel in vitro and computational models to provide an advanced understanding of how tumor growth is regulated by the synergistic influence of tumour-bone cell signaling and mechanobiological cues. In particular, we develop the first multicellular healthy and metastatic bone models, which can account for physiological mechanical signals within a custom bioreactor. These models successfully recapitulated mineralization, mechanobiological responses, osteolysis and metastatic activity. Ultimately we demonstrate that mechanical stimulus provided protective effects against tumor-induced osteolysis, confirming the importance of mechanobiological factors in bone metastasis development.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of neuromodulators are essential for their functions. Optical sensors have transformed the study of neuromodulators because they capture neuromodulator dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, fluorescence intensity-based sensors are restricted to measure acute changes within one animal over a short period because intensity varies with sensor expression level and excitation light fluctuation. In contrast, fluorescence lifetime is impervious to sensor expression level or excitation light power, allowing comparison between individuals and across long periods. Here, we discover fluorescence lifetime response in multiple intensity-based neuromodulator sensors. Using the acetylcholine sensor GRABACh3.0 to investigate the power of lifetime measurement, we find that fluorescence lifetime correlates with animal behavior states accurately despite varying excitation power or changes in sensor expression level across weeks and animals. Thus, fluorescence lifetime of neuromodulator sensors enables comparison of neuromodulator dynamics at high resolution between animals and for chronic time scales.",

    "abstract": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has caused recurring respiratory disease outbreaks in the United States since 2014. The dominant circulating EV-D68 strain has evolved from clade B1 to the more recent B2 and B3 clades. As recurrent outbreaks and continued virus evolution are expected for EV-D68, a robust real-time PCR assay that detects known strains as well as potential emerging strains is critical for national surveillance and clinical diagnostics. We describe a type-specific EV-D68 real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay termed CDC2022, which targets sequences encoding conserved amino acid regions of all extant EV-D68 strains. We targeted three motifs conserved among all strains in the last 60 years. The assay achieved 100% (270/270) sensitivity and 100% (344/344) specificity when tested with a collection of 613 respiratory specimens, compared to the gold-standard EV semi-nested VP1 PCR and sequencing assay (snPCR/Seq). CDC2022 gave negative results with 289/289 non-target viruses, including 104 EV A-D isolates, 165 rhinovirus (RV) isolates or clinical specimens, and 14 other common respiratory viruses. The assay can detect as few as 0.28 CCID50 per reaction. An in silico \"phylo-primer-mismatch\" analysis was performed to visualize primer/probe mismatches and to compare CDC2022 with other EV-D68 rRT-PCR assays, including the previous CDC assay (CDC2015) developed in 2014 for clade B1 strains. It showed that CDC2022 has the fewest primer/probe mismatches among all assays analyzed and is suitable for all clades. We additionally tested 11 EV-D68-positive clinical specimens from 2022 that were confirmed by snPCR/Seq, and all were detected. CDC2022 assay could provide a critical tool for molecular surveillance of EV-D68.",

    "abstract": "Responding rapidly to visual stimuli is fundamental for many animals. For example, predatory birds and insects alike have amazing target detection abilities, with incredibly short neural and behavioral delays, enabling efficient prey capture. Similarly, looming objects need to be rapidly avoided to ensure immediate survival, as these could represent approaching predators. Male Eristalis tenax hoverflies are non-predatory, highly territorial insects, that perform high-speed pursuits of conspecifics and other territorial intruders. During the initial stages of the pursuit the retinal projection of the target is very small, but grows to a larger object before physical interaction. Supporting such behaviors, E. tenax and other insects have both target-tuned and loom-sensitive neurons in the optic lobes and the descending pathways. We here show that these visual stimuli are not necessarily encoded in parallel. Indeed, we describe a class of descending neurons that respond to small targets, to looming and to widefield stimuli. We show that these neurons have two distinct receptive fields where the dorsal receptive field is sensitive to the motion of small targets and the ventral receptive field responds to larger objects or widefield stimuli. Our data suggest that the two receptive fields have different pre-synaptic input, where the inputs are not linearly summed. This novel and unique arrangement could support different behaviors, including obstacle avoidance, flower landing, target pursuit or capture.\n\nSignificance StatementIf you are playing baseball, when the ball is far away, it appears as a very small object on your retina. However, as the ball gets closer, its image becomes a rapidly expanding object. Here, we show that within the hoverfly visual system, a single neuron could respond to both of these images. Indeed, we found a class of descending neurons with dual sensitivity, separated into two distinct parts of the visual field. The neurons have a more dorsal receptive field that is sensitive to small targets and a more ventral receptive field that is sensitive to larger objects.",

QSMs are topological ordered cylinder models of trees which describe the branching structure up to the tips. All new invented parameters have in common, that their defining point of view looks from the direction of the tips and not from the root along the tree.\n\nMethodsWe use new allometric power functions to predict the radius from the invented parameters. Then we improve the radii of the QMSs cylinders utilizing those functions.\n\nResultsFor validation we use QSMs produced from an open point cloud data set of tree clouds with SimpleForest software. We compare the QSM volume against the harvested reference data for 65felled trees. We also found QSM data of TreeQSM, a competitive and broadly accepted QSM modeling tool. Our RMSE was less than 40 % of the TreeQSM RMSE. For other error measures, the r2adj. and the CCC, the relative improvement looked even better with reaching only 27 % and 21 % of the TreeQSM errors respectively.\n\nIn a second validation part we show a way to run numerical tests against the West Brown Enquist (WBE) model. Expected power coefficients have been published for various allometric relations and we compare them to predicted values from QSM data. The deviation from the expected values ranges here from 8 % underestimation to 32 % overestimation.\n\nConclusionsQuality - With the invention of the QSM radius filter technique we improve tree volume prediction capabilities utilizing QSMs.\n\nQuantity - More data can be collected with QSMs than with traditional methods.",

Finally, we established gene essentiality signatures for noncancer drugs and used them to predict their anticancer targets.

Here we employed genome-resolved phylogenetic analyses to decipher the evolution of the mercury methylating gene, hgcAB, constrain the ancestral origin of the hgc operon, and explain the distribution of hgc in Bacteria and Archaea. We infer the extent to which vertical inheritance and horizontal gene transfer have influenced the evolution of mercury methylators and hypothesize that evolution of this trait bestowed the ability to produce an antimicrobial compound (MeHg+) on a potentially resource-limited early Earth. We speculate that, in response, the evolution of MeHg+-detoxifying alkylmercury lyase (encoded by merB) reduced a selective advantage for mercury methylators and resulted in widespread loss of hgc in Bacteria and Archaea.\n\nSignificanceNeurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg+(aq)) is synthesized from HgII(aq) in the environment by microorganisms possessing the gene pair hgcAB. Our phylogenetic analyses elucidate the origin and evolution of the hgc operon, and support a hypothesis that mercury methylation evolved as an antimicrobial production mechanism, possibly from competition for limited resources on the early Earth. We infer from our analyses that hgc has been primarily vertically inherited in Bacteria and Archaea, with extensive parallel loss, and note that few taxa possessing hgc also possess the gene encoding for MeHg+ demethylation, merB. Our findings support the interpretation that merB evolved as a defense mechanism against the evolution of microbial HgII(aq) methylation.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic profiling from sequencing data aims to disentangle a microbial sample at lower ranks of taxonomy, such as species and strains. Deep taxonomic profiling involving accurate estimation of strain level abundances aids in precise quantification of the microbial composition, which plays a crucial role in various downstream analyses. Existing tools primarily focus on strain/subspecies identification and limit abundance estimation to the species level. Abundance quantification of the identified strains is challenging and remains largely unaddressed by the existing approaches. We propose a novel algorithm MAGE (Microbial Abundance GaugE), for accurately identifying constituent strains and quantifying strain level relative abundances. For accurate profiling, MAGE uses read mapping information and performs a novel local searchbased profiling guided by a constrained optimization based on maximum likelihood estimation. Unlike the existing approaches that often rely on strain-specific markers and homology information for deep profiling, MAGE works solely with read mapping information, which is the set of target strains from the reference collection for each mapped read. As part of MAGE, we provide an alignment-free and kmer-based read mapper that uses a compact and comprehensive index constructed using FM-index and R-index. We use a variety of evaluation metrics for validating abundances estimation quality. We performed several experiments using a variety of datasets, and MAGE exhibited superior performance compared to the existing tools on a wide range of performance metrics.",

    "abstract": "Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is classically linked to inhibitory control, emotion regulation and reward processing. Recent perspectives propose that the OFC also generates predictions about perceptual events, actions, and their outcomes. We tested the causal involvement of the OFC in detecting violations of prediction at two levels of abstraction (i.e., hierarchical predictive processing) by studying the event-related potentials (ERPs) of patients with focal OFC lesions (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 14) while they detected deviant sequences of tones in a Local-Global paradigm. The structural regularities of the tones were controlled at two hierarchical levels by rules defined at a local (i.e., between tones within sequences) and at a global (i.e., between sequences) level. In OFC patients, ERPs elicited by standard tones were unaffected at both local and global levels compared to controls. However, patients showed an attenuated mismatch negativity (MMN) to local prediction violation, as well as a diminished and delayed MMN/P3a complex to the combined local and global level prediction violation. The subsequent P3b component to conditions involving violations of prediction at the level of global rules was preserved in the OFC group. Comparable effects were absent in patients with lesions restricted to the lateral PFC, which lends a degree of anatomical specificity to the altered predictive processing resulting from OFC lesion. Overall, the altered magnitudes and time courses of MMN/P3a responses after lesions to the OFC indicate fundamental impairments in detecting violation of auditory regularity at two hierarchical levels of stimuli abstraction.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOrbitofrontal lesions reduce auditory MMN (i.e., prediction error) to unpredicted stimuli at the local level.\nC_LIO_LIOrbitofrontal lesions reduce local and global level auditory deviance (i.e., prediction error) response, as manifested by diminished and delayed MMN and P3a.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Improved biomarkers are needed for early cancer detection, risk stratification, treatment selection, and monitoring treatment response. While proteins can be useful blood-based biomarkers, many have limited sensitivity or specificity for these applications. Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) open reading frame 1 protein (ORF1p) is a transposable element protein overexpressed in carcinomas and high-risk precursors during carcinogenesis with negligible detectable expression in corresponding normal tissues, suggesting ORF1p could be a highly specific cancer biomarker. To explore the potential of ORF1p as a blood-based biomarker, we engineered ultrasensitive digital immunoassays that detect mid-attomolar (10-17 M) ORF1p concentrations in patient plasma samples across multiple cancers with high specificity. Plasma ORF1p shows promise for early detection of ovarian cancer, improves diagnostic performance in a multi-analyte panel, and provides early therapeutic response monitoring in gastric and esophageal cancers. Together, these observations nominate ORF1p as a multi-cancer biomarker with potential utility for disease detection and monitoring.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLINE-1 ORF1p transposon protein is pervasively expressed in many cancers and a highly specific biomarker of multiple common, lethal carcinomas and their high-risk precursors in tissue and blood.

    "abstract": "Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a powerful method for the deep analysis of translation mechanisms and regulatory circuits during gene expression. Here, we established an optimized and high resolution Ribo-seq protocol for the unicellular model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas). Comparing different nuclease treatments for the extraction and sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) and parallel RNA-seq, provided deep insight into translational dynamics and post-transcriptional control of gene expression, thoroughly covering more than 10,000 different transcripts. Our high quality Ribo-seq protocol captures the 3-nucleotide movement of elongating ribosomes along nuclear and chloroplast transcripts. Detailed analysis of the ribosomal offsets on transcripts uncovers presumable transition states during translocation of elongating ribosomes within the 5- and 3-sections of transcripts and features of eukaryotic translation termination. These offsets reveal drastic differences between the nature of cytosolic and chloroplast translation mechanisms. Chloroplast translation is further characterized by heterogenous RPF size distribution. We found that local accumulation of small RPFs correlates with local slowdown of psbA translation, possibly revealing an uncharacterized regulator step during PsbA/D1 synthesis. Further analyses of RPF distribution along specific cytosolic transcripts revealed characteristic patterns of translation elongation exemplified for the major light harvesting complex proteins, LHCs. Moreover, our Ribo-seq data can be utilized to survey coding sequence annotations and the expression preference of alternatively spliced transcripts in Chlamydomonas. We made these features easily accessible for the research community by attaching our Ribo-seq data to the most recent Chlamydomonas reference genome.",

    "abstract": "An epithelium in a living organism seldom develops in isolation. Rather, most epithelia are tethered to other epithelial or non-epithelial tissues, necessitating growth coordination between layers. We investigated how two tethered epithelial layers of the Drosophila larval wing imaginal disc, the disc proper (DP) and the peripodial epithelium (PE), coordinate their growth. DP growth is driven by the morphogens Hedgehog (Hh) and Dpp, but regulation of PE growth is poorly understood. We find that the PE adapts to changes in growth rates of the DP, but not vice versa, suggesting a \"leader and follower\" mechanism. Moreover, PE growth can occur by cell shape changes, even when proliferation is inhibited. While Hh and Dpp pattern gene expression in both layers, growth of the DP is exquisitely sensitive to Dpp levels, while growth of the PE is not; the PE can achieve an appropriate size even when Dpp signaling is inhibited. Instead, both the growth of the PE and its accompanying cell shape changes require the activity of two components of the mechanosensitive Hippo pathway, the DNA-binding protein Scalloped (Sd) and its co-activator (Yki), which could allow the PE to sense and respond to forces generated by DP growth. Thus, an increased reliance on mechanically-dependent growth mediated by the Hippo pathway, at the expense of morphogen-dependent growth, enables the PE to evade layer-intrinsic growth control mechanisms and coordinate its growth with the DP. This provides a potential paradigm for growth coordination between different components of a developing organ.",

Live-cell imaging revealed that DNA transfected into mammalian cells was either captured directly in the cytoplasm, or was soon expelled from the nucleus, upon its entry. In the cytoplasm, plasmid DNA was rapidly surrounded by a double membrane and frequently colocalized with extra-chromosomal DNA of telomeric origin, also expelled from the nucleus. Therefore, we termed this long-term maintained structure exclusome. The exclusome envelope contains endoplasmic reticulum proteins, the inner-nuclear membrane proteins Lap2{beta} and Emerin but differs from the nuclear envelope by the absence of the Lamin B Receptor, nuclear pore complexes and by the presence of fenestrations. Further, Emerin affects the frequency of cells with exclusomes. Thus, cells wrap chromosomes and extra-chromosomal DNA into similar yet distinct envelopes. Thereby, they distinguish, sort, cluster, package, and keep extra-chromosomal DNA in the exclusome but chromosomal DNA in the nucleus, where transcription occurs.",

    "abstract": "The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a highly conserved collection of heterotrimeric holoenzymes responsible for the dephosphorylation of many regulated phosphoproteins. Substrate recognition and the integration of regulatory cues are mediated by B regulatory subunits that are complexed to the catalytic subunit (C) by a scaffold protein (A). PP2A/B55 substrate recruitment was thought to be mediated by charge-charge interactions between the surface of B55 and its substrates. Challenging this view, we recently discovered a conserved SLiM [RK]-V-x-x-[VI]-R in a range of proteins, including substrates such as the retinoblastoma-related protein p107 and TAU (Fowle et al. eLife 2021;10:e63181). Here we report the identification of this SLiM in FAM122A, an inhibitor of B55/PP2A. This conserved SLiM is necessary for FAM122A binding to B55 in vitro and in cells. Computational structure prediction with AlphaFold2 predicts an interaction consistent with the mutational and biochemical data and supports a mechanism whereby FAM122A uses the  SLiM in the form of a short -helix to dock to the B55 top groove. In this model, FAM122A spatially constrains substrate access by occluding the catalytic subunit with a second -helix immediately adjacent to helix 1. Consistently, FAM122A functions as a competitive inhibitor as it prevents binding of substrates in in vitro competition assays and the dephosphorylation of CDK substrates by B55/PP2A in cell lysates. Ablation of FAM122A in human cell lines reduces the rate of proliferation, progression through cell cycle transitions and abrogates G1/S and intra-S phase cell cycle checkpoints. FAM122A-KO in HEK293 cells results in attenuation of CHK1 and CHK2 activation in response to replication stress. Overall, these data strongly suggest that FAM122A is a  SLiM-dependent, substrate-competitive inhibitor of B55/PP2A that suppresses multiple functions of B55 in the DNA damage response and in timely progression through the cell cycle interphase.",

    "abstract": "Predator-prey arms races have led to the evolution of remarkable disguise strategies. While the theoretical benefits of predator camouflage are well established, no study has yet been able to quantify its consequences for hunting success. High-resolution movement data therefore allowed us to study how barn owls (Tyto alba) conceal their approach when using a sit-and-wait strategy, as well as the power exerted during strikes. We hypothesized that hunting owls would reduce their landing force, and therefore noise, on perches located close to a hunting event. Analyzing 87,957 landings from 163 individuals equipped with GPS and accelerometer tags, we show that landing force predicts hunting success. Landing force also varied with the substrate, being lowest on man-made poles in field boundaries, most likely due to the opportunities for enhanced flight control in open landscapes. The physical environment therefore affects the capacity for sound camouflage, providing an unexpected link between predator-prey interactions and land-use. Finally, hunting strike forces were the highest recorded in any bird, relative to body mass, revealing the remarkable capacity of these predators to modulate their landing force and the range of selective pressures that act on landings. Overall, our results provide the first measurements of landing force in a wild setting revealing a new form of motion-induced sound camouflage, its link to hunting success and hence to fitness.",

    "abstract": "Sulfolactate (SL) is a short-chain organosulfonate that is an important reservoir of sulfur in the biosphere. SL is produced by oxidation of sulfolactaldehyde (SLA), which in turn derives from sulfoglycolysis of the sulfosugar sulfoquinovose, or through oxidation of 2,3-dihydroxypropanesulfonate. Oxidation of SLA is catalyzed by SLA dehydrogenases belonging to the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. We report that SLA dehydrogenase RlGabD from the sulfoglycolytic bacterium Rhizobium leguminsarum SRDI565 can use both NAD+ and NADP+ as cofactor to oxidize SLA, and indicatively operates through a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism. We report the cryo-EM structure of RlGabD bound to NADH, revealing a tetrameric quaternary structure and supporting proposal of organosulfonate binding residues in the active site, and a catalytic mechanism. Sequence based homology searches identified SLA dehydrogenase homologs in a range of putative sulfoglycolytic gene clusters in bacteria predominantly from the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. This work provides a structural and biochemical view of SLA dehydrogenases to complement our knowledge of SLA reductases, and provide detailed insights into a critical step in the organosulfur cycle.\n\nGraphical abstractSulfolactate is an important species in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle.

    "abstract": "Physical activity is an integral part of every mammals daily life, and as a driver of Darwinian fitness, required coordinated evolution of the body and brain. The decision to engage in physical activity is driven either by survival needs or by motivation for the rewarding qualities of physical activity itself. Rodents exhibit innate and learned motivation for voluntary wheel running, and over time run longer and farther, reflecting increased incentive salience and motivation for this consummatory behavior. Dynamic coordination of neural and somatic physiology are necessary to ensure the ability to perform behaviors that are motivationally variable. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) have evolved both cognitive and metabolic functions, which in modern mammals may facilitate body-brain coordination. To determine if SWRs encode aspects of exercise motivation we monitored hippocampal CA1 SWRs and running behaviors in adult mice, while manipulating the incentive salience of the running experience. During non-REM (NREM) sleep, the duration of SWRs before (but not after) running positively correlated with future running duration, and larger pyramidal cell assemblies were activated in longer SWRs, suggesting that the CA1 network encodes exercise motivation at the level of neuronal spiking dynamics. Inter-Ripple-intervals (IRI) before but not after running were negatively correlated with running duration, reflecting more SWR bursting, which increases with learning. In contrast, SWR rates before and after running were positively correlated with running duration, potentially reflecting a tuning of metabolic demand for that days anticipated and actual energy expenditure rather than motivation. These results suggest a novel role for CA1 in exercise behaviors and specifically that cell assembly activity during SWRs encodes motivation for anticipated physical activity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDarwinian fitness is increased by body-brain coordination through internally generated motivation, though neural substrates are poorly understood. Specific hippocampal rhythms (i.e., CA1 SWRs), which have a well-established role in reward learning, action planning and memory consolidation, have also been shown to modulate systemic [glucose]. Using a mouse model of voluntary physical activity that requires body-brain coordination, we monitored SWR dynamics when animals were highly motivated and anticipated rewarding exercise (i.e., when body-brain coordination is of heightened importance). We found that during non-REM sleep before exercise, SWR dynamics (which reflect cognitive and metabolic functions) were correlated with future time spent exercising. This suggests that SWRs support cognitive and metabolic facets that motivate behavior by coordinating the body and brain.",

Here, we aimed at designing a new type of dendritic cell (DC) vaccine by unbiased computational integration of multi-omics data from cancer patients. In a first attempt, a DC vaccine designed to present tumor antigens from cancer cells succumbing to immunogenic cancer cell death (ICD) and to elicit high type I interferon (IFN) responses failed to induce the regression of mouse tumors lacking T cell infiltrates. In lymph nodes (LNs), instead of activating CD4+ and CD8+T cells, DCs stimulated immunosuppressive PD-L1+LN-associated macrophages (LAMs) via a type I IFN response. Moreover, DC vaccines of this type stimulated pre-existing, T cell-suppressive, PD-L1+tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). This created a T cell-suppressive circuit of PD-L1+macrophages, spanning across LNs and tumours. Accordingly, DC vaccines synergised with PD-L1 blockade to deplete PD-L1+macrophages, suppress myeloid inflammation affecting the tumor bed and draining lymph nodes, and de-inhibit effector/stem-like memory T cells, eventually causing tumour regression. The synergistic interaction between the DC vaccine and PD-L1 blockade was lost when DCs were manipulated to lose Ifnar1or Ccr7 or when macrophages were depleted. Interestingly, clinical DC vaccines also potentiated lymphocyte-suppressive PD-L1+TAMs in patients bearing T cell-depleted tumours. Altogether, our results reveal the existence of a novel PD-L1+LAM/TAM-driven immunosuppressive pathway that can be elicited by DC vaccines, yet can be subverted for improving the outcome of immunotherapy.",

However, the impact of cell wall thickening on susceptibility to host defences is unclear. Here, we show that bacteria grown in culture medium were rapidly opsonised by antibody and complement upon incubation with human serum, resulting in efficient phagocytosis and killing by human neutrophils. However, as bacteria adapted to serum, the resulting increase in cell wall thickness led to the concealment of bound opsonins and a corresponding reduction in phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils. Partial digestion of accumulated peptidoglycan using the enzyme lysostaphin restored opsonin exposure, phagocytosis and killing, whilst the antibiotic fosfomycin blocked accumulation of peptidoglycan and maintained the susceptibility of S. aureus to opsonophagocytic killing by neutrophils. These findings reveal that the adaptation of S. aureus to the host environment significantly reduces the ability of the immune system to detect and kill this pathogen through concealment of bound opsonins via peptidoglycan accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging and growing global health challenge that could result in 10.2 million deaths annually by 2050. The unrestricted and haphazard use of antibiotics is contributing to the rapid emergence and spread of AMR, and the problem is exacerbated by release of untreated waste water from high-risk sources like hospitals into rivers. Bacteria often develop resistance through horizontal gene transfer mechanism and gut flora can act as a source for new Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARG). Upcoming methods like metagenomics can identify the resistance profile (AMR) of gut microbiome, and detect bacterial infections that otherwise go unnoticed. Our study focused on understanding the presence of AMR mutations and gene transfer dynamics in human, animal and environmental samples collected in one of the temporary settlements of Kathmandu (Nepal) using One Health approach. Current AMR reporting based on clinical cases is limited and does not provide information on specific pathogen and associated AMR genes-our study is an effort to contribute information to fulfill this gap.\n\nTwenty-one samples were collected from a temporary settlement in Thapathali (Kathmandu), which included fecal samples from birds (n=3) and humans (n=14), and environmental samples (n=4). Microbiological assessment was carried out based on 16S sequence metagenomic analysis using MiSeq (Illumina, USA). Taxonomic classification on obtained 16S sequences were determined by using Metaphlan 2 and Qiime 2 bioinformatics tools. ShortBRED was used to classify ARG and virulence factors, and WAFFLE was used for horizontal gene transfer event prediction. The network analysis was carried out using Gephi v0.9 and the ResistoXplorer web tool to identify ARG in the collected samples.\n\nPrevotella spp. was the dominant gut microbiome in humans. We detected diverse phages and viruses, including Stx-2 converting phages. 72 virulence factors and 53 ARG subtypes were detected, with poultry samples having the highest number of subtypes. The cluster and network analysis showed a strong association between gut microbiome and ARG, which was also supported by Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) analysis. One-Health interface showed ARG dynamics and revealed gut microbiomes of humans and animals serving as a reservoir for the circulating ARG.",

    "abstract": "We use viral kinetic models fitted to viral load data from in vitro studies to explain why the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant replicates faster than the Delta variant in nasal cells, but slower than Delta in lung cells, which could explain Omicrons higher transmission potential and lower severity. We find that in both nasal and lung cells, viral infectivity is higher for Omicron but the virus production rate is higher for Delta. However, the differences are unequal between cell types, and ultimately leads to the basic reproduction number and growth rate being higher for Omicron in nasal cells, and higher for Delta in lung cells. In nasal cells, Omicron alone can enter via a TMPRSS2-independent pathway, but it is primarily increased efficiency of TMPRSS2-dependent entry which accounts for Omicrons increased activity. This work paves the way for using within-host mathematical models to understand the transmission potential and severity of future variants.",

    "abstract": "Representational drift refers to the dynamic nature of neural representations in the brain despite the behavior being seemingly stable. Although drift has been observed in many different brain regions, the mechanisms underlying it are not known. Since intrinsic neural excitability is suggested to play a key role in regulating memory allocation, fluctuations of excitability could bias the reactivation of previously stored memory ensembles and therefore act as a motor for drift. Here, we propose a rate-based plastic recurrent neural network with slow fluctuations of intrinsic excitability. We first show that subsequent reactivations of a neural ensemble can lead to drift of this ensemble. The model predicts that drift is induced by co-activation of previously active neurons along with neurons with high excitability which leads to remodelling of the recurrent weights. Consistent with previous experimental works, the drifting ensemble is informative about its temporal history. Crucially, we show that the gradual nature of the drift is necessary for decoding temporal information from the activity of the ensemble. Finally, we show that the memory is preserved and can be decoded by an output neuron having plastic synapses with the main region.",

These patterns are validated out-of-sample and across different data processing choices. Brain regions most strongly implicated in general cognitive ability (g; meta-analytic N = 40,929) have greater balance between downregulation and upregulation of both major components.

Here, we developed an in vitro human assembloid model of the thalamocortical pathway to systematically dissect the contribution of genetic variants in T-type calcium channels. We discovered that a CACNA1G variant (M1531V) associated with seizures led to hypersynchronous activity in the thalamus and in cortical neurons in thalamo-cortical assembloids. In contrast, CACNA1G loss, which has been associated with risk of schizophrenia, resulted in abnormal thalamocortical connectivity that was related to both increased spontaneous thalamic activity and aberrant thalamic axonal projections.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies uncovered pervasive transcription and translation of thousands of noncanonical open reading frames (nORFs) outside of annotated genes. The contribution of nORFs to cellular phenotypes is difficult to infer using conventional approaches because nORFs tend to be short, of recent de novo origins, and lowly expressed. Here we develop a dedicated coexpression analysis framework that accounts for low expression to investigate the transcriptional regulation, evolution, and potential cellular roles of nORFs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\nResultsOur results reveal that nORFs tend to be preferentially coexpressed with genes involved in cellular transport or homeostasis but rarely with genes involved in RNA processing. Mechanistically, we discover that young de novo nORFs located downstream of conserved genes tend to leverage their neighbors promoters through transcription readthrough, resulting in high coexpression and high expression levels. Transcriptional piggybacking also influences the coexpression profiles of young de novo nORFs located upstream of genes, but to a lesser extent and without detectable impact on expression levels. Transcriptional piggybacking influences, but does not determine, the transcription profiles of de novo nORFs emerging nearby genes. About 40% of nORFs are not strongly coexpressed with any gene but are transcriptionally regulated nonetheless and tend to form entirely new transcription modules. We offer a web browser interface (https://carvunislab.csb.pitt.edu/shiny/coexpression/) to efficiently query, visualize and download our coexpression inferences.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that nORF transcription is highly regulated. Our coexpression dataset serves as an unprecedented resource for unraveling how nORFs integrate into cellular networks, contribute to cellular phenotypes, and evolve.",

    "abstract": "Climatic variations subject living species to evolutionary stresses and shape their distributions. Since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the subsequent temperature rise, species (re-) colonised higher latitudes. Among the evolutionary mechanisms involved during this process, local adaptation is thought to be one of the keystones of species persistence. However, its relative role and location in space remain elusive. The Western Palearctic barn owl (Tyto alba) recolonised Europe after the LGM (from the Italian and Iberic peninsulas) and offers an excellent opportunity to study local adaptation at the continental scale. Here, we modelled the evolution of the barn owls ecological niche since LGM and showed that the birds probably followed its shift towards the North during the recolonisation. To identify traces of local adaptation, we scanned the entire genomes of 74 owls from 9 European populations using both Tajimas D and population-specific FST and associated genomic variants to temperature and precipitation through a Redundancy analysis. The combination of these methods yielded a total of 394 genomic windows putatively involved in the local adaptation distributed over all populations. Interestingly, our results identified a large region under selection in both refugial populations, consistent with climate change and ecological convergence in the two peninsulas. This study shed light on the genomic basis of local adaptation of the European barn owl, emphasised the importance of considering the ecological niche as a dynamic entity and paved the way to a better understanding of where and how local adaptation happens in a context of postglacial recolonisation.",

Despite the proven efficacy of estrogen therapy, its mechanism of action is unclear and this treatment remains under-utilized. Mechanistic understanding may offer strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy.\n\nExperimental DesignWe performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening and transcriptomic profiling in long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) ER+ breast cancer cells to identify pathways required for therapeutic response to the estrogen 17{beta}-estradiol (E2). We validated findings in cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and patient samples, and developed a novel combination treatment through testing in cell lines and PDX models.\n\nResultsCells treated with E2 exhibited replication-dependent markers of DNA damage and the DNA damage response prior to apoptosis. Such DNA damage was partially driven by the formation of DNA:RNA hybrids (R-loops). Pharmacological suppression of the DNA damage response via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib enhanced E2-induced DNA damage. PARP inhibition synergized with E2 to suppress growth and prevent tumor recurrence in BRCA1/2-mutant and BRCA1/2-wild-type cell line and PDX models.\n\nConclusionsE2-induced ER activity drives DNA damage and growth inhibition in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. Inhibition of the DNA damage response using drugs such as PARP inhibitors can enhance therapeutic response to E2. These findings warrant clinical exploration of the combination of E2 with DNA damage response inhibitors in advanced ER+ breast cancer, and suggest that PARP inhibitors may synergize with therapeutics that exacerbate transcriptional stress.",

Although smoking cessation is the best preventive action, nearly 50% of all lung cancer diagnoses occur in people who have already quit smoking. Research into treatment options for these high-risk patients has been constrained to rodent models of chemical carcinogenesis, which are time-consuming, expensive, and require large numbers of animals. Here we show that embedding precision-cut lung slices within an engineered hydrogel and exposing this tissue to a carcinogen from cigarette smoke creates an in vitro model of lung cancer premalignancy. Hydrogel formulations were selected to promote early lung cancer cellular phenotypes and extend PCLS viability up to six weeks. In this study, hydrogel-embedded lung slices were exposed to the cigarette smoke derived carcinogen vinyl carbamate, which induces adenocarcinoma in mice. At six weeks, analysis of proliferation, gene expression, histology, tissue stiffness, and cellular content revealed that vinyl carbamate induced the formation of premalignant lesions with a mixed adenoma/squamous phenotype. Two putative chemoprevention agents were able to freely diffuse through the hydrogel and induce tissue-level changes. The design parameters selected using murine tissue were validated with hydrogel-embedded human PCLS and results showed increased proliferation and premalignant lesion gene expression patterns. This tissue-engineered model of human lung cancer premalignancy is the starting point for more sophisticated ex vivo models and a foundation for the study of carcinogenesis and chemoprevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Many types of cancer overexpress bulky glycoproteins to form a thick glycocalyx layer. The glycocalyx physically separates the cell from its surroundings, but recent work has shown that the glycocalyx can paradoxically increase adhesion to soft tissues and therefore promote the metastasis of cancer cells. This surprising phenomenon occurs because the glycocalyx forces adhesion molecules (called integrins) on the cells surface into clusters. These integrin clusters have cooperative effects that allow them to form stronger adhesions to surrounding tissues than would be possible with equivalent numbers of un-clustered integrins. These cooperative mechanisms have been intensely scrutinized in recent years; a more nuanced understanding of the biophysical underpinnings of glycocalyx-mediated adhesion could uncover therapeutic targets, deepen our general understanding of cancer metastasis, and elucidate general biophysical processes that extend far beyond the realm of cancer research.\n\nThis work examines the hypothesis that the glycocalyx has the additional effect of increasing mechanical tension experienced by clustered integrins. Integrins function as mechanosensors that undergo catch bonding - meaning the application of moderate tension increases integrin bond lifetime relative to the lifetime of integrins experiencing low tension. In this work, a three-state chemomechanical catch bond model of integrin tension is used to investigate catch bonding in the presence of a bulky glycocalyx.\n\nThis modeling suggests that a bulky glycocalyx can lightly trigger catch bonding, increasing the bond lifetime of integrins at adhesion edges by up to 100%. The total number of integrin-ligand bonds within an adhesion is predicted to increase by up to ~60% for certain adhesion geometries. Catch bonding is predicted to decrease the activation energy of adhesion formation by ~1-4 kBT, which translates to a ~3-50x increase in the kinetic rate of adhesion nucleation. This work reveals that integrin mechanic and clustering likely both contribute to glycocalyx-mediated metastasis.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=185 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532909v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5dc213org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@170ac28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@36873eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e92ef2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Patient stratification by NRF2 activity may guide treatment decisions to improve outcome. Here, we developed a mass spectrometry (MS)-based targeted proteomics assay based on internal standard triggered parallel reaction monitoring (IS-PRM) to quantify 69 NRF2 pathway components and targets as well as 21 proteins of broad clinical significance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We improved the existing IS-PRM acquisition algorithm, called SureQuant, to increase throughput, sensitivity, and precision. Testing the optimized platform on 27 lung and upper aerodigestive cancer cell models revealed 35 NRF2 responsive proteins. In formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HNSCCs, NRF2 signaling intensity positively correlated with NRF2 activating mutations and with SOX2 protein expression. PD-L2/CD273 and protein markers of T-cell infiltration correlated positively with one another and with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection status. p16/CDKN2A protein expression positively correlated with the HPV oncogenic E7 protein, and confirmed the presence of translationally active virus. This work establishes a clinically actionable HNSCC protein biomarker assay capable of quantifying over 600 peptides from frozen or FFPE archived tissues in under 90 minutes.",

    "abstract": "The presence of supernumerary centrosomes is a hallmark of cancer and is frequently observed in aggressive tumors. Cancer cells with centrosome amplification achieve pseudo-bipolar spindles through specific coping mechanisms in order to survive. However, their distribution and prevalence in cancer remain largely unknown. Here, using the NCI60 panel of cancer cell lines, we show that the presence of coping strategies correlates with centrosome amplification, with the clustering of extra-centrosomes within the two spindle poles being the most widespread mechanism. Moreover, we report an association between centrosome clustering ability and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and observe that the induction of mesenchymal characteristics in breast cancer cells with centrosome amplification promotes clustering.\n\nFurthermore, we unveil hematological malignancies, which lack epithelial characteristics, as the most proficient in centrosome clustering. Finally, we show that acute lymphoblastic leukemia is particularly sensitive to targeting clustering through inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Our study reveals how centrosome clustering and the EMT collaborate to promote carcinogenesis, suggesting new possibilities to treat tumors with low epithelial characteristics, in particular leukemias.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=74 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532472v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12a713dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1706edborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7deea7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bf2280_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG O_LICentrosome clustering is widespread in the NCI60 panel and particularly strong in leukemia.\nC_LIO_LIThe EMT enhances the ability of cancer cells to cope with multiple centrosomes through centrosome clustering.\nC_LIO_LICentrosome clustering gene expression peaks at the invasive stage and has prognostic value in breast cancer.\nC_LIO_LIThe inhibition of MPS1 is a good strategy to promote the death of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with CA.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Plant genomes encode a unique group of papain-type Cysteine EndoPeptidases (CysEPs) containing a KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (KDEL-CysEPs or CEPs). CEPs process the cell-wall scaffolding EXTENSIN proteins (EXTs), which regulate de novo cell wall formation and cell expansion. Since CEPs are able to cleave EXTs and EXT-related proteins, acting as cell wall-weakening agents, they may play a role in cell elongation. Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three CEPs (AtCPE1-AtCEP3). Here we report that the three Arabidopsis CEPs, AtCEP1-AtCEP3, are highly expressed in root-hair cell files. Single mutants have no evident abnormal root-hair phenotype, but atcep1-3 atcep3-2 and atcep1-3 atcep2-2 double mutants have longer root hairs (RHs) than wild type (Wt) plants, suggesting that expression of AtCEPs in root trichoblasts restrains polar elongation of the RH. We provide evidence that the transcription factor NAC1 activates AtCEPs expression in roots to limit RH growth. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that NAC1 binds the promoter of AtCEP1, AtCEP2, and to a lower extent to AtCEP3 and may directly regulate their expression. Indeed, inducible NAC1 overexpression increases AtCEP1 and AtCEP2 transcript levels in roots and leads to reduced RH growth while the loss of function nac1-2 mutation reduces AtCEP1-AtCEP3 gene expression and enhances RH growth. Likewise, expression of a dominant chimeric NAC1-SRDX repressor construct leads to increased RH length. Finally, we show that RH cell walls in the atcep1-1 atcep3-2 double mutant have reduced levels of EXT deposition, suggesting that the defects in RH elongation are linked to alterations in EXT processing and accumulation. Taken together, our results support the involvement of AtCEPs in controlling RH polar growth through EXT-processing and insolubilization at the cell wall.",

Here we show that mice deficient in the C-Type-lectin receptor, Clec12a developed severe colitis, which was dependent on the microbiota. Fecal-microbiota-transplantation (FMT) studies into germfree mice revealed a colitogenic microbiota formed within Clec12a-/- mice that was marked by expansion of the gram-positive organism, Faecalibaculum rodentium. Treatment with F. rodentium was sufficient to worsen colitis in wild-type mice. Macrophages within the gut express the highest levels of Clec12a. Cytokine and sequencing analysis in Clec12a-/- macrophages revealed heighten inflammation but marked reduction in genes associated with phagocytosis. Indeed, Clec12a-/- macrophages are impaired in their ability to uptake F. rodentium. Purified Clec12a had higher binding to gram-positive organisms such as F. rodentium. Thus, our data identifies Clec12a as an innate immune surveillance mechanism to control expansion of potentially harmful commensals without overt inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic AMP signalling in trypanosomes differs from most eukaryotes due to absence of known cAMP effectors and cAMP independence of PKA. We have previously identified four genes from a genome-wide RNAi screen for resistance to the cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor NPD-001. The genes were named cAMP Response Protein (CARP) 1 through 4. Here, we report an additional six CARP candidate genes from the original sample, after deep sequencing of the RNA interference target pool retrieved after NPD-001 selection (RIT-seq). The resistance phenotypes were confirmed by targeted RNAi knockdown and highest level of resistance to NPD-001, approximately 17-fold, was seen for knockdown of CARP7 (Tb927.7.4510). CARP1 and CARP11 contain predicted cyclic AMP binding domains and bind cAMP as evidenced by capture and competition on immobilised cAMP. CARP orthologues are strongly enriched in kinetoplastid species, and CARP3 and CARP11 are unique to Trypanosoma. Localization data and/or domain architecture of all CARPs predict association with the T. brucei flagellum. This suggests a crucial role of cAMP in flagellar function, in line with the cell division phenotype caused by high cAMP and the known role of the flagellum for cytokinesis. The CARP collection is a resource for discovery of unusual cAMP pathways and flagellar biology.\n\nImportanceTrypanosomes are major pathogens of humans and livestock. In addition they have been invaluable as a model system to investigate new biological systems, and not just of protozoa. Equally, they are known to have a lot of unique biology and biochemistry. One example of this is signal transduction by cyclic nucleotides. Some elements, including phosphodiesterases and the catalytic domains of its dozens of adenylate cyclase isoforms, are highly conserved, while the absence of G-proteins, a cAMP-responsive protein kinase A and other known effector types suggests a unique cAMP-dependent pathway, which as yet is mostly uncharacterised. Here, we identify a set of ten Trypanosoma brucei proteins, all localised to its flagellum, that appear to be involved in the production of cAMP, or in mediating its cellular effects. These cAMP Response Proteins (CARPs) were mostly unique to trypanosomes, suggesting a completely novel pathway. Two of the CARPs were shown to bind cAMP and were found to possess structurally conserved cyclic nucleotide binding domains.",

Although neither morphant nor mutant cln3 larvae showed any obvious developmental or morphological defects, behavioral phenotyping of the mutant larvae revealed higher basal activity, hyposensitivity to abrupt light changes and hypersensitivity to pro-convulsive drugs. Importantly, in-depth metabolomics and lipidomics analyses revealed significant accumulation of several glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs) and a global decrease of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) species, two classes of molecules previously proposed as potential biomarkers for CLN3 disease based on independent studies in other organisms. We could also demonstrate GPD accumulation in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids carrying a pathogenic variant for CLN3.

Depletion of LONP2 triggered accumulation of its substrates, alterations in peroxisome size and numbers, and luminal protein import failure. Gene expression changes and lipidomic analysis revealed striking cell specific differences in the response to siLONP2. Specific to COS-7 cells was a strong activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) and upregulation of ribosomal biogenesis gene expression levels. Common changes between COS-7 and U2OS cell lines included repression of the retinoic acid signaling pathway, and upregulation of sphingolipids. Cholesterol accumulated in the endomembrane compartments in both cell lines, consistent with evidence that peroxisomes are required for cholesterol flux out of late endosomes. These unexpected consequences of peroxisomal stress provide an important insight for our understanding of the tissue-specific responses seen in peroxisomal disorders.",

    "abstract": "Identifying traits that exhibit improved drought resistance is highly important to cope with the challenges of predicted climate change. We investigated the response of state transition mutants to drought. Compared with the wild type, state transition mutants were less affected by drought. Photosynthetic parameters in leaves probed by chlorophyll fluorescence confirmed that mutants possess a more reduced plastoquinone (PQ) pool, as expected due to the absence of state transitions. Seedlings of the mutants showed an enhanced growth of the primary root and more lateral root formation. The photosystem II inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, leading to an oxidized PQ pool, inhibited primary root growth in wild type and mutants, while the cytochrome b6f complex inhibitor 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylbenzoquinone, leading to a reduced PQ pool, stimulated root growth. A more reduced state of the PQ pool was associated with a slight but significant increase in singlet oxygen production. Singlet oxygen may trigger a, yet unknown, signaling cascade promoting root growth. We propose that photosynthetic mutants with a deregulated ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I activity can provide a novel path for improving crop drought resistance.\n\nSummary StatementArabidopsis thaliana mutants affected in state transitions are more drought resistant.",

However, it remains unclear how to parse continuous keypoint data into the modules out of which behavior is organized. This challenge is particularly acute because keypoint data is susceptible to high frequency jitter that clustering algorithms can mistake for transitions between behavioral modules. Here we present keypoint-MoSeq, a machine learning-based platform for identifying behavioral modules (\"syllables\") from keypoint data without human supervision. Keypoint-MoSeq uses a generative model to distinguish keypoint noise from behavior, enabling it to effectively identify syllables whose boundaries correspond to natural sub-second discontinuities inherent to mouse behavior. Keypoint-MoSeq outperforms commonly used alternative clustering methods at identifying these transitions, at capturing correlations between neural activity and behavior, and at classifying either solitary or social behaviors in accordance with human annotations. Keypoint-MoSeq therefore renders behavioral syllables and grammar accessible to the many researchers who use standard video to capture animal behavior.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune system plays essential roles in brain synaptic development, and immune dysregulation is implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases. Here we show that a subset of innate lymphocytes (group 2 innate lymphoid cells, ILC2s) is required for cortical inhibitory synapse maturation and adult social behavior. ILC2s expanded in the developing meninges and produced a surge of their canonical cytokine Interleukin-13 (IL-13) between postnatal days 5-15. Loss of ILC2s decreased cortical inhibitory synapse numbers in the postnatal period where as ILC2 transplant was sufficient to increase inhibitory synapse numbers. Deletion of the IL-4/IL-13 receptor (Il4ra) from inhibitory neurons phenocopied the reduction inhibitory synapses. Both ILC2 deficient and neuronal Il4ra deficient animals had similar and selective impairments in adult social behavior. These data define a type 2 immune circuit in early life that shapes adult brain function.\n\nOne sentence summaryType 2 innate lymphoid cells and Interleukin-13 promote inhibitory synapse development.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 continues to damage populations, communities and economies worldwide. Vaccines have reduced COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths, primarily in developed countries. Persisting infection rates, and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) causing repeat and breakthrough infections, underscore the ongoing need for new treatments to achieve a global solution. Based on ADDomer, a self-assembling protein nanoparticle scaffold, we created ADDoCoV, a thermostable COVID-19 candidate vaccine displaying multiple copies of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif (RBM)-derived epitope. In vitro generated neutralising nanobodies combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) established authenticity and accessibility of the epitopes displayed. A Gigabody comprising multimerized nanobodies prevented SARS-CoV-2 virion attachment with picomolar EC50. Antibodies generated by immunising mice cross-reacted with VOCs including Delta and Omicron. Our study elucidates nasal administration of ADDomer-based nanoparticles for active and passive immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 and provides a blueprint for designing nanoparticle reagents to combat respiratory viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogenic viruses, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, coronaviruses, and Pneumoviruses, rely on class I fusion proteins to fuse viral and cellular membranes. To drive the fusion process, class I fusion proteins undergo an irreversible conformational change from a metastable prefusion state to an energetically more favorable and stable postfusion state. An increasing amount of evidence exists highlighting that antibodies targeting the prefusion conformation are the most potent. However, many mutations have to be evaluated before identifying prefusion-stabilizing substitutions. We therefore established a computational design protocol that stabilizes the prefusion state while destabilizing the postfusion conformation. As a proof of concept, we applied this principle to the fusion protein of the RSV, hMPV, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. For each protein, we tested less than a handful of designs to identify stable versions. Solved structures of designed proteins from the three different viruses evidenced the atomic accuracy of our approach. Furthermore, the immunological response of the RSV F design compared to a current clinical candidate in a mouse model. While the parallel design of two conformations allows identifying and selectively modifying energetically less optimized positions for one conformation, our protocol also reveals diverse molecular strategies for stabilization. We recaptured many approaches previously introduced manually for the stabilization of viral surface proteins, such as cavity-filling, optimization of polar interactions, as well as postfusion-disruptive strategies. Using our approach, it is possible to focus on the most impacting mutations and potentially preserve the immunogen as closely as possible to its native version. The latter is important as sequence re-design can cause perturbations to B and T cell epitopes. Given the clinical significance of viruses using class I fusion proteins, our algorithm can substantially contribute to vaccine development by reducing the time and resources needed to optimize these immunogens.",

Experimental assays to identify new extracellular ligand-receptor interactions are challenging, which has hampered the rate of novel ligand discovery. Here, using AlphaFold-multimer, we developed and applied an approach for extracellular ligand-binding prediction to a structural library of 1,108 single-pass transmembrane receptors. We demonstrate high discriminatory power and a success rate of close to 90 % for known ligand-receptor pairs where no a priori structural information is required. Importantly, the prediction was performed on de novo ligand-receptor pairs not used for AlphaFold training and validated against experimental structures.

    "abstract": "The discovery1,2 and the pioneering applications3 of CRISPR-Cas effector complexes have provided powerful gene-editing tools. The effector complexes are guided to the targeted genomic locus by the complementarity of their CRISPR RNA (crRNA)4,5. Recognition of double-stranded DNA targets proceeds via DNA unwinding and base-pairing between crRNA and the DNA target strand resulting in the formation of an R-loop structure5,6. Full R-loop formation is the prerequisite for the subsequent DNA cleavage. While the CRISPR-Cas technology is easy to use, efficient and highly versatile, therapeutic applications are hampered by the off-target effects due to the recognition of unintended sequences with multiple mismatches7. This process is still poorly understood on a mechanistic level8,9. Particularly, the lack of insight into the energetics and dynamics of the R-loop formation hinders a direct modelling of the R-loop formation for off-target prediction.\n\nHere we set up ultrafast DNA unwinding experiments based on plasmonic DNA nanorotors to follow the R-loop formation by the Cascade effector complex in real time, close to base pair resolution. We directly resolve a weak global downhill bias of the energy landscape of the forming R-loop followed by a steep uphill bias for the final base pairs. We furthermore show a modulation of the landscape by base flips and mismatches. These data provide that Cascade-mediated R-loop formation occurs on short time scales in single base pair steps of sub-millisecond duration, but on longer time scales in six-base pair intermediate steps in agreement with the structural periodicity of the crRNA-DNA hybrid. We expect that the knowledge about the energy landscapes of R-loop formation of CRISPR-Cas effector complexes will pave the way for a detailed understanding and prediction of off-target recognition10.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria benefit plants by stimulating their growth or protecting them against phytopathogens. Rhizobacteria must colonise and persist on plant roots to exert their benefits. However, little is known regarding the processes by which rhizobacteria adapt to different plant species, or behave under alternating host plant regimes. Here, we used experimental evolution and whole-population whole-genome sequencing to analyse how Bacillus subtilis evolves on Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato seedlings, and under an alternating host plant regime, in a static hydroponic setup. We observed parallel evolution across multiple levels of biological organisation in all conditions, which was greatest for the two heterogeneous, multi-resource spatially-structured environments at the genetic level. Species-specific adaptation at the genetic level was also observed, possibly caused by the selection stress imposed by different host plants. Furthermore, a trade-off between motility and biofilm development was supported by mutational changes in motility- and biofilm-related genes. Finally, we identified several condition-specific and common targeted genes in different environments by comparing three different B. subtilis biofilm adaptation settings. The results demonstrate a common evolutionary pattern when B. subtilis is adapting to the plant rhizosphere in similar conditions, and reveal differences in genetic mechanisms between different host plants. These findings will likely support strain improvements for sustainable agriculture.\n\nData summarySequencing data associated with this article are available in the CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) [1] of the China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb) [2] under accession numbers CNP0002416 and CNP0003952.

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus causes acute and chronic pulmonary infection in patients with chronic lung damage. It is intrinsically resistance to antibiotics effective against other pathogenic mycobacteria largely due to the drug-induced expression of genes that confer resistance. Induction of genes upon exposure to ribosome targeting antibiotics proceeds via WhiB7-dependent and -independent pathways. WhiB7 controls the expression of >100 genes, a few of which are known determinants of drug resistance. The function of the vast majority of genes within the regulon is unknown, but some conceivably encode additional mechanisms of resistance. Furthermore, the hierarchy of gene expression within the regulon, if any, is poorly understood. In the present work we have identified 56 WhiB7 binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (CHIP-Seq) which accounts for the WhiB7-dependent upregulation of 70 genes, and find that M. abscessus WhiB7 functions exclusively as a transcriptional activator at promoters recognized by {sigma}A/{sigma}B We have investigated the role of 18 WhiB7 regulated genes in drug resistance and demonstrated the role of MAB_1409c and MAB_4324c in aminoglycoside resistance. Further, we identify a {sigma}H-dependent pathway in aminoglycoside and tigecycline resistance which is induced upon drug exposure and is further activated by WhiB7 demonstrating the existence of a crosstalk between components of the WhiB7-dependent and -independent circuits.\n\nAbstract ImportanceThe induction of multiple genes that confer resistance to structurally diverse ribosome-targeting antibiotics is funneled through the induction of a single transcriptional activator, WhiB7, by antibiotic-stalled ribosomes. This poses a severe restriction in M. abscessus therapy as treatment with one ribosome-targeting antibiotic confers resistance to all other ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Here we uncover the intricacies of the WhiB7 regulatory circuit, identify three previously unknown determinants of aminoglycoside resistance and unveil a communication between WhiB7 dependent and independent components. This not only expands our understanding of the antibiotic resistance potential of M. abscessus but can also inform the development of much needed therapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "Species tree-aware phylogenetic methods model how gene trees are generated along the species tree by a series of evolutionary events, including the duplication, transfer and loss of genes. Over the past ten years these methods have emerged as a powerful tool for inferring and rooting gene and species trees, inferring ancestral gene repertoires, and studying the processes of gene and genome evolution. However, these methods are complex and can be more difficult to use than traditional phylogenetic approaches. Method development is rapid, and it can be difficult to decide between approaches and interpret results. Here, we review ALE and GeneRax, two popular packages for reconciling gene and species trees, explaining how they work, how results can be interpreted, and providing a tutorial for practical analysis. It was recently suggested that reconciliation-based estimates of duplication and transfer frequencies are unreliable. We evaluate this criticism and find that, provided parameters are estimated from the data rather than being fixed based on prior assumptions, reconciliation-based inferences are in good agreement with the literature, recovering variation in gene duplication and transfer frequencies across lineages consistent with the known biology of studied clades. For example, published datasets support the view that transfers greatly outnumber duplications in most prokaryotic lineages. We conclude by discussing some limitations of current models and prospects for future progress.\n\nSignificance statementEvolutionary trees provide a framework for understanding the history of life and organising biodiversity. In this review, we discuss some recent progress on statistical methods that allow us to combine information from many different genes within the framework of an overarching phylogenetic species tree. We review the advantages and uses of these methods and discuss case studies where they have been used to resolve deep branches within the tree of life. We conclude with the limitations of current methods and suggest how they might be overcome in the future.",

    "abstract": "The trillions of microorganisms inhabiting the human gut are intricately linked to human health. At the species abundance level, correlational studies have connected specific bacterial taxa to various diseases. While the abundances of these bacteria in the gut serve as good indicators for disease progression, understanding the functional metabolites they produce is critical to decipher how these microbes influence human health. Here, we report a unique biosynthetic enzyme-guided disease correlation approach to uncover microbial functional metabolites as potential molecular mechanisms in human health. We directly connect the expression of gut microbial sulfonolipid (SoL) biosynthetic enzymes to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients, revealing a negative correlation. This correlation is then corroborated by targeted metabolomics, identifying that SoLs abundance is significantly decreased in IBD patient samples. We experimentally validate our analysis in a mouse model of IBD, showing that SoLs production is indeed decreased while inflammatory markers are increased in diseased mice. In support of this connection, we apply bioactive molecular networking to show that SoLs consistently contribute to the immunoregulatory activity of SoL-producing human microbes. We further reveal that sulfobacins A and B, two representative SoLs, primarily target Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to mediate immunomodulatory activity through blocking TLR4s natural ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to myeloid differentiation factor 2, leading to significant suppression of LPS-induced inflammation and macrophage M1 polarization. Together, these results suggest that SoLs mediate a protective effect against IBD through TLR4 signaling and showcase a widely applicable biosynthetic enzyme-guided disease correlation approach to directly link the biosynthesis of gut microbial functional metabolites to human health.",

As a plant species that grows naturally in the deserts of southern Africa, marama also serves as a good model for studying plant adaptation to extreme environments. In this study, HMW leaf DNA samples were prepared to generate 21.6 Gb PacBio HiFi data, which was assembled into to a raw tetraploid genome assembly of 1.24 Gb using Canu and into a partially phased assembly of 564.8 Mb by Hifiasm. The N50 values were 1.28 Mb and 2.75 Mb, respectively, and the BUSCO completeness were all above 99%. Repeats were found to account for 27.35% of the genome. The k-mer analysis indicated that marama was likely to be an autotetraploid plant with an estimated haplotype genome size of only 277 Mb. The current assembly was aligned with the genome of Bauhinia variegata, the closest species to marama whose genome has been sequenced, with an overall alignment rate of only 20.36% indicating a significant divergence between the two. This is the first high-quality genome assembly of marama bean, albeit unphased and still fragmented. However, some of the long contigs, which can be close to half the chromosome length, can serve as good references for studying the genes underlying the traits of interest. This will greatly facilitate the molecular breeding of the bean.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology involves the generation of logic circuits to create or control biological functions and behaviors by engineering interconnected genetic elements such as promoters, repressors, and transcriptional activators. CRISPR discovery, and its adaptations to mammalian cells, has made it the tool of choice in molecular biology and revolutionized genome engineering in biomedical sciences. Here, we describe an adaptation of a split Cas9 to generate synthetic logic gates to sense biological events. As proof-of-concept, the complementing halves of split Cas9 were placed under different promoters, one unique to cancer cells of epithelial origin (phCEA) and one universal promoter (pCMV). We used self-assembling inteins to reunite the halves when co-expressed. Only cancer cells with epithelial origin expressed both halves and activated a reporter becoming green fluorescent. We then investigated whether we could apply this system to the detection of biological processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We designed another logic gate where one halve is expressed only by cancer cells of epithelial origin, while the other is activated during EMT - under the control of TWIST1. Indeed, cells undergoing EMT were detected by the activation of the reporter. Finally, the split-Cas9 logic gate was applied as a sensor to detect cell-cell fusion events in multiple cell lines. Each cell type expressed only one halve of split Cas9, and only induction of fusion resulted in the appearance of multinucleated syncytia and the expression of the reporter system. The simplicity and flexibility of the split Cas9 system reported here can be integrated to many other cellular processes, not only as a sensor but as an actuator.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/533022v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f63cf0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ab298org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c3270eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1394488_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effect of sleep on memory consolidation relies on the precise interplay of slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles. However, whether these rhythms are orchestrated by an underlying pacemaker has remained elusive. Here, we tested whether respiration, which has been shown to impact brain rhythms and cognition during wake, shapes memory reactivation by modulating sleep-related oscillations and their interplay in humans. We recorded scalp EEG and respiration throughout an experiment in which participants acquired associative memories before taking a nap. Our results reveal that respiration strongly modulates the emergence of sleep oscillations. Specifically, SOs, spindles as well as their interplay (i.e., coupled SO_spindle complexes) systematically increase towards inhalation peaks. Moreover, the strength of respiration-SO_spindle coupling is linked to the extent of memory reactivation during SO_spindles. Our results identify respiration as a potential pacemaker for memory consolidation in humans and highlight the critical role of brain-body interactions during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Heptose metabolites including ADP-heptose are involved in bacterial lipopolysaccharide and cell envelope biosynthesis. Recently, heptoses were also identified to have potent pro-inflammatory activity on human cells as novel microbe-associated molecular patterns. The gastric pathogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori produces heptose metabolites which it transports into human cells through its Cag type 4 secretion system. Using H. pylori as a model, we have addressed the question, how pro-inflammatory ADP-heptose biosynthesis can be regulated by the bacteria. We have characterized the inter-strain variability and regulation of heptose biosynthesis genes and the modulation of heptose metabolite production by H. pylori, which impact cell-autonomous pro-inflammatory human cell activation. HldE, a central enzyme of heptose metabolite biosynthesis, showed strong sequence variability between strains, and was also strain-variably expressed. Transcript amounts of genes in the hldE gene cluster displayed intra-strain and inter-strain differences, were modulated by host cell contact and the presence of the cag pathogenicity island, and were affected by carbon starvation regulator A (CsrA). We reconstituted four steps of the H. pylori LPS heptose biosynthetic pathway in vitro using recombinant purified GmhA, HldE and GmhB proteins. On the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, the structures of major reaction products were identified as {beta}-D-ADP-heptose and {beta}-heptose-1-monophosphate. A pro-inflammatory heptose-monophosphate variant was also identified for the first time as a novel cell-active product in H. pylori bacteria. Separate purified HldE subdomains and variant HldE allowed to uncover additional strain variation in generating heptose metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and fecal virome transplantation (FVT, sterile filtrated donor feces) have proven effective in treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). However, variability in donor materials and costly screening, coupled with concerns (motivated by case reports) over pathogen transfer with FMT or FVT, hinders their wider clinical application in treating less acute diseases. Although FVT presents safety advantages over FMT by transferring no bacteria, the presence of eukaryotic viruses poses a risk of harmful infections. To overcome these challenges, we developed methods to broaden FVTs clinical application while maintaining efficacy and increasing safety. Namely: 1) chemostat-fermentation to reproduce the bacteriophage FVT component and remove eukaryotic viruses (FVT-ChP); 2) solvent-detergent treatment to inactivate enveloped viruses (FVT-SDT); and 3) pyronin-Y treatment to block RNA-virus replication (FVT-PyT). We evaluated the efficacy of these processed FVTs using a CDI mouse model and compared them with untreated FVT (FVT-UnT), FMT, and saline control. FVT-UnT, FVT-SDT, and FVT-ChP significantly reduced C. difficile colonization, limited CDI symptoms and reduced the incidence of mice reaching humane endpoints compared with the saline control. This proof-of-concept opens the possibility of developing safer and more effective phage-mediated therapies for a broad range of gut-related diseases and addresses the reproducibility issues associated with fecal donor material.\n\nSummaryFecal viromes depleted of enveloped viruses efficiently treat Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea in a murine model.",

    "abstract": "Below-ground carbon transformations represent a natural climate change mitigation solution, but newly-acquired traits adaptive to climate stress may alter microbial climate feedback mechanisms. To better define microbial evolutionary responses to long-term climate warming, we study microorganisms from an ongoing in situ soil warming experiment at the Harvard Forest Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site where, for over three decades, soils are continuously heated 5 {degrees}C above ambient temperatures. We hypothesize that across generations of chronic warming, genomic signatures within diverse bacterial lineages reflect trait-based adaptations related to growth and carbon utilization. From our culture collection of soil bacteria isolated from experimental heated and control plots, we sequenced genomes representing taxa dominant in soil communities and sensitive to warming, including independent lineages of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria. We investigated differences in genomic attributes and patterns of functional gene content to identify genetic signatures of adaptation. Comparative pangenomics revealed differently abundant gene clusters with functional annotations related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism. We also observed differences in global codon usage bias between heated and control genomes, suggesting potential adaptive traits related to growth or growth efficiency. This effect was more varied for organisms with fewer 16S rrn operons, suggesting that these organisms experience different selective pressures on growth efficiency. Together, these data illustrate the emergence of lineage-specific traits as well as common ecological-evolutionary microbial responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "In patients with asthma, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections can cause disease exacerbations by infecting the epithelial layer of the airways, inducing an innate and adaptive immune response. The type-I interferon antiviral response of epithelial cells upon RSV infection is found to be reduced in asthma in most -but not all-studies. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms that cause the differences in the asthmatic bronchial epithelium in response to viral infection are poorly understood.\n\nHere, we investigated the transcriptional response to RSV infection of primary bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs) from asthma patients(n=8) and healthy donors(n=8). The pBECs obtained from bronchial brushes were differentiated in air-liquid interface conditions and infected with RSV. After three days, cells were processed for single-cell RNA sequencing.\n\nA strong antiviral response to RSV was observed for all cell types present, from both asthma patients and healthy donors. Most differentially regulated genes following RSV infection were found in cells transitioning from basal to secretory. Goblet cells from asthma patients showed lower expression of genes involved in the interferon response. In multiciliated cells, an impairment of the signaling pathways involved in the response to RSV in asthma was observed, including no enrichment of the type-III interferon response.\n\nOur results highlight that the response to RSV infection of the bronchial epithelium in asthma and healthy airways was largely similar. However, in asthma, the response of goblet and the multiciliated cells was impaired, highlighting the need for studying airway epithelial cells at high resolution in the context of asthma exacerbations.\n\nWhat is already know on this topicThe airway epithelium response to RSV is altered in asthma. However, literature remains conflicted about the exact changes in the antiviral response, and the mechanisms causing these changes are yet to be found.\n\nWhat this study addsThis study describes extensively the response of the bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) to RSV for both healthy subjects and asthma patients, at a single-cell resolution. It highlights the major overlap between healthy and asthma in the antiviral response to RSV. It allows the identification of specific genes and cell types that show a different behavior in response to RSV in asthma compared to healthy.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policyOur study indicates that goblet and multiciliated cells are the most relevant BECs to further investigate in the context of drug development for RSV-induced asthma exacerbation. It also suggests that focusing research on the cross-talk between the epithelial and the immune cells, or into investigating a potential delayed response in asthma would be the best way forward into understanding the mechanisms involved in the asthma response to RSV.",

    "abstract": "Calcium signaling is critical for successful fertilization. In spermatozoa, calcium influx into the sperm flagella mediated by the sperm specific CatSper calcium channel is necessary for hyperactivated motility and male fertility. CatSper is a macromolecular complex and is repeatedly arranged in zigzag rows within four linear nanodomains along the sperm flagella. Here, we report that the Tmem249-encoded transmembrane domain containing protein, CATSPER{theta}, is essential for the CatSper channel assembly during sperm tail formation. CATSPER{theta} facilitates the channel assembly by serving as a scaffold for a pore forming subunit CATSPER4. CATSPER{theta} is specifically localized at the interface of a CatSper dimer and can self-interact, suggesting its potential role in CatSper dimer formation. Male mice lacking CATSPER{theta} are infertile because the sperm lack the entire CatSper channel from sperm flagella, rendering sperm unable to hyperactivate, regardless of their normal expression in the testis. In contrast, genetic abrogation of any of the other CatSper transmembrane subunits results in loss of CATSPER{theta} protein in the spermatid cells during spermatogenesis. CATSPER{theta} might acts as a checkpoint for the properly assembled CatSper channel complex to traffic to sperm flagella. This study provides insights into the CatSper channel assembly and elucidates the physiological role of CATSPER{theta} in sperm motility and male fertility.",

    "abstract": "While N6-methyldeoxyadenine (6mA) modification has been linked to fundamental regulatory processes in prokaryotes, its prevalence and functional implications in eukaryotes are controversial. Here, we report 6mA-Sniper to quantify 6mA sites in eukaryotes at single-nucleotide resolution. With 6mA-Sniper, we delineated an accurate 6mA profile in C. elegans with 2,034 sites, significantly enriched on sequences of [GC]GAG motif. Twenty-six of 39 6mA events with MnlI restriction endonuclease sites were experimentally verified, demonstrating the feasibility of this method. Notably, the enrichment of these 6mA sites on a specific sequence motif, their within-population conservation and the combinatorial patterns, and the selective constrains on them jointly support an active model for the shaping of the profile by some undiscovered methyltransferases. In a joint study (Cell Research, in revision), Ma et al. reported METL-9 as a new methyltransferase in shaping the basal and stress-dependent 6mA profile in C. elegans. Notably, with the 6mA profile identified by 6mA-Sniper at single-nucleotide resolution, we found that the levels of 6mAs are significantly decreased in strains with the removal of METL-9 (METL-9 KO-OP50), while generally increased after P. aeruginosa infection, further verified the efficiency of 6mA-Sniper in accurately pinpointing 6mA sites. Moreover, for the regions marked by 998 6mA sites emerged specifically after the infection, we identified an enrichment of the upregulated genes after the infection. The gene upregulations are likely mediated through a mutual exclusive crosstalk between 6mA and H3K27me3 modification, as supported by their co-occurrence, and the signal of increased H3K27me3 at regions marked by 6mAs depleted in METL-9 KO-OP50 strains. Notably, in different C. elegans strains, the cross-strain genetic variants removing 6mA sites are associated with the decreased expression of their host genes, and the removal of two randomly-selected 6mA events with genome editing directly decreased the expression of their host genes. We thus highlight 6mA regulation as a previously-neglected regulator of transcriptome in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Each genome encodes some codons more frequently than their synonyms (codon usage bias), but codons are also arranged more frequently into specific pairs (codon pair bias). Recoding viral genomes and yeast or bacterial genes with non-optimal codon pairs has been shown to decrease gene expression. Gene expression is thus importantly regulated not only by the use of particular codons but by their proper juxtaposition. We therefore hypothesized that non-optimal codon pairing could likewise attenuate Mtb genes. We explored the role of codon pair bias by recoding Mtb genes (rpoB, mmpL3, ndh) and assessing their expression in the closely related and tractable model organism M. smegmatis. To our surprise, recoding caused the expression of multiple smaller protein isoforms from all three genes. We confirmed that these smaller proteins were not due to protein degradation, but instead issued from new transcription initiation sites positioned within the open reading frame. New transcripts gave rise to intragenic translation initiation sites, which in turn led to the expression of smaller proteins. We next identified the nucleotide changes associated with these new sites of transcription and translation. Our results demonstrated that apparently benign, synonymous changes can drastically alter gene expression in mycobacteria. More generally, our work expands our understanding of the codon-level parameters that control translation and transcription initiation.\n\nIMPORTANCEMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis, one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Previous studies have established that synonymous recoding to introduce rare codon pairings can attenuate viral pathogens. We hypothesized that non-optimal codon pairing could be an effective strategy for attenuating gene expression to create a live vaccine for Mtb. We instead discovered that these synonymous changes enabled the transcription of functional mRNA that initiated in the middle of the open reading frame and from which many smaller protein products were expressed. To our knowledge, this is the first report that synonymous recoding of a gene in any organism can create or induce intragenic transcription start sites.",

Still, its empirical effects and comparisons to single-species inoculation have yet to be systematically quantified. In this global meta-analysis of 51 live-soil studies, we compared the impact (mean and variability) of single-species and consortium inoculations on biofertilization and bioremediation. Our results showed that both single-species and consortium inoculations increased plant growth by 29% and 48%, respectively, and pollution remediation by 48% and 80%, respectively, compared with non-inoculated treatments. We revealed the potential mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of consortium inoculation, which are associated with the diversity of inoculants and the synergistic effect between frequently used inoculums (e.g., Bacillus and Pseudomonas). Despite a reduction in efficacy in field settings compared to greenhouse results, consortium inoculation had a more significant overall advantage under various conditions. We recommend increasing original soil organic matter, N, and P content and regulating soil pH to 6-7 to achieve a better inoculation effect. Overall, these findings support the use of microbial consortia for improved biofertilization and bioremediation in living soil and suggest perspectives for constructing and inoculating beneficial microbial consortia.",

Mutations in BCL7 proteins are associated with different kind of cancers including blood malignancies. The information on the molecular function and on the structure of BCL7 proteins is to date very limited. Here we report that BCL7 proteins directly bind the nucleosome core particle (NCP) and free DNA with high affinity. We demonstrate that BCL7 proteins form defined complexes with the NCP and we identify the conserved N-terminal part of BCL7 proteins as sufficient to nucleosome binding. We further characterize the impact of BCL7 protein mutations reported in cancer patients on NCP binding and show that the R11S driver mutation reduces the affinity for the nucleosome. Our findings clarify the molecular function of BCL7 proteins and help rationalize the impact of cancer-associated mutations.",

The software available so far for this purpose can only detect a small number of modifications. Alternatively, two samples can be compared for different RNA modifications. We present Magnipore, a novel tool to search for significant signal shifts between samples of Oxford Nanopore data from similar or related species. Magnipore classifies them into mutations and potential modifications. We use Magnipore to compare SARS-CoV-2 samples. Included were representatives of the early 2020s Pango lineages (n=6), samples from Pango lineages B.1.1.7 (n=2, Alpha), B.1.617.2 (n=1, Delta), and B.1.529 (n=7, Omicron). Magnipore utilizes position-wise Gaussian distribution models and a comprehensible significance threshold to find differential signals. In the case of Alpha and Delta, Magnipore identifies 55 detected mutations and 15 sites that hint at differential modifications. We predicted potential virus-variant and variant-group-specific differential modifications. Magnipore contributes to advancing RNA modification analysis in the context of viruses and virus variants.",

Inspired by the ribosomal RNA transcription, we here develop a scaling theory of a brush of polymers, where monomers are added to their grafted ends in the steady state. Our theory predicts that monomers newly added to the polymers stay at the vicinity of the surface due to the slow dynamics of the polymers and thus the polymer volume fraction increases with increasing the polymerization rate. The excluded volume interaction between polymers and reactant monomers suppresses the diffusion of reactant monomers and thus decreases the polymerization rate. The extent of the suppression of monomer diffusion increases with increasing the polymerization rate because the diffusion length decreases, rather than the condensation of polymers due to their slow dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Massively parallel genetic screens have been used to map sequence-to-function relationships for a variety of genetic elements. However, because these approaches only interrogate short sequences, it remains challenging to perform high throughput (HT) assays on constructs containing combinations of multiple sequence elements arranged across multikb length scales. Overcoming this barrier could accelerate synthetic biology; by screening diverse gene circuit designs, \"composition-to-function\" mappings could be created that reveal genetic part composability rules and enable rapid identification of behavior-optimized variants. Here, we introduce CLASSIC, a genetic screening platform that combines long- and short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) modalities to quantitatively assess pools of constructs of arbitrary length containing diverse part compositions. We show that CLASSIC can measure expression profiles of >105 drug-inducible gene circuit designs (from 6-9 kb) in a single experiment in human cells. Using statistical inference and machine learning (ML) approaches, we demonstrate that data obtained with CLASSIC enables accurate predictive modeling of an entire circuit design landscape, offering critical insight into underlying design principles. Our work shows that by expanding the throughput and understanding gained with each design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, CLASSIC dramatically augments the pace and scale of synthetic biology and establishes an experimental basis for data-driven design of complex genetic systems.",

But every species described is a three-dimensional organism that needs to be seen, manipulated to be fully understood in its native shape. Nowadays, digital technology allows us to transform everyone in an avatar or a digital clone with ease, but collections do not provide many type specimens in a digital format. Here we present a simple approach used to study a specific deep-sea crab Segonzacia mesatlantica and provide online digital taxonomy across four repository sites. This offers the possibility to describe, exchange digitally and analyse specimens in its full 3D, establish their taxonomy and share them widely on online databases as well as physically by additive manufacturing to duplicate them in collections and outreach activities. Using an integrated taxonomic approach that included the use of 3D type specimens and molecular barcoding we provide evidence that the genus Segonzacia may be more diverse than previously understood",

While cytoarchitectonic homolog areas have been identified in nonhuman primates, it remains unknown how these regions evolved to support human language. Here, we use histological data and advanced cortical registration methods to precisely compare the morphology of BA44 and 45 between humans and chimpanzees. We found a general expansion of Brocas areas in humans, with the left BA44 enlarging the most, growing anteriorly into a region known to process syntax. Together with recent functional studies, our findings show that BA44 evolved from a purely action-related region to a more expanded region in humans, with a posterior portion supporting action and an anterior portion supporting syntactic processes. Furthermore, our findings provide a solution for the longstanding debate concerning the structural and functional evolution of Brocas area and its role in action and language.",

    "abstract": "Spatial navigation is a multi-faceted behaviour drawing on many different aspects of cognition. Visuospatial abilities, such as spatial working memory and mental rotation, in particular, may be key factors. A range of tests have been developed to assess visuospatial processing and memory, but how such tests relate to navigation ability remains unclear. This understanding is important to advance tests of navigation for disease monitoring in Alzheimers Disease, where disorientation is an early symptom. Here, we report the use of an established mobile gaming app, Sea Hero Quest, as a measure of navigation ability. We used three separate tests of navigation embedded in the game: wayfinding, path integration and spatial memory in a radial arm maze. In the same participants, we also collected measures of mental rotation (Mental Rotation Test), visuospatial processing (Design Organization Test) and visuospatial working memory (Digital Corsi). We found few strong correlations across our measures. Being good at wayfinding in a virtual navigation test does not mean an individual will rate themself as a confident navigator, be good at path integration, or have a superior memory in a radial arm maze. However, those good at wayfinding tend to perform well on the three visuospatial tasks examined here, and to also use a landmark strategy in the radial maze task. These findings help clarify the inter-relationships between different abilities supporting visuospatial and navigation skills.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThree navigation tests embedded in the game Sea Hero Quest were examined in relation to three object-based visuospatial tasks, and self-ratings of navigation ability and stress during navigation.\nC_LIO_LINo associations were observed among performance on wayfinding, path integration and radial arm maze levels of Sea Hero Quest.\nC_LIO_LIObject-based visuospatial abilities were selectively correlated with performance on wayfinding levels of Sea Hero Quest.\nC_LIO_LIGameplay stress and navigation strategy were not associated with performance on Sea Hero Quest navigation tasks.\nC_LI",

We further sequenced and constructed genome assemblies with long read sequences to find that the virus is likely integrated into the nuclear genome. Attempts to cure virus positive isolates were unsuccessful, however, phenotypic differences between naturally virus positive and virus negative Bd isolates suggested that BdDV-1 decreases the growth of its host in vitro but increases the virulence of its host in vivo.

    "abstract": "Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) has proven to be a useful technique for obtaining large amounts of DNA from tiny samples in genomics and metagenomics. However, MDA has limitations, such as amplification artifacts and biases that can interfere with subsequent quantitative analysis. To overcome these challenges, alternative methods and engineered DNA polymerase variants have been developed. Here, we present new MDA protocols based on the primer-independent DNA polymerase (piPolB), a replicative-like DNA polymerase endowed with DNA priming and proofreading capacities. These new methods were tested on a genomes mixture containing diverse sequences with high-GC content, followed by deep sequencing. Protocols relying on piPolB as a single enzyme cannot achieve competent amplification due to its limited processivity and the presence of ab initio DNA synthesis. However, an alternative method called piMDA, which combines piPolB with {Phi}29 DNA polymerases, allows proficient and faithful amplification of the genomes. In addition, the prior denaturation step commonly performed in MDA protocols is dispensable, resulting in a more straightforward protocol. In summary, piMDA outperforms commercial methods in the amplification of metagenomes containing high GC sequences and exhibits similar profiling, error rate, and variant determination as the non-amplified samples.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/533076v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cfb02dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@378d8corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12e0f93org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1008ffd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Schematic representation of methods based on multiple displacement amplification (MDA) for whole genome amplification.

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification responsible for one of the most complex multi-layered communication and regulation system in the cell. Over the past decades, new ubiquitin variants and ubiquitin-like proteins arose to further enrich this mechanism. Among them, the recently discovered ubiquitin variant UbKEKS can specifically target several proteins and yet, functional consequences of this new modification remain unknown. The absence of UbKEKS induces accumulation of lamin A in the nucleoli, highlighting the need for deeper investigations about protein composition and functions regulation of this highly dynamic and membrane-less compartment. By using data independent acquisition mass spectrometry and microscopy, we show here that despite not impacting protein stability, UbKEKS is required to maintain normal nucleolar organization. The absence of UbKEKS increases nucleolis size and accentuate their circularity while disrupting dense fibrillar component and fibrillar center structures. Moreover, depletion of UbKEKS leads to distinct changes in nucleolar composition. Notably, lack of UbKEKS favors nucleolar sequestration of known apoptotic regulators such as IFI16 or p14ARF, resulting in an increase of apoptosis in UbKEKS knockout cells observed by flow cytometry and real-time cellular growth monitoring. Overall, the results presented here identifies the first cellular functions of the UbKEKS variant and lay the foundation stone to establish UbKEKS as a new universal layer of regulation in the already complex ubiquitination system.",

    "abstract": "Understanding what determines species and population differences in levels of genetic diversity has important implications for our understanding of evolution, as well as for the conservation and management of wild populations. Previous comparative studies have emphasized the roles of linked selection, life-history trait variation and genomic properties, rather than pure demography, as important determinants of genetic diversity. However, these findings are based on coarse estimates across a range of highly diverged taxa, and it is unclear how well they represent the processes within individual species. We assessed genome-wide genetic diversity ({pi}) in 45 nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations and found that{pi} varied 15-fold among populations ({pi}min{approx}0.00015,{pi} max{approx}0.0023) whereas estimates of recent effective population sizes varied 122-fold. Analysis of inbreeding coefficients (FROH) estimated from runs of homozygosity revealed strong negative association between{pi} and FROH. Genetic diversity was also negatively correlated with mean body size and longevity, but these associations were not statistically significant after controlling for demographic effects (FROH). The results give strong support for the view that populations demographic features, rather than life history differences, are the chief determinants of genetic diversity in the wild.",
