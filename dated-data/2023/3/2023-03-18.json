    "abstract": "Intake of Western diet stimulates bile acid (BA) production and their conversion to secondary BAs by 7-dehydroxylating (7DH+) bacteria in the colon. Increased levels of 7DH+ bacteria and the secondary BA deoxycholic acid (DCA) have been associated with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). However, causal proof of their tumour-promoting effects under detrimental dietary conditions is lacking. Therefore, we performed feeding studies in a transgenic pig model of CRC combined with multi-omics analyses and gnotobiotic mouse studies. Western diet worsened the disease phenotype in APC1311/+ pigs. This was accompanied by increased levels of DCA and colonic epithelial cell proliferation, which was counteracted by using the bile acid-scavenging drug colestyramine. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model of CRC, we demonstrate that colonisation with different 7DH+ bacterial isolates increased colonic tumour loads. These complementary approaches present clear evidence for the causal role of microbiome-derived DCA production in CRC, opening avenues for future preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "Most TonB-dependent transporters in Bacteroides belong to the SusC family and work with an outer-membrane lipoprotein from the SusD family that functions like a lid. But the best-studied strain, B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, also contains 18 TonB-dependent transporters that are not from the SusC family. We identified six families of putative lids for these transporters. The putative lids are lipoproteins that are encoded next to TonB-dependent transporters, but they are not homologous to SusD. AlphaFold-Multimer predicts that the putative lids bind the outer faces of the corresponding TonB-dependent receptors. Genetic data suggests that members of four of these families are required for the activity of the corresponding TonB-dependent receptors. Overall, of the 18 TonB-dependent receptors that do not belong to the SusC family, we identified alternate lids for nine.",

Preclinical studies of next generation TB vaccines have typically used a murine aerosol challenge model that employs a high supraphysiologic challenge dose. Here we show that the protective efficacy of a live attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) vaccine candidate {Delta}LprG markedly exceeds that of BCG in a low dose murine aerosol challenge model. BCG vaccination reduced bacterial loads but failed to prevent establishment or dissemination of infection in this model. In contrast, {Delta}LprG prevented detectable infection in 61% of mice and resulted in striking anatomic containment of 100% breakthrough infections to a single lung. Protection was partially abrogated in a repeated low dose challenge model, which revealed serum IL-17A, IL-6, CXCL2, CCL2, IFN-{gamma}, and CXCL1 as correlates of protection. These data demonstrate that {Delta}LprG provides strikingly increased protection compared to BCG, including reduced detectable infection and anatomic containment, in a low dose murine challenge model.",

    "abstract": "Phase-variable Type I Restriction Modification (RM) systems are epigenetic regulatory systems that have been identified in numerous human bacterial pathogens. We previously showed that an emerging zoonotic lineage of Streptococcus suis acquired a phase-variable Type I RM system named SsuCC20p. The SsuCC20p locus was present in the genome of disease-associated isolates from multiple streptococcal species. This indicates that it is not restricted to S. suis and can be acquired through horizontal gene transfer. We demonstrate that SsuCC20p phase-variability relies on a recombinase present within the locus. In vitro, only SsuCC20p is responsible for the genome methylation profiles that were detected in the representative zoonotic S. suis isolate 861160. In addition, we show that, contrary to previous observations, hsdS genes located downstream of the hsdM gene and the recombinase gene, can contribute to the SsuCC20p genome methylation profile. SsuCC20p locked mutants expressing a single hsdS each showed unique genome methylation profiles. The differential genome methylation of the distinct locked mutants caused phase dependent differences in global gene expression in a growth condition dependent manner. We observed significant differences in virulence between hsdS locked mutants in a zebrafish larvae infection model. These data indicate that the streptococcal phase-variable Type I RM system SsuCC20p can impact bacterial virulence via epigenetic regulation of gene expression and potentially contributes to the zoonotic potential of S. suis.\n\nImportancePhase-variation contributes to the virulence of bacterial pathogens as it allows a single strain to produce phenotypic diverse subpopulations. Phase-variable Restriction Modification (RM) systems are systems that allow for such phase-variation via epigenetic regulation of gene expression levels. The phase-variable RM system SsuCC20p was found in multiple streptococcal species and was acquired by an emerging zoonotic lineage of Streptococcus suis. We show that the phase-variability of SsuCC20p is dependent on a recombinase encoded within the SsuCC20p locus. We characterized the genome methylation profiles of the different phases of SsuCC20p and showed that the differential genome methylation within the phases causes differences in gene expression levels and virulence. Altogether, we show that the acquisition of a phase-variable RM system impacts virulence and can potentially contribute to the zoonotic potential of S. suis. Bacterial pathogens can increase their virulence through acquisition of mobile elements containing epigenetic regulatory systems such as RM systems.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of all chromatin-templated processes involves the selective recruitment of chromatin factors to facilitate DNA repair, replication, and transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a critical experimental method used to provide spatiotemporal evidence for the coordination of these chromatin-based events including the dynamic regulation of chromatin modifications at cis-regulatory elements. However, obtaining a global appreciation of all the factors that influence a specific chromatin event has remained challenging. Here, as a proof of concept we demonstrate the utility of coupling unbiased functional genomics with ChIP to identify the factors associated with active transcription. Specifically, we use this method to identify the major chromatin factors associated with the catalysis of two evolutionarily conserved histone modifications; H3K4me3 present at the transcriptional start site and H3K79me2 present through the gene body of actively transcribed genes. With CRISPR-ChIP, we identify all the non-redundant COMPASS complex members required for H3K4me3 and demonstrate that RNA polymerase II is dispensable for the maintenance of H3K4me3. As H3K79me2 has a putative oncogenic function in leukaemia cells driven by MLL-translocations, using CRISPR-ChIP we reveal a functional partitioning of H3K79 methylation into two distinct regulatory units. An oncogenic DOT1L complex, where the malignant driver directs the catalytic activity of DOT1L at MLL-Fusion target genes and a separate endogenous DOT1L complex, where catalytic activity is directed by MLLT10. This functional demarcation provides an explanation for the observed synergy with Menin and DOT1L inhibitors and why Menin inhibition surprisingly controls methylation of H3K79 at a critical subset of genes that sustain MLL-fusion leukaemia. Overall, CRISPR-ChIP provides a powerful tool for the unbiased interrogation of the mechanisms underpinning chromatin regulation.",

    "abstract": "Orthosteric inhibition of kinases has been challenging due to the conserved active site architecture of kinases and emergence of resistance mutants. Simultaneous inhibition of distant orthosteric and allosteric sites, which we refer to as \"double-drugging\", has recently been shown to be effective in overcoming drug resistance. However, detailed biophysical characterization of the cooperative nature between orthosteric and allosteric modulators has not been undertaken. Here, we provide a quantitative framework for double-drugging of kinases employing isothermal titration calorimetry, Forster resonance energy transfer, coupled-enzyme assays, and X-ray crystallography. We discern positive and negative cooperativity for Aurora A kinase (AurA) and Abelson kinase (Abl) with different combinations of orthosteric and allosteric modulators. We find that a conformational equilibrium shift is the main principle governing this cooperative effect. Notably, for both kinases, we find a synergistic decrease of the required orthosteric and allosteric drug dosages when used in combination to inhibit kinase activities to clinically relevant inhibition levels. X-ray crystal structures of the doubledrugged kinase complexes reveal the molecular principles underlying the cooperative nature of double-drugging AurA and Abl with orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors. Finally, we observe the first fully-closed conformation of Abl when bound to a pair of positively cooperative orthosteric and allosteric modulators, shedding light onto the puzzling abnormality of previously solved closed Abl structures. Collectively, our data provide mechanistic and structural insights into rational design and evaluation of doubledrugging strategies.",

However, we find that SCD1 progressively loses its activity during catalysis and becomes fully inactive after nine turnovers. Further studies show that the inactivation of SCD1 is due to the loss of an iron (Fe) ion in the diiron center, and that the addition of free ferrous ions (Fe2+) sustains the enzymatic activity. Using SCD1 labeled with Fe isotope, we further show that free Fe2+ is incorporated into the diiron center only during catalysis. We also discover that the diiron center in SCD1 has prominent electron paramagnetic resonance signals in its diferric state, indicative of distinct coupling between the two ferric ions. These results reveal that the diiron center in SCD1 is structurally dynamic during catalysis and that labile Fe2+ in cells could regulate SCD1 activity, and hence lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The intricate regulation of chromatin plays a key role in controlling genome architecture and accessibility. Histone lysine methyltransferases regulate chromatin by catalyzing the methylation of specific histone residues but are also hypothesized to have equally important non-catalytic roles. SUV420H1 di- and tri-methylates histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2/me3) and plays crucial roles in DNA replication, repair, and heterochromatin formation, and is dysregulated in several cancers. Many of these processes were linked to its catalytic activity. However, deletion and inhibition of SUV420H1 have shown distinct phenotypes suggesting the enzyme likely has uncharacterized non-catalytic activities. To characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms SUV420H1 uses to modify chromatin, we determined cryo- EM structures of SUV420H1 complexes with nucleosomes containing histone H2A or its variant H2A.Z. Our structural, biochemical, biophysical, and cellular analyses reveal how both SUV420H1 recognizes its substrate and H2A.Z stimulates its activity, and show that SUV420H1 binding to nucleosomes causes a dramatic detachment of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer. We hypothesize that this detachment increases DNA accessibility to large macromolecular complexes, a prerequisite for DNA replication and repair. We also show that SUV420H1 can promote chromatin condensates, another non-catalytic role that we speculate is needed for its heterochromatin functions. Together, our studies uncover and characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms of SUV420H1, a key histone methyltransferase that plays an essential role in genomic stability.",

Scalable parallel random access of information is a desirable property of any storage system. For DNA-based storage systems, however, this yet has to be robustly established. Here we develop thermoconfined PCR, a novel method that enables multiplexed, repeated random access of compartmentalized DNA files. Our strategy is based on stable localization of biotin-functionalized oligonucleotides inside microcapsules with temperature-dependent membrane permeability. At low temperatures, microcapsules are permeable to enzymes, primers, and amplified products, while at high temperatures membrane collapse prevents molecular crosstalk during amplification. We demonstrate that our platform outperforms non-compartmentalized DNA storage with respect to repeated random access and reducing amplification bias during multiplex PCR. Using fluorescent sorting, we additionally demonstrate sample pooling and data retrieval by barcoding of microcapsules. Our thermoresponsive microcapsule technology offers a scalable, sequence-agnostic approach for repeated random access of archival DNA files.",

    "abstract": "Pronounced over-eruption of the canine teeth, much greater than in eco-morphologically equivalent placental carnivores, occurs with age and growth in Australian marsupial carnivores. Suppression of functional tooth replacement is a characteristic of marsupials and is frequent among diverse placentals, where the primitive therian pattern is two generations of incisor, canine and premolar teeth. Rapid determinate growth is one among multiple hypotheses proposed to explain the loss of tooth replacement in mammals. In this line of reasoning, the animal reaches a sufficient body or jaw size to accommodate adult-sized teeth by the time it requires functional dentition. Marsupial carnivores have a full set of adult anterior teeth at weaning, which erupt into a juvenile jaw that is 25 to 30 % adult size, compared with well grown in placental carnivores. Indeterminate over-eruption of the canine teeth in marsupial carnivores results in increasing canine height and diameter with increasing body size with age, suggesting this is a compensatory mechanism for the constraint of a single generation of anterior teeth. Patterns of over-eruption in different tooth types of marsupial carnivores are consistent with two non-exclusive mechanisms that operate in other mammals, a response to tooth wear and lack of an occlusal partner.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders have been linked to a disbalance of excitation and inhibition in a network of brain structures comprising frontal cortical regions, the amygdala and the hippocampus, among others. Recent imaging studies suggest sex differences in the activation of this anxiety network during the processing of emotional information. Rodent models with genetically altered {Upsilon}-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission allow studying the neuronal basis of such activation shifts and their relation to anxiety endophenotypes, but to date sex effects have rarely been addressed. Using mice with a null mutation of the GABA synthetizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65-/-), we started to compare anxiety-like behavior and avoidance in male vs. female GAD65-/- mice and their wildtype littermates. In an open field, female GAD65-/- mice displayed increased activity, while male GAD65-/- mice showed an increased adaptation of anxiety-like behavior over time. GAD65-/- mice of both sexes had a higher preference for social interaction partners, which was further heightened in male mice. In male mice higher escape responses were observed during an active avoidance task. Together, female mice showed more stable emotional responses despite GAD65 deficiency. To gain insights into interneuron function in network structures controlling anxiety and threat perception, fast oscillations (10-45 Hz) were measured in ex vivo slice preparations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). GAD65-/- mice of both sexes displayed increased gamma power in the ACC and a higher density of PV-positive interneurons, which are crucial for generating such rhythmic activity. In addition, GAD65-/- mice had lower numbers of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the basolateral amygdala and in the dorsal dentate gyrus especially in male mice, two key regions important for anxiety and active avoidance responses. Our data suggest sex differences in the configuration of GABAergic interneurons in a cortico-amygdala-hippocampal network controlling network activity patterns, anxiety and threat avoidance behavior.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRole of GABA in sex-specific anxiety endophenotypes demonstrated in GAD65-/- mice\nC_LIO_LISex- and GAD65-dependent alterations in anxiety, social preference and avoidance\nC_LIO_LIEnhanced in vitro gamma-beta oscillations in ACC slices of GAD65-/- mice\nC_LIO_LIIncreased parvalbumin(+) interneuron counts in ACC slices of GAD65-/- mice\nC_LIO_LIReduced somatostatin(+) interneuron counts in dorsal DG and BLA of male GAD65-/- mice\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532980v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@85ac09org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e1a70aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19dbbeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d52ff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The coordination between habitual and goal-directed behaviors has significant evolutionary importance. However, the specific cognitive processes and neural mechanisms underlying this coordination process require further research. Since inducing natural habitual responses through repetitive stimuli-response training in a laboratory environment is extremely difficult in humans, well-trained sports experts with automatic perception-action features towards expertise-related stimuli serve as ideal natural samples to address this critical gap. We conducted scalp EEG recordings while sports experts performed an expertise Simon task that involved both automatic and goal-directed processes with moderate space of expertise-related stimuli congruent or incongruent with the response hand. In the congruent condition, sports experts showed larger response-locked LRP and beta band (15-25Hz) activity at the frontal-central region, indicating an enhanced automatic response tendency towards expertise-related stimuli. In the incongruent condition, a larger theta (3-8Hz) dynamic was observed in the superior frontal gyrus when sports experts needed to inhibit the automatic response tendency. The results indicated that sports experts exhibited an enhanced coordination process towards expertise-related stimuli, which was closely related to specific cognitive processes of response preparation and response inhibition in coordinating habitual and goal-directed behaviors",

    "abstract": "Quinidine has been used as an anticonvulsant to treat patients with KCNT1-related epilepsy by targeting gain-of-function KCNT1 pathogenic mutant variants. However, the detailed mechanism underlying quinidines blockade against KCNT1 (Slack) remains elusive. Here, we report a functional and physical coupling of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.6 and Slack. NaV1.6 binds to and highly sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade. Homozygous knockout of NaV1.6 reduces the sensitivity of native sodium-activated potassium currents to quinidine blockade. NaV1.6-mediated sensitization requires the involvement of NaV1.6s N- and C-termini binding to Slacks C-terminus, and is enhanced by transient sodium influx through NaV1.6. Moreover, disrupting the Slack-NaV1.6 interaction by viral expression of Slacks C-terminus can protect against SlackG269S-induced seizures in mice. These insights about a Slack-NaV1.6 complex challenge the traditional view of \"Slack as an isolated target\" for anti-epileptic drug discovery efforts, and can guide the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for KCNT1-related epilepsy.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532982v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14bc9a2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a2d460org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@250edaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f241ad_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The muscle synergy is a guiding concept in motor control research that relies on the general notion of muscles  working together towards task performance. However, although the synergy concept has provided valuable insights into motor coordination, muscle interactions have not been fully characterised with respect to task performance. Here, we address this research gap by proposing a novel perspective to the muscle synergy that assigns specific functional roles to muscle couplings by characterising their task-relevance. Our novel perspective provides nuance to the muscle synergy concept, demonstrating how muscular interactions can  work together in different ways: a) irrespective of the task at hand but also b) redundantly or c) complementarily towards common task-goals. To establish this perspective, we leverage information- and network-theory and dimensionality reduction methods to include discrete and continuous task parameters directly during muscle synergy extraction. Specifically, we introduce co-information as a measure of the task relevance of muscle interactions and use it to categorise such interactions as task-irrelevant (present across tasks), redundant (shared task information) or synergistic (different task information). To demonstrate these types of interactions in real data, we firstly apply the framework in a simple way, revealing its added functional and physiological relevance with respect to current approaches. We then apply the framework to large-scale datasets and extract generalizable and scale-invariant representations consisting of subnetworks of synchronised muscle couplings and distinct temporal patterns. The representations effectively capture the functional interplay between task end-goals and biomechanical affordances and the concurrent processing of functionally similar and complementary task information. The proposed framework unifies the capabilities of current approaches in capturing distinct motor features while providing novel insights and research opportunities through a nuanced perspective to the muscle synergy.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion is one of the most ubiquitous motor actions in the animal kingdom, essential for behaviours as diverse as foraging, migration, and escape. Successful execution of all these tasks relies on continual adjustment of locomotor gait in line with the behavioural demand for speed as well as the terrain. Failure in this process would disrupt locomotor smoothness, raise its energetic cost, and increase the risk of injury due to skeletal stress [1, 2]. Animals avoid these scenarios, in part, by transitioning from left-right alternating (walk, trot) to synchronous (gallop, bound) gaits as they increase the speed [3, 4]. However, this relationship is not deterministic [5, 6] and its connection to biomechanical factors, like the loading of limbs [7, 8], is unclear. To address this, we developed a head-fixed locomotor paradigm that decouples the speed- and leg loading-related influences on gait by combining optogenetic stimulation of an established speed-control pathway [9, 10] with head height or surface incline modulation. We found a pronounced speed-independent shift in homolateral limb coordination from strict alternation to a gallop-like pattern at upward oriented body postures and upsloping terrains. Both conditions are associated with greater relative loading of the hindlimbs and have a consistent effect on gait preference during head-fixed and head-free locomotion. These results suggest that mice use proprioceptive feedback from the limbs to coordinate their gait across speeds and environments, and implicate ipsilateral control mechanisms in this process. More broadly, our work serves as a principled entry point to a behaviour-driven study of gait circuits.",

    "abstract": "1Real-world size is a functionally important high-level visual property of objects that supports interactions with our physical environment. Critically, real-world-size is robust over changes in visual appearance as projected onto our retinae such that large and small objects are correctly perceived to have different real-world sizes. To better understand the neural basis of this phenomenon, we examined whether the neural coding of real-world size holds for objects embedded in complex natural scene images, as well as whether real-world size effects are present for both inanimate and animate objects, whether low- and mid-level visual features can account for size selectivity, and whether neural size tuning is best described by a linear, logarithmic, or exponential neural coding function. To address these questions, we used a large-scale dataset of fMRI responses to natural images combined with per-voxel regression and contrasts. Importantly, the resultant pattern of size selectivity for objects embedded in natural scenes was aligned with prior results using isolated objects. Extending this finding, we also found that size coding exists for both animate and inanimate objects, that low-level visual features cannot account for neural size preferences, and size tuning functions have different shapes for large versus small preferring voxels. Together, these results indicate that real-world size is an ecologically significant dimension in the larger space of behaviorally-relevant cortical representations that support interactions with the world around us.",

    "abstract": "The versatility of somatosensation arises from heterogenous human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The critical information to decipher their functions, i.e., the soma transcriptome, is lacking due to technical difficulties. Here we developed a novel approach to isolate individual human DRG neuron somas for deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). On average, >9000 unique genes per neuron were detected, and 16 neuronal types were identified. Cross-species analyses revealed that touch-, cold-, and itch-sensing neuronal types were relatively conserved, while the pain-sensing neurons displayed marked divergence. Soma transcriptomes of human DRG neurons predicted novel functional features, which were confirmed using single-cell in vivo electrophysiological recordings. These results support a close relationship the between physiological properties of human sensory afferents and molecular profiles uncovered by the single-soma RNA-seq dataset. In summary, by conducting single-soma RNA-seq of human DRG neurons, we generated an unprecedented neural atlas for human somatosensation.",

    "abstract": "Animals navigating in natural environments must handle vast changes in their sensory input. Visual systems, for example, handle changes in luminance at many timescales, from slow changes across the day to rapid changes during active behavior. To maintain luminance-invariant perception, visual systems must adapt their sensitivity to changing luminance at different timescales. We demonstrate that luminance gain control in photoreceptors alone is insufficient to explain luminance invariance at both fast and slow timescales and reveal the algorithms that adjust gain past photoreceptors in the fly eye. We combined imaging and behavioral experiments with computational modeling to show that, downstream of photoreceptors, circuitry taking input from the single luminance-sensitive neuron type L3 implements gain control at fast and slow timescales. This computation is bidirectional in that it prevents underestimation of contrasts in low luminance and overestimation in high luminance. An algorithmic model disentangles these multifaceted contributions and shows that the bidirectional gain control occurs at both timescales. The model implements a nonlinear interaction of luminance and contrast to achieve gain correction at fast timescales and a dark-sensitive channel to improve the detection of dim stimuli at slow timescales. Together, our work demonstrates how a single neuronal channel performs diverse computations to implement gain control at multiple timescales that are together important for navigation in natural environments.\n\nSignificance StatementLuminance varies slowly throughout the day, or rapidly during movements. Yet, animals show luminance-invariant behaviors to visual cues across these scenarios. Combining in vivo imaging, behavioral analyses and computational modeling, we here show that diverse luminance gain control operations required for robust visual processing exist in the fly visual circuitry beyond photoreceptors. Despite relying on a single luminance-sensitive neuron type, this luminance gain control is multifaceted, in that it achieves both gain increments and decrements at two different timescales. Overall, the study sheds light on a circuit gain control strategy operating at multiple timescales, which together challenge luminance-invariant visual behaviors in natural environments.",

While investigation of engram cell properties and functionality in memory recall has been extensive, less is known about how engram cells are affected by forgetting. We describe a form of interference-based forgetting using an object memory behavioral paradigm. By using activity-dependent cell labelling, we show that although retroactive interference results in decreased engram cell reactivation during recall trials, optogenetic stimulation of the labelled engram cells is sufficient to induce memory retrieval. Forgotten engrams may also be reinstated via the presentation of similar or related environmental information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that engram activity is necessary for interference to occur. Taken together, these findings indicate that retroactive interference modulates engram expression in a manner that is both reversible and updatable. Retroactive inference may constitute a form of adaptive forgetting, where in everyday life new perceptual and environmental inputs modulate the natural forgetting process.",

    "abstract": "Specialized mechanosensory end organs within mammalian skin--hair follicle-associated lanceolate complexes, Meissner corpuscles, and Pacinian corpuscles--enable our perception of light, dynamic touch1. In each of these end organs, fast-conducting mechanically sensitive neurons, called A{beta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors (A{beta} LTMRs), associate with resident glial cells, known as terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) or lamellar cells, to form complex axon ending structures. Lanceolate-forming and corpuscle-innervating A{beta} LTMRs share a low threshold for mechanical activation, a rapidly adapting (RA) response to force indentation, and high sensitivity to dynamic stimuli1-6. How mechanical stimuli lead to activation of the requisite mechanotransduction channel Piezo27-15 and A{beta} RA-LTMR excitation across the morphologically dissimilar mechanosensory end organ structures is not understood. Here, we report the precise subcellular distribution of Piezo2 and high-resolution, isotropic 3D reconstructions of all three end organs formed by A{beta} RA-LTMRs determined by large volume enhanced Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) imaging. We found that within each end organ, Piezo2 is enriched along the sensory axon membrane and is minimally or not expressed in TSCs and lamellar cells. We also observed a large number of small cytoplasmic protrusions enriched along the A{beta} RA-LTMR axon terminals associated with hair follicles, Meissner corpuscles, and Pacinian corpuscles. These axon protrusions reside within close proximity to axonal Piezo2, occasionally contain the channel, and often form adherens junctions with nearby non-neuronal cells. Our findings support a unified model for A{beta} RA-LTMR activation in which axon protrusions anchor A{beta} RA-LTMR axon terminals to specialized end organ cells, enabling mechanical stimuli to stretch the axon in hundreds to thousands of sites across an individual end organ and leading to activation of proximal Piezo2 channels and excitation of the neuron.",

Noroviruses are one such group of viruses, but a mechanism of norovirus-infection triggered cell death and lysis are unknown.

We found that the norovirus-encoded NTPase contains a N-terminal four helix bundle domain homologous to the pore forming domain of the pseudokinase Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like (MLKL). Norovirus NTPase acquired a mitochondrial localization signal, thereby inducing cell death by targeting mitochondria. NTPase full length (NTPase-FL) and N-terminal fragment (NTPase-NT) bound mitochondrial membrane lipid cardiolipin, permeabilized mitochondrial membrane and induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Both the N-terminal region and the mitochondrial localization motif of NTPase were essential for cell death, virus egress from cells and virus replication in mice. These findings suggest that noroviruses stole a MLKL-like pore forming domain and co-opted it to facilitate viral egress by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlasmodium vivax is the second most prevalent cause of malaria yet remains challenging to study due to the lack of a continuous in vitro culture system, highlighting the need to establish a biobank of clinical isolates with multiple freezes per sample for use in functional assays. Different methods for cryopreserving parasite isolates were compared and subsequently the most promising one was validated. Enrichment of early- and late-stage parasites and parasite maturation were quantified to facilitate assay planning.\n\nMethodsIn order to compare cryopreservation protocols, nine clinical P. vivax isolates were frozen with four glycerolyte-based mixtures. Parasite recovery post thaw, post KCl-Percoll enrichment and in short-term in vitro culture was measured via slide microscopy. Enrichment of late-stage parasites by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) was measured. Short and long-term storage of parasites at either -80{degrees}C or liquid nitrogen were also compared.\n\nResultsOf the four cryopreservation mixtures, one mixture (glycerolyte:serum:RBC at a 2.5:1.5:1 ratio) resulted in improved parasite recovery and statistically significant (P<0.05) enhancement in parasite survival in short-term in vitro culture. A parasite biobank was subsequently generated using this protocol resulting in a collection with 106 clinical isolates, each with 8 vials. The quality of the biobank was validated by measuring several factors from 47 thaws: the average reduction in parasitemia post-thaw (25.3%); the average fold enrichment post KCl-Percoll (6.65-fold); and the average percent recovery of parasites (22.0%, measured from 30 isolates). During short-term in vitro culture, robust maturation of ring stage parasites to later stages (>20% trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes) was observed in 60.0% of isolates by 48 hours. Enrichment of mature parasite stages via MACS showed good reproducibility, with an average 30.0% post-MACS parasitemia and an average 5.30 x 105 parasites/vial. Finally, the effect of storage temperature was tested, and no large impacts from short-term (7 day) or long term (7 - 10 year) storage at -80{degrees}C on parasite recovery, enrichment or viability was observed.\n\nConclusionsHere, an optimized freezing method for P. vivax clinical isolates is demonstrated as a template for the generation and validation of a parasite biobank for use in functional assays.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial viruses (phages) and the immune systems targeted against them significantly impact bacterial survival, evolution, and the emergence of pathogenic strains. While recent research has made spectacular strides towards discovering and validating new defenses in a few model organisms1-3, the inventory of immune systems in clinically-relevant bacteria remains under-explored, and little is known about the mechanisms by which these systems horizontally spread. Such pathways not only impact the evolutionary trajectory of bacterial pathogens, but also threaten to undermine the effectiveness of phage-based therapeutics. Here, we investigate the battery of defenses in staphylococci, opportunistic pathogens that constitute leading causes of antibiotic-resistant infections. We show that these organisms harbor a variety of anti-phage defenses encoded within/near the infamous SCC (staphylococcal cassette chromosome) mec cassettes, mobile genomic islands that confer methicillin resistance. Importantly, we demonstrate that SCCmec-encoded recombinases mobilize not only SCCmec, but also tandem cassettes enriched with diverse defenses. Further, we show that phage infection potentiates cassette mobilization. Taken together, our findings reveal that beyond spreading antibiotic resistance, SCCmec cassettes play a central role in disseminating anti-phage defenses. This work underscores the urgent need for developing adjunctive treatments that target this pathway to save the burgeoning phage therapeutics from suffering the same fate as conventional antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "As a mater regulator in cells, RNA-binding protein (RBP) plays critical roles in organismal development, metabolism and various diseases. It controls gene expression at multiple levels mostly by specific recognition of target RNA. The traditional CLIP-seq method to detect transcriptome-wide RNA targets of RBP is less efficient in yeasts due to their cell walls. Here, we established an efficient HyperTRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins Identified By Editing) in yeast, by fusing a RBP to the hyper active catalytic domain of human RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 and expressing the fusion protein in yeast cells. The target transcripts of RBP were marked with new RNA editing events and identified by high-throughput sequencing. We successfully applied TRIBE to identifying the RNA targets of two yeast RBPs, KHD1 and BFR1. The antibody-free HyperTRIBE has competitive advantages including low background, high sensitivity and reproducibility, and a simple library preparation procedure, which provides a reliable strategy for RBP target identification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

Their effects can lead to adverse physiological changes and necessitate countermeasure development and/or longitudinal monitoring. A time-resolved analysis of biological signals can detect and better characterize potential adverse events during spaceflight, ideally preventing them and maintaining astronauts wellness. Here we provide a time-resolved assessment of the impact of spaceflight on multiple astronauts (n=27) by studying multiple biochemical and immune measurements before, during, and after long-duration orbital spaceflight. We reveal space-associated changes of astronauts physiology on both the individual level and across astronauts, including associations with bone resorption and kidney function, as well as immune-system dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "RNA replication is considered a crucial stage in the origins of life. However, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic RNA replication cycles are impeded by the \"strand separation problem\" (SSP), a form of product inhibition arising from the extraordinary stability of RNA duplexes and their rapid kinetics of reannealing. Here we show that RNA trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) can overcome the SSP by binding to and kinetically trapping dissociated RNA strands in a single-stranded form, while simultaneously serving as substrates for RNA replication by a triplet polymerase ribozyme (TPR). This enabled exponential replication of both (+) and (-) strands of double-stranded RNAs by the TPR when driven by coupled pH and freeze-thaw cycles. We demonstrate replication of a fragment of the ribozyme itself, and open-ended amplification of random RNA sequence pools over >70 cycles, with emergence of partial, distributive TPR self-replication and triplet codon drift towards a primordial genetic code.\n\nOne-sentence summaryRNA trinucleotide substrates together with simple physicochemical cycles enable RNA-catalysed replication of double-stranded RNA and partial, distributive self-replication of an RNA polymerase ribozyme.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydiota are an ancient and hyperdiverse Phylum of obligate intracellular bacteria. The best characterized representatives are pathogens or parasites of mammals, but it is thought that their most common hosts are microeukaryotes like Amoebozoa. The diversity in taxonomy, evolution, and function of non-pathogenic Chlamydiota are slowly being described. Here we use data mining techniques and genomic analysis to extend our current knowledge of Chlamydiota diversity and its hosts, in particular the Order Parachlamydiales. We extract one Rhabdochlamydiaceae and three Simkaniaceae genomes from NCBI Short Read Archive deposits of ciliate and algal genome sequencing projects. We then use these to identify a further 14 and 8 genomes respectively amongst existing, unidentified environmental assemblies. From these data we identify two novel clades with host associated data, for which we propose the names  Candidatus Sacchlamydia (Family Rhabdochlamydiaceae) and  Candidatus Amphrikania (Family Simkaniaceae), as well as a third new clade of environmental MAGs  Candidatus Acheromydia (Family Rhabdochlamydiaceae). The extent of uncharacterized diversity within the Rhabdochlamydiaceae and Simkaniaceae is indicated by 16 of the 22 MAGs being evolutionarily distant from currently characterised genera. Within our limited data, we observe great predicted diversity in Parachlamydiales metabolism and evolution, including the potential for metabolic and defensive symbioses as well as pathogenicity. These data provide an imperative to link genomic diversity in metagenomics data to their associated eukaryotic host, and to develop onward understanding of the functional significance of symbiosis with this hyperdiverse clade.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/533158v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (56K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd4282org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1199065org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156f740org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@829eed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Traditional genome-editing reagents such as CRISPR-Cas9 achieve targeted DNA modification by introducing double-strand breaks (DSBs), thereby stimulating localized DNA repair by endogenous cellular repair factors. While highly effective at generating heterogenous knockout mutations, this approach suffers from undesirable byproducts and an inability to control product purity. Here we develop a system in human cells for programmable, DSB-free DNA integration using Type I CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs). To adapt our previously described CAST systems, we optimized DNA targeting by the QCascade complex through a comprehensive assessment of protein design, and we developed potent transcriptional activators by exploiting the multi-valent recruitment of the AAA+ ATPase, TnsC, to genomic sites targeted by QCascade. After initial detection of plasmid-based transposition, we screened 15 homologous CAST systems from a wide range of bacterial hosts, identified a CAST homolog from Pseudoalteromonas that exhibited improved activity, and increased integration efficiencies through parameter optimization. We further discovered that bacterial ClpX enhances genomic integration by multiple orders of magnitude, and we propose that this critical accessory factor functions to drive active disassembly of the post-transposition CAST complex, akin to its demonstrated role in Mu transposition. Our work highlights the ability to functionally reconstitute complex, multi-component machineries in human cells, and establishes a strong foundation to realize the full potential of CRISPR-associated transposons for human genome engineering.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a multifaceted protein deacetylase/deacylase and a major target for small-molecule modulators of longevity and cancer. In the context of chromatin, SIRT6 removes acetyl groups from histone H3 in nucleosomes, but the molecular basis for its nucleosomal substrate preference is unknown. Our cryo-electron microscopy structure of human SIRT6 in complex with the nucleosome shows that the catalytic domain of SIRT6 pries DNA from the nucleosomal entry-exit site and exposes the histone H3 N-terminal helix, while the SIRT6 zinc-binding domain binds to the histone acidic patch using an arginine anchor. In addition, SIRT6 forms an inhibitory interaction with the C-terminal tail of histone H2A. The structure provides insights into how SIRT6 can deacetylate both H3 K9 and H3 K56.\n\nTeaserThe structure of the SIRT6 deacetylase/nucleosome complex suggests how the enzyme acts on both histone H3 K9 and K56 residues.",

    "abstract": "Faithful DNA replication requires that cells fine-tune their histone pool in coordination with cell-cycle progression. Replication-dependent histone biosynthesis is initiated at a low level upon cell-cycle commitment, followed by a burst at the G1/S transition, but it remains unclear how exactly the cell regulates this change in histone biosynthesis as DNA replication begins. Here, we use single-cell timelapse imaging to elucidate the mechanisms by which cells modulate histone production during different phases of the cell cycle. We find that CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT at the Restriction Point triggers histone transcription, which results in a burst of histone mRNA precisely at the G1/S phase boundary. Excess soluble histone protein further modulates histone abundance by promoting the degradation of histone mRNA for the duration of S phase. Thus, cells regulate their histone production in strict coordination with cell-cycle progression by two distinct mechanisms acting in concert.",
