    "abstract": "The leading cause of the Ebola virus outbreak during 2013-16 in Western Africa was a lack of targeted anti- viral drug choices, a fast rate of mutations and the unavailability of many of the structural proteins and annotations within its genome. The surroundings of the Ebola River in DR-Congo fail to get rid of this endemic, the reason behind this was believed to be its origin from non-human primates, which made its risk assessment and tracing difficult. The Vp35 is a multifunctional protein with innate immune antagonistic properties and is considered one of the most suitable drug targets within this virus. The main motive of this study is to discover a potential anti-viral drug against the Ebola virus by targeting the aforementioned protein with different phytocompounds of oregano that have the lowest binding energies and qualifies over different simulation parameters, so firstly, molecular docking was performed on its 28 compounds using PyRx to get the best complexes with minimum binding energies e.g., -8.9Kcal/mol. Ligands with the best docking scores were gone through Lipinskis rule of five for drug likeliness potential. For the drug affirmation, molecular dynamic simulation was also performed with the best two docked complexes using NAMD/VMD to find out their conformational stability through RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA and H-bond analyses. Current computer-generated prediction suggested that Ursolic acid and Oleanolic acid possess potential inhibitory effects against virus replication. Furthermore, paradigm shifts of usage of natural and herbal products for treating infectious diseases are being encouraged here, However, further wet-lab experiments and clinical trials are still needed to determine the robustness of these virtually tested phytocompounds against the Vp35 protein of the Ebola virus.",

    "abstract": "Biological interpretation of metabolomics datasets often ends at a pathway analysis step to find the over-represented metabolic pathways in the list of statistically significant metabolites. However, definitions of biochemical pathways and metabolite coverage vary among different curated databases, leading to inaccurate and contradicting interpretations. For the lists of gene, transcripts and proteins, Gene Ontology (GO) terms over-presentation analysis has become a standardized approach for the biological interpretation. But, GO analysis has not been achieved for metabolomics datasets. We present a new knowledgebase and the online tool, Gene Ontology Analysis by the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics (IDSL.GOA) to conduct GO over-representation analysis for a metabolite list. The IDSL.GOA knowledgebase covers 2,324 metabolic GO terms and associated 2,818 genes, 22,264 transcripts, 20,158 proteins, 1,482 EC annotations, 2,430 reactions and 2,212 metabolites. IDSL.GOA analysis of a case study of older vs young female brain cortex metabolome highlighted over 250 GO terms being significantly overrepresented (FDR <0.05). On contrast, for the same metabolite list, MetaboAnalyst and Reactome Pathway Analysis suggested less than 5 pathways at FDR <0.05. We showed how IDSL.GOA identified key and relevant GO metabolic processes that were not mentioned by alternative pathway analysis approaches. Overall, we suggest that metabolomics researchers should not limit the interpretation of metabolite lists to only pathway maps and can also leverage GO terms as well. IDSL.GOA provides a powerful tool for this purpose, allowing for a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of metabolite pathway data. IDSL.GOA tool can be accessed at https://goa.idsl.me/",

    "abstract": "Citrus reticulata (Blanco) fruit is native to South East Asia which owns many of the nutritional, medicinal and economic advantages, locally known as \"Kinnow\" and one of the priced mandarin varieties (Dancy, Fuetrells Early and Honey) of Citrus genera renowned for its exclusive taste, vitamin richness, thin peel, long shelf-life and seedless characteristics in Pakistan. However, genetic improvement and breeding strategies of this valued variety are lacking due to the in-housed insufficient genomic and technical resources. Therefore, the current research was initiated to provide the base-line de-novo genome assembly of C. reticulata (seedless kinnow) at a depth of 151x with Illumina paired-end short-read sequencing technology using HiSeq 2500. Whole-genome sequencing resulted in 139,436,350 raw reads ([~]20.09 GB) of data, however, after removing the low-quality reads (1.08%), duplicated sequences (10.5%) and Illumina adaptors, 137,901,462 clean reads were obtained with ([~]18.87 GB) of clean data which was further used for downstream variant calling analysis. In total, 348,861 scaffolds were generated with N50 value of 4827 which constitute 263,018,9 contigs ranging from 71-36,213 with total of 179,984,763 nucleotides. The GC content of the final draft assembly at 71-mer was 34.1%. Moreover, annotation was performed with \"Hayai-Annotation Plants\" tool which marked the whole-genome mapping with three main functional databases of interpro, Pfam and gene ontology. Additionally, in-silico identification of 111,032 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) was also accomplished with the help of GMATA tool, which may be used for further screening and genetic improvement of the citrus varieties by means of this current assembly as a resource of local reference genome.",

    "abstract": "Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) develops in stratified epithelial tissues and demonstrates frequent alterations in transcriptional regulators. We sought to discover SCC-specific transcriptional programs and identified the transcription factor Basonuclin 1 (BNC1) as highly expressed in SCC compared to other tumor types. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis identified pro-proliferative genes activated by BNC1 in SCC cells and keratinocytes. Inhibition of BNC1 in SCC cells suppressed proliferation and increased migration via FRA1. In contrast, BNC1 reduction in keratinocytes caused differentiation, which was abrogated by IRF6 knockdown, leading to increased migration. Protein interactome analysis identified PRMT1 as a co-activator of BNC1-dependent proliferative genes. Inhibition of PRMT1 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in SCC cell proliferation without increasing migration. Importantly, therapeutic inhibition of PRMT1 in SCC xenografts significantly reduced tumor size, resembling functional effects of BNC1 knockdown. Together, we identify BNC1-PRMT1 as an SCC-lineage specific transcriptional axis that promotes cancer growth, which can be therapeutically targeted to inhibit SCC tumorigenesis.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/533164v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@97dd68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@48ebaaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167eb2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180b325_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Natural products belonging to different chemical classes have been established as a promising source of novel anticancer drugs. Several low molecular weight compounds from the classes of monoterpenes, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids were shown to possess anticancer activities in previous studies. In this work, over 20 semisynthetic derivatives of molecules belonging to these classes, namely thymol, eugenol and 6-hydroxyflavanone were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines, namely gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS cells) and human lung carcinoma (A549 cells). An initial screening based on viability assessment was performed in order to identify the most cytotoxic compounds at 100 M. The results evidenced that two 6-hydroxyflavanone derivatives were the most cytotoxic among the compounds tested, being selected for further studies. Noteworthy, in a general way some of the derivatives synthesized displayed enhanced toxicity when compared with their natural counterparts. Moreover, LDH assay showed that the loss of cell viability was not accompanied by a loss of membrane integrity, thus ruling out a necrotic process. Morphological studies with AGS cells demonstrated chromatin condensation compatible with apoptosis, confirmed by the activation of caspase 3/7. Furthermore, a viability assay on non-cancer human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) confirmed these two derivatives possess selective anticancer activity.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.Tm) poses a considerable threat to public health due to its zoonotic potential. Human infections are mostly foodborne, and pork and pork products are ranked among the top culprits for transmission. In addition, the high percentage of antibiotic resistance, especially in monophasic S.Tm, limits treatment options when needed. Better S.Tm control would therefore be of benefit both for farm animals and for safety of the human food chain.\n\nA promising pre-harvest intervention is vaccination. In this study we tested safety and immunogenicity of an oral inactivated S.Tm vaccine, which has been recently shown to generate an \"evolutionary trap\" and to massively reduce S.Tm colonization and transmission in mice. We show that this vaccine is highly immunogenic and safe in post-weaning pigs and that administration of a single oral dose results in a strong and long-lasting serum IgG response. This has several advantages over existing - mainly live - vaccines against S.Tm, both in improved seroconversion and reduced risk of vaccine-strain persistence and reversion to virulence.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic chemical probes are small molecule reagents that utilise naturally occurring biosynthetic enzymes for in situ incorporation into biomolecules of interest. These reagents can be used to label, detect, and track important biological processes within living cells including protein synthesis, protein glycosylation and nucleic acid proliferation. A limitation of current chemical probes, which have largely focused on mammalian cells, is that they often cannot be applied to other organisms due to metabolic differences. For example, the thymidine derivative 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) is a gold standard metabolic chemical probe for assessing DNA proliferation in mammalian cells however is unsuitable for the study of malaria parasites due to Plasmodium species lacking the thymidine kinase enzyme that is essential for metabolism of EdU. Herein we report the design and synthesis of new thymidine-based probes that sidestep the requirement for a thymidine kinase enzyme in Plasmodium. Two of these DNADetect probes exhibit robust labelling of replicating asexual intraerythrocytic P. falciparum parasites, as determined by flow cytometry using copper catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) to a fluorescent azide. The DNADetect chemical probes are synthetically accessible and thus can be made widely available to researchers as tools to further understand the biology of different Plasmodium species, including laboratory lines and clinical isolates.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity helps animals to buffer the effects of increasing thermal and nutritional stress created by climate change. Studies have shown that plastic responses to single and combined stressors can vary among genetically diverged populations. However, less is known about how plasticity in response to combined stress varies among individuals within a population or whether such variation changes across life-history traits. This is important because individual variation within populations shapes population level responses to environmental change. Here, we used isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster to assess plasticity of egg-adult viability and sex-specific body size for combinations of two temperatures (25{degrees}C or 28{degrees}C) and three diets (standard diet, low caloric diet, or low protein:carbohydrate ratio diet). Our results reveal substantial within-population genetic variation in plasticity for egg-to-adult viability and wing size in response to combined thermal-nutritional stress. This genetic variation in plasticity was a result of cross-environment genetic correlations that were generally < 1 rather than changes in the expression of genetic variation across environments. Cross-sex genetic correlations for body size were weaker when the sexes were reared in different conditions, suggesting wing size has the potential to evolve independently across sexes. Further, our results suggest that plasticity in egg-adult viability is genetically independent from plasticity in body size. By quantifying plasticity in response to combined stress between sexes and across traits, our study aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential for populations to adapt to ongoing climate change.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHeterochromatic gene silencing relies on combinatorial control by specific histone modifications, the occurrence of transcription, and/or RNA degradation. Once nucleated, heterochromatin propagates within defined chromosomal regions and is maintained throughout cell divisions to warrant proper genome expression and integrity. The fission yeast Ccr4-Not complex has been involved in gene silencing, but its relative contribution to distinct heterochromatin domains and its role in nucleation versus spreading have remained elusive. Here, we unveil major functions for Ccr4-Not in silencing and heterochromatin spreading at the mating type locus and subtelomeres. Mutations of the catalytic subunits Caf1 or Mot2, involved in RNA deadenylation and protein ubiquitinylation respectively, result in impaired propagation of H3K9me3 and massive accumulation of nucleation-distal heterochromatic transcripts. Both silencing and spreading defects are suppressed upon disruption of the heterochromatin antagonizing factor Epe1. Overall, our results position the Ccr4-Not complex as a critical, dual regulator of heterochromatic gene silencing and spreading.\n\nAuthor SummaryEukaryotic genomes are partitioned into relaxed, gene-rich regions, and condensed, gene-poor domains called heterochromatin. The maintenance of heterochromatin is crucial for proper genome expression and integrity, and requires multiple factors regulating histone modifications and/or the levels of RNA molecules produced from these regions. Such effectors not only promote heterochromatin assembly but also ensure its propagation from specific nucleation sites to defined domain boundaries. However, while the mechanisms involved in initiation of heterochromatin formation have been well documented, the molecular and biochemical properties underlying its spreading remain largely elusive. By combining genetic and single-cell approaches, we report here that the fission yeast Ccr4-Not complex, a multisubunit complex conserved throughout eukaryotes, is essential for efficient heterochromatin spreading to repress expression of nucleation-distal RNAs. The two catalytic activities of the complex, RNA deadenylation and protein ubiquitinylation, are each critical, thereby defining a dual enzymatic requirement in the process.",

We have developed a cellular transcriptome atlas of the miracidium larva of Schistosoma mansoni, the first post-embryonic stage of development. The miracidium infects a snail host, inside which its stem cells generate daughter sporocysts that give rise to human-infective cercariae larvae. We use a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, in situ hybridisation and image analysis to characterise the miracidia. Each larva comprises [~]365 cells and 19 transcriptionally distinct cell types. We show that 93% of miracidium cells are somatic (>45% neural, 19% muscle, 13% tegument, 2% parenchyma, 2% protonephridia) and the remaining 7% are stem cells. Cellular diversity within tissue types is revealed, including two transcriptionally distinct muscle clusters, corresponding to the circular and the longitudinal muscles of the body wall, as well as two stem cell populations that show different activation states and cluster further by sex. This whole-body atlas provides new insight into the organisation of the larva and lays the foundation for understanding how the somatic cells drive the behaviour and physiology necessary for infection and propagation of the stem cells inside the snail.",

    "abstract": "Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that originate from chromaffin cells in the adrenal gland. However, the cellular molecular characteristics and immune microenvironment of PCCs are incompletely understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 16 tissues from 4 sporadic unclassified PCC patients and 1 hereditary PCC patient with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. We found that intra-tumoral heterogeneity was less extensive than the inter-individual heterogeneity of PCCs, a finding inconsistent with the widely-used PASS evaluation system. We further divided the unclassified PCC patients into two types, metabolism-type (marked by NDUFA4L2 and COX4I2) and kinase-type (marked by RET and PNMT), validated by immunohistochemical staining. Trajectory analysis of tumor evolution revealed that metabolism-type PCC cells display phenotype of consistently active metabolism and increased malignant potential, while kinase-type PCC cells showed decreased epinephrine synthesis and neuron-like phenotypes. Cellular communication analysis showed activation of the annexin pathway and a strong inflammation reaction in metabolism-type PCCs and activation of FGF signaling in the kinase-type PCC. Although multispectral immunofluorescence staining showed a lack of CD8+ T cell infiltration in both metabolism-type and kinase-type PCCs, only the kinase-type PCC exhibited downregulation of HLA- molecules that possibly regulated by RET, suggesting the potential of combined therapy with kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy for kinase-type PCCs; in contrast, the application of immunotherapy to metabolism-type PCCs (with antigen presentation ability) is likely unsuitable. Our study presents a single-cell transcriptomics-based molecular classification and microenvironment characterization of PCCs, providing clues for potential therapeutic strategies to treat PCCs.",

    "abstract": "Polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are cell wall-anchored proteins that inhibit pathogen polygalacturonases (PGs). PGIPs, like other resistance genes, contain extracytoplasmic leucine-rich repeats (eLRRs), which are required for pathogen PG recognition. The importance of these PGIPs in plant defense has been well documented. This study focuses on chickpea (Cicer arietinum) PGIPs (CaPGIPs) owing to limited information available on this important crop. In this study, we identified and characterized two novel Capgips (Capgip3 and Capgip4) in addition to the previously reported Capgip1 and Capgip2. Our analysis showed that CaPGIP1, CaPGIP3, and CaPGIP4 proteins contain N-terminal signal peptides, ten LRRs, theoretical molecular mass, and isoelectric points like other legume PGIPs. However, the previously reported CaPGIP2 cannot be classified as a true PGIP since it lacked a signal peptide, more than half of the LRRs, and other characteristics of a typical PGIP. Phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment revealed that the Capgip amino acid sequences are similar to the other reported legumes. Several cis-acting elements that are typical of pathogen response, tissue-specific activity, hormone response, and abiotic stress-related are present in the promoters of Capgip1, Capgip3, and Capgip4. Localization experiments showed that Capgip1, Capgip3, and Capgip4 are located in the cell wall or membrane, whereas Capgip2 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Capgip transcript levels analyzed at normal conditions show constitutive tissue specific expression and heterozygous expression patterns analogous to other defense related gene families. All these findings suggest that CaPGIPs could have the potential to combat chickpea pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Cells originating from the same tissue can respond differently to external signals depending on the genotypic and phenotypic state of the cell and its local environment. We have developed a semi-quantitative-computational model to analyze the intracellular signaling network and its outcome in the presence of multiple external signals including growth factors, hormones, and extracellular matrix. We use this model to analyze the cells mechanical response to external stimuli and identify the key internal elements of the network that drive specific outcomes within the response space. The model is built upon the Boolean approach to network modeling, where the state of any given node is determined using the state of the connecting nodes and Boolean logic. This allows us to analyze the network behavior without the need to estimate all the various interaction rates between different cellular components. However, such an approach is limited in its ability to predict network dynamics and temporal evolution of the cell state. So, we introduce modularity in the model and incorporate dynamical aspects, mass-action kinetics, and chemo-mechanical effects on only certain transition rates within specific modules as required, creating a Boolean-Hybrid-Modular (BoHyM) signal transduction model. We present this model as a comprehensive, cell-type agnostic, user-modifiable tool to investigate how extra-and intra-cellular signaling can regulate cellular cytoskeletal components and consequently influence cell-substrate interactions, force generation, and migration. Using this tool, we show how slight changes in signaling network architectures due to phenotypic changes can alter cellular response to stress hormone signaling in an environment-dependent manner. The tool also allows isolating effector proteins driving specific cellular mechanical responses. Ultimately, we show the utility of the tool in analyzing transient chemo-mechanical dynamics of cells in response to time-varying chemical stimuli.",

But almost all research has ignored the participation of insects which may transport pollens from the nectar to stigmas, and that pollens may germinate on the dry stigma since they have soaked in the nectar. So, the key question is that whether insects carry pollens from nectar to the stigma.\n\nSince the adult Lepidoptera are important to the plant pollination and there is a general consensus that pollens are mainly deposited on the proboscis of adult Lepidoptera, and pollens are ubiquitous in the nectar of field flowers, we simulated the flower environment to conduct several groups of behavioral experiments in the adult Mythimna separata by controlling the presence, absence or movement of pollens in nectar, then counted and compared the proboscis pollens.\n\nWe found that the pollens on the proboscis were mainly derived from the nectar.\n\nOur conclusion may contributes to the research of pollen germination on stigmas, especially the dry stigma, and also shows the importance of adult Lepidoptera to pollination, even supports the coevolution of Lepidoptera and angiosperm.",

    "abstract": "The role of proteostasis and organelle homeostasis dysfunction in human aging and Alzheimers disease (AD) remains unclear. Analyzing proteome-wide changes in human donor fibroblasts and their corresponding transdifferentiated neurons (tNeurons), we find aging and AD synergistically impair multiple proteostasis pathways, most notably lysosomal quality control (LQC). In particular, we show that ESCRT-mediated lysosomal repair defects are associated with both sporadic and PSEN1 familial AD. Aging- and AD-linked defects are detected in fibroblasts but highly exacerbated in tNeurons, leading to enhanced neuronal vulnerability, unrepaired lysosomal damage, inflammatory factor secretion and cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, tNeurons from aged and AD donors spontaneously develop amyloid-{beta} inclusions co-localizing with LQC markers, LAMP1/2-positive lysosomes and proteostasis factors; we observe similar inclusions in brain tissue from AD patients and APP-transgenic mice. Importantly, compounds enhancing lysosomal function broadly ameliorate these AD-associated pathologies. Our findings establish cell-autonomous LQC dysfunction in neurons as a central vulnerability in aging and AD pathogenesis.",

Contrast with the extracellular and nuclear regulation, how Dpp morphogen gradient is shaped and interpreted by endocytic trafficking remains unclear. To address this, here we generate novel fluorescent protein tagged dpp alleles that allow to visualize both extracellular and intracellular Dpp distribution. Using these alleles, we found that, while blocking endocytosis expanded the extracellular Dpp gradient and impaired Dpp signaling, blocking early endosome expanded not only the extracellular Dpp gradient but also Dpp signaling range due to impaired downregulation of activated receptors. We show that blocking multivesicular body (MVB) formation, but not late endosome, expanded Dpp signaling and caused accumulation of the intracellular Dpp without affecting the extracellular Dpp gradient. These results indicate that, while the early endocytosis acts as a sink for Dpp and initiates Dpp signaling, termination of Dpp signaling at MVB is required for interpretation of the extracellular Dpp gradient. Taken together, our results reveal that extracellular Dpp morphogen gradient is shaped and interpreted by distinct endocytic trafficking pathways.",

    "abstract": "KRASG12C inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape for cancer patients harboring the G12C mutant isoform of KRAS. With the recent FDA approval of sotorasib and adagrasib, patients now have access to more promising treatment options. However, patients who receive these agents as a monotherapy usually develop drug resistance. Thus, there is a need to develop logical combination strategies that can delay or prevent the onset of resistance and simultaneously enhance the antitumor effectiveness of the treatment regimen. In this study, we aimed at pharmacologically targeting PAK4 by KPT9274 in combination with KRASG12C inhibitors in KRASG12C mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) preclinical models. PAK4 is a hub molecule that links several major signaling pathways and is known for its tumorigenic role in mutant Ras-driven cancers. We assessed the cytotoxicity of PAK4 and KRASG12C inhibitors combination in KRASG12C mutant 2D and 3D cellular models. KPT9274 synergized with both sotorasib and adagrasib in inhibiting the growth of KRASG12C mutant cancer cells. The combination was able to reduce the clonogenic potential of KRASG12C mutant PDAC cells. We also evaluated the antitumor activity of the combination in a KRASG12C mutant PDAC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model. Oral administration of a sub-optimal dose of KPT9274 in combination with sotorasib (at one-fourth of MTD) demonstrated significant inhibition of the tumor burden (p = 0.002). Similarly, potent antitumor efficacy was observed in an NSCLC CDX model where KPT9274, acting as an adjuvant, prevented tumor relapse following the discontinuation of sotorasib treatment (p = 0.0001). KPT9274 and sotorasib combination also resulted in enhanced survival. This is the first study showing that KRASG12C inhibitors can synergize with PAK4 inhibitor KPT9274 both in vitro and in vivo resulting in remarkably enhanced antitumor activity and survival outcomes.\n\nSignificanceKRASG12C inhibitors demonstrate limited durable response in patients with KRASG12C mutations. In this study, combining PAK4 inhibitor KPT9274 with KRASG12C inhibitors has resulted in potent antitumor effects in preclinical cancer models of PDAC and NSCLC. Our results bring forward a novel combination therapy for cancer patients that do not respond or develop resistance to KRASG12C inhibitor treatment.",

    "abstract": "RationaleDesigner receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) are a tool for \"remote control\" of defined neuronal populations during behavior. These receptors are inert unless bound by an experimenter-administered designer drug, most commonly clozapine-n-oxide (CNO). However, questions have emerged about the suitability of CNO as a systemically administered DREADD agonist.\n\nObjectivesSecond-generation agonists such as JHU37160 (J60) have been developed, which may have more favorable properties than CNO. Here we sought to directly compare effects of CNO (0, 1, 5, & 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and J60 (0, 0.03, 0.3, & 3 mg/kg, i.p.) on operant food pursuit.\n\nMethodsMale and female TH:Cre+ rats and their wildtype (WT) littermates received cre-dependent hM4Di-mCherry vector injections into ventral tegmental area (VTA), causing inhibitory DREADD expression in VTA dopamine neurons in TH:Cre+ rats. Rats were trained to stably lever press for palatable food on a fixed ratio 10 schedule, and doses of both agonists were tested on separate days in a counterbalanced order.\n\nResultsAll three CNO doses reduced operant food seeking in rats with DREADDs, and no CNO dose had behavioral effects in WT controls. The highest tested J60 dose significantly reduced responding in DREADD rats, but this dose also increased responding in WTs, indicating non-specific effects. The magnitude of CNO and J60 effects in TH:Cre+ rats were correlated and were present in both sexes.\n\nConclusionsFindings demonstrate the usefulness of directly comparing DREADD agonists when optimizing behavioral chemogenetics, and highlight the importance of proper controls, regardless of the DREADD agonist employed.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial-fungal interactions (BFIs) influence microbial community performance of most ecosystems and elicit specific microbial behaviours, including stimulating specialised metabolite production. Using a simple BFI system encompassing the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the black mould fungus Aspergillus niger, we established a co-culture experimental evolution method to investigate bacterial adaptation to the presence of a fungus. In the evolving populations, B. subtilis was rapidly selected for enhanced production of the lipopeptide surfactin and accelerated surface spreading ability, leading to inhibition of fungal expansion and acidification of the environment. These phenotypes were explained by specific mutations in the DegS-DegU two-component system. In the presence of surfactin, fungal hyphae exhibited bulging cells with delocalised secretory vesicles and RlmA-dependent cell wall stress induction. Increased surfactin production typically enhances the competitive success of bacteria against fungi, which likely explains the primary adaption path in the presence of A. niger.\n\nSignificance statementExperimental evolution and co-cultivation of different microbes are important and useful techniques for discovering new traits and unravelling cryptic regulatory connections. We combined these methods by evolving the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis in the presence of the black mould fungus Aspergillus niger that were previously shown to engage in an intricate and physical interaction. Both are ubiquitous, environmentally and industrially relevant model microbes in the colonisation of rhizo- and endosphere and in the production of enzymes.

    "abstract": "PurposeGalleria mellonella larvae have emerged as an invertebrate model for studying bacterial pathogenesis and novel therapeutic options due to ethical concerns associated with the use of mammalian models such as mice. The benefits of using G. mellonella larvae include a less complex microbiome in the gut, making it suitable for gut colonization studies. The intestinal colonization of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) and Escherichia coli (Ec), two of the most antibiotic-resistant bacteria on the World Health Organizations (WHO) priority list, plays a key role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophage therapy is emerging as a promising alternative for antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to its ability to specifically target and infect bacterial hosts, making it suitable for gut decontamination. This study aimed to establish a novel Enterobacteriaceae G. mellonella larvae gut colonization model and compare the efficacy of conventional antibiotic treatment with a one-time phage cocktail in decolonizing the gut.\n\nApproachLarvae were force-fed with different concentrations of bacterial doses of K. pneumoniae and E. coli at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h, followed by survival monitoring at 24 h intervals. After 48 h and 120 h of the last force feed, the colony forming unit (CFU) count in the gut was evaluated. After successful colonization, larvae were one-time force-fed with either a 107 PFU/larvae bacteriophage cocktail or with ciprofloxacin 4 mg/L or meropenem 2 mg/L. After 24 h post phage feeding, CFU counts were determined.\n\nMain findingsThree bacterial doses of 106 CFU/larvae led to a stable gut colonization in the larvae gut regardless of the K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains. Bacteriophage force-feeding reduced bacterial colonization by 4 log10 CFU/larvae whereas antibiotic treatment led to a 2 log10 CFU/larvae reduction compared to the control. The novel alternative G. mellonella model for gut colonization studies can be used for proof-of-concept studies, reducing or even obviating the number of follow-up experiments in vertebrate models.",

However, attenuated DNA damage and transient oxygen depletion are among several proposed models. Here, we tested whether FLASH-RT under physioxic (4% O2) and hypoxic conditions ([&le;]2% O2) reduces genome-wide translocations relative to CONV-RT and whether any differences identified revert under normoxic (21% O2) conditions. We employed high-throughput rejoin and genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS-JoinT-seq), using S. aureus and S. pyogenes Cas9 \"bait\" DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), to measure differences in bait-proximal repair and their genome-wide translocations to \"prey\" DSBs generated by electron beam CONV-RT (0.08-0.13Gy/s) and FLASH-RT (1x102-5x106 Gy/s), under varying ionizing radiation (IR) doses and oxygen tensions. Normoxic and physioxic irradiation of HEK293T cells increased translocations at the cost of decreasing bait-proximal repair but were indistinguishable between CONV-RT and FLASH-RT. Although no apparent increase in chromosome translocations was observed with hypoxia-induced apoptosis, the combined decrease in oxygen tension with IR dose-rate modulation did not reveal significant differences in the level of translocations nor in their junction structures. Thus, Irrespective of oxygen tension, FLASH-RT produces translocations and junction structures at levels and proportions that are indistinguishable from CONV-RT.",

    "abstract": "Soybean stem canker (SSC) caused by the fungal pathogen Diaporthe caulivora is an important disease affecting soybean production. However, limited information related to the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean resistance to Diaporthe species is available. In the present work, the defense responses to D. caulivora in two contrasting soybean genotypes were analyzed. We showed that Genesis 5601 is more resistant to fungal infection than Williams, evidenced by significantly smaller lesion length, reduced disease severity and pathogen biomass. Transcriptional profiling was performed in untreated plants and in D. caulivora-inoculated and control-treated tissues at 8 and 48 hours post inoculation (hpi). In total, 2.322 and 1.855 genes were differentially expressed in Genesis 5601 and Williams, respectively. Interestingly, Genesis 5601 exhibited a significantly higher number of upregulated genes compared to Williams at 8 hpi, 1.028 versus 434 genes. Resistance to D. caulivora was associated with defense activation through transcriptional reprogramming mediating perception of the pathogen by receptors, biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, hormones, small heat shock proteins and pathogenesis related (PR) genes. These findings provide novel insights into soybean defense molecular mechanisms used to control D. caulivora, and generate a foundation for development of resistant SSC varieties within soybean breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Modern microscopy has revealed that core nuclear functions, including transcription, replication, and heterochromatin formation occur in spatially restricted clusters. Previous work from our lab has shown that subnuclear high-concentration clusters of transcription factors may play a role in regulating RNA synthesis in the early Drosophila embryo. A nearly ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic transcription factors is that they contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that often arise from low complexity amino acid sequences within the protein. It has been proposed that IDRs within transcription factors drive co-localization of transcriptional machinery and target genes into high concentration clusters within nuclei. Here we test that hypothesis directly, by conducting a broad survey of the subnuclear localization of IDRs derived from transcription factors. Using a novel algorithm to identify IDRs in the Drosophila proteome, we generated a library of IDRs from transcription factors expressed in the early Drosophila embryo. We used this library to perform a high throughput imaging screen in Drosophila S2 cells. We found that while subnuclear clustering does not occur when the majority of IDRs are expressed alone, it is frequently seen in full length transcription factors. These results are consistent in live Drosophila embryos, suggesting that IDRs are insufficient to drive the subnuclear clustering behavior of transcription factors. Furthermore, the clustering of transcription factors in living embryos was unaffected by the deletion of IDR sequences. Our results demonstrate that IDRs are unlikely to be the primary molecular drivers of the clustering observed during transcription, suggesting a more complex and nuanced role for these disordered protein sequences.",

    "abstract": "Extent and efficacy of DNA end resection at DNA double strand break (DSB)s determines the choice of repair pathway. Here we describe how the 53BP1 associated protein DYNLL1 works in tandem with Shieldin and the CST complex to protect DNA ends. DYNLL1 is recruited to DSBs by 53BP1 where it limits end resection by binding and disrupting the MRE11 dimer. The Shieldin complex is recruited to a fraction of 53BP1-positive DSBs hours after DYNLL1 predominantly in the G1 cells. Shieldin localization to DSBs is dependent on MRE11 activity and is regulated by the interaction of DYNLL1 with MRE11. BRCA1-deficient cells rendered resistant to PARP inhibitors by the loss of Shieldin proteins can be re-sensitized by the constitutive association of DYNLL1 with MRE11. These results define the temporal and functional dynamics of the 53BP1-centric DNA end resection factors in cells.",

    "abstract": "Hard ticks feed on their host for multiple days. To ensure firm attachment, they secrete a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid cement cone. The underlying mechanism of this liquid-to-solid transition is not yet understood. This study focuses on the phase transitions of a disordered glycine-rich protein (GRP) that is prominent in tick saliva. We show that GRP undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation via simple coacervation to form biomolecular condensates in salty environments. Cation-pi and pi-pi interactions near the C-terminus promote coacervation while a negatively charged N-terminus prolongs its onset through electrostatic repulsion. Interestingly, GRP condensates exhibit ageing and undergo liquid-to-gel transition to form viscoelastic networks as well as solid-like condensates. Lastly, we provide evidence for protein-rich condensates in natural tick saliva. Our findings provide a starting point to gain insights into the bioadhesion of ticks, develop novel tick control strategies, and towards biomedical applications such as tissue sealants.",

    "abstract": "The preferences of consumers for different flavours and aromas in wine are varied and may be explained by inherent factors such as cultural background, wine education and personal taste of the wine consumer. Wine flavour as perceived in the mouth includes aroma compounds released through the retronasal pathway which are shaped by interactions with saliva. Saliva and wine interactions could provide an explanation as to why wine tasters express different preferences for wine. To test this hypothesis, 13 Western and 13 Chinese experienced wine tasters were recruited. Sensory evaluation was performed in formal surroundings to acquire free description-based and perceived sensory intensity data using the Pivot(R) Profile and continuous scale assessment, respectively. Participants saliva samples were collected before the sensory evaluation and spiked into a wine sample to investigate the impact on the wine volatile release using GCxGC-MS. Saliva samples were subjected to enzyme activity assays and protein composition profiling by Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) quantitative proteomics. The wine tasters showed differences in wine flavour perception, which was supported by the difference in wine volatile release resulting from the addition of saliva. The two groups of participants did not have significant differences in total salivary protein concentrations or the amounts of esterase and -amylase. However, statistically significant variations in the concentrations of specific proteins (proline-rich proteins (PRPs) and lipocalin-1 (LCN-1); p < 0.01) were found between the two groups. Significant correlations between perceived intensities of wine attributes and concentrations of PRPs and LCN-1 were observed. These results indicate that the composition of proteins in saliva are a factor that influences wine perception and preference. Our results provide a biochemical basis to understanding preference for food based on interactions between aroma compounds and salivary proteins and could be used to suggest foods or beverages to particular cultural groups.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens led to a critical need for new antibiotics. A key property of effective antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria is their ability to permeate through the bacterial outer membrane via transmembrane porin proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are in principle capable of modeling antibiotic permeation across outer membrane porins (OMPs). However, owing to sampling problems, it has remained challenging to obtain converged potentials of mean force (PMFs) for antibiotic permeation across OMPs. Here, we investigated the convergence of PMFs obtained with three advanced flavors of the umbrella sampling (US) technique aimed to quantify the permeation of the antibiotic fosmidomycin across the OprO porin: (i) Hamiltonian replica-exchange with solute tempering in combination with US, (ii) simulated tempering-enhanced US, and (iii) replica-exchange US. To quantify the PMF convergence and to reveal hysteresis problems, we computed several independent sets of US simulations started from pulling simulations in outward and inward permeation directions. We find that replica-exchange US in combination with well-chosen restraints is highly successful for obtaining converged PMFs of fosmidomycin permeation through OprO, reaching PMFs converged to sub-kilocalorie per mole accuracy.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/534415v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecfd61org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef1445org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11be702org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db6202_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We showed that the enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is strictly required for the transformation of thymic immature progenitors and for the growth of human T-ALL, which remain dependent on ACLY activity even upon transformation. Whereas PTEN mutant mice all died within 17 weeks, the concomitant ACLY deletion prevented disease initiation in 70% of the animals, where it prevented the apoptosis of pre-malignant DP thymocytes by up-regulating BCL-2. Transcriptomic and metabolic analysis of primary T-ALL cells next translated our findings to the human pathology, showing that PTEN-altered T-ALL cells selectively activate ACLY and are specifically sensitive to its genetic targeting. ACLY activation thus represents a metabolic vulnerability with therapeutic potential for high-risk T-ALL patients.",

    "abstract": "APOL1 high-risk variants partially explain the high kidney disease prevalence among African ancestry individuals. Many mechanisms have been reported in cell culture models, but few have been demonstrated in mouse models. Here we characterize two models: (1) HIV- associated nephropathy (HIVAN) Tg26 mice crossed with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)/APOL1 transgenic mice and (2) interferon-{psi} administered to BAC/APOL1 mice. Both models showed exacerbated glomerular disease in APOL1-G1 compared to APOL1-G0 mice. HIVAN model glomerular bulk RNA-seq identified synergistic podocyte-damaging pathways activated by the APOL1-G1 allele and by HIV transgenes. Single-nuclear RNA-seq revealed podocyte-specific patterns of differentially-expressed genes as a function of APOL1 alleles. Eukaryotic Initiation factor-2 pathway was the most activated pathway in the interferon-{psi} model and the most deactivated pathway in the HIVAN model. HIVAN mouse model podocyte single-nuclear RNA-seq data showed similarity to human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) glomerular bulk RNA-seq data. Furthermore, single-nuclear RNA-seq data from interferon-{psi} mouse model podocytes (in vivo) showed similarity to human FSGS single-cell RNA- seq data from urine podocytes (ex vivo) and from human podocyte cell lines (in vitro) using bulk RNA-seq. These data highlight differences in the transcriptional effects of the APOL1-G1 risk variant in a model specific manner. Shared differentially expressed genes in podocytes in both mouse models suggest possible novel glomerular damage markers in APOL1 variant-induced diseases. Transcription factor Zbtb16 was downregulated in podocytes and endothelial cells in both models, possibly contributing to glucocorticoid-resistance. In summary, these findings in two mouse models suggest both shared and distinct therapeutic opportunities for APOL1 glomerulopathies.\n\nSignificance statementCoding variants in APOL1, encoding apolipoprotein L1, contribute to kidney disease in individuals with African ancestry. The mechanisms for glomerular injury remain incompletely understood. We studied two transgenic mouse models, HIV-associated nephropathy and interferon-{psi} administration. Using glomerular and single-nuclear RNA sequencing, we identified genes differentially expressed among mice with kidney risk alleles (G1) and the common variant (G0). Both models exhibited up-regulation of genes that indicated podocyte damage with risk alleles compared to the common variant. One gene down-regulated in both models was Zbtb16, encoding a transcription factor, that may contribute to glucocorticoid-resistance. Overall, the findings suggest both shared and distinct alterations in the two disease models.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid sensing by endolysosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) plays a crucial role in innate immune responses to invading pathogens. In contrast, aberrant activation of these pathways is associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The endolysosomal solute carrier family 15 member 4 (SLC15A4) is required for TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9-induced inflammatory responses and for disease development in different SLE models. SLC15A4 has been proposed to affect TLR7-9 activation through its transport activity, as well as by assembling in an IRF5-activating signalling complex with the innate immune adaptor TASL, but the relative contribution of these different functions remains unclear. Here we show that the essential role of SLC15A4 is to recruit TASL to the endolysosomal compartment, while its transport activity is dispensable. Targeting of TASL to the endolysosomal compartment is sufficient to rescue TLR7-9-induced IRF5 activation in SLC15A4-deficient cells. In line with this, lysosomal-localized TASL restored proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon responses in absence of SLC15A4. Our study reveals that SLC15A4 acts as a signalling scaffold and that this transport-independent function is essential to control TLR7-9-mediated inflammatory responses. These findings further support targeting the SLC15A4-TASL complex as a potential therapeutic strategy for SLE and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is an efficient colonizer of human gastrointestinal tracts and skin and is an opportunistic pathogen. C. albicans exhibits morphological plasticity and the ability to switch between yeast and filamentous morphologies is associated with virulence. One regulator of this switch is the quorum sensing molecule farnesol which is produced by C. albicans throughout growth. However, the synthesis, secretion, regulation, and turnover of farnesol is not fully understood. To address this, we used our improved farnesol assay to screen a transcription regulator knockout library of 164 mutants for farnesol accumulation in whole cultures, pellets, and supernatants. All mutants produced farnesol and they averaged 9.2X more farnesol in the pellet than the supernatant. Nineteen mutants had significant differences with ten mutants producing more farnesol than their SN152+ parent while nine produced less. Seven mutants exhibited greater secretion of farnesol while two exhibited less. We examined the time course for farnesol accumulation in six mutants with the greatest accumulation differences and found that those differences persisted throughout growth and they were not time dependent. Significantly, two high accumulating mutants did not exhibit the decay in farnesol levels during stationary phase characteristic of wild type C. albicans, suggesting that a farnesol modification/degradation mechanism is absent in these mutants. Identifying these transcriptional regulators provides new insight into farnesols physiological functions regarding cell cycle progression, white-opaque switching, yeast-mycelial dimorphism, and response to cellular stress.",

The current study seeks to assess the prevalence of various H. sp. in the gastric mucosa of slaughtered and dead pigs, as well as the prevalence of Helicobacter infection among pig farmers. A total of 403 stomach samples from various pig slaughter points, 74 necropsy samples from various pig farms and 97 stool samples from pig farmers were collected from Assam, India. Among 477 pig stomach samples tested, 214 samples with gastritis (20.09%) showed Gram negative, spiral-shaped organisms in brush cytology from the mucosal surface, and the rest of the 263 stomach samples without any gastric lesion showed only 3.04% Gram negative, spiral-shaped organisms. In ultrastructure investigation, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the four urease positive stomach samples revealed a tightly coiled Helicobacter bacterium (spiral-shaped) found in the mucous lining of the stomach. In histopathological examination of pars esophagia, cardiac and fundic mucosa showed chronic gastritis associated with hemorrhagic necrosis, leucocytic infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages, and lymphoid aggregates (lymphoid follicles) etc. PCR confirmed 16S rRNA genes of Helicobacter suis (H. suis) where a total of 42 (19.63%) out of 214 pig stomach samples and 2 (2.08%) out of 96 stool samples of pig farmers were found positive for H. suis. of these 96 stool samples of pig farmers 3 (3.12%) were confirmed positive for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Phosphoglucosamine mutase gene in PCR. Phylogenic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of H. suis showed distinct clusters with other H. sp. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the prevalence of Helicobacter both in pig gastric mucosa and human stool. The findings highlight the need for improved sanitation and hygiene practices among pig farmers to minimize the risk of Helicobacter infection in humans.",

    "abstract": "In virtually all eukaryotes, the mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA) encodes proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the RNA machinery required for their synthesis inside the mitochondria. Appropriate regulation of mtDNA copy number and expression is essential for ensuring the correct stoichiometric formation of OXPHOS complexes assembled from both nuclear- and mtDNA-encoded subunits. The mechanisms of mtDNA regulation are not completely understood but are essential to organismal viability and lifespan. Here, using multiple approaches, we identify the presence of N6-methylation (6mA) on the mtDNA of diverse animal and plant species. Importantly, we also demonstrate that this modification is regulated in C. elegans by the DNA methyltransferase DAMT-1, and DNA demethylase ALKB-1, which localize to mitochondria. Misregulation of mtDNA 6mA through targeted overexpression of these enzymatic activities inappropriately alters mtDNA copy number and expression, impairing OXPHOS function and producing increased oxidative stress, as well as a shortened lifespan. Compounding defects in mtDNA regulation, reductions in mtDNA 6mA methylation promote the propagation of a deleterious mitochondrial genome across generations. Together, these results reveal that mtDNA 6mA is highly conserved among eukaryotes and regulates lifespan by influencing mtDNA copy number, expression, and heritable mutation levels in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The yellow mosaic disease (YMD) caused by begomoviruses is a major constraint for the production of pole bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in India. Survey was carried out in the eastern dry zone of Karnataka during 2019-20 to record the incidence of yellow mosaic disease in pole bean which revealed the ubiquitous prevalence of YMD in pole bean ranging from 6.02 to 80.74 per cent. Leaf samples collected (symptomatic and asymptomatic) were subjected for begomovirus detection using specific primers. Twelve samples, representing all the 12 taluks in the surveyed region were considered for full genome amplification by RCA, cloned and sequenced. Genome length of 12 current isolates ranged from 2718 - 2744 and 2668 - 2671 nucleotides for DNA-A and DNA-B, respectively. Sequence analysis using Sequence Demarcation Tool (SDT) showed >91 per cent nucleotide identity of current isolates (DNA-A) with other horsegram yellow mosaic virus (HgYMV) isolates available in the GenBank. As per existing ICTV criteria, all the current isolates can be considered as strains of HgYMV. Further, DNA-B associated with all the 12 isolates also shared >91 per cent nucleotide identity with DNA-B of HgYMV isolates, indicating absence of component re-assortment in HgYMV. Variation in the pairwise nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the existence of new strains within the current HgYMV isolates. GC plot analysis reveals potential recombination in the low GC rich regions. Further, recombination breakpoint analysis indicated intra-species recombination in both DNA-A and DNA-B, which might have driven the origin of new strains in HgYMV. This is the first comprehensive study on begomoviruses ioslates associated with the yellow mosaic disease of pole bean based on complete genome sequencing in the world.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHematopoietic stem cells are cells that differentiate into all blood cell types. Although the placenta secretes hormones, proteins and other factors important for maternal and fetal health, cross-talk between placental cells and hematopoietic stem cells is poorly understood. Moreover, toxicant impacts on placental-hematopoietic stem cell communication is understudied. The goals of this study were to determine if factors secreted from placental cells alter transcriptomic responses in hematopoietic stem cells and if monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), the bioactive metabolite of the pollutant diethylhexyl phthalate, modifies these effects.\n\nMethodsWe used K-562 and BeWo cells as in vitro models of hematopoietic stem cells and placental syncytiotrophoblasts, respectively. We treated K-562 cells with medium conditioned by incubation with BeWo cells, medium conditioned with BeWo cells treated with 10 M MEHP for 24 hours, or controls treated with unconditioned medium. We extracted K-562 cell RNA, performed RNA sequencing, then conducted differential gene expression and pathway analysis by treatment group.\n\nResultsRelative to controls, K-562 cells treated with BeWo cell conditioned medium differentially expressed 173 genes (FDR<0.05 and fold-change>2.0), including 2.4 fold upregulatation of TPM4 and 3.3 fold upregulatation of S1PR3. Upregulated genes were enriched for pathways including stem cell maintenance, cell proliferation and immune processes. Downregulated genes were enriched for terms involved in protein translation and transcriptional regulation. MEHP treatment differentially expressed eight genes (FDR<0.05), including genes involved in lipid metabolism (PLIN2, fold-change: 1.4; CPT1A, fold-change: 1.4).\n\nConclusionK-562 cells, a model of hematopoietic stem cells, are responsive to media conditioned by placental cells, potentially impacting pathways like stem cell maintenance and proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Strict blood-feeding animals are confronted with a strong B vitamin deficiency. Blood-feeding leeches from the Glossiphoniidae family, similarly to haematophagous insects, have evolved specialised organs called bacteriomes to harbour symbiotic bacteria. Leeches of the Haementeria genus have two pairs of globular bacteriomes attached to the oesophagus which house intracellular Candidatus Providencia siddallii bacteria. Previous work analysing a draft genome of the Providencia symbiont of the Mexican leech Haementeria officinalis showed that, in this species, the bacteria hold a reduced genome capable of synthesising B vitamins. In this work, we aimed to expand our knowledge on the diversity and evolution of Providencia symbionts of Haementeria. For this purpose, we sequenced the symbiont genomes of three selected leech species. We found that all genomes are highly syntenic and have kept a stable genetic repertoire, mirroring ancient insect endosymbionts. Additionally, we found B vitamin pathways to be conserved among these symbionts, pointing to a conserved symbiotic role. Lastly and most notably, we found that the symbiont of Haementeria acuecueyetzin has evolved an alternative genetic code, affecting a portion of its proteome and showing evidence of a lineage-specific and likely intermediate stage of genetic code reassignment.",

The results indicated that the chemical composition of some of these honeys violated the most national and international guidelines. Also, honey samples showed greater antimicrobial activities against all the osmophilic microorganisms especially Aspergillus flavus. Pb and Cd were not detected in all the tested samples, while Cu levels were below the guideline value of 5 mg/kg. However, Zn, Fe, and Ni levels in most the tested samples did not comply with the legislation values of 5, 15, and 0.01-1.00 mg/kg, respectively, and may pose a health risk to consumers. Also, Mn was found in higher levels which can be attributed either to the production stages of honey or the region from where the honey has been taken. Regarding the pesticide residues, some residues were detected in honeys imported from Germany, Australia, and Turkey; however, the hazardous indices for all the detected residues were less than one, indicating that these residues could not pose a health risk. It can be concluded that natural honeys should be free of any objectionable metals and pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived kidney organoids have the potential for a large variety of applications. However, they do not persist long in culture, for which reasons are still unclear. Furthermore, their morphological maturation, an essential feature for kidney function, has not been sufficiently assessed. Kidney organoids are transcriptionally much alike end-of-first-trimester fetal kidneys and present many of the same cell types. From large transmission electron microscopy tilescans of specific regions of interest, we compared the ultrastructures of iPSC-derived kidney organoids at various timepoints to human fetal kidneys of the first trimester. Unlike healthy fetal kidneys, large glycogen deposits developed over time in all organoid cell types, but particularly in podocytes and in chondrocytes, one of the off-target populations that contaminate the culture. Deeper investigation showed that glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3{beta}) levels and activation were diminished over time, correlated with the accumulation of glycogen. Activated YAP was strongly expressed and large lipid droplets accumulated over time in proximal tubules. Accordingly, EGFR signaling increased significantly over time. Mitochondria in glomeruli and tubules contained few or no cristae, indicating mitochondrial damage. Together these features are known for hyperglycemic cultures and diabetic nephropathy. Measuring the glucose concentration in the kidney organoid culture medium showed a concentration of 2.94 g/mL, which is considered an elevated, pre-diabetic-like concentration in vitro. In summary, our ultrastructural assessment of iPSC-derived kidney organoids using an age-matched fetal human reference allowed the evaluation of cellular morphology, and we identified intracellular features that can inform the cellular state, which is particularly important while physiological testing of organoids is limited.\n\nTranslational StatementKidney organoids hold promise as a future treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease. The engineering of kidney organoids with correct and healthy morphology in vitro is therefore essential, to guarantee functionality after transplantation. The present study provided deeper insights into the structural organization and ultrastructure of cells in kidney organoids compared to age-matched human fetal kidneys. Accordingly, we found several features in the regular kidney organoid culture, which are known to occur in hyperglycemic cultures and diabetic nephropathy, indicating that the current medium composition may be inducing pathological cellular phenotypes. This study therefore creates a better understanding of current limitations in the kidney organoid culture, increases knowledge of their function and cellular organization, and sets the foundation for further research to create advanced organoids.",

    "abstract": "The cooperative effect of multiple affinity binding interactions creating a stable bond, known as avidity, is particularly important in assessing the potency of potential drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, CAR T, or NK cells to treat cancer. However, predicting avidity based on in vitro single affinity interactions has limitations and often fails to describe the avidity effects observed in vivo. Acoustic force-based assays have recently emerged as a reliable method for direct avidity measurements, expressed as adhesion forces, which positively correlate with drug efficacy. However, to better understand avidity, in particular for cell-cell interactions and correlate it with affinity, a cell model system with controlled avidity-related properties is needed. This study presents a method for producing a cell model system using \"effector beads\" that can be used in acoustic force spectroscopy-based avidity assays or any other bead-based avidity assay. The protein of interest is biotinylated in vivo in E.coli, purified and subsequently mixed with streptavidin coated beads to create effector beads. The results demonstrate the dependency of rupture force on the receptor surface density and force loading rate, thus providing valuable information for designing future effector bead assays as well as cell avidity measurements for screening and characterization purposes.",

    "abstract": "Cell spreading and motility on an adhesive substrate are driven by the active physical forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton. We have recently shown that coupling curved membrane complexes to protrusive forces, exerted by the actin polymerization that they recruit, provides a mechanism that can give rise to spontaneous membrane shapes and patterns. In the presence of an adhesive substrate, this model was shown to give rise to an emergent motile phenotype, resembling a motile cell. Here, we utilize this \"minimal-cell\" model to explore the impact of external shear flow on the cell shape and migration on a uniform adhesive flat substrate. We find that in the presence of shear the motile cell reorients such that its leading edge, where the curved active proteins aggregate, faces the shear flow. The flow-facing configuration is found to minimize the adhesion energy by allowing the cell to spread more efficiently over the substrate. For the non-motile vesicle shapes, we find that they mostly slide and roll with the shear flow. We compare these theoretical results with experimental observations, and suggest that the tendency of many cell types to move against the flow may arise from the very general, and non-cell-type-specific mechanism predicted by our model.",

HIP1 depletion also significantly increased anchorage independent growth and invasion of these cells. However, the EMT markers did not follow the canonical regulation.

They play important role in K+ acquisition, translocation and enhancing salt tolerance. Here we report that the plasma-membrane-located OsHAK18 functions in K+ and sodium (Na+) circulation and sugar translocation in rice. OsHAK18 is expressed mainly, though not exclusively, in vascular tissues and particularly in the phloem. Knockout (KO) of OsHAK18 reduced K+ concentration in phloem sap and in the root but increased K+ accumulation in the shoot of both Nipponbare and Zhonghua11 cultivars, while overexpression (OX) of OsHAK18 driven by its endogenous promoter increased K+ concentration in phloem sap and in roots, and promoted Na+ retrieval from shoot to root under salt stress. Split-root experimental analysis of rubidium (Rb+) uptake and circulation indicated that OsHAK18-OX promoted Rb+ translocation from shoot to root. In addition, OsHAK18-KO increased while OsHAK18-OX reduced soluble sugar content in the shoot and affected oppositely the sugar concentration in the phloem and its content in the root. Moreover, OsHAK18-OX increased dramatically grain yield and physiological K+ utilization efficiency. Taken together, our results suggest that - unlike other OsHAKs analyzed heretofore - OsHAK18 is critical to K+ and Na+ re-circulation from shoot to root and enhances the source-to-sink translocation of a photo-assimilate.\n\nOne sentence summaryRice potassium transporter OsHAK18 mediates shoot-to-root circulation of potassium and sodium and source-to-sink translocation of soluble sugar which improves potassium use efficiency and grain yield.",

The mechanism underlying in vitro metabolic conditioning-induced augmented in vivo T cell function remains poorly understood.

This redox shift contributes to enhanced in vivo persistence and tumor clearance. In human tumour-infiltrating T cells, altering the redox balance ex-vivo reinvigorated pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

    "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of morphogenesis is the capacity of cells to actively exchange neighbours while maintaining the overall cohesion of the tissue. These cell rearrangements require the dynamic remodelling of cadherin cell adhesions. Many studies have examined this process in tissues where it is driven by the joint action of cell protrusions and actomyosin contraction along the shrinking junction. However, cell rearrangements can also occur through differential migration. This mode of cell rearrangement, characteristic of mesenchymal tissues, is much less well understood. Here, we explore the prototypical case of the gastrulating Xenopus prechordal mesoderm, and provide the first detailed analysis at how cadherin contacts are remodelled and eventually disrupted in this type of tissue. Using a reductionist approach, including analysis of single contacts using a dual pipette aspiration setup, we unveil two concurrent mechanisms. Most cadherins are removed via \"peeling\", i.e. disruption of the trans bonds and lateral diffusion out of the contact. In parallel, a remnant of cadherins concentrates at the shrinking contact, which is ultimately resolved by breakage of the link with the actin cytoskeleton, showing that the weakest link shifts at different stages of contact remodelling. Additionally, we observe recruitment of myosin peripheral to the shrinking contact, which influences the efficiency of the final detachment. Finally, manipulation of cortical tension indicates that the process is sensitive to the magnitude and orientation of the forces applied on the contact, revealing another key relationship between cell-cell adhesion and the cortical cytoskeleton. This study unravels a new modality of cell contact dynamics, which is likely to be widely relevant for highly migratory mesenchymal tissues.",

    "abstract": "Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a well-established conservation practice worldwide, but their effectiveness in protecting or replenishing fish biodiversity remains uneven. Understanding the patterns of this heterogeneity is central to general guidelines for MPA design and can ultimately provide guidance on how to maximize MPA potential. Here, we examine associations between the degree of protection, duration of protection, and protected area size, with fish biodiversity inside of protected areas relative to that of sites nearby, but outside of protected areas. We quantitatively synthesize 116 published estimates of species richness from 72 marine protected areas, and 38 estimates of Shannon entropy from 21 marine protected areas. We show that species richness is on average 18% (95% confidence intervals: 10% to 29%) higher in protected areas relative to areas open to fishing; and, on average Shannon entropy is 13% (95% confidence intervals: -2% to 31%) higher within protected areas relative to outside. We find no relationship between the degree or duration of protection with the ratio of species richness inside versus outside of protected areas; both fully and partially protected areas contribute to the accumulation of species inside protected areas, and protected areas of all ages contribute similarly on average to biodiversity conservation. In contrast to our expectations, increasing protected area size was associated with a decreased ratio of species richness sampled at sites inside versus outside the protected area, possibly due, for example, to insufficient enforcement and/or low compliance. Finally, we discuss why meta-analyses such as ours that summarize effect sizes of local scale biodiversity responses, that is, those at a single site, can only give a partial answer to the question of whether larger protected areas harbor more species than comparable unprotected areas.",
