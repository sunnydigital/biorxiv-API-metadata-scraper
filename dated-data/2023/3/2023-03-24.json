    "abstract": "BackgroundA Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiome provides the first line of defense against numerous adverse genital tract health outcomes. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome modulates protection, as prior work mostly described its composition through morphologic assessment and marker gene sequencing methods that do not capture functional information. To address this limitation, we developed metagenomic community state types (mgCSTs) which uses metagenomic sequences to describe and define vaginal microbiomes based on both composition and function.\n\nResultsMgCSTs are categories of microbiomes classified using taxonomy and the functional potential encoded in their metagenomes. MgCSTs reflect unique combinations of metagenomic subspecies (mgSs), which are assemblages of bacterial strains of the same species, within a microbiome. We demonstrate that mgCSTs are associated with demographics such as age and race, as well as vaginal pH and Gram stain assessment of vaginal smears. Importantly, these associations varied between mgCSTs predominated by the same bacterial species. A subset of mgCSTs, including three of the six predominated by Gardnerella mgSs, as well as a mgSs of L. iners, were associated with a greater likelihood of Amsel bacterial vaginosis diagnosis. This L. iners mgSs, among other functional features, encoded enhanced genetic capabilities for epithelial cell attachment that could facilitate cytotoxin-mediated cell lysis. Finally, we report a mgSs and mgCST classifier as an easily applied, standardized method for use by the microbiome research community.\n\nConclusionsMgCSTs are a novel and easily implemented approach to reducing the dimension of complex metagenomic datasets, while maintaining their functional uniqueness. MgCSTs enable investigation of multiple strains of the same species and the functional diversity in that species. Future investigations of functional diversity may be key to unraveling the pathways by which the vaginal microbiome modulates protection to the genital tract. Importantly, our findings support the hypothesis that functional differences between vaginal microbiomes, including those that may look compositionally similar, are critical considerations in vaginal health. Ultimately, mgCSTs may lead to novel hypotheses concerning the role of the vaginal microbiome in promoting health and disease, and identify targets for novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies to improve womens genital health.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancers are a complex malignancy comprising multiple anatomical sites, with cancer of the oral cavity ranking among the deadliest and most disfiguring cancers globally. Oral cancer (OC) constitutes a subset of head and neck cancer cases, presenting primarily as tobacco-and alcohol-associated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), with a 5-year survival rate of [~]65%, partly due to the lack of early detection and effective treatments. OSCC arises from premalignant lesions (PMLs) in the oral cavity through a multi-step series of clinical and histopathological stages, including varying degrees of epithelial dysplasia. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with the progression of PMLs to OSCC, we profiled the whole transcriptome of 66 human PMLs comprising leukoplakia with dysplasia and hyperkeratosis non-reactive (HkNR) pathologies, alongside healthy controls and OSCC. Our data revealed that PMLs were enriched in gene signatures associated with cellular plasticity, such as partial EMT (p-EMT) phenotypes, and with immune response. Integrated analyses of the host transcriptome and microbiome further highlighted a significant association between differential microbial abundance and PML pathway activity, suggesting a contribution of the oral microbiome towards PML evolution to OSCC. Collectively, this study reveals molecular processes associated with PML progression that may help early diagnosis and disease interception at an early stage.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPatients harboring oral premalignant lesions (PMLs) have an increased risk of developing oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but the underlying mechanisms driving transformation of PMLs to OSCC remain poorly understood. In this study, Khan et al., analyzed a newly generated dataset of gene expression and microbial profiles of oral tissues from patients diagnosed with PMLs from differing histopathological groups, including hyperkeratosis not reactive (HkNR) and dysplasia, comparing these profiles with OSCC and normal oral mucosa. Significant similarities between PMLs and OSCC were observed, with PMLs manifesting several cancer hallmarks, including oncogenic and immune pathways. The study also demonstrates associations between the abundance of multiple microbial species and PML groups, suggesting a potential contribution of the oral microbiome to the early stages of OSCC development. The study offers insights into the nature of the molecular, cellular and microbial heterogeneity of oral PMLs and suggests that molecular and clinical refinement of PMLs may provide opportunities for early disease detection and interception.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/534064v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86cf7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@129e6d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f0ae31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c4d67_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Salt-inducible kinases 1-3 (SIK1-3) are key regulators of the LKB1-AMPK pathway and play an important role in cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of any of the three isoforms has been associated with tumorigenesis in liver, breast, and ovarian cancers. We have recently developed the dual pan-SIK/group I p21-activated kinase (PAK) chemical probe MRIA9. However, inhibition of p21-activated kinases has been associated with cardiotoxicity in vivo, which complicates the use of MRIA9 as a tool compound. Here, we present a structure-based approach involving the back-pocket and gatekeeper residues, for narrowing the selectivity of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one-based inhibitors towards SIK kinases, eliminating PAK activity. Optimization was guided by high-resolution crystal structure analysis and computational methods, resulting in a pan-SIK inhibitor, MR22, which no longer exhibited activity on STE group kinases and displayed excellent selectivity in a representative kinase panel. MR22-dependent SIK inhibition led to centrosome dissociation and subsequent cell-cycle arrest in ovarian cancer cells, as observed with MRIA9, conclusively linking these phenotypic effects to SIK inhibition. Taken together, MR22 represents a valuable tool compound for studying SIK kinase function in cells.",

Here we describe a deep mutational scanning system that can measure the effects of combinations of mutations to HIV envelope (Env) on neutralization by antibodies and polyclonal serum. We first show that this system can accurately map how all functionally tolerated mutations to Env affect neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. We then comprehensively map Env mutations that affect neutralization by a set of human polyclonal sera known to target the CD4-binding site that neutralize diverse strains of HIV. The neutralizing activities of these sera target different epitopes, with most sera having specificities reminiscent of individual characterized monoclonal antibodies, but one sera targeting two epitopes within the CD4 binding site. Mapping the specificity of the neutralizing activity in polyclonal human serum will aid in assessing anti-HIV immune responses to inform prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe importance of gut microbiomes has become generally recognized in vector biology. This study addresses microbiome signatures in North American Triatoma species of public health significance (vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi) linked to their blood feeding strategy and the natural habitat. To place the Triatoma associated microbiomes within a complex evolutionary and ecological context, we sampled sympatric Triatoma populations, related predatory reduviids, unrelated ticks, and environmental material from vertebrate nests where these arthropods reside. Along with five Triatoma species, we have characterized microbiomes of five reduviids (Stenolemoides arizonensis, Ploiaria hirticornis, Zelus longipes, and two Reduvius species), a single soft tick species, Ornithodoros turicata, and environmental microbiomes from selected sites in Arizona, Texas, Florida and Georgia. The microbiomes of predatory reduviids lack a shared core microbiota. Like in triatomines, microbiome dissimilarities among species corelate with dominance of a single bacterial taxa. These include Rickettsia, Lactobacillus, Candidatus Midichloria, and Zymobacter, which are often accompanied by known symbiotic genera, i.e., Wolbachia, Candidatus Lariskella, Asaia, Gilliamella, and Burkholderia. We have further identified compositional convergence of analyzed microbiomes in respect to the host phylogenetic distance in both blood feeding and predatory reduviids. While microbiomes of two reduviid species from Emesinae family reflect their close relationship, the microbiomes of all Triatoma species repeatedly form a distinct monophyletic cluster highlighting their phylosymbiosis. Furthermore, based on environmental microbiome profiles and blood meal analysis, we propose three epidemiologically relevant and mutually interrelated bacterial sources for Triatoma microbiomes, i.e., host abiotic environment, host skin microbiome, and pathogens circulating in host blood.\n\nImportanceThis study places microbiomes of blood feeding North American Triatoma vectors (Reduviidae) into a broader evolutionary and ecological context provided by related predatory assassin bugs (Reduviidae), another unrelated vector species (soft tick Ornithodor turicata), and the environment these arthropods cohabit. For both vectors, microbiome analyses suggest three interrelated sources of bacteria, i.e., microbiome of vertebrate nests as their natural habitat, vertebrate skin microbiome, and pathobiome circulating in vertebrate blood. Despite an apparent influx of environment-associated bacteria into the arthropod microbiomes, Triatoma microbiomes retain their specificity, forming a distinct cluster that significantly differ from both predatory relatives and ecologically comparable ticks. Similarly, within the related predatory Reduviidae, we found the host phylogenetic distance to underlie microbiome similarities.",

    "abstract": "The split-Gal4 system allows for intersectional genetic labeling of highly specific cell-types and tissues in Drosophila. However, the existing split-Gal4 system, unlike the standard Gal4 system, cannot be repressed by Gal80, and therefore cannot be controlled temporally. This lack of temporal control precludes split-Gal4 experiments in which a genetic manipulation must be restricted to specific timepoints. Here, we describe a new split-Gal4 system based on a self-excising split-intein, which drives transgene expression as strongly as the current split-Gal4 system and Gal4 reagents, yet which is fully repressible by Gal80. We demonstrate the potent inducibility of \"split-intein Gal4\" in vivo using both fluorescent reporters and via reversible tumor induction in the gut. Further, we show that our split-intein Gal4 can be extended to the drug-inducible GeneSwitch system, providing an independent method for intersectional labeling with inducible control. We also show that the split-intein Gal4 system can be used to generate highly cell-type specific genetic drivers based on in silico predictions generated by single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) datasets, and we describe a new algorithm (\"Two Against Background\" or TAB) to predict cluster-specific gene pairs across multiple tissue-specific scRNA datasets. We provide a plasmid toolkit to efficiently create split-intein Gal4 drivers based on either CRISPR knock-ins to target genes or using enhancer fragments. Altogether, the split-intein Gal4 system allows for the creation of highly specific intersectional genetic drivers that are inducible/repressible.\n\nSignificance statementThe split-Gal4 system allows Drosophila researchers to drive transgene expression with extraordinary cell type specificity. However, the existing split-Gal4 system cannot be controlled temporally, and therefore cannot be applied to many important areas of research. Here, we present a new split-Gal4 system based on a self-excising split-intein, which is fully controllable by Gal80, as well as a related drug-inducible split GeneSwitch system. This approach can both leverage and inform single-cell RNAseq datasets, and we introduce an algorithm to identify pairs of genes that precisely and narrowly mark a desired cell cluster. Our split-intein Gal4 system will be of value to the Drosophila research community, and allow for the creation of highly specific genetic drivers that are also inducible/repressible.",
