    "abstract": "The lack of a widely accessible method for expressing genes of interest in wild-type embryos is the fundamental obstacle in understanding genetic regulation during embryonic development. In particular, only a few methods are available for introducing gene expression vectors into cells prior to neural tube closure, a period for the drastic development of many tissues. In this study, we present a simple technique for transferring vectors into the endo- and ectodermal cells of mouse embryos at E7.0 or E8.0 via in utero injection, without any specialized equipment. Using this technique, introduction of retroviruses can facilitate the labeling of cells in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, epidermis, and digestive and respiratory organs. As such, this technique can aid in analyzing the roles of genes of interest during endo- and ectodermal development prior to neural tube closure.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora are eukaryotic microbes that cause disease in a wide range of agriculturally and ecologically important plants. During the Phytophthora disease cycle, thick-walled oospores can be produced via sexual reproduction. These resting spores can survive in the soil for several years in the absence of a host plant, thus providing a long-term inoculum for disease. The ability to quantitatively evaluate oospore viability is an important part of many phytopathology studies. Here, we tested six fluorescent viability dyes for their ability to differentially stain Phytophthora agathidicida oospores: SYTO 9, FUN-1, fluorescein diacetate (FDA), 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA), propidium iodide, and TOTO-3 iodide. Each dye was first tested individually with untreated or heat-treated oospores as proxies for viable and non-viable oospores, respectively. SYTO9, FUN-1, CFDA and propidium iodide stained untreated and heat-treated oospores indiscriminately. In contrast, FDA (a green-fluorescent viable cell stain) and TOTO-3 (a red-fluorescent non-viable cell stain) differentially stained untreated or heat-treated oospores with no cross-fluorescence. We then tested the efficacy of dual viability staining and in conjunction with a pipeline for automated image analysis. To validate the method, untreated and heat-treated oospores were mixed at specific ratios, dual-stained, and analyzed using the pipeline. Linear regression of the resulting data showed a clear correlation between the expected and measured oospore ratios (dy/dx=0.95, R2=0.88). Overall, the combination of dual-fluorescence staining and automated image analysis provides a high-throughput method for quantitatively assessing oospore viability and therefore can facilitate further studies on this key part of the Phytophthora disease cycle.",

    "abstract": "Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma harzianum are widely used as commercial biocontrol agents against plant diseases. Recently, T. harzianum IOC-3844 (Th3844) and T. harzianum CBMAI-0179 (Th0179) demonstrated great potential in the enzymatic conversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars. Herein, we performed whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the Th3844 and Th0179 strains. To assess the genetic diversity within the genus Trichoderma, the results of both strains were compared with strains of T. atroviride CBMAI-00020 (Ta0020) and T. reesei CBMAI-0711 (Tr0711). The sequencing coverage value of all genomes evaluated in this study was higher than that of previously reported genomes for the same species of Trichoderma. The resulting assembly revealed total lengths of 40 Mb (Th3844), 39 Mb (Th0179), 36 Mb (Ta0020), and 32 Mb (Tr0711). A genome-wide phylogenetic analysis provided details on the relationships of the newly sequenced species with other Trichoderma species. Structural variants revealed genomic rearrangements among Th3844, Th0179, Ta0020, and Tr0711 relative to the T. reesei QM6a reference genome and showed the functional effects of such variants. In conclusion, the findings presented herein allow the visualization of genetic diversity in the evaluated strains and offer opportunities to explore such fungal genomes in future biotechnological and industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "The C2-WW-HECT domain ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L regulates sorting in endocytosis by mediating ubiquitination of cargo molecules, such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Defects in ENaC ubiquitination cause Liddle syndrome, a hereditary hypertension. Nedd4L is catalytically autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains, but the activation mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Nedd4L is activated by membranes sculpted by FCHO2, a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rsv (BAR) domain protein that regulates endocytosis. We found that FCHO2 was required for Nedd4L-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis of ENaC. Nedd4L co-localized with FCHO2 at clathrin-coated pits where it likely became activated. Nedd4L was specifically recruited to and activated by the FCHO2 BAR domain exogenously expressed in cells. Furthermore, we reconstituted in vitro FCHO2-induced recruitment and activation of Nedd4L. Both the recruitment and activation were mediated by membrane curvature rather than protein-protein interactions. The Nedd4L C2 domain recognized a specific degree of membrane curvature that was generated by the FCHO2 BAR domain. Consequently, this curvature activated Nedd4L by relieving autoinhibition. Thus, we show for the first time a specific functionality (i.e., recruitment and activation of an enzyme regulating cargo sorting) of membrane curvature by a BAR domain protein.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) is a nutritional intervention that reduces the risk of age-related diseases in numerous species, including humans. CRs metabolic effects, including decreased fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity, play an important role in its broader health benefits. However, the extent and basis of sex differences in CRs health benefits are unknown. We found that 30% CR in young (3-month-old) male mice decreased fat mass and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, whereas these effects were blunted or absent in young female mice. Females resistance to fat and weight loss was associated with decreased lipolysis, lower systemic energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation, and increased postprandial lipogenesis compared to males. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) showed that peripheral glucose uptake was comparable between sexes. Instead, the sex differences in glucose homeostasis were associated with altered hepatic ceramide content and substrate metabolism: compared to CR males, CR females had lower TCA cycle activity but higher blood ketone concentrations, a marker of hepatic acetyl-CoA content. This suggests that males use hepatic acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle whereas in females it accumulates, thereby stimulating gluconeogenesis and limiting hypoglycaemia during CR. In aged mice (18-months old), when females are anoestrus, CR decreased fat mass and improved glucose homeostasis to a similar extent in both sexes. Finally, in a cohort of overweight and obese humans CR-induced fat loss was also sex- and age-dependent: younger females (<45 years) resisted fat loss compared to younger males while in older subjects (>45 years) this sex difference was absent. Collectively, these studies identify age-dependent sex differences in the metabolic effects of CR and highlight adipose tissue, the liver and oestrogen as key determinants of CRs metabolic benefits. These findings have important implications for understanding the interplay between diet and health and for maximising the benefits of CR in humans.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICaloric restriction (CR) decreases fat mass and improves glucose homeostasis in young male mice, but young females resist these effects.\nC_LIO_LICR females resist lipolysis, decrease energy expenditure and increase postprandial lipogenesis more than CR males, explaining how females resist fat loss.\nC_LIO_LISex differences in glucose homeostasis are associated with altered hepatic metabolism and gluconeogenesis, without marked differences in peripheral glucose uptake.\nC_LIO_LICRs effects on fat loss and glucose homeostasis are comparable in aged male and female mice, implicating oestrogen as the driver of the sexually dimorphic effects in young mice.\nC_LIO_LIIn humans, females resist CR-induced fat loss in an age-dependent manner, further supporting the role of oestrogen in the sexually dimorphic effects of CR.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The mitophagic degradation of mitochondrial matrix proteins in S. cerevisiae was previously shown to be selective, reflecting a pre-engulfment sorting step within the mitochondrial network. This selectivity is regulated through phosphorylation of mitochondrial matrix proteins by the matrix kinases Pkp1 and Pkp2, which in turn appear to be regulated by the phosphatase Aup1/Ptc6. However, these same proteins also regulate the phosphorylation status and catalytic activity of the yeast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is critical for mitochondrial metabolism. To understand the relationship between these two functions, we evaluated the role of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in mitophagic selectivity. Surprisingly, we identified a novel function of the complex in regulating mitophagic selectivity, which is independent of its enzymatic activity. Our data support a model in which the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex directly regulates the activity of its associated kinases and phosphatases. This regulatory interaction then determines the phosphorylation state of mitochondrial matrix proteins and their mitophagic fates.",

    "abstract": "Studying human-animal interactions in domestic species and how they affect the establishment of a positive Human-Animal Relationship (HAR) may help us improve animal welfare and better understand the evolution of interspecific interactions associated with the domestication process. Understanding and describing the quality of an HAR requires information on several aspects of the animal biology and emotional states (social, spatial and postural behaviours, physiological and cognitive states). Growing evidence shows that acoustic features of animal vocalisations may be indicators of emotional states. Here, we tested the hypothesis that vocal structure may indicate the quality of HAR. At weaning, 30 piglets were positively handled by an experimenter who talked to and physically interacted with them three times a day, while 30 other piglets only received the contact necessary for proper husbandry. After two weeks, we recorded the behaviours and vocalisations produced in the presence of the static experimenter for 5 min. We repeated this test two weeks later, after a conditioning period during which human presence with additional positive contacts was used as a reward for all piglets. We hypothesized this conditioning period would lead to a positive human-piglet relationship for all piglets. As expected, piglets that were positively handled at weaning expressed a higher attraction toward the experimenter, and, after the conditioning, piglets that were not positively handled at weaning expressed a similar level of attraction than the positively handled ones. Piglets positively handled at weaning produced shorter grunts than the other ones, regardless of the context of recording, which may indicate a more positive affect. During reunions with the static experimenter, a more positive HAR was associated with a decrease in vocal reactivity to human proximity. However, during reunions with the experimenter providing additional positive contacts and over the conditioning, proximity to the human systematically triggered shorter and higher pitched grunts, indicator of positive a emotional state. Results first show that changes in vocal structure are consistent with indicators of positive states in the presence of a human. Second, these changes are stronger when the human positively interact with the piglets, supposedly emphasizing a higher positive arousal state during these interactions. We show that vocalisation structure may be a promising indicator of the quality of human-pig relationship.",

    "abstract": "In high-risk environments, fast and accurate responses to warning systems are essential to efficiently handle emergency situations. The aim of the present study was twofold: 1) investigating whether hand action videos (i.e., gesture alarms) trigger faster and more accurate responses than text alarm messages (i.e., written alarms), especially when mental workload (MWL) is high; and 2) investigating the brain activity in response to both types of alarms as a function of MWL. Regardless of MWL, participants (N = 28) were found to be both faster and more accurate when responding to gesture alarms than to written alarms. Brain electrophysiological results suggest that this greater efficiency might be due to a facilitation of the action execution, reflected by the decrease in mu and beta power observed around the response time window. These results suggest that gesture alarms may improve operators performances in emergency situations.",

    "abstract": "Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits are often associated with impairments in perspective taking and cognitive control (regulating goal directed behavior); and adolescents with CU traits demonstrate aberrant brain activation/connectivity in areas underlying these processes. Together cognitive control and perspective taking are thought to link mechanistically to explain CU traits. Because increased cognitive control demands modulate perspective taking ability among both typically developing samples and individuals with elevated CU traits, understanding the neurophysiological substrates of these constructs could inform efforts to alleviate societal costs of antisocial behavior. The present study uses GIMME to examine the heterogenous functional brain properties (i.e., connection density, node centrality) underlying cognitive controls influence on perspective taking among adolescents on a CU trait continuum. Results reveal that cognitive control had a negative indirect association with CU traits via perspective taking; and brain connectivity indirectly associated with lower CU traits - specifically the social network via perspective taking and conflict network via cognitive control. Additionally, less negative connection density between the social and conflict networks was directly associated with higher CU traits. Our results support the growing literature on cognitive controls influence on socio-cognitive functioning in CU traits and extends that work by identifying underlying functional brain properties.",

Performance is better at the fovea, decreases with eccentricity, and is better along the horizontal than vertical meridian and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. However, all neurophysiological and virtually all behavioral studies of cortical magnification have investigated eccentricity effects without considering polar angle. Most performance differences due to eccentricity are eliminated when stimulus size is cortically magnified (M-scaled) to equate the size of its cortical representation in primary visual cortex (V1). But does cortical magnification underlie performance differences around the visual field? Here, to assess contrast sensitivity, human adult observers performed an orientation discrimination task with constant stimulus size at different locations as well as when stimulus size was M-scaled according to stimulus eccentricity and polar angle location. We found that although M-scaling stimulus size eliminates differences across eccentricity, it does not eliminate differences around the polar angle. This finding indicates that limits in contrast sensitivity across eccentricity and around the visual field are mediated by different anatomical and computational constraints.",

Moreover, mirroring trends observed in humans, our findings showed that sparse predictors using variants in cis are more effective than polygenic predictors and that gene expression prediction in rats is highly correlated across brain regions. Importantly, our analysis also identified a significant overlap between genes associated with rat and human body length and BMI, indicating rat models may be useful for studying the genetic basis of complex traits in humans. RatXcan represents a valuable tool for uncovering shared biological mechanisms of complex traits across species, with potential applications in a wide range of research fields.",

    "abstract": "When the source of nociception expands across a body area, the experience of pain increases due to the spatial integration of nociceptive information. This well-established effect is called spatial summation of pain (SSp) and has been the subject of multiple investigations. Here, we used cold-induced SSp to investigate the effect of attention on the spatial tuning of nociceptive processing. Forty pain-free volunteers (N=40, 20 females) participated in this experiment. They took part in an SSp paradigm based on three hand immersions into cold water (5{degrees}C): Participants either immersed the ulnar segment (\"a\"), radial segment (\"b\") or both hand segments (\"a+b\") and provided overall pain ratings. In some trials based on \"a+b\" immersions, they were also asked to provide divided (i.e., first pain in \"a\" then in \"b\"; or reversed) and directed attention ratings (i.e., pain only in \"a\" or \"b\"). Results confirmed a clear SSp effect in which reported pain during immersions of \"a\" or \"b\" was less intense than pain during immersions of \"a+b\" (p<0.001). Data also confirmed that spatial tuning was altered. SSp was fully abolished when participants provided two ratings in a divided fashion (p<0.001). Furthermore, pain was significantly lower when attention was directed only to one segment (\"a\" OR \"b\") during \"a+b\" immersion (p<0.001). We conclude that spatial tuning is dynamically driven by attention as reflected in abolished SSp. Directed attention was sufficient to focus spatial tuning and abolish SSp. Results support the role of cognitive processes such as attention in spatial tuning.\n\nPerspectiveThis article presents experimental investigation of spatial tuning in pain and offers mechanistic insights of contiguous spatial summation of pain in healthy volunteers. Depending on how pain is evaluated in terms of attentional derivative (overall pain, directed, divided attention) the pain is reduced and spatial summation abolished.",

Previous research has focused on visual change due to stimulus motion, eye movements or unfolding events, but not their combined impact across the brain, or their interactions with semantic novelty. We investigate the neural responses to these sources of novelty during film viewing. We analyzed intracranial recordings in humans across 6328 electrodes from 23 individuals. Responses associated with saccades and film cuts were dominant across the entire brain. Film cuts at semantic event boundaries were particularly effective in the temporal and medial temporal lobe. Saccades to visual targets with high visual novelty were also associated with strong neural responses. Specific locations in higher-order association areas showed selectivity to either high or low-novelty saccades.

    "abstract": "Neurons receive thousands of inputs onto their dendritic arbour, where individual synapses undergo activitydependent changes in strength. The durable forms of synaptic strength change, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) require calcium entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) that triggers downstream protein signalling cascades in the dendrite. Notably, changes in postsynaptic strengths associated with LTP and LTD are correlated to changes in spine head volume, referred to as structural LTP (sLTP) and structural LTD (sLTD). Intriguingly, LTP and LTD, including sLTP and sLTD, are not necessarily restricted to the active, targeted synapses (homosynapses), and the changes in synaptic strength can spread and affect the strengths of inactive or non-stimulated synapses (heterosynapses) on the same cell. Moreover, the plasticity outcome at both homo- and heterosynapses can depend on the number of stimulated sites when eliciting multi-spine plasticity. Precisely how neurons allocate resources for implementing the changes in strength at individual synapses depending on their proximity to input activity across space and time remains an open question. In order to gain insights into the elementary processes underlying multi-spine plasticity that engages both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic changes, we have combined experimental and mathematical modelling approaches. On the one hand, we used glutamate uncaging to precisely and systematically stimulate variable numbers of homosynapses sharing the same dendritic branch whilst monitoring tens of other heterosynapses on the same dendrite. Homosynaptic potentiation of clusters of dendritic spines leads to heterosynaptic changes that are dependent on NMDAR, CaMKII and calcineurin. On the other hand, inspired by the Ca2+ levels hypothesis where different amounts of Ca2+ lead to either growth or shrinkage of spines, we have built a model based on a dual-role Ca2+-dependent protein that induces sLTP or sLTD. Comparing our experimental results with model predictions, we find that (i) both collaboration and competition among spines for protein resources are key drivers of heterosynaptic plasticity and (ii) the temporal and spatial distance between simultaneously stimulated spines impact the resulting spine dynamics. Moreover, our model can reconcile disparate experimental reports of sLTP and sLTD at homo- and heterosynaptic spines. Our results provide a quantitative description of the heterosynaptic footprint over minutes and hours post-stimulation across tens of microns of dendritic space. This broadens our knowledge about the operation of non-linear dendritic summation rules and how they impact spiking decisions.",

    "abstract": "The ventral visual processing hierarchy of the cortex needs to fulfill at least two key functions: Perceived objects must be mapped to high-level representations invariantly of the precise viewing conditions, and a generative model must be learned that allows, for instance, to fill in occluded information guided by visual experience. Here, we show how a multilayered predictive coding network can learn to recognize objects from the bottom up and to generate specific representations via a top-down pathway through a single learning rule: the local minimization of prediction errors. Trained on sequences of continuously transformed objects, neurons in the highest network area become tuned to object identity invariant of precise position, comparable to inferotemporal neurons in macaques. Drawing on this, the dynamic properties of invariant object representations reproduce experimentally observed hierarchies of timescales from low to high levels of the ventral processing stream. The predicted faster decorrelation of error-neuron activity compared to representation neurons is of relevance for the experimental search for neural correlates of prediction errors. Lastly, the generative capacity of the network is confirmed by reconstructing specific object images, robust to partial occlusion of the inputs. By learning invariance from temporal continuity within a generative model, despite little change in architecture and learning rule compared to static input- reconstructing Hebbian predictive coding networks, simply by shifting the training paradigm to dynamic inputs, the approach generalizes the predictive coding framework to dynamic inputs in a more biologically plausible way than self-supervised networks with non-local error-backpropagation.\n\nAuthor SummaryNeurons in the inferotemporal cortex of primates respond to images of complex objects independent of position, rotational angle, or size. While feedforward models of visual perception such as deep neural networks can explain this, they fail to account for the use of top-down information, for example when sensory evidence is scarce. Here, we address the question of how the neuronal networks in the brain learn both bottom-up and top-down processing without labels as they are used in the artificial supervised learning paradigm. Building on previous work that explains vision as a process of iteratively improving predictions, learning in the predictive coding network is driven by the local minimization of prediction errors. When trained on sequences of moving inputs, the network learns both invariant high-level representations comparable to those in the inferotemporal cortex of primates, and a generative model capable of reconstructing whole objects from partially occluded input images in agreement with experimental recordings from early visual areas. Advancing the search for experimental hallmarks of prediction errors, we find that error neurons in the higher areas of the network change their activity on a shorter timescale than representation neurons.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular Ca2+ signalling and Na+ homeostasis are inextricably linked via ion channels and co-transporters, with alterations in the concentration of one ion having profound effects on the other. Evidence indicates that intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) is elevated in breast tumours, and that aberrant Ca2+ signalling regulates numerous key cancer hallmark processes. The present study therefore aimed to determine the effects of Na+ depletion on intracellular Ca2+ handling in metastatic breast cancer cell lines. The relationship between Na+ and Ca2+ was probed using fura-2 and SBFI fluorescence imaging and replacement of extracellular Na+ with equimolar N-methyl-D-glucamine (0Na+/NMDG) or choline chloride (0Na+/ChoCl). In triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells and Her2+ SKBR3 cells, but not ER+ MCF-7 cells, 0Na+/NMDG and 0Na+/ChoCl resulted in a slow, sustained depletion in [Na+]i that was accompanied by a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Application of La3+ in nominal Ca2+-free conditions had no effect on this response, ruling out reverse-mode NCX activity and Ca2+ entry channels. Moreover, the Na+-linked [Ca2+]i increase was independent of membrane potential hyperpolarisation (NS-1619), but was inhibited by pharmacological blockade of IP3 receptors (2-APB), phospholipase C (PLC, U73122) or following depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores (cyclopiazonic acid). Thus, Na+ is linked to PLC/IP3-mediated activation of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in metastatic breast cancer cells and this may have an important role in breast tumours where [Na+]i is perturbed.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is controlled by two processes - a circadian clock that regulates its timing and a homeostat that regulates the drive to sleep. Drosophila has been an insightful model for understanding both processes. For four decades, Borbely and Daans two-process model has provided a powerful framework for understanding how circadian and homeostatic processes regulate sleep. However, the field of fly sleep has not employed such a model as a framework for the investigation of sleep. To this end, we have adapted the two-process model to the fly and establish its utility by showing that it can provide empirically testable predictions regarding the circadian and homeostatic control of fly sleep. We show that the ultradian rhythms previously reported for loss-of-function clock mutants are a predictable consequence of a functional sleep homeostat in the absence of a functioning circadian system. We find that a model in which the circadian clock speed and homeostatic rates act without influencing each other provides imprecise predictions regarding how clock speed influences the strength of sleep rhythms and the amount of daily sleep. We also find that quantitatively good fits between empirical values and model predictions were achieved only when clock speeds were positively correlated with rates of decay of sleep pressure. Our results indicate that longer sleep bouts better reflect the homeostatic process than the current definition of sleep as any inactivity lasting five minutes or more. This two-process model represents a powerful framework for future work on the molecular and physiological regulation of fly sleep.",

    "abstract": "Clustering of weakly interacting multivalent biomolecules underlies the formation of membraneless compartments known as condensates. As opposed to single component (homotypic) systems, the concentration dependence of multi-component (heterotypic) condensate formation is not well understood. We previously proposed the solubility product (SP), the product of monomer concentrations in the dilute phase, as a tool for understanding the concentration dependence of multi-component systems. In the current study, we further explore the limits of the SP concept using spatial Langevin dynamics and rule-based stochastic simulations. We show, for a variety of idealized molecular structures, how the maximum SP coincides with the onset of the phase transition, i.e., the formation of large clusters. We reveal the importance of intra-cluster binding in steering the free and cluster phase molecular distributions. We also show how structural features of biomolecules shape the solubility product profiles. The interplay of flexibility, length and steric hindrance of linker regions controls the phase transition threshold. Remarkably, when solubility products are normalized to non-dimensional variables and plotted against the concentration scaled to the threshold for phase transition, the curves all coincide independent of the structural features of the binding partners. Similar coincidence is observed for the normalized clustering vs. concentration plots. Overall, the principles derived from these systematic models will help guide and interpret in vitro and in vivo experiments on the biophysics of biomolecular condensates.\n\nSignificance StatementBiomolecular condensates are macroscopic intracellular structures that are composed of weakly interacting macromolecules. Because their composition can be complex, there are no simple rules for how condensates form as a function of the concentrations of their individual components. In this work, we show how the solubility product (SP), the product of monomer concentrations in the dilute phase, might serve as a tool for predicting the concentration dependence for condensation of multi-component systems. Specifically, Langevin dynamics simulations of the clustering of a series of multivalent binding partners reveals how the maximum SP is always attained at the same concentration as the appearance of large clusters. Experimental application of the SP concept should help rationalize the cellular formation of biomolecular condensates.",

    "abstract": "Behavior and cognition emerge from the complex interplay of neural properties at different scales. However, inferring these multi-scale properties from diverse experimental data remains a classical challenge in computational and systems neuroscience. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, such as deep learning and Bayesian inference, have shown promise in addressing this issue. Nonetheless, the performance of ML models trained on synthetic data generated from computational models degrades dramatically on experimental data. To systematically tackle these challenges, we introduce the concept of \"out-of-distribution (OOD)\" to quantify distributional shift between synthetic and experimental datasets, and propose a deep domain-adaptive inference framework that aligns the distribution of synthetic data with experimental data by minimizing OOD errors. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of real experimental data when inferring neural properties at different scales. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in two scenarios: inferring detailed biophysical properties at the neuron and microcircuit scales, and inferring monosynaptic connections in hippocampal CA1 networks from in vivo multi-electrode extracellular recordings in free-running mice. Our approach represents a pioneering systematic solution to the OOD problem in neuroscience research and can potentially facilitate bottom-up modeling of large-scale network dynamics underlying brain function and dysfunction.\n\nTeaserOur deep domain-adaptive inference framework addresses the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in inferring multi-scale neural properties from experimental data, enabling state-of-the-art performance and broad implications for neuroscience research.",

Here we report that the source of this variation is cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and their variation with the duration and magnitude of applied stretch, and present a model that can predict the degree to which stretch will either increase or decrease long-term activation levels of fibroblasts cultured within a stretched, three-dimensional collagen matrix.

    "abstract": "MotivationIn metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications, promoters with appropriate strengths are critical. However, it is time-consuming and laborious to annotate promoter strength by experiments. Nowadays many machine learning (ML) methods are applied to synthetic promoter strength prediction, but existing models are limited by the excessive proximity between synthetic promoters.\n\nResultsIn order to enhance ML models to better predict the synthetic promoter strength, we propose EVMP(Extended Vision Mutant Priority), a universal framework which utilize mutation information more effectively. In EVMP, synthetic promoters are equivalently transformed into base promoter and corresponding k-mer mutations, which are input into BaseEncoder and VarEncoder respectively. In Trc synthetic promoter library, EVMP was applied to multiple ML models and the model effect was enhanced to varying extents, up to 61.30%, while the SOTA(state-of-the-art) record was improved by 15.25%. EVMP also provides optional data augmentation based on multiple base promoters, which further improved the model performance by 17.95% compared with non-EVMP SOTA record. In further study, extended vision is shown to be essential for EVMP. We also found that EVMP can alleviate the over-smoothing phenomenon, which may contributes to its effectiveness. Our work suggests that EVMP can highlight the mutation information of synthetic promoters and significantly improve the prediction accuracy of strength.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe source code is publicly available on github: https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/EVMP.\n\nContacthuangrr@sdu.edu.cn\n\nSupplementary informationAppendix is available at bioRxiv online.",

To further reveal the functions of Styxl2 in adult muscles, we generated two inducible knockout mouse models: one with Styxl2 being deleted in mature myofibers to assess its role in sarcomere maintenance, and the other in adult muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) to assess its role in de novo sarcomere assembly. We find that Styxl2 is not required for sarcomere maintenance but functions in de novo sarcomere assembly during injury-induced muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, Styxl2 interacts with non-muscle myosin IIs, enhances their ubiquitination, and targets them for autophagy-dependent degradation. Without Styxl2, the degradation of non-muscle myosin IIs is delayed, which leads to defective sarcomere assembly and force generation. Thus, Styxl2 promotes de novo sarcomere assembly by interacting with non-muscle myosin IIs and facilitating their autophagic degradation.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the mammalian inferior colliculus (IC) are sensitive to the velocity (speed and direction) of fast frequency chirps contained in Schroeder-phase harmonic complexes (SCHR). However, IC neurons are also sensitive to stimulus periodicity, a prominent feature of SCHR stimuli. Here, to disentangle velocity sensitivity from periodicity tuning, we introduced a novel stimulus consisting of aperiodic random chirps. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were made in the IC of Dutch-belted rabbits. Periodicity tuning was characterized using modulation transfer functions (MTFs). The prevalence of direction selectivity to SCHR and aperiodic chirps was quantified, demonstrating that the majority of IC neurons (90.5%) were selective for SCHR-chirp direction and that nearly all neurons were selective for aperiodic-chirp direction (99.6%). Rate-velocity functions were constructed from aperiodic chirp responses, revealing that neurons were commonly sensitive to the direction of lower-velocity (0.40 - 1.59 kHz/ms) chirps and were often insensitive to the direction of higher-velocity chirps (3.16 - 9.24 kHz/ms). Rate-velocity functions and MTFs were combined using a generalized linear model to predict SCHR response rates--this analysis revealed that both velocity and periodicity cues were required to explain SCHR responses. In general, velocity cues had a stronger effect on responses for harmonic stimuli with lower fundamental frequencies. This result has implications for neural encoding of complex sounds that combine envelope periodicities and frequency-sweeps, such as speech.",

    "abstract": "Defining pattern formation mechanisms during embryonic development is important for understanding the etiology of birth defects and to inform tissue engineering approaches. In this study, we used tricaine, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) inhibitor, to show that VGSC activity is required for normal skeletal patterning in Lytechinus variegatus sea urchin larvae. We demonstrate that tricaine-mediated patterning defects are rescued by an anesthetic-insensitive version of the VGSC LvScn5a. Expression of this channel is enriched in the ventrolateral ectoderm where it spatially overlaps with posterolaterally expressed Wnt5. We show that VGSC activity is required to spatially restrict Wnt5 expression to this ectodermal region that is adjacent and instructive to clusters of primary mesenchymal cells that initiate secretion of the larval skeleton as triradiates. Tricaine-mediated Wnt5 spatial expansion correlates with the formation of ectopic PMC clusters and triradiates. These defects are rescued by Wnt5 knock down, indicating that the spatial expansion Wnt5 is responsible for the patterning defects induced by VGSC inhibition. These results demonstrate a novel connection between bioelectrical status and the spatial control of patterning cue expression during embryonic pattern formation.\n\nSummary statementInhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels perturbs Wnt5-mediated patterning of the sea urchin larval skeleton",

    "abstract": "The stomach-derived hormone ghrelin motivates food search and stimulates food consumption, with highest plasma concentrations before a meal and lowest shortly after. However, ghrelin also appears to affect the value of non-food rewards such as interaction with rat conspecifics, and monetary rewards in humans. The present pre-registered study investigated how nutritional state and ghrelin concentrations are related to the subjective and neural responses to social and non-social rewards.\n\nIn a cross-over feed-and-fast design, 67 healthy volunteers (20 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a hungry state and after a meal with repeated plasma ghrelin measurements. In task 1, participants received social rewards in the form of approving expert feedback, or non-social computer reward. In task 2, participants rated the pleasantness of compliments and neutral statements.\n\nNutritional state and ghrelin concentrations did not affect the response to social reward in task 1. In contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortical activation to non-social rewards was reduced when the meal strongly suppressed ghrelin. In task 2, fasting increased activation in the right ventral striatum during all statements, but ghrelin concentrations were neither associated with brain activation nor with experienced pleasantness. Complementary Bayesian analyses provided moderate evidence for a lack of correlation between ghrelin concentrations and behavioral and neural responses to social rewards, but moderate evidence for an association between ghrelin and non-social rewards.\n\nThis suggests that ghrelins influence may be restricted to non-social rewards. Social rewards implemented via social recognition and affirmation may be too abstract and complex to be susceptible to ghrelins influence. In contrast, the non-social reward was associated with the expectation of a material object that was handed out after the experiment. This may indicate that ghrelin might be involved in anticipatory rather than consummatory phases of reward.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms coordinate the responses of organisms to their daily fluctuating environments, by establishing a temporal program of gene expression. This schedules aspects of metabolism, physiology, development and behaviour according to the time of day. Circadian regulation in plants is extremely pervasive, and is important because it underpins both productivity and seasonal reproduction. Circadian regulation extends to the control of environmental responses through a regulatory process known as circadian gating. Circadian gating is the process whereby the circadian clock regulates the response to an environmental cue, such that the magnitude of response to an identical cue varies according to the time of day of the cue. Here, we show that there is genome-wide circadian gating of responses to cold temperatures in plants. By using bread wheat as an experimental model, we establish that circadian gating is crucial to the programs of gene expression that underlie the environmental responses of a crop of major socioeconomic importance. Furthermore, we identify that circadian gating of cold temperature responses are distributed unevenly across the three wheat subgenomes, which might reflect the geographical origins of the ancestors of modern wheat.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThere is genome-wide circadian gating of a response to low temperatures in a crop of major socioeconomic importance.",

    "abstract": "An evolutionary perspective enhances our understanding of biological mechanisms. Comparison of sex determination and X-chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms between the closely related nematode species C. briggsae (Cbr) and C. elegans (Cel) revealed that the genetic regulatory hierarchy controlling both processes is conserved, but the X-chromosome target specificity and mode of binding for the specialized condensin dosage compensation complex (DCC) controlling X expression have diverged. We identified two motifs within Cbr DCC recruitment sites that are highly enriched on X: 13-bp MEX and 30-bp MEX II. Mutating either MEX or MEX II in an endogenous recruitment site with multiple copies of one or both motifs reduced binding, but only removing all motifs eliminated binding in vivo. Hence, DCC binding to Cbr recruitment sites appears additive. In contrast, DCC binding to Cel recruitment sites is synergistic: mutating even one motif in vivo eliminated binding. Although all X-chromosome motifs share the sequence CAGGG, they have otherwise diverged so that a motif from one species cannot function in the other. Functional divergence was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. A single nucleotide position in Cbr MEX can determine whether Cel DCC binds. This rapid divergence of DCC target specificity could have been an important factor in establishing reproductive isolation between nematode species and contrasts dramatically with conservation of target specificity for X-chromosome dosage compensation across Drosophila species and for transcription factors controlling developmental processes such as body-plan specification from fruit flies to mice.",

    "abstract": "This paper suggests an explanation for listeners greater tolerance to positive than negative mistuning of the higher tone within an octave pair. It hypothesizes a neural circuit tuned to cancel the lower tone, that also cancels the higher tone if that tone is in tune. Imperfect cancellation is the cue to mistuning of the octave. The circuit involves two neural pathways, one delayed with respect to the other, that feed a coincidence-sensitive neuron via excitatory and inhibitory synapses. A mismatch between the time constants of these two synapses results in an asymmetry in sensitivity to mismatch. Specifically, if the time constant of the delayed pathway is greater than that of the direct pathway, there is a greater tolerance to positive mistuning than to negative mistuning. The model is directly applicable to the harmonic octave (concurrent tones), but extending it to the melodic octave (successive tones) requires additional assumptions that are discussed. The paper reviews evidence from auditory psychophysics and physiology in favor - or against - this explanation.",

    "abstract": "Rapid movements of limbs and appendages, faster than those produced by simple muscle contraction alone, are generated through mechanical networks consisting of springs and latches. The latch plays a central role in these spring-loaded mechanisms, but the structural details of the latch are not always known. The mandibles of the trapjaw ant Odontomachus kuroiwae closes the mandible extremely quickly to capture prey or to perform mandible-powered defensive jumps to avoid potential threats. The jump is mediated by a mechanical spring and latch system embodied in the mandible. An ant can strike the tip of the mandible onto the surface of an obstacle (prey, predator, or ground) in order to bounce its body away from potential threats. The angular velocity of the closing mandible was 2.3x104 rad/s. Latching of the joint is a key mechanism to aid the storage of energy required to power the ballistic movements of the mandibles. We have identified the fine structure of two latch systems on the mandible forming a  balljoint using an X-ray micro-computational tomography system (X-ray micro-CT) and X-ray live imaging with a synchrotron. Here we describe the surface of the inner section of the socket and a projection on the lip of the ball. The X-ray live imaging and movements of the 3D model show that the ball with a detent ridge slipped into a socket and over the socket ridge before snapping back at the groove edge. Our results give insight into the complex spring-latch systems that underpin ultra-fast movements in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "The cranial neural crest plays a fundamental role in orofacial development and morphogenesis. Accordingly, mutations with impact on the cranial neural crest and its development lead to orofacial malformations such as cleft lip and palate. As a pluripotent and dynamic cell population, the cranial neural crest undergoes vast transcriptional and epigenomic alterations throughout the formation of facial structures pointing to an essential role of factors regulating chromatin state or transcription levels. Using CRISPR/Cas9-guided genome editing and conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, we here show that inactivation of Kat5 and Ep400 as the two essential enzymatic subunits of the Tip60/Ep400 chromatin remodeling complexes severely affects carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in cranial neural crest cells. The resulting decrease in protein synthesis, proliferation and survival leads to a drastic reduction of cranial neural crest cells early in fetal development and a loss of most facial structures in the absence of either protein. Following heterozygous loss of Kat5 in neural crest cells palatogenesis was impaired. These findings point to a decisive role of the Tip60/Ep400 chromatin remodeling complex in facial morphogenesis and lead us to conclude that the orofacial clefting observed in patients with heterozygous KAT5 missense mutations is at least in part due to disturbances in the cranial neural crest.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract with limited treatments, and dietary intervention may be effective, and affordable, for managing symptoms. Glucosinolate compounds are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts, especially glucoraphanin, and can be metabolized by certain mammalian gut bacteria into anti inflammatory isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane. Gut microbiota exhibit biogeographic patterns, but it is unknown if colitis alters these or whether the location of glucoraphanin metabolizing bacteria affects anti-inflammatory benefits. We fed specific pathogen free C57BL/6 mice either a control diet or a 10% steamed broccoli sprout diet, and gave a three-cycle regimen of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water over a 34-day experiment to simulate chronic, relapsing ulcerative colitis. We monitored body weight, fecal characteristics, lipocalin, serum cytokines, and bacterial communities from the luminal and mucosa-associated populations in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet with DSS treatment performed better than mice fed the control diet with DSS, including significantly more weight gain, lower Disease Activity Indexes, lower plasma lipocalin and proinflammatory cytokines, and higher bacterial richness in all gut locations. Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location, but were more homogenous across locations in the control diet + DSS mice. Importantly, our results showed that broccoli sprout feeding abrogated the effects of DSS on gut microbiota, as bacterial richness and biogeography were similar between mice receiving broccoli sprouts with and without DSS. Collectively, these results support the protective effect of steamed broccoli sprouts against dysbiosis and colitis induced by DSS.\n\nImportanceEvaluating bacterial communities across different locations in the gut provides a greater insight than fecal samples alone, and provides an additional metric by which to evaluate beneficial host-microbe interactions. Here, we show that 10% steamed broccoli sprouts in the diet protects mice from the negative effects of dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis, that colitis erases biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities in the gut, and that the cecum is not likely to be a significant contributor to colonic bacteria of interest in the DSS mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet during colitis performed better than mice fed the control diet while receiving DSS.

    "abstract": "Crohns Disease (CD) is a presentation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) that manifests in childhood and adolescence, and involves chronic and severe enterocolitis, immune and gut microbiome dysregulation, and other complications. Diet and gut-microbiota-produced metabolites are sources of anti-inflammatories which could ameliorate symptoms. However, questions remain on how IBD influences biogeographic patterns of microbial location and function in the gut, how early life transitional gut communities are affected by IBD and diet interventions, and how disruption to biogeography alters disease mediation by diet components or microbial metabolites. Many studies on diet and IBD use a chemically induced ulcerative colitis model, despite the availability of an immune-modulated CD model. Interleukin-10-knockout (IL-10-KO) mice on a C57BL/6 background, beginning at age 4 or 7 weeks, were fed a control diet or one containing 10% (w/w) raw broccoli sprouts, which was high in the sprout-sourced anti-inflammatory sulforaphane. Diets began 7 days prior to, and for 2 weeks after inoculation with Helicobacter hepaticus, which triggers Crohns-like symptoms in these immune-impaired mice. The broccoli sprout diet increased sulforaphane in plasma; decreased weight stagnation, fecal blood, and diarrhea associated; and increased microbiota richness in the gut, especially in younger mice. Sprout diets resulted in some anatomically specific bacteria in younger mice, and reduced the prevalence and abundance of pathobiont bacteria which trigger inflammation in the IL-10-KO mouse, for example; Escherichia coli and Helicobacter. Overall, the IL-10-KO mouse model is responsive to a raw broccoli sprout diet and represents an opportunity for more diet-host-microbiome research.\n\nImportanceTo our knowledge, IL-10-KO mice have not previously been used to investigate the interactions of host, microbiota, and broccoli, broccoli sprouts, or broccoli bioactives in resolving symptoms of CD. We showed that a diet containing 10% raw broccoli sprouts increased the plasma concentration of the anti-inflammatory compound sulforaphane, and protected mice to varying degrees against negative disease symptoms, including weight loss or stagnation, fecal blood, and diarrhea. Younger mice responded more strongly to the diet, further reducing symptoms, as well as increased gut bacterial community richness, increased bacterial community similarity to each other, and more location-specific communities than older mice on the diet intervention. Crohns Disease disrupts the lives of patients, and requires people to alter dietary and lifestyle habits to manage symptoms. The current medical treatment is extremely expensive, and a dietary intervention represents an affordable, accessible, and simple strategy to reduce the burden of symptoms.",

We present a novel method, uvaia, which is based on partial and exact sequence similarity for quickly extracting database sequences similar to query sequences of interest. Many SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analyses rely on very low numbers of ambiguous sites as a measure of quality since ambiguous sites do not contribute to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences, which uvaia alleviates by using measures of sequence similarity that consider partially ambiguous sites. Such fine-grained definition of similarity allows not only for better phylogenetic analyses, but also for improved classification and biogeographical inferences.

Several rAAV vectored therapies have achieved regulatory approval, but production of sufficient rAAV quantities remains difficult. The AAV Rep proteins, which are essential for genome replication and packaging, represent a promising engineering target for improvement of rAAV production but remain underexplored. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Rep proteins and their mutational landscape, we assayed the effects of all 39,297 possible single codon mutations to the AAV2 rep gene on AAV2 production. Most beneficial variants are not observed in nature, indicating that improved production may require synthetic mutations. Additionally, the effects of AAV2 rep mutations were largely consistent across capsid serotypes, suggesting that production benefits are capsid independent. Our results provide a detailed sequence-to-function map that enhances our understanding of Rep protein function and lays the groundwork for Rep engineering and enhancement of large-scale gene therapy production.",

We found that memory specificity correlated with the amount of cell turnover between a shock and neutral arena and that learning caused context-specific remapping. We induced amnesia by blocking protein synthesis following learning, which promoted an acute suppression of neural activity, and arrested learning-related place field remapping. Finally, freeze-predicting neural ensembles emerged following learning, and their coordinated activity required protein synthesis.

    "abstract": "Developmental programmed cell death (dPCD) in Arabidopsis thaliana is an integral part of the differentiation process of the root cap, a specialized organ surrounding meristematic stem cells. dPCD in lateral root cap (LRC) cells depends on the transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and is followed by rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance, involving the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1 downstream of SMB. Based on transcriptomic analyses, we observed the downregulation of BFN1 during colonization of A. thaliana by the beneficial root endophyte Serendipita indica. Roots of smb3 mutants, deficient in root cap dPCD and corpse clearance, are covered by uncleared LRC cell corpses and hypercolonized by S. indica from the root tip upwards. The bfn1-1 mutant exhibits an attenuated delayed corpse clearance phenotype, but still enhances colonization by S. indica. These results highlight that the constant production and clearance of LRC cells, in addition to its function in root cap size control, represents a sophisticated physical defense mechanism to prevent microbial colonization in close proximity to meristematic stem cells. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism by which S. indica manipulates dPCD in A. thaliana roots by downregulating BFN1 to promote fungal colonization through delayed clearance of dead cells, which present potential sources of nutrients.",

However, the full spectrum, characteristics and regulation of existing metabolic switches are unknown. We propose that metabolic switches can be recognised by locating large alternating gene expression patterns and associate them with specific metabolic states. We developed a method to identify interspersed genesets by massive correlated biclustering (MCbiclust) and to predict their metabolic wiring. Testing the method on major breast cancer transcriptome datasets we discovered a series of gene sets with switch-like behaviour, predicting mitochondrial content, activity and central carbon fluxes in tumours associated with different switch positions. The predictions were experimentally validated by bioenergetic profiling and metabolic flux analysis of 13C-labelled substrates and were ultimately extended by geneset analysis to link metabolic alterations to cellular states, thus predicting tumour pathology, prognosis and chemosensitivity. The method is applicable to any large and heterogeneous transcriptome dataset to discover metabolic and associated pathophysiological states.",

The neural correlates of the internal model of familiarity and the cellular mechanisms of enhanced novelty detection following multi-day repeated passive experience remain elusive. Using the mouse visual cortex as a model system, we test how the repeated passive experience of a 45{degrees} orientation-grating stimulus for multiple days alters spontaneous and non-familiar stimuli evoked neural activity in neurons tuned to familiar or non-familiar stimuli. We found that familiarity elicits stimulus competition such that stimulus selectivity reduces in neurons tuned to the familiar 45{degrees} stimulus; it increases in those tuned to the 90{degrees} stimulus but does not affect neurons tuned to the orthogonal 135{degrees} stimulus. Furthermore, neurons tuned to orientations 45{degrees} apart from the familiar stimulus dominate local functional connectivity. Interestingly, responsiveness to natural images, which consists of familiar and non-familiar orientations, increases subtly in neurons that exhibit stimulus competition. We also show the similarity between familiar grating stimulus-evoked and spontaneous activity increases, indicative of an internal model of altered experience.",

In addition, the effects of a CXCR1/CXCR2 antagonist, SX-682, on melanoma tumorigenesis were evaluated in BrafV600E/Pten-/- and NRasQ61R/INK4a-/- mice and in melanoma cell lines. Potential mechanisms by which Cxcr2 affects melanoma tumorigenesis in these murine models were explored using RNAseq, mMCP-counter, ChIPseq, and qRT-PCR; flow cytometry, and reverse phosphoprotein analysis (RPPA).\n\nResultsGenetic loss of Cxcr2 or pharmacological inhibition of CXCR1/CXCR2 during melanoma tumor induction resulted in key changes in gene expression that reduced tumor incidence/growth and increased anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, after Cxcr2 ablation, Tfcp2l1, a key tumor suppressive transcription factor, was the only gene significantly induced with a log2 fold-change greater than 2 in these three different melanoma models.\n\nConclusionsHere, we provide novel mechanistic insight revealing how loss of Cxcr2 expression/activity in melanoma tumor progenitor cells results in reduced tumor burden and creation of an anti-tumor immune microenvironment. This mechanism entails an increase in expression of the tumor suppressive transcription factor, Tfcp2l1, along with alteration in the expression of genes involved in growth regulation, tumor suppression, stemness, differentiation, and immune modulation. These gene expression changes are coincident with reduction in the activation of key growth regulatory pathways, including AKT and mTOR.",

    "abstract": "Myriad bacterial anti-phage systems have been described and often the mechanism of programmed cell death is invoked for phage inhibition. However, there is little evidence of  suicide under physiological conditions for these systems. Instead of death to stop phage propagation, we show here that persister cells, i.e., transiently-tolerant, dormant, antibiotic-insensitive cells, are formed and survive using the Escherichia coli C496_10 tripartite toxin/antitoxin system MqsR/MqsA/MqsC to inhibit T2 phage. Specifically, MqsR/MqsA/MqsC inhibited T2 phage by one million-fold and reduced T2 titers by 500-fold. During T2 phage attack, in the presence of MqsR/MqsA/MqsC, evidence of persistence include the single-cell physiological change of reduced metabolism (via flow cytometry), increased spherical morphology (via transmission electron microscopy), and heterogeneous resuscitation. Critically, we found restriction-modification systems (primarily EcoK McrBC) work in concert with the toxin/antitoxin system to inactivate phage, likely while the cells are in the persister state. Phage attack also induces persistence in Klebsiella and Pseudomonas spp. Hence, phage attack invokes a stress response similar to antibiotics, starvation, and oxidation, which leads to persistence, and this dormant state likely allows restriction/modification systems to clear phage DNA.",

Here, we investigated the impact of non-synonymous mutations in SF3B1 and U2AF1, two splicing factors commonly mutated in cancer, on transcription.

This elongation defect is linked to disrupted pre-spliceosome assembly due to impaired protein-protein interactions of mutant SF3B1. Through an unbiased screen, we identified epigenetic factors in the Sin3/HDAC complex, which, when modulated, normalize transcription defects and their downstream effects.

    "abstract": "For correct chromosome segregation in mitosis, sister kinetochores must interact with microtubules from opposite spindle poles (biorientation). For this, aberrant kinetochore- microtubule interaction must be resolved (error correction) by Aurora B kinase. Once biorientation is formed, tension is applied across sister kinetochores, stabilizing kinetochore- microtubule interactions. The mechanism for this tension-dependent process has been debated. Here we study how localizations of Aurora B at different kinetochore sites affect the establishment and maintenance of biorientation in budding yeast. In the absence of the physiological Aurora B-INCENP recruitment mechanisms, engineered recruitment of Aurora B-INCENP to the inner kinetochore (Mif2) prior to biorientation supports the subsequent establishment of biorientation. By contrast, an engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to the outer kinetochore (Ndc80) fails to support biorientation establishment. Furthermore, when the physiological Aurora B-INCENP recruitment mechanisms are present, an engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to Mif2 during metaphase (after biorientation establishment) does not affect biorientation maintenance. By contrast, an engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to Ndc80 during metaphase leads to disruption of biorientation, which is dependent on the kinase activity of Aurora B. Taken together, our results suggest that spatial separation of Aurora B from its outer kinetochore substrates is required to stabilize kinetochore-microtubule interaction when biorientation is formed and tension is applied on this interaction. Meanwhile, Aurora B shows dynamic turnover (or exchange) on the centromere and kinetochore during early mitosis. It has been thought that this turnover is crucial for error correction and biorientation, as it may help Aurora B reach its substrates in distance and/or may facilitate the Aurora B activation on the mitotic spindle. However, using the engineered Aurora B-INCENP recruitment to the inner kinetochore, we demonstrate that, even without such a turnover, Aurora B-INCENP can efficiently support biorientation. Altogether, our study provides important insights into how Aurora B promotes error correction and biorientation in a tension-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we found that Wnt and Notch signaling govern stem cells of clear cell kidney cancer (ccRCC) in patients. To mimic stem cell responses in the normal kidney in vitro in a marker-unbiased fashion, we have established organoids from total single adult mouse kidney epithelial cells in Matrigel and serum-free conditions. Deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that the organoids resembled renewal of adult kidney tubular epithelia, since organoid cells displayed activity of Wnt and Notch signaling, long-term proliferation and expression of markers of proximal and distal nephron lineages. In our wish to model stem cell-derived human ccRCC, we have generated two types of genetic double kidney mutants in mice: Wnt-{beta}-catenin-GOF together with Notch-GOF and Wnt-{beta}-catenin-GOF together with a most common alteration in ccRCC, Vhl-LOF. An inducible Pax8-rtTA-LC1-Cre was used to drive recombination specifically in adult kidney epithelial cells. We confirmed mutagenesis of {beta}-catenin, Notch and Vhl alleles on DNA, protein and mRNA target gene levels. Surprisingly, we observed symptoms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mutant mice, but no increased proliferation and tumorigenesis. Thus, the responses of kidney stem cells in the organoid and genetic systems produced different phenotypes, i.e. enhanced renewal versus CKD.",

We generated single-cell transcriptomic atlases across the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans under different pro-longevity conditions (http://mengwanglab.org/atlas). We found cell-specific, age-related changes across somatic and germ cell types and developed transcriptomic aging clocks for different tissues. These clocks enabled us to determine tissue-specific aging-slowing effects of different pro-longevity mechanisms, and identify major cell types sensitive to these regulations. Additionally, we provided a systemic view of alternative polyadenylation events in different cell types, as well as their cell-type-specific changes during aging and under different pro-longevity conditions. Together, this study provides molecular insights into how aging occurs in different cell types and how they respond to pro-longevity strategies.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are often deregulated in tumor cells, resulting in altered transcriptional programs that facilitate tumor growth. These altered networks may make tumor cells vulnerable to the inhibition of specific regulatory proteins. Consequently, the reconstruction of GRNs in tumors is often proposed as a means to identify therapeutic targets. While there are examples of individual targets identified using GRNs, the extent to which GRNs can be used to predict sensitivity to targeted intervention in general remains unknown. Here we use the results of genome-wide CRISPR screens to systematically assess the ability of GRNs to predict sensitivity to gene inhibition in cancer cell lines. Using GRNs derived from multiple sources, including GRNs reconstructed from tumor transcriptomes and from curated databases, we infer regulatory gene activity in cancer cell lines from ten cancer types. We then ask, in each cancer type, if the inferred regulatory activity of each gene is predictive of sensitivity to CRISPR perturbation of that gene. We observe slight variation in the correlation between gene regulatory activity and gene sensitivity depending on the source of the GRN and the activity estimation method used. However, we find that there is consistently a stronger relationship between mRNA abundance and gene sensitivity than there is between regulatory gene activity and gene sensitivity. This is true both when gene sensitivity is treated as a binary and a quantitative property. Overall, our results suggest that gene sensitivity is better predicted by measured expression than by GRN-inferred activity.",

    "abstract": "Plant microbiome contribute directly to plant health and productivity but mechanisms that underpin plant microbiome assembly in different compartments (e.g. root, leaf) are not fully understood. Identifying environmental and management factors that affect plant microbiome assembly is important to advance understanding of fundamental ecological processes and harnessing microbiome for improved primary productivity and environmental sustainability. Irrigation and fertilization are two common management practices in Australian tree plantations, but little is known about the effects of these treatments on soil, plant host, and their microbiome. Here, we investigated the impact of a decade long irrigation, fertilization, and their combined application, on soil, plant traits and microbiome of a Eucalyptus saligna plantation at the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment, Western Sydney University, Richmond, NSW. Microbial profiling of bulk soil, rhizosphere, root, and leaves was performed using amplicon sequencing 16S rDNA and ITS markers for bacteria and fungi, respectively, along with measurements of soil properties and plant traits. The results indicated that both management practices affected soil properties and soil and root microbiome significantly. Irrigation increased but fertilizer treatment reduced microbial alpha diversity. However, neither irrigation nor fertilizer treatment significantly impacted the leaf microbiome. Our findings imply that management practices impact soil edaphic factors, which in turn influence the below ground microbiome (soil and root). In addition, the leaf microbiome was distinct from soil and root microbiome, and a source tracker analysis suggested root and bulk soils only contributed to 53% and 10% OTUs of the leaf bacterial community, suggesting strong and sequential host selection of the leaf microbiome. In addition, management practices had limited impact on leaf traits and, consequently, the leaf microbiome maintained its distinct composition. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for ecological processes that drive plant microbiome assembly and indicate that host selection plays a more important role than management practices on leaf microbiome assembly.",

    "abstract": "UbiA prenyltransferase domain containing protein-1 (UBIAD1) is a polytopic membrane-bound enzyme that synthesizes the vitamin K2 subtype menaquinone-4 (MK-4) by conjugating the prenyl group of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to the aromatic acceptor menadione. The enzyme moonlights as a regulator endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids. When cells are replete with isoprenoids, UBIAD1 constitutively cycles between membranes of the medial-trans Golgi and the ER. When ER membranes become depleted of GGpp, UBIAD1 becomes trapped in the organelle where it binds to and inhibits the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR. This inhibition permits continued synthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids, even when sterols are abundant. The resultant accumulation of GGpp in the ER causes dissociation of the HMGCR-UBIAD1 complex, which allows maximal ERAD of HMGCR and translocation of UBIAD1 to the Golgi. These findings disclose a novel GGpp sensing mechanism that allows for metabolically-regulated, intracellular trafficking of UBIAD1. However, the mechanism for this GGpp-induced transport remains to be determined. In the current study, we use cysteine derivatization and protease protection assays to determine the membrane topology of UBIAD1. These findings are key to the determination of mechanisms through which GGpp modulates the intracellular trafficking of UBIAD1 and ultimately, the ERAD of HMGCR.",

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol use causes a great deal of harm and negative health outcomes. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), a stress-related neuropeptide, has been implicated in binge ethanol intake and ethanol dependence. CRF containing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTCRF) can control ethanol consumption. These BNSTCRF neurons also release GABA, raising the question, is it CRF or GABA release or both that is controlling alcohol consumption. Here, we used viral vectors to separate the effects of CRF and GABA release from BNSTCRF neurons on the escalation of ethanol intake in an operant self-administration paradigm in male and female mice. We found that CRF deletion in BNST neurons reduces ethanol intake in both sexes, with a stronger effect in males. For sucrose self-administration there was no effect of CRF deletion. Suppression of GABA release, via knockdown of vGAT, from BNSTCRF produced a transient increase in ethanol operant self-administration following in male mice, and reduced in motivation to work for sucrose on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement in a sex-dependent manner. Together, these results highlight how different signaling molecules from the same populations of neurons can bidirectionally control behavior. Moreover, they suggest that BNST CRF release is important for high intensity ethanol drinking that precedes dependence, whereas GABA release from these neurons may play a role in regulating motivation.",

Cellular surveillance systems also target OM-resident proteins to control organellar homeostasis and ensure cell survival under stress. Using traditional approaches to discover OM proteins and identify their dynamically interacting partners remains challenging. In this study, we developed an OM proximity labeling (OMPL) system using biotin ligase-mediated proximity biotinylation to map the proximity proteome of the OMs of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes in living Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cells. We demonstrate the power of this system with the discovery of cytosolic factors and OM receptor candidates involved in local protein translation and translocation, membrane contact sites, and organelle quality control. This system also performed admirably for the rapid isolation of intact mitochondria and peroxisomes. Our data support the notion that TOM20-3 is a candidate for both a mitochondrial and a chloroplast receptor, and that PEX11D is a candidate for a peroxisome receptor for the coupling of protein translation and import. OMPL-generated OM proximity proteomes are valuable sources of candidates for functional validation and suggest directions for further investigation of important questions in cell biology.",

In mouse liver, cyclin D1-positive hepatocytes in the midlobular zone repopulate the parenchyma at a constant rate to preserve liver homeostasis.

Hepatic stellate cells, the livers pericytes, are in close proximity to hepatocytes and have been implicated in supporting hepatocyte proliferation, but their role in liver homeostasis is unknown. Here, we employ a T cell-mediated hepatic stellate cell ablation model to remove nearly all hepatic stellate cells in the murine liver, enabling the unbiased characterization of hepatic stellate cell functions. In the normal murine liver, complete loss of hepatic stellate cells persists for up to 6 weeks and reduces liver mass. Our results show that hepatic stellate cells induce cyclin D1 in midlobular hepatocytes by release of neurotrophin-3 to promote hepatocyte proliferation via tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling. These findings establish that hepatic stellate cells form the niche for midlobular hepatocytes and reveal a novel hepatocyte growth factor signaling pathway.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryHepatic stellate cells provide mitogenic cues for midlobular hepatocyte proliferation and metabolic zonation by secreting neurotrophin-3.",

We investigated whether the pigmented cells have melanocytic characteristics and functions by qRT-PCR, immunocytochemical analysis and flow cytometry. We also investigated their biocompatibility by injecting the cells into immunodeficient mice for clinical use.\n\nResultWe successfully differentiated and established a pure culture of melanocytes. The melanocytes maintained their growth rate for a long time, approximately 200 days, and were functional. They exhibited melanogenesis and transfer of melanin to peripheral keratinocytes. Moreover, melanocytes simulated the developmental processes from melanoblasts to melanocytes. The melanocytes had high engraftability and biocompatibility in the immunodeficient mice.\n\nConclusionThe robust generation of functional and long-lived melanocytes are key to developing clinical applications for the treatment of pigmentary skin disorders.",

    "abstract": "Pericentromeric heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences prone to aberrant recombination. Previous studies showed that homologous recombination (HR) repair is uniquely regulated in this domain to enable  safe repair while preventing aberrant recombination. In Drosophila cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) relocalize to the nuclear periphery through nuclear actin-driven directed motions before recruiting the strand invasion protein Rad51 and completing HR repair. End-joining (EJ) repair also occurs with high frequency in heterochromatin of fly tissues, but how alternative EJ (alt-EJ) pathways operate in heterochromatin remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we induce DSBs in single euchromatic and heterochromatic sites using a new system that combines the DR-white reporter and I-SceI expression in spermatogonia of flies. Using this approach, we detect higher frequency of HR repair in heterochromatin, relative to euchromatin. Further, sequencing of mutagenic repair junctions reveals the preferential use of different EJ pathways across distinct euchromatic and heterochromatic sites. Interestingly, synthesis-dependent microhomology-mediated end joining (SD-MMEJ) appears differentially regulated in the two domains, with a preferential use of motifs close to the cut site in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin, resulting in smaller deletions. Together, these studies establish a new approach to study repair outcomes in fly tissues, and support the conclusion that heterochromatin uses more HR and less mutagenic EJ repair relative to euchromatin.",

    "abstract": "It has recently been discovered that eukaryotic cells are host to a multiplicity of biomolecular condensates. These condensates typically contain protein components with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). While IDRs have been proposed and demonstrated to play many roles in the literature, we suggest here an additional crucial role of IDRs, which is to exclude unwanted \"intruders\" from condensates. This exclusion effect arises from the large conformational entropy of IDRs, i.e., there is a large free-energy cost to occupying volume that would otherwise be available to the IDRs. We find that at realistic IDR densities, particles as small as the size of an average protein (4 nm in diameter) can be more than 98% excluded from condensates. Application of the developed size-exclusion theory to biological condensates suggests that condensate IDRs may play a generic exclusionary role across organisms and types of condensates.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing worldwide epidemic that carries numerous metabolic complications including increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated the PPP1R3B locus with cardiometabolic traits including fasting glucose and insulin levels (T2D traits), plasma lipids (CVD traits), and indications of hepatic steatosis and liver damage (NAFLD traits)1-5. The PPP1R3B gene encodes the glycogen regulatory protein PPP1R3B (also known as GL) which has an established role in liver glycogen metabolism and plasma glucose homeostasis6,7. The metabolic and NAFLD GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region, which are all in high linkage disequilibrium, result in increased liver PPP1R3B expression and hepatic glycogen accumulation, but have provided conflicting results on the impacts on hepatic steatosis and liver damage. Here we investigate the consequences of both Ppp1r3b overexpression and deletion in mouse and cell models and find that dysregulated Ppp1r3b expression in either direction promotes metabolic dysfunction and liver injury. Hepatocyte overexpression of Ppp1r3b increases hepatic glycogen storage, prolongs fasting blood glucose levels, and confers protection from hepatic steatosis, but increases plasma ALT in aged animals. Conversely, deletion of hepatocyte Ppp1r3b eliminates hepatic glycogen, causes impaired glucose disposal, and results in hepatic steatosis with age or high sucrose diet. We investigated the metabolic pathways contributing to steatosis and found that Ppp1r3b deletion and diminished glycogenesis diverts the storage of exogenous glucose to hepatic triglycerides (TG), and stored liver lipids are preferentially used for energy during fasting through lipid oxidation and ketogenesis. Further, we interrogated two large human biobank cohorts and found carriers of SNPs associated with increased PPP1R3B expression have increased plasma glucose, decreased hepatic fat, and lower plasma lipids, while putative loss-of-function (pLoF) variant carriers have increased hepatic fat and elevated plasma ketones and lipids, consistent with the results seen in our mouse models. These findings suggest hepatic PPP1R3B serves as a metabolic switch favoring hepatic energy storage as glycogen instead of TG.",

Using an E. coli quantitative transposition assay, we show that CASTs use CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from these defense systems for horizontal gene transfer. A high-resolution structure of the type I-F CAST-Cascade in complex with a type III-B crRNA reveals that Cas6 recognizes direct repeats via sequence-independent{pi} - {pi} interactions. In addition to using heterologous CRISPR arrays, type V CASTs can also transpose via a crRNA-independent unguided mechanism, even when the S15 co-factor is over-expressed. Over-expressing S15 and the trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) or a single guide RNA (sgRNA) reduces, but does not abrogate, off-target integration for type V CASTs. Exploiting new spacers in defense-associated CRISPR arrays explains how CASTs horizontally transfer to new hosts. More broadly, this work will guide further efforts to engineer the activity and specificity of CASTs for gene editing applications.",

    "abstract": "C. elegans is a free-living nematode that must adapt to a wide range of environments including both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. To survive in low oxygen, C. elegans can use an unusual form of anaerobic respiration that relies on rhodoquinone (RQ) as an alternative electron carrier. Parasitic nematodes like hookworm and whipworm also require rhodoquinone-dependent metabolism (RQDM) to survive in the highly anaerobic conditions in the human gut. Understanding how RQDM is regulated in C. elegans may thus identify new ways to combat these closely-related major human pathogens. We previously established a simple movement-based assay for RQDM in C. elegans. In this study, we tested a panel of wild-type isolates of C. elegans in our RQDM assay and find substantial variation in their ability to use RQDM. We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci that affect RQDM -- this identified a single major QTL on the right arm of Chromosome III. We used RNAi to test almost all genes within the QTL region for involvement in RQDM and found one gene, wah-1, that strongly modulates RQDM-dependent recovery in C. elegans. WAH-1 is a mitochondrial flavoprotein that affects the electron transport chain, consistent with a role in RQDM. We show that wah-1 expression varies between isolates due to major changes in wah-1 transcript structures and this correlates tightly with variation in RQDM. Finally, we show that there is similar complexity to wah-1 transcription in parasitic nematodes and that wah-1 transcript structures change as parasites shift from aerobic to anaerobic, RQ- requiring metabolism. We thus conclude that reduced wah-1 expression correlates with increased ability to survive in conditions where RQDM is essential.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal and early life exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) have repeatedly been shown to induce stable, long-term changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) in offspring. It has been hypothesized that these changes might be functionally related to the known outcomes of prenatal and early life CS exposure, which include impaired lung development, altered lung function and increased risk of asthma and wheeze. However, to date, few studies have examined DNAm changes induced by prenatal CS in tissues of the lung, and even fewer have attempted to examine the specific influences of prenatal versus early postnatal exposures. Here, we have established a mouse model of CS exposure which isolates the effects of prenatal and early postnatal CS exposures in early life. We have used this model to measure the effects of prenatal and/or postnatal CS exposures on lung function and immune cell infiltration as well as DNAm and expression of Cyp1a1, a candidate gene previously observed to demonstrate DNAm differences upon CS exposure in humans. Our study revealed that exposure to CS prenatally and in the early postnatal period cause long-lasting differences in offspring lung function, gene expression and lung Cyp1a1 DNAm, which wane over time but are reestablished upon re-exposure to CS in adulthood. This study creates a testable mouse model which can be used to investigate the effects of prenatal and early postnatal CS exposures and will contribute to the design of intervention strategies to mediate these detrimental effects.",

    "abstract": "GPCRs mediate neuromodulation through activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins (G{beta}{gamma}). Classical models depict that G-protein activation leads to a one-to-one formation of G-GTP and G{beta}{gamma} species. Each of these species propagates signaling by independently acting on effectors, but the mechanisms by which response fidelity is ensured by coordinating G and G{beta}{gamma} responses remain unknown. Here, we reveal a paradigm of G-protein regulation whereby the neuronal protein GINIP biases inhibitory GPCR responses to favor G{beta}{gamma} over G signaling. Tight binding of GINIP to Gi-GTP precludes its association with effectors (adenylyl cyclase) and, simultaneously, with Regulator-of-G-protein-Signaling (RGS) proteins that accelerate deactivation. As a consequence, Gi-GTP signaling is dampened whereas G{beta}{gamma} signaling is enhanced. We show that this mechanism is essential to prevent imbalances of neurotransmission that underlie increased seizure susceptibility in vivo. Our findings reveal an additional layer of regulation within a quintessential mechanism of signal transduction that sets the tone of neurotransmission.",

The SBP can adopt an  open or  closed state depending on the presence of substrate. The two transmembrane domains of TRAP transporters form a monomeric elevator whose function is strictly dependent on the presence of a sodium ion gradient. Insights from experimental structures, structural predictions and molecular modeling have suggested a conformational coupling between the membrane elevator and the substrate binding protein. Here, we use a disulfide engineering approach to lock the TRAP transporter HiSiaPQM from Haemophilus influenzae in different conformational states. The SBP, HiSiaP, was locked in its substrate-bound form and the transmembrane elevator, HiSiaQM, was locked in either its predicted inward- or outward-facing states. We characterized the disulfide-locked variants and used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to study their interactions. Our experiments demonstrate that the SBP and the transmembrane elevator are indeed  conformationally coupled, meaning that the open and closed state of the SBP recognize specific conformational states of the transporter and vice versa.",

Focusing on two enzyme families, we expressed and purified over 440 natural and generated sequences with 70-90% identity to the most similar natural sequences to benchmark computational metrics for predicting in vitro enzyme activity. Over three rounds of experiments, we developed a computational filter that improved experimental success rates by 44-100%.

Natural cell-penetrating protein toxins have shown promise as protein delivery platforms but existing approaches are limited by immunogenicity, lack of cell type specificity, or their multicomponent nature. Here we explore inactivated botulinum toxin (BoNT) as a protein delivery platform. Using split luciferase reconstitution in the cytosol as a readout for endosomal escape and cytosolic delivery, we showed that BoNT chimeras with nanobodies replacing their natural receptor binding domain could be selectively targeted to cells expressing nanobody-matched surface markers. We used chimeric BoNTs to deliver a range of cargo from 1.3-55 kD, and demonstrated selective delivery of orthogonal cargoes to distinct cell populations within a heterogenous mixture. These explorations suggest that BoNT can be a versatile platform for targeted protein and peptide delivery into mammalian cells.",

Use of a cardiac-biased promoter ensured the cardiac-directed expression of the therapeutic human transgene without signs of clinical toxicity. The beneficial effects of rAAV5-hS100A1 were linked to an attenuated activity of post-MI inflammatory gene networks and this was further validated in a murine model.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe EF-hand Ca2+ sensor protein S100A1 has been identified as a molecular regulator and enhancer of cardiac performance. S100A1s ability to recognize and modulate the activity of targets such as SERCA2a and RyR2 in cardiomyocytes has mostly been ascribed to its hydrophobic C-terminal -helix (residues 75-94). Objective: We therefore hypothesized that a synthetic peptide consisting of residues 75-94 of S100A1 and an N-terminal solubilization tag (S100A1ct) could mimic the performance enhancing effects of S100A1 and may be suitable as a peptide therapeutic to improve the function of diseased hearts. Methods and Results: Applying an integrative translational research pipeline, ranging from computational molecular modeling to large animal cardiac disease models, we characterize S100A1ct as a cell-penetrating peptide with positive inotropic and antiarrhythmic properties in normal and failing myocardium in vitro and in vivo. This activity translates into improved contractile performance and survival in pre-clinical heart failure models with reduced ejection fraction after S100A1ct systemic administration. Mechanistically, S100A1ct exerts a fast and sustained dose-dependent enhancement of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ cycling and prevents {beta}-adrenergic receptor triggered Ca2+ imbalances by targeting SERCA2a and RyR2 activity. Modeling suggests that S100A1ct may stimulate SERCA2a by interacting with the sarcoplasmic transmembrane segments of the multi-span integral membrane Ca2+ pump. Incorporation of a cardiomyocyte targeting peptide tag into S100A1ct (cor-S100A1ct) further enhanced its biological and therapeutic potency in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: S100A1ct peptide is a promising lead for the development of a novel peptide-based therapeutic against heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the contribution of soil organic layers to bacterial diversity evaluations. We used a forest in the eastern Amazon and an adjacent pasture as model systems. Distinct organic and organo-mineral layers were identified in the forest and pasture floors, including the litter, partially and wholly decomposed organic material, and the mineral and rhizospheric soils. DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR were performed to assess bacterial community structure and the abundance of critical groups of the N cycle. We observed a clear vertical gradient in bacterial community composition. Species followed a log-normal distribution, with the highest richness and diversity observed in transitional organic layers of both land uses. Generally, critical groups of the N cycle were more abundant in these transitional layers, especially in the pastures fragmented litter and in the forests partially decomposed organic material. Considering the organic layers increased diversity estimates significantly, with the highest alpha and gamma bacterial diversity observed on the pasture floor and the highest beta diversity on the forest floor. The results show that organic layers harbor significant bacterial diversity in natural and anthropized systems and suggest that they can be crucial for maintaining the N cycle in these ecosystems, highlighting the need to consider them when studying soil bacterial diversity.",

    "abstract": "In many industries, from food to biofuels, contamination of production systems with predators is a costly problem and requires the maintenance of sterile operating conditions. In this study, we look at the robustness of one such alkaliphilic consortium, comprised largely of a cyanobacterium Candidatus Phormidium alkaliphilum, to viral predation. This consortium has existed without a community crash over several years in laboratory and pilot scale environments. We look at CRISPR-Cas systems and viral dynamics in this consortium at four conditions using metagenomic analyses. Results show that while there are active viral members in this community, viral predation of the cyanobacteria is low and does not affect the community dynamics. The multiple CRISPR arrays within the Phormidium were found to be static following initial lab establishment of consortium. Multiple cryptic CRISPR-Cas systems were detected with uncertain viral protection capacity. Our results suggest that dynamics of potential viruses and CRISPR-Cas mediated immunity likely play an important role in the initial establishment of consortia and may continue to support the functional robustness of engineered microbial communities throughout biotechnology applications.\n\nImportanceBiotechnology applications utilizing the function of microbial communities have become increasingly important solutions as we strive for sustainable applications. Although viral infections are known to have significant impact on microbial turnover and nutrient cycling, viral dynamics have remained largely overlooked in these engineered communities. Predatory perturbations to the functional stability of these microbial biotechnology applications must be investigated in order to design more robust applications. In this study, we closely examine virus-microbe dynamics in a model microbial community used in a biotechnology application. Our findings suggest that viral dynamics change significantly with environmental conditions and that microbial immunity may play an important role in maintaining functional stability. We present this study as a comprehensive template for other researchers interested in exploring predatory dynamics in engineered microbial communities.",

During the genesis of infection, HBV establishes an independent minichromosome consisting of the viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome and host histones. The first viral protein expressed, HBx, induces degradation of a host silencing factor to facilitate infection. However, the relationship between cccDNA chromatin and early HBx transcription remains poorly understood. Establishing reconstituted viral minichromosomes, we found that nucleosomes in cccDNA drive HBx transcription. We corroborated these findings in cells and further showed that the chromatin destabilizing drug CBL137 inhibits infection in hepatocytes. Our results shed new light on a long-standing paradox and represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of chronic HBV.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryChromatin assembly on the Hepatitis B Virus genome drives transcription of the critical viral oncogene HBx, and thus infection.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR genome editing is a powerful tool for elucidating biological functions. To modify the genome as intended, it is essential to understand the various modes of recombination that can occur. In this study, we report unexpected complex vector insertions that were identified during the generation of conditional alleles by CRISPR editing using microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). The targeting vector contained two loxP sequences and flanking 40-bp microhomologies. The genomic regions corresponding to the loxP sequences were cleaved with Cas9 in mouse embryonic stem cells. PCR screening for targeted recombination revealed a high frequency of bands of a larger size than expected. Nanopore sequencing of these bands revealed complex vector insertions mediated not only by MMEJ but also by non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination in at least 17% of the clones. A new band appeared upon improving the PCR conditions, suggesting the presence of unexpectedly modified alleles that escape standard PCR screening. This prompted us to characterize the recombination of each allele of the genome-edited clones using heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms, leading to confirmation of the presence of homozygous alleles. Our study indicates that careful quality control of genome-edited clones is needed to exclude complex, unexpected, on-target vector insertion.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella infections are a leading cause of bacterial food-borne illness worldwide. Infections are highly associated with the consumption of contaminated food, and in particular, chicken meat. Understanding how management practices and environmental factors influence Salmonella populations in broiler chicken production may aid in reducing the risk of food-borne illness in humans. Utilizing whole genome sequencing with antimicrobial and heavy metal resistance, virulence factor and plasmid identification, we have characterized the genetic diversity of Salmonella enterica isolates (n = 55) obtained from broiler chicken litter. S. enterica isolates were recovered from the litter of broiler chickens over three consecutive flocks in four broiler houses on a single integrated farm in Georgia, USA. The chickens were raised under a newly adopted \"No Antibiotics Ever\" program and copper sulfate was administered via drinking water. In-silico serovar prediction identified three S. enterica serovars: Enteritidis (n = 12), Kentucky (n = 40) and Senftenberg (n = 3). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that only one S. Kentucky isolate was resistant to streptomycin, while the remaining isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Metal resistance operons, including copper and silver, were identified chromosomally and on plasmids in serovar Senftenberg and Kentucky isolates, respectively. Serovar Kentucky isolates harboring metal resistance operons were the only Salmonella isolates recovered from the litter of third flock cohort. These results suggest the addition of copper sulfate to drinking water may have selected for S. Kentucky isolates harboring plasmid-borne copper resistance genes and may explain their persistence in litter from flock to flock.\n\nImportanceSalmonella foodborne illnesses are the leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths, resulting in a high economic burden on the healthcare system. Globally, chicken meat is one of the highest consumed meats and is a predominant source of foodborne illness. The severity of Salmonella infections depends on the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors. While there are many studies which have investigated Salmonella strains isolated from post-harvest chicken samples, there is a gap in our understanding of the prevalence and persistence of Salmonella in pre-harvest and in particular their makeup of antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors and metal resistance genes. The objective of this study was to determine how on-farm management practices and environmental factors influence Salmonella persistence, as well as the antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors they harbor. In this study we demonstrate that broiler chickens raised without antibiotics are less likely to harbor antibiotic resistance, however the practice of adding acidified copper sulfate to drinking water may select for strains carrying metal resistant genes.",

    "abstract": "Genes of putative reductases of ,{beta}-unsaturated carboxylic acids are abundant among anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic microorganisms, yet substrate specificity has been experimentally verified for few encoded proteins. Here, we co-produced in Escherichia coli one such protein of the marine bacterium Vibrio ruber (GenBank SJN56021; annotated as urocanate reductase) with Vibrio cholerae flavin transferase. The isolated protein (named Crd) is a heterodimer of the SJN56021-encoded subunit CrdB (NADH:flavin, FAD binding 2, and FMN bind domains) and an additional subunit CrdA (SJN56019, a single NADH:flavin domain) that interact via their NADH:flavin domains (Alphafold2 prediction). Each domain contains a flavin group (three FMNs and one FAD in total), one of the FMN groups being linked covalently by the flavin transferase. Crd readily reduces cinnamate, p-coumarate, caffeate, and ferulate under anaerobic conditions with NADH or methyl viologen as the electron donor, is moderately active against acrylate and practically inactive against urocanate. The reduction reactions started by NADH demonstrated a time lag of several minutes, suggesting a redox regulation of Crd activity. The oxidized enzyme is inactive, which apparently prevents production of reactive oxygen species under aerobic conditions. Our findings identify Crd as a regulated NADH-dependent cinnamate reductase, apparently protecting V. ruber from cinnamate poisoning.\n\nAbbreviated SummaryThe genome of the marine bacterium Vibrio ruber encodes a heterodimeric NADH-dependent cinnamate reductase, apparently protecting V. ruber from poisoning by cinnamate and its derivatives.

    "abstract": "Hyperuricemia caused by elevated levels of serum uric acid is responsible for implication of gout and other associated disorders that influence the human health. So far, Xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors are the choice of first line drugs for the treatment of hyperuricemia. The objective of the present study was to isolate a potent XO inhibitor from the actinobacteria and to evaluate its inhibitory mechanism. Initially, XO was isolated from bovine milk using standard protocol and enzyme kinetics were evaluated. Thereafter, culture filtrates of actinobacteria (Amycolatopsis thermoflava ICTA 103), Streptomyces luteireticuli ICTA 16, Streptomyces kurssanovii ICTA165 and Amycolatopsis lurida ICTA 194) were screened for XO inhibition using in vitro qualitative NBT plate assay followed by extraction and purification of potent inhibitor 1-O-methyl chrysophanol (OMC), from the culture filtrate of Amycolatopsis thermoflava ICTA 103, which belongs to hydroxy anthraquinones (HAQ) family. Further, in silico molecular model building was performed to study the binding affinity of OMC towards XO followed by quantitative in vitro spectroscopic assays. The molecular building study explored the mechanistic view of binding interaction between inhibitor & enzyme and the results were corroborates with the in vitro kinetic study. The in vitro results revealed the significant enzyme inhibition potential of OMC with an IC50 and Ki value of 24.8 {+/-} 0.072 {micro}M & 2.218 {+/-} 0.3068 {micro}M respectively. These results are comparable to standard allopurinol, however, more significant than its structural analog, chrysophanol. The kinetic analysis revealed that OMC is a reversible slow binding inhibitor and the Lineweaver - Burkplot analysis showed mixed type inhibition of OMC against XO. These results are in agreement with chrysophanol. Findings of this study proposed a new derivative of HAQ in the pipeline of hyperuricemia therapeutic drug candidates.",

Despite the importance of AC8 in physiology, including cognitive functions and memory, the structural basis of its regulation by G proteins and CaM is not well defined. Here we report the 3.5 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the bovine AC8 bound to Ca2+/CaM and the stimulatory Gs protein. The structure reveals the architecture of the ordered AC8 domains bound to Gs and a small molecule activator forskolin. The extracellular surface of AC8 features a negatively charged pocket, a potential site for unknown interactors. Despite the well resolved forskolin density, the captured state of AC8 does not favour tight nucleotide binding. The structural proteomics approaches, limited proteolysis and crosslinking mass spectrometry, allow us to identify the contact sites between AC8 and its regulators, CaM, Gs, and G{beta}{gamma}, as well as the conformational changes induced by these interactions.

    "abstract": "3.1Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable respiratory disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. While vaccination rates remain high in developed countries, incidence of pertussis has increased following the transition from wP vaccines to aP vaccines. The reemergence of pertussis is attributed, in part, to waning immunity induced by aP vaccination. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine if addition of adjuvant to DTaP can modulate the immune response and improve protection compared to DTaP alone. In this study we immunized outbred, female CD-1 mice with 1/320th the human dose of vehicle control, DTaP, and DTaP supplemented with adjuvant. Markers of early vaccine-induced memory were measured using a chemokine assay or by flow cytometry. Protection was assessed by measuring serological responses and quantifying bacterial burden in the respiratory tract at day 3 post-challenge. From this work we identified a partially protective aP vaccine dose to use for vaccination and challenge studies. We observed that MPLA and SWE promote robust anti-B. pertussis antibody responses and stimulate significant increases in early markers of vaccine-induced memory such as CXCL13, FDCs, and TFH cells. Quil-A induced Th1 responses compared to DTaP alone, but none of the adjuvants improved protection against challenge with B. pertussis. Overall, the data suggests that addition of adjuvant modulates the protective immune responses induced by aPs. Further studies are needed to evaluate the B cell compartment and longevity of protection.",

Although the decrease in metabolic rate and body temperature during torpor is controlled by the brain, the underlying neural circuits remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify the neural circuits involved in torpor regulation by combining whole-brain mapping of torpor-activated neurons, cell type-specific manipulation of neural activity, and viral tracing-based circuit mapping. We found that Trpm2-positive neurons in the preoptic area and Vgat-positive neurons in the dorsal medial hypothalamus are activated during torpor. Genetic silencing shows the activity of either cell type is necessary to enter the torpor state. Finally, we show that these cells receive projections from the arcuate and suprachiasmatic nucleus and send projections to brain regions involved in thermoregulation. Our results demonstrate an essential role of hypothalamic neurons in the regulation of body temperature and metabolic rate during torpor and identify critical nodes of the torpor-regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "Nonhuman primates (NHPs) exhibit complex and diverse behavior that typifies advanced cognitive function and social communication, but quantitative and systematical measure of this natural nonverbal processing has been a technical challenge. Specifically, a method is required to automatically segment time series of behavior into elemental motion motifs, much like finding meaningful words in character strings. Here, we propose a solution called SyntacticMotionParser (SMP), a general-purpose unsupervised behavior parsing algorithm using a non-parametric Bayesian model. Using three-dimensional posture-tracking data from NHPs, SMP automatically outputs an optimized sequence of latent motion motifs classified into the most likely number of states. When applied to behavioral datasets from common marmosets and rhesus monkeys, SMP outperformed conventional posture-clustering models and detected a set of behavioral ethograms from publicly available data. SMP also quantified and visualized the behavioral effects of chemogenetic neural manipulations. SMP thus has the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of natural NHP behavior in a variety of contexts.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of symbolic thinking has been proposed as a dominant cognitive criterion to distinguish humans from other primates during hominization. Although the proper definition of a symbol has been the subject of much debate, one of its simplest features is bidirectional attachment: the content is accessible from the symbol, and vice versa. Behavioral observations scattered over the past four decades suggest that this criterion might not be met in non-human primates, as they fail to generalize an association learned in one temporal order (A to B) to the reverse order (B to A). Here, we designed an implicit fMRI test to investigate the neural mechanisms of arbitrary audio-visual and visual-visual pairing in monkeys and humans and probe their spontaneous reversibility. After learning a unidirectional association, humans showed surprise signals when this learned association was violated. Crucially, this effect occurred spontaneously in both learned and reversed directions, within an extended network of high-level brain areas, including, but also going beyond the language network. In monkeys, by contrast, violations of association effects occurred solely in the learned direction and were largely confined to sensory areas. We propose that a human-specific brain network may have evolved the capacity for reversible symbolic reference.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG triplet repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Previous research focused on neuropathology in the striatum and its association with a typical movement disorder. Direct effects of mutant HTT (mHTT) in the striatum may cause neuropathology, although non-cell autonomous effects have also been suggested. Important non-motor features of HD include psychiatric symptoms and metabolic dysfunction, which may be linked to hypothalamic neuropathology. As hypothalamic neurons project to the ventral striatum, we hypothesized that expression of mHTT in the hypothalamus leads to disrupted neurotransmission in the ventral striatum and causes pathology. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mHTT expression in the hypothalamus on ventral striatal neuropathology and its contribution to non-HD motor symptoms. We demonstrate that selective expression of mHTT in the hypothalamus leads to the loss of dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) immunopositive neurons in the ventral striatum in mice. Contrary to the effects of direct expression of mHTT in the hypothalamus, selective overexpression of mHTT in the ventral striatum does not affect body weight. Selective expression of mHTT in the ventral striatum leads to mHTT inclusion formation and loss of DARPP-32 neurons without affecting motor activity or anxiety-like behavior. We show that DARPP-32 neuron loss in the ventral striatum is recapitulated in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Chemogenetic activation of hypothalamic neurons projecting to the ventral striatum had a blunted response in the R6/2 mice compared to wild-type mice, indicating a disrupted hypothalamus-ventral striatal circuitry. In summary, the expression of mHTT in the hypothalamus may impact the development of ventral striatal pathology in mice. This opens the possibility that non-cell-autonomous effects in the reward circuitry play a role in HD.",
