    "abstract": "In neuroscience, it is of interest to consider all possible modes of information transfer between neurons in order to fully understand processing in the brain. It has been suggested that photonic communication may be possible along axonal connections, especially through the myelin sheath as a waveguide, due to its high refractive index. There is already a good deal of theoretical and experimental evidence for light guidance in the myelin sheath; however, the question of how the polarization of light is transmitted remains largely unexplored. It is presently unclear whether polarization-encoded information could be preserved within the myelin sheath. We simulate guided mode propagation through a myelinated axon structure with multiple Ranvier nodes. This allows both to observe polarization change and to test the assumption of exponentiated transmission loss through multiple Ranvier nodes for guided light in myelin sheath waveguides. We find that the polarization can be well preserved through multiple nodes and that transmission losses through multiple nodes are approximately multiplicative. These results provide an important context for the hypothesis of neural information transmission facilitated by biophotons, strengthening the possibility of both classical and quantum photonic communication within the brain.",

We measured norepinephrine and dopamine release, postsynaptic calcium responses, and interactions between tonic and phasic firing modes under various stimuli and conditions. High tonic activity in vivo depleted catecholamine stores, desensitized postsynaptic responses, and decreased phasic transmission. Together this provides a clearer understanding of the inverted-U relationship, offering insights into psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases with impaired catecholamine signaling.",

    "abstract": "Within the anterior inferior temporal cortex (AIT) there is a cluster of color selective neurons whose activities correlate with color discrimination behavior. To examine the causal relationship between the activities of these neurons and behavior, we applied electrical microstimulation to modulate neuronal activities within the AIT. We trained monkeys to perform a color judgment task and evaluated the effect of microstimulation in terms of the horizontal shift of the psychometric function. We found large effects of microstimulation on color discrimination behavior, predominantly within a subregion of the AIT. The cortical extent where microstimulation modulated behavior correlated with the presence of color-selective neurons. Unexpectedly, the direction of the modulation of color judgment evoked by microstimulation correlated negatively with the preference of the neurons around the stimulation site. These results support the existence of an anterior inferior temporal color-selective area (AITC) and its causal relationship with the color perception of these animals.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the complexity of neural activity has provided fundamental insights into cognition, consciousness, and clinical conditions. However, the most widely used approach to estimate the complexity of neural dynamics, Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ), has fundamental limitations that substantially restrict its domain of applicability. In this article we leverage the information-theoretic foundations of LZ to overcome these limitations by introducing a complexity estimator based on state-space models --which we dub Complexity via State-space Entropy Rate (CSER). While having a performance equivalent to LZ in discriminating states of consciousness, CSER boasts two crucial advantages: 1) CSER offers a principled decomposition into spectral components, which allows us to rigorously investigate the relationship between complexity and spectral power; and 2) CSER provides a temporal resolution two orders of magnitude better than LZ, which allows complexity analyses of e.g. event-locked neural signals. As a proof of principle, we use MEG, EEG and ECoG datasets of humans and monkeys to show that CSER identifies the gamma band as the main driver of complexity changes across states of consciousness; and reveals early entropy increases that precede the standard ERP in an auditory mismatch negativity paradigm by approximately 20ms. Overall, by overcoming the main limitations of LZ and substantially extending its range of applicability, CSER opens the door to novel investigations on the fine-grained spectral and temporal structure of the signal complexity associated with cognitive processes and conscious states.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how we recognize everyday objects requires unravelling the variables that govern the way we think about objects and the way in which our representations are organized neurally. A major hypothesis is that the organization of object knowledge follows key object-related dimensions, analogously to how sensory information is organized in the brain. Here, we explored, behaviorally and neurally, the multidimensionality of object processing. We focused on within-domain object information as a proxy for the kinds of object decision tasks we typically engage in our daily lives - e.g., identifying a knife from other types of manipulable objects such as spoons, axes or screwdrivers. To do so, we extracted object-related dimensions from subjective human judgments on a set of objects from a particular object domain - i.e., manipulable objects. We demonstrated that the extracted dimensions are cognitively interpretable - i.e., participants are able to label them; are cognitively relevant for manipulable object processing - i.e., categorization decisions are guided by these dimensions; and are important for the neural organization of knowledge - i.e., they are good predictors of the neural signals elicited by manipulable objects. This shows that multidimensionality is a hallmark of the organization of object knowledge in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The development of new approaches indirectly measuring the structural disconnectome has recently led to an increase in studies investigating pairwise structural disconnections following brain damage. Previous studies jointly analyzed patients with left hemispheric and patients with right hemispheric lesions when investigating a behavior of interest. An alternative approach would be to perform analyses separated by hemisphere, which has been applied in only a minority of studies to date. The present simulation study investigated whether joint or separate analyses (or both equally) are appropriate to reveal the ground truth disconnections. In fact, both approaches resulted in very different patterns of disconnection. In contrast to analyses separated by hemisphere, joint analyses introduced a bias to the disadvantage of intra-hemispheric disconnections. Intra-hemispheric disconnections were statistically underpowered in the joint analysis and thus surpassed the significance threshold with more difficulty compared to inter-hemispheric disconnections. This statistical imbalance was also shown by a greater number of significant inter-hemispheric than significant intra-hemispheric disconnections. This bias from joint analyses is based on mechanisms similar to those underlying the  partial injury problem. We therefore conclude that pairwise structural disconnections in patients with unilateral left hemispheric and with unilateral right hemispheric lesions exhibiting a specific behavior (or disorder) of interest should be studied separately by hemisphere rather than in a joint analysis.",

    "abstract": "In many situations it is behaviorally relevant for an animal to respond to co-occurrences of perceptual, possibly polymodal features, while these features alone may have no importance. Thus, it is crucial for animals to learn such feature combinations in spite of the fact that they may occur with variable intensity and occurrence frequency. Here, we present a novel unsupervised learning mechanism that is largely independent of these contingencies and allows neurons in a network to achieve specificity for different feature combinations. This is achieved by a novel correlation-based (Hebbian) learning rule which allows for linear weight growth and which is combined with a mechanism for gradually reducing the learning rate as soon as the neurons response becomes feature combination specific. In a set of control experiments, we show that other existing advanced learning rules cannot satisfactorily form such multi-feature representations. In addition, we show that networks, which use this type of learning always stabilize and converge to subsets of neurons with different feature-combination specificity. Neurons with this property may, thus, serve as an initial stage for the processing of ecologically relevant real world situations for an animal.",

    "abstract": "An animals perceived sense of orientation depends upon the head direction (HD) system found in several limbic structures and depends upon an intact peripheral vestibular labyrinth. However, how the vestibular system influences the generation, maintenance, and updating of the HD signal remains poorly understood. Anatomical and lesion studies point towards three key brainstem nuclei as being potential critical components in generating the HD signal: nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH), supragenual nucleus (SGN), and dorsal paragigantocellularis reticular nuclei (PGRNd). Collectively, these nuclei are situated between the vestibular nuclei and the dorsal tegmental and lateral mammillary nuclei, which are thought to serve as the origin of the HD signal. To test this hypothesis, extracellular recordings were made in these areas while rats either freely foraged in a cylindrical environment or were restrained and rotated passively. During foraging, a large subset of cells in all three nuclei exhibited activity that correlated with changes in the rats angular head velocity (AHV). Two fundamental types of AHV cells were observed: 1) symmetrical AHV cells increased or decreased their neural firing with increases in AHV regardless of the direction of rotation; 2) asymmetrical AHV cells responded differentially to clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) head rotations. When rats were passively rotated, some AHV cells remained sensitive to AHV whereas others had attenuated firing. In addition, a large number of AHV cells were modulated by linear head velocity. These results indicate the types of information conveyed in the ascending vestibular pathways that are responsible for generating the HD signal.\n\nSignificance StatementExtracellular recording of brainstem nuclei (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, supragenual nucleus, and dorsal paragigantocellularis reticular nucleus) that project to the head direction circuit identified different types of angular head velocity (AHV) cells while rats freely foraged in a cylindrical environment. The firing of many cells was also modulated by linear velocity. When rats were restrained and passively rotated some cells remained sensitive to AHV, whereas others had attenuated firing. These brainstem nuclei provide critical information about the rotational movement of the rats head in the azimuthal plane.",

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that neurodegeneration initiated by axonal insults depends in part on the stress-responsive kinase Perk (Larhammar et al., 2017). Here we show that Perk acts primarily through Activating Transcription Factor-4 (Atf4) to stimulate not only pro-apoptotic but also pro-regenerative responses following optic nerve injury. Using conditional knockout mice, we find an extensive Perk/Atf4-dependent transcriptional response that includes canonical Atf4 target genes and modest contributions by C/ebp homologous protein (Chop). Overlap with c-Jun-dependent transcription suggests interplay with a parallel stress pathway that couples regenerative and apoptotic responses. Accordingly, neuronal knockout of Atf4 recapitulates the neuroprotection afforded by Perk deficiency, and Perk or Atf4 knockout impairs optic axon regeneration enabled by disrupting the tumor suppressor Pten. These findings contrast with the transcriptional and functional consequences reported for CRISPR targeting of Atf4 or Chop and reveal an integral role for Perk/Atf4 in coordinating neurodegenerative and regenerative responses to CNS axon injury.",

    "abstract": "Continued drug-taking despite adverse consequences is hypothesized to be an insidious behavioral hallmark of drug addiction. Although most preclinical research has focused on drug self-administration in the presence of positive punishment, another source of potential adverse consequences is behavioral allocation away from negative reinforcers (i.e., escape/avoid electric shock) and towards drug reinforcers. The goals of the present study were to establish a discrete-trial cocaine-vs-negative reinforcer choice procedure in male and female rats and determine sensitivity of choice behavior to environmental and pharmacological manipulations. Rats could make up to nine discrete choices between an intravenous cocaine infusion (0.32 - 1.8 mg/kg/inf) under a fixed-ratio (FR) 3 schedule and a negative reinforcer (escape or avoidance of electric shock, 0.1 - 0.7 mA) under an FR1 schedule. The negative reinforcer was consistently chosen over all cocaine doses. Lowering shock magnitude decreased negative reinforcer trials, increased omitted trials, and failed to promote behavioral reallocation towards cocaine. Increasing the negative reinforcement response requirement between sessions only increased omitted trials. Introduction of 12-hr extended access cocaine self-administration sessions across two weeks resulted in high daily cocaine intakes but failed to significantly increase cocaine choice. Acute diazepam pretreatment also did not impact choice behavior up to doses that produced behavioral depression. Overall, the lack of behavioral allocation between cocaine infusions and a negative reinforcer suggests these two reinforcers may be economic independents. Additionally, the failure of extended cocaine access to increase cocaine choice highlights the importance of alternative reinforcers and environmental context in preclinical models of drug addiction.",

Neural tracking can be measured by relating the electroencephalography (EEG) and the speech signal. Recent studies have shown a significant contribution of linguistic features over acoustic neural tracking using linear models. However, linear models cannot model the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. To overcome this, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that relates EEG to linguistic features using phoneme or word onsets as a control and has the capacity to model non-linear relations.\n\nApproachWe integrate phoneme- and word-based linguistic features (phoneme surprisal, cohort entropy, word surprisal and word frequency) in our nonlinear CNN model and investigate if they carry additional information on top of lexical features (phoneme and word onsets). We then compare the performance of our nonlinear CNN with that of a linear encoder and a linearized CNN.\n\nMain resultsFor the non-linear CNN, we found a significant contribution of cohort entropy over phoneme onsets and of word surprisal and word frequency over word onsets. Moreover, the non-linear CNN outperformed the linear baselines.\n\nSignificanceMeasuring coding of linguistic features in the brain is important for auditory neuroscience research and applications that involve objectively measuring speech understanding. With linear models, this is measurable, but the effects are very small. The proposed non-linear CNN model yields larger differences between linguistic and lexical models and, therefore, could show effects that would otherwise be unmeasurable and may, in the future, lead to improved within-subject measures and shorter recordings.\n\nIndex TermsEEG decoding, speech processing, CNN, linguistics.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical nuclei and other deep brain structures play essential roles in regulating the central and peripheral nervous systems. However, many of these nuclei and their subregions are challenging to identify and delineate in conventional MRI due to their small size, hidden location, and often subtle contrasts compared to neighboring regions. To address these limitations, we scanned the whole brain of the marmoset monkeys in ex vivo using a clinically feasible diffusion MRI method, called the mean apparent propagator (MAP)-MRI, along with T2W and MTR (T1-like contrast) images acquired at 7 Tesla. Additionally, we registered these multimodal MRI volumes to the high-resolution images of matched whole-brain histology sections with seven different stains obtained from the same brain specimens. At high spatial resolution, the microstructural parameters and fiber orientation distribution functions derived with MAP-MRI can distinguish the subregions of many subcortical and deep brain structures, including fiber tracts of different sizes and orientations. The good correlation with multiple but distinct histological stains from the same brain serves as a thorough validation of the structures identified with MAP-MRI and other MRI parameters. Moreover, the anatomical details of deep brain structures found in the volumes of MAP-MRI parameters are not visible in conventional T1W or T2W images. The high-resolution mapping using novel MRI contrasts, combined and correlated with histology, can elucidate structures that were previously invisible radiologically. Thus, this multimodal approach offers a roadmap toward identifying salient brain areas in vivo in future neuroradiological studies. It also provides a useful anatomical standard reference for the region definition of subcortical targets and the generation of a 3D digital template atlas for the marmoset brain research (Saleem et al., 2023). Additionally, we conducted a cross-species comparison between marmoset and macaque monkeys using results from our previous studies (Saleem et al., 2021). We found that the two species had distinct patterns of iron distribution in subregions of the basal ganglia, red nucleus, and deep cerebellar nuclei, confirmed with T2W MRI and histology.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology features autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation, demyelination, and failed remyelination. Carnosine is a histidine-containing dipeptide (HCD) with pluripotent homeostatic properties that is able to improve outcomes in an animal MS model (EAE) when supplied exogenously. To uncover if endogenous carnosine is involved in, and protects against, MS-related neuroinflammation, demyelination or remyelination failure, we here studied the HCD-synthesizing enzyme carnosine synthase (CARNS1) in human MS lesions and two preclinical mouse MS models (EAE, cuprizone). We demonstrate that due to its presence in oligodendrocytes, CARNS1 expression is diminished in demyelinated MS lesions and mouse models mimicking demyelination/inflammation, but returns upon remyelination. Carns1-KO mice that are devoid of endogenous HCDs display exaggerated neuroinflammation and clinical symptoms during EAE, which could be partially rescued by exogenous carnosine treatment. Worsening of the disease appears to be driven by a central, not peripheral immune-modulatory, mechanism possibly linked to impaired clearance of the reactive carbonyl acrolein in Carns1-KO mice. In contrast, the presence of CARNS1 and endogenous HCDs does not protect against cuprizone-induced demyelination, and is not required for normal oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and (re)myelin to occur. Exogenously administered carnosine is not effective in blunting demyelination or accelerating remyelination. In conclusion, we show that CARNS1 is diminished in demyelinated MS lesions, which may have detrimental effects on disease progression through weakening the endogenous protection against neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe rumen of neonatal calves is underdeveloped and exhibits limited functionality during early life. Thus, the acquisition and colonization of microbes in the gut are key to establishing a healthy host-microbiome symbiosis for neonatal calves. Microbiome-linked health outcomes appear to be the consequences of individual strains of specific microbes. However, the temporal colonization of pioneering microbial strains and their linkages to the health and growth of neonatal calves are poorly understood.\n\nResultsTo address this, we longitudinally profiled the gut microbiome of 36 neonatal calves from birth up to 2 months postpartum and carried out microbial transplantation (MT) to reshape their gut microbiome. Genomic reconstruction of deeply sequenced fecal samples resulted in a total of 3,931 metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs), of which 397 were identified as new species when compared with existing databases of Bos taurus. Single nucleotide level metagenomic profiling shows a rapid influx of microbes after birth, followed by strong selection during the first few weeks of life. MT was found to reshape the genetic makeup of 33 MAGs (FDR<0.05), mainly from Prevotella and Bacteroides species. We further linked over 20 million microbial single nucleotide variations (SNVs) to 736 plasma metabolites, which enabled us to characterize 24 study-wide significant associations (P < 4.4x10-9) that identify the potential microbial genetic regulation of host immune and neuro-related metabolites, including glutathione and L-dopa. Our integration analyses further revealed that microbial genetic variations may influence the health status and growth performance of neonatal calves by modulating metabolites via structural regulation of their encoded proteins. For instance, we found that the albumin levels and total antioxidant capacity in neonatal calves were correlated with L-dopa, which was determined by SNVs via structural regulations of metabolic enzymes.\n\nConclusionsThe current results indicate that the temporal colonization of microbial strains and MT-induced strain replacement are integral in the development of the gut microbiome of neonatal calves and may help to develop strategies that can improve the health status and growth performance of neonatal calves.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAblynx NV, a subsidiary of Sanofi, has a long-standing focus on the development of Nanobody(R) molecules as biopharmaceuticals (Nanobody(R) is a registered trademark of Ablynx NV). Nanobody molecules are single variable domains, and they have been met with great success part due to their favorable expression properties in several microbial systems. Nevertheless, the search for the host of the future is an ongoing and challenging process. Komagataella phaffi (Pichia pastoris) is one of the most suitable organisms to produce Nanobody molecules. In addition, genetic engineering of Pichia is easy and an effective approach to improve titers.\n\nResultsHere we report that P. pastoris engineered to co-express genes encoding four auxiliary proteins (HAC1, KAR2, PDI and RPP0), leads to a marked improvement in the expression of Nanobody molecules using the AOX1 methanol induction system. Titer improvement is mainly attributed to HAC1, and its beneficial effect was also observed in a methanol-free expression system.\n\nConclusionOur findings are based on over a thousand fed-batch fermentations and offer a valuable guide to produce Nanobody molecules in P. pastoris. The presented differences in expressability between types of Nanobody molecules will be helpful for researchers to select both the type of Nanobody molecule and Pichia strain and may stimulate further the development of a more ecological methanol-free expression platform.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium ovale curtisi (Poc) and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri (Pow) represent distinct non-recombining malaria species that are increasing in prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. Though they circulate sympatrically, co-infection within human and mosquito hosts has rarely been described. Separate 18S rRNA real-time PCR assays that detect Poc and Pow were modified to allow species determination in parallel under identical cycling conditions. The lower limit of detection was 0.6 plasmid copies/L (95% CI 0.4-1.6) for Poc and 4.5 plasmid copies/L (95% CI 2.7-18) for Pow, or 0.1 and 0.8 parasites/L, respectively, assuming 6 copies of 18s rRNA per genome. However, the assays showed cross-reactivity at concentrations greater than 103 plasmid copies/L (roughly 200 parasites/L). Mock mixtures were used to establish criteria for classifying mixed Poc/Pow infections that prevented false-positive detection while maintaining sensitive detection of the minority ovale species down to 100 copies/L (<1 parasite/L). When the modified real-time PCR assays were applied to field-collected blood samples from Tanzania and Cameroon, species identification by real-time PCR was concordant with nested PCR, but additionally detected two mixed Poc/Pow infections where nested PCR detected a single Po species. When real-time PCR was applied to 14 oocyst-positive Anopheles midguts saved from mosquitoes fed on P. ovale-infected persons, mixed Poc/Pow infections were detected in 11 (79%). Based on these results, 8/9 P. ovale carriers transmitted both P. ovale species to mosquitoes, though both Po species could only be detected in the blood of two carriers. The described real-time PCR approach can be used to identify the natural occurrence of mixed Poc/Pow infections in human and mosquito hosts and reveals that such co-infections and co-transmission are likely more common than appreciated.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPlasmodium ovale, one of five species of malaria known to infect humans, in fact represents two distinct species, P. ovale curtisi (Poc) and wallikeri (Pow), that can only be distinguished using molecular diagnostics. Though Poc and Pow circulate in the same regions in Africa and Asia, mixed infections, where both are found in the same human host, have rarely been described. In this study, we modified existing real-time PCR assays targeting 18S rRNA and developed an algorithm to detect mixed Poc/Pow infections. We then applied these assays to field-collected samples from Tanzania and Cameroon, including blood samples from P. ovale-infected persons and P. ovale-positive mosquito midguts saved from mosquito feeding assays. We detected both Poc and Pow in roughly 10% of human P. ovale blood-stage infections, and surprisingly, in a majority of blood-fed mosquitoes. This suggests that Poc and Pow co-infect the same hosts more frequently than previously realized.",

    "abstract": "Insects release methane as a result of their symbiosis with methanogenic microorganisms. This phenomenon has been well studied in termites but is still poorly known in other insects, among which the most likely methane producers are wood-feeders. We applied two methodological approaches to examine whether the wood-feeding larvae of Stictoleptura rubra (Cerambycidae, Coleoptera) release methane. By means of the precise gas chromatography we detected a methane release at the rate of 0.02-0.05 nmol/gxhr. We also investigated the gut Archaea assemblage by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and T-RFLP analysis. Halophilic archaea but no known methanogens were detected. Combined with our chromatographic studies showing small but significant amount of methane release, one possible explanation is that the detected archaeons are methanogenic although this is unlikely. Our results offer the first evidence of methane release by a longhorn (cerambycid) beetle, which may be the small amounts of methane all organisms produce abiotically but the actual mechanism of this consistent methanogenesis remains intriguingly unknown.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThe research presented here goes beyond the long-established tracks on the symbiotic basis of insect methanogenesis and shows that there are areas still scarcely covered so far, with great exploratory potential.",

Such individual differences in environmental sensitivity are associated with mechanisms of stress-related psychiatric symptoms. In recent years, researchers have focused on bidirectional interactions in the brain-gut-microbiota axis as a neurophysiological pathway contributing to the mechanisms of stress-related psychiatric symptoms, and evidence is rapidly accumulating.\n\nMethodsData on environmental sensitivity, gut microbiota, gut permeability (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; LBP) and inflammation (C-reactive protein; CRP) were collected from 90 adults (50% female; Mage = 42.1; SDage = 10.0). Environmental sensitivity was measured using a self-report questionnaire. Study participants feces were analyzed, and observed operational taxonomic units for richness, Shannons index for evenness, and phylogenetic diversity for biodiversity were evaluated as indicators of gut microbiota. In addition, participants serum was analyzed for CRP and LBP. We investigated whether the interaction between environmental sensitivity and gut microbiota is associated with biomarkers of inflammation and gut permeability.\n\nResultsThe interaction between environmental sensitivity and gut microbiota (excluding the Shannons index) explained the levels of these biomarkers. Individuals with high environmental sensitivity displayed higher levels of CRP and LBP, when the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota was low. However, even highly susceptible individuals had lower levels of CRP and LBP, when the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota was high.\n\nConclusionsOur study indicates that high environmental sensitivity can be a risk factor for inflammation and gut permeability, when the gut microbiota diversity is low, suggesting a brain-gut-microbiota axis interaction.",

    "abstract": "Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is the key protein driving the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). It is a switch-like protein held in a closed and inactive state by intramolecular electrostatic interactions competitively opened by RNA, activating the protein and initiating its LLPS. Here we show that C9orf72-derived arginine-rich dipeptide repeats PR30 and GR30 (R-DPRs) present in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), also bind to G3BP1, switching it to an LLPS-competent open state much more effectively than RNA. Whereas RNA binds G3BP1 with micromolar affinity, and cannot initiate LLPS without crowding agents, R-DPRs exhibit a thousand-fold stronger binding to G3BP1, eliciting rapid LLPS even without crowding. The pathogenic effect of R-DPRs is also underscored by the slow transition of R-DPR-G3BP1 liquid droplets to aggregated, ThS-positive states that can recruit the ALS-linked protein hnRNPA2. Deletion constructs and molecular simulations show that R-DPR binding and LLPS are mediated via binding through the negatively charged intrinsically disordered region 1 (IDR1) of the protein, allosterically regulated by the positively charged IDR3. Bioinformatic analyses point to the strong mechanistic parallels of these effects with the interaction of R-DPRs with nuclear nucleophosmin (NPM1) and also suggest that R-DPRs also interact with many other similar nucleolar and stress-granule proteins, extending the underlying mechanism of R-DPR toxicity in cells.",

Our biochemical and structural studies reported here, demonstrate that the helicase activator GINS interacts with TopBP1 through two separate binding surfaces, the first involving a stretch of highly conserved amino acids in the TopBP1-GINI region, the second a surface located on TopBP1-BRCT4. The two surfaces bind to opposite ends of the A domain of the GINS subunit Psf1, and their cooperation is required for a biochemically stable TopBP1-GINS interaction. The GINI and BRCT4 domains also cooperate during replication origin firing, as revealed by immuno-replacement experiments in Xenopus egg extracts using different sets of mutations in either interface. Furthermore, the TopBP1-GINS interaction is incompatible with simultaneous binding of DNA polymerase epsilon to GINS when bound to Mcm2-7-Cdc45. Our TopBP1-GINS model predicts the coordination of three molecular processes, DNA polymerase epsilon arrival, TopBP1 ejection and GINS integration into Mcm2-7-Cdc45.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing hypothesis sees DNA replication control in E. coli as a central cell cycle oscillator at whose core is the DnaA protein. The consensus is that the activity of the DnaA protein, which is dependent on its nucleotide bound state, is an effector of initiation of DNA replication and a sensor of cell size. However, while several processes are known to regulate the change in DnaA activity, the oscillations in DnaA production and DnaA activity have never been observed at the single cell level, and their correlation with cell volume has yet to be established. Here, we measured the volume-specific production rate of a reporter protein under control of the dnaAP2 promoter in single cells. By a careful dissection of the effects of DnaA-ATP- and SeqA-dependent regulation of dnaAP2 promoter activity two distinct cell-cycle oscillators emerge. The first one, driven by both DnaA activity and SeqA repression, is strongly coupled to cell cycle and cell size, and its minima show the same \"adder\" behaviour as initiation events. The second, a reporter of DnaA activity, is still coupled with cell size but not to the time of cell division and its minima show a \"sizer-like\" behavior. These findings suggest that while DnaA activity and gene dosage perform volume sensing, SeqA repression primes the DnaA oscillator to follow extrinsic cues from cell cycle progression.",

    "abstract": "Diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in wild birds, including dangerous strains that infect poultry and humans. Consequently, surveillance of IAVs in wild birds is a cornerstone of outbreak prevention and pandemic preparedness. Surveillance is traditionally done by testing birds, but dangerous IAVs are rarely detected before outbreaks begin. Testing environmental specimens from wild bird habitats has been proposed as an alternative. These specimens are thought to contain diverse IAVs deposited by broad range of avian hosts, including species that are not typically sampled by surveillance programs. We developed a targeted genomic sequencing method for recovering IAV genome fragments from these challenging environmental specimens, including purpose-built bioinformatic analysis tools for counting, subtyping, and characterizing each distinct fragment recovered. We demonstrated our method on 90 sediment specimens from wetlands around Vancouver, Canada. We recovered 2,312 IAV genome fragments originating from all 8 IAV genome segments. 11 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 neuraminidase subtypes were detected, including H5, the current global surveillance priority. Recovered fragments originated predominantly from IAV lineages that circulate in North American resident wild birds. Our results demonstrate that targeted genomic sequencing of environmental specimens from wild bird habitats can be a valuable complement to avian influenza surveillance programs.",

Therefore, the establishment of intestinal microbiota may play an instrumental role in their health and performance, but it has been rarely explored. Thus, we aim to explore the temporal colonization of the gut microbiome and the potential benefits of early microbial intervention in newborn calves. We followed up on the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome and plasma metabolome in 36 newborn calves during the first two months of life and established their relationships with their health status and performance. We also evaluated whether microbiota transplantation (MT) could influence their phenotypes by modulating metabolism and its impact on later milk production performance.We showed that the composition and ecological interactions of the gut microbiome are likely to reach maturity one month after birth. Temporal changes in the gut microbiome of newborn calves are widely associated with changes in their physiological statuses, such as growth and fiber digestion. Importantly, we observed that MT reshapes the gut microbiome of newborns by altering the abundance and interaction of Bacteroides species, as well as amino acid pathways, such as arginine biosynthesis. Two-year follow-up of those calves further showed that MT improves their later milk production. Notably, MT improves fiber digestion, antioxidant capacity of newborns while reducing diarrhea. MT also contributes to significant changes in the metabolomic landscape, and with putative causal mediation analysis, we suggest that altered gut microbial composition in newborns may influence physiological status through microbial-derived metabolites. The data from the study may help develop strategies to manipulate the gut microbiota during early life, which may be significantly relevant to the health and production of newborn calves.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe gut microbial composition and ecological interaction in newborn calves reach maturity one month after birth\nC_LIO_LITemporal shifts in the gut microbiome of newborn calves are associated with phenotypic changes, including growth, digestion, and antioxidative capacity\nC_LIO_LIEarly microbial intervention in newborn calves reduces diarrhea while improving later milk production\nC_LIO_LIThe gut microbial impact on newborn calves is mediated by plasma metabolites\nC_LI",

In this study, we explored the presence of microbiota in mosquito saliva and their potential effect on mosquito-borne virus infection in vitro. Culturable fungal and bacterial colonies were isolated and identified from saliva harvested from Aedes aegypti (lab strain) and Culex pipiens (field-collected mosquitoes). For the first time, the fungal species Penicillium crustosum was identified in mosquitoes. Culturable bacteria detected in mosquito saliva included Serratia marcescens, Serratia nematodiphila, Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp., which were previously identified as mosquito or insect endosymbionts in the midgut or other organs. Oral treatment of adult mosquitoes with antibiotics or an antifungal drug resulted in a significant reduction of bacteria or fungi in saliva. Saliva depleted from fungi or bacteria significantly decreased Semliki Forest virus infection in human skin fibroblasts compared to non-treated saliva when the virus was preincubated with saliva or when virus and saliva were added to the cells at the same time. These results suggest that the salivary microbiota may play an essential role in mosquito-borne viral replication in human skin cells. Nevertheless, the potential effect of salivary microbiota warrants further investigation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian DNA replication timing (RT) program is crucial for the proper functioning and integrity of the genome. The best-known mechanism for controlling RT is the suppression of late origins of replication in heterochromatin by RIF1. Here, we report that in antigen-activated B lymphocytes, RIF1 binds predominantly to early-replicating active chromatin, regulates early origin firing and promotes early replication. RIF1 has a minor role in gene expression and genome organization in B cells. Furthermore, we find that RIF1 functions in a complementary and non-epistatic manner with minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins to establish early RT signatures genome-wide and, specifically, to ensure the early replication of highly transcribed genes. These findings reveal new layers of regulation within the B cell RT program, driven by the coordinated activity of RIF1 and MCM proteins.",

    "abstract": "The RNase III enzyme Drosha has a central role in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, where it is required to release the stem-loop intermediate from primary (pri)-miRNA transcripts. However, it can also cleave stem-loops embedded within messenger (m)RNAs. This destabilizes the mRNA causing target gene repression and appears to occur primarily in stem cells. While pri-miRNA stem-loops have been extensively studied, such non-canonical substrates of Drosha have yet to characterized in detail. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing to capture all polyA-tailed RNAs that are cleaved by Drosha in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and compared the features of non-canonical versus miRNA stem-loop substrates. First, mRNA substrates are less efficiently processed than miRNA stem-loops. Sequence and structural analyses revealed that these mRNA substrates are also less stable and more likely to fold into alternative structures than miRNA stem-loops. Moreover, they lack the sequence and structural motifs found in miRNAs stem-loops that are required for precise cleavage. Notably, we discovered a non-canonical Drosha substrate that is cleaved in an inverse manner, which is a process that is normally inhibited by features in miRNA stem-loops. Our study thus provides valuable insights into the recognition of non-canonical targets by Drosha.",

    "abstract": "Although emerging evidence indicates that alterations in proteins within nuclear compartments elicit changes in chromosomal architecture and differentiation, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we investigate the direct role of the abundant nuclear complex protein Matrin3 (Matr3) in chromatin architecture and development in the context of myogenesis. Using an acute targeted protein degradation platform (dTAG-Matr3), we reveal the dynamics of development-related chromatin reorganization. Upon acute depletion of Matr3, gains in chromatin accessibility and MyoD binding were observed, prior to widespread loss in the steady-state Matr3-knockout. These initial changes correlated with gene expression changes later in development. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments revealed substantial chromatin loop rearrangements soon after Matr3 depletion. Notably, YY1 binding was detected in close proximity to enhancer and promoter regions, accompanied by the emergence of novel YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter loops, which occurred concurrently with changes in histone modifications and chromatin-level binding patterns. Overall, our results suggest that Matr3 mediates differentiation through stabilizing chromatin accessibility and chromatin loop-domain interactions, and highlight a conserved and direct role for Matr3 in maintenance of chromosomal architecture.",

Away from the NPC, FG-Nups readily form condensates and aggregates, and we address how this behavior is surveilled in cells. FG-Nups, including Nsp1, together with nuclear transport receptor Kap95, form a native cytosolic condensate in yeast. In aged cells this condensate disappears as cytosolic Nsp1 levels decline. Biochemical assays and modeling show that Nsp1 is a modulator of FG-Nup liquid-liquid phase separation, promoting a liquid-like state. Nsp1s presence in the cytosol and condensates is critical, as a reduction of cytosolic levels in young cells induces NPC assembly and transport defects and a general decline in protein quality control, all quantitatively mimicking aging phenotypes. Excitingly, these phenotypes can be rescued by cytosolic Nsp1. We conclude that Nsp1 is a phase state regulator that surveils FG-Nups and impacts general protein homeostasis.\n\nHighlightsO_LINups form native cytosolic condensates\nC_LIO_LINsp1 reduction mimics NPC aging phenotypes\nC_LIO_LINsp1 acts as phase state modulator of FG-Nups\nC_LIO_LINsp1 shares surveillance function with classical chaperones\nC_LI",

In this study, we tested the inhibitory effects of six pyrimidine analogs (5-fluorouracil, floxuridine, 5-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, 5-fluorouridine, gemcitabine, cytarabine) on wild-type CU428 and conditional mutant NP1 Tetrahymena thermophila at room temperature and the restrictive temperature (37{degrees}C) where NP1 does not form the oral apparatus. We found that cytarabine was the only tested analog that did not inhibit growth, and phagocytosis was not required for pyrimidine analog entry. IC50 values did not significantly differ between strains for the same analog at either temperature. To investigate the mechanism of inhibition, we used two pyrimidine bases (uracil and thymine) and three nucleosides (uridine, thymidine, 5-methyluridine) to help determine whether the inhibitory effects from analogs were reversible. We found that the inhibitory effects from 5-fluorouracil could be reversed by uracil and thymine, from floxuridine could be reversed by thymidine, and from 5-deoxy-5-fluorouridine could be reversed by uracil. None of the tested nucleobases or nucleosides could reverse the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine or 5-fluorouridine. Our results suggest that the five pyrimidine analogs act on different sites to inhibit T. thermophila growth and that nucleobases and nucleosides are metabolized differently.",

Methods aimed at predicting from point estimates exist, but often even fail to recover the true parameters from simulated data. Computational methods to robustly infer and quantify the uncertainty in model parameters are needed. Here, we propose a computational workflow addressing such challenges - allowing us to compare mechanistic models and identify the values and the certainty of inferred parameters. This approach allows us to infer which kind of interactions occur in the microbial community. In contrast to point-estimate inference, the distribution for the parameters, our outcome, reflects their uncertainty. To achieve this, we consider as many equations for the statistical moments of the microbiome as parameters. Our inference workflow, which builds upon a mechanistic foundation of microscopic processes, can take into account that commonly metagenomic datasets only provide information on relative abundances and hosts ensembles. With our framework, we move from qualitative prediction to quantifying the likelihood of certain interaction types in microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Histone acetylation is important for the activation of gene transcription but little is known about its direct  read/write mechanisms. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures in which a p300/CBP multidomain monomer recognizes histone H4 N-terminal tail (NT) acetylation (ac) in a nucleosome and acetylates non-H4 histone NTs within the same nucleosome. p300/CBP not only recognized H4NTac via the bromodomain pocket responsible for  reading, but also interacted with the DNA minor grooves via the outside of that pocket. This directed the catalytic center of p300/CBP to one of the non-H4 histone NTs. The primary target that p300  writes by  reading H4NTac was H2BNT, and H2BNTac promoted H2A-H2B dissociation from the nucleosome. We propose a model in which p300/CBP  replicates histone NT acetylation within the H3-H4 tetramer to inherit epigenetic storage, and  transcribes it from the H3-H4 tetramer to the H2B-H2A dimers to activate context-dependent gene transcription through local nucleosome destabilization.",

    "abstract": "Contact probabilities between loci, separated by arbitrary genomic distance, for a number of cell types have been reported using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments. How to extract the effective interaction energies between active euchromatin (A) and inactive het-erochromatin (B) directly from the experimental data, without an underlying polymer model, is unsolved. Here, we first calculate the pairwise effective interaction energies (A-A, B-B, or A-B) for interphase chromosomes based on Hi-C data by using the concept of Statistical Potential (SP), which assumes that the interaction energy between two loci is proportional to the logarithm of the frequency with which they interact. Polymer simulations, using the extracted interaction energy values without any parameters, reproduce the segregation between A and B type loci (compartments), and the emergence of topologically associating domains (TADs), features that are prominent in the Hi-C data for interphase chromosomes. Remarkably, the values of the SP automatically satisfy the Flory-Huggins phase separation criterion for all the chromosomes, which explains the mechanism of compartment formation in interphase chromosomes. Strikingly, simulations using the SP that accounts for pericentromeric constitutive heterochromatin (C-type), show hierarchical structuring with the high density of C-type loci in the nuclear center, followed by localization of the B type loci, with euchromatin being confined to the nuclear periphery, which differs from the expected nuclear organization of interphase chromosomes, but is in accord with imaging data. Such an unusual organization of chromosomes is found in inverted nuclei of photoreceptor rods in nocturnal mammals. The proposed method without free parameters and its applications show that compartment formation in conventional and inverted nuclei is best explained by the inequality between the effective interaction energies, with heterochromatin attraction being the dominant driving force.",

    "abstract": "Social play is a highly rewarding behavior that is essential for the development of social skills. Social play is impaired in children diagnosed with autism, a disorder with a strong sex bias in prevalence. We recently showed that the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system in the lateral septum (LS) regulates social play behavior sex-specifically in juvenile rats: Administration of a AVP 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist increased social play behavior in males and decreased it in females. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate, but not GABA, is involved in the sex-specific regulation of social play by the LS-AVP system. First, males show higher extracellular glutamate concentrations in the LS than females while they show similar extracellular GABA concentrations. This resulted in a baseline sex difference in excitatory/inhibitory balance, which was eliminated by V1aR antagonist administration into the LS: V1aR antagonist increased extracellular glutamate release in females but not in males. Second, administration of the glutamate receptor agonist L-glutamic acid into the LS prevented the V1aR antagonist-induced increase in social play behavior in males while mimicking the V1aR antagonist-induced decrease in social play behavior in females. Third, administration of the glutamate receptor antagonists AP-5 and CNQX into the LS prevented the V1aR antagonist-induced decrease in social play behavior in females. Last, both sexes showed increases in extracellular LS-GABA release upon V1aR antagonist administration into the LS and decreases in social play behavior upon administration of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol into the LS, suggesting that GABA is not involved in the sex-specific regulation of social play by the LS-AVP system. Finally, to start identifying the cellular mechanism mediating the sex-specific effects of the LS-AVP system on LS-glutamate, we determined the presence of potential sex differences in the type of LS cells expressing V1aR. However, no sex differences were found in the percentage of Avpr1a+ LS cells expressing markers for either GABAergic neurons, somatostatin-expressing neurons, calbindin 1-expressing neurons, or astrocytes. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the LS-AVP system regulates social play sex-specifically via differential local glutamatergic neurotransmission in male and female juvenile rats. Further research is required to uncover the underlying cellular mechanism.",

    "abstract": "How do we learn associations in the world (e.g., between cues and rewards)? Cue-reward associative learning is controlled in the brain by mesolimbic dopamine1-4. It is widely believed that dopamine drives such learning by conveying a reward prediction error (RPE) in accordance with temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) algorithms5. TDRL implementations are \"trial-based\": learning progresses sequentially across individual cue-outcome experiences. Accordingly, a foundational assumption--often considered a mere truism--is that the more cuereward pairings one experiences, the more one learns this association. Here, we disprove this assumption, thereby falsifying a foundational principle of trial-based learning algorithms. Specifically, when a group of head-fixed mice received ten times fewer experiences over the same total time as another, a single experience produced as much learning as ten experiences in the other group. This quantitative scaling also holds for mesolimbic dopaminergic learning, with the increase in learning rate being so high that the group with fewer experiences exhibits dopaminergic learning in as few as four cue-reward experiences and behavioral learning in nine. An algorithm implementing reward-triggered retrospective learning explains these findings. The temporal scaling and few-shot learning observed here fundamentally changes our understanding of the neural algorithms of associative learning.",

The frequency of these filaments increased upon inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) with the small-molecule drug thapsigargin. Subtomogram averaging showed that the luminal filaments adopt a helical structure reminiscent of cofilin-bound actin (cofilactin). Consistent with this, cofilin was activated in cells under the same conditions that increased luminal filament occurrence. Furthermore, RNAi knock-down of cofilin reduced the frequency of luminal filaments with cofilactin morphology.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer type and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents most of the lung cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) is a member of the VEGF family of receptor tyrosine kinase proteins, expressed on both endothelial and tumor cells which is one of the key proteins contributing to cancer development and involved in drug resistance. We previously showed that Musashi-2 (MSI2) RNA-binding protein is associated with NSCLC progression by regulating several signaling pathways relevant to NSCLC. In this study, we performed Reverse Protein Phase Array (RPPA) analysis of murine lung cancer which nominated VEGFR2 protein as strongly positively regulated by MSI2. Next, we validated VEGFR2 protein regulation by MSI2 in several human NSCLC cell line models. Additionally, we found that MSI2 affected AKT signaling via negative PTEN mRNA translation regulation. In silico prediction analysis suggested that both VEGFR2 and PTEN mRNAs have predicted binding sites for MSI2. We next performed RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative PCR which confirmed that MSI2 directly binds to VEGFR2 and PTEN mRNAs, suggesting direct regulation mechanism. Finally, MSI2 expression positively correlated with VEGFR2 and VEGF-A protein levels in human NSCLC samples. We conclude that MSI2/VEGFR2 axis contributes to NSCLC progression and is worth further investigations and therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignancy linked to asbestos exposure and highly resistant to chemotherapy, potentially due to upregulated expression of the pro-survival proteins, BCL2/BCL-XL/MCL-1. Using clinically-relevant models of MPM we show that patient-derived primary MPM cell lines and ex-vivo 3D tumour explants are highly resistant to apoptosis induced by the BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor, ABT-737. Importantly, we discover that 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, can sensitize MPM cells to ABT-737 and show this correlates with loss of the pro-survival protein, MCL-1. siRNA knockdown of MCL-1 (MCL-1 KD) combined with ABT-737 induced BAX/BAK-dependent, but BIM/PUMA-independent apoptosis, mimicking 2DG/ABT-737 treatment. MCL-1 KD/ABT-737 induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-independent inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we observed a hitherto unreported caspase-dependent cleavage of glycolytic enzymes and subsequent inhibition of glycolysis. 2DG inhibited ERK/STAT3 activity, decreased MCL-1 mRNA and protein levels, with concurrent activation of AKT, which limited loss of MCL-1 protein. However, co-treatment with a specific AKT inhibitor, AZD5363, and 2DG/ABT-737 potently induced cell death and inhibited clonogenic cell survival, while in MPM 3D tumour explants MCL-1 protein expression decreased significantly following 2DG or 2DG/AZD5363 treatment. Notably, a similar synergy was observed in MPM cell lines and MPM 3D tumour explants using ABT-737 in combination with the recently developed MCL-1 inhibitor, S63845. Importantly, our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the chemoresistance of MPM and highlights how this can be overcome by a combination of metabolic reprogramming and/or simultaneous targeting of MCL-1 and BCL-2/BCL-XL using BH3-mimetics.",

    "abstract": "The nucleolus is a multi-functional nuclear body. To tease out the roles of nucleolar structure without resorting to multi-action drugs, we knocked down RNA polymerase I subunit RPA194 in HeLa cells by siRNA. Loss of RPA194 resulted in nucleolar structural segregation and effects on both nucleolus-proximal and distal nuclear components. The perinucleolar compartment was disrupted, centromere-nucleolus interactions were significantly reduced, and the intranuclear locations of specific genomic loci were altered. Moreover, Cajal bodies, distal from nucleoli, underwent morphological and compositional changes. To distinguish whether these global reorganizations are the results of nucleolar structural disruption or inhibition of ribosome synthesis, the pre-ribosomal RNA processing factor, UTP4, was also knocked down, which did not lead to nucleolar segregation, nor the intranuclear effects seen with RPA195A knockdown, demonstrating that they do not arise from a cessation of ribosome synthesis. These findings point to a commutative system that links nucleolar structure to the maintenance and spatial organization of certain nuclear bodies and genomic loci.",

    "abstract": "Multisystem proteinopathy (MSP) is a rare dominantly-inherited disorder that includes a cluster of diseases, including frontotemporal dementia, inclusion body myopathy, and Pagets disease of bone. MSP is caused by mutations in the gene encoding Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP). Patients with the same mutation, even within the same family, can present with a different combination of any or all of the above diseases, along with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The pleiotropic effects may be linked to the greater than 50 VCP cofactors that direct VCPs many roles in the cell. Small VCP-Interacting Protein (SVIP) is a small protein that directs VCP to autophagosomes and lysosomes. We found that SVIP directs VCP localization to autophagosomes in an acylation-dependent manner. We demonstrate that SVIP is myristoylated at glycine 2 and palmitoylated at cysteines 4 and 7. Acylation of SVIP is required to mediate cell death in the presence of the MSP-associated VCP variant (R155H-VCP), whereas blocking SVIP myristoylation prevents cytotoxicity. Therefore, SVIP acylation may present a novel target in MSP.",

    "abstract": "Human neural organoid models offer an exciting opportunity for studying often inaccessible human-specific brain development; however, it remains unclear how precisely organoids recapitulate fetal/primary tissue biology. Here, we characterize field-wide replicability and biological fidelity through a meta-analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for first and second trimester human primary brain (2.95 million cells, 51 datasets) and neural organoids (1.63 million cells, 130 datasets). We quantify the degree to which primary tissue cell-type marker expression and co-expression are recapitulated in organoids across 12 different protocol types. By quantifying gene-level preservation of primary tissue co-expression, we show neural organoids lie on a spectrum ranging from virtually no signal to co-expression near indistinguishable from primary tissue data, demonstrating high fidelity is within the scope of current methods. Additionally, we show neural organoids preserve the cell-type specific co-expression of developing rather than adult cells, confirming organoids are an appropriate model for primary tissue development. Overall, quantifying the preservation of primary tissue co-expression is a powerful tool for uncovering unifying axes of variation across heterogeneous neural organoid experiments.",

    "abstract": "Myofibroblasts are responsible for scarring and organ stiffness during fibrosis. The scar propagates mechanical signals inducing a radical transformation in myofibroblast cell state linked to an increasingly pro-fibrotic phenotype. Here, we have discovered mechanical stress from progressive scarring induces nuclear softening and de-repression of heterochromatin. The parallel loss of H3K9Me3 enables a permissive state for distinct chromatin accessibility and profibrotic gene regulation. By integrating chromatin accessibility profiles (ATAC sequencing) we provide insight into the transcription network and open chromatin landscape underlying the switch in profibrotic myofibroblast states, emphasizing mechanoadaptive pathways linked to PAK1 as key drivers. Through genetic manipulation in liver and lung fibrosis, uncoupling PAK1-dependant signaling impaired the mechanoadaptive response in vitro and dramatically improved fibrosis in vivo. Moreover, we provide human validation for mechanisms underpinning PAK1 mediated mechanotransduction in liver and lung fibrosis. Collectively, these observations provide new insight into the nuclear mechanics driving the profibrotic chromatin landscape in fibrosis, highlighting actomyosin-dependent mechanisms linked to chromatin organisation as urgently needed therapeutic targets in fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The periderm is basic for land plants due to its protective role during radial growth, which is achieved by the polymers deposited in the cell walls. In most trees, like holm oak, the periderm is frequently replaced by subsequent internal periderms yielding a heterogeneous outer bark made of a mixture of periderms and phloem tissues, known as rhytidome. Exceptionally, cork oak forms a persistent or long-lived periderm which results in a homogeneous outer bark of thick phellem cell layers known as cork. Here we use the outer bark of cork oak, holm oak, and their natural hybrids to analyse the chemical composition, the anatomy and the transcriptome, and further understand the mechanisms underlying periderm development. The inclusion of hybrid samples showing rhytidome-type and cork-type barks is valuable to approach to cork and rhytidome development, allowing an accurate identification of candidate genes and processes. The present study underscores that biotic stress and cell death signalling are enhanced in rhytidome-type barks whereas lipid metabolism and cell cycle are enriched in cork-type barks. Development-related DEGs, showing the highest expression, highlight cell division, cell expansion, and cell differentiation as key processes leading to cork or rhytidome-type barks.",

This network includes multiple GTPases, such as the most studied Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, and their numerous effectors that provide mutual regulation and feedback loops. Here we investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between Rac1 and Cdc42 during membrane ruffling using a simulation model which couples GTPase signaling with cell morphodynamics to capture the GTPase behavior observed with FRET-based biosensors. We show that membrane velocity is regulated by the kinetic rate of GTPase activation rather than the concentration of active GTPase. Our model captures both uniform and polarized ruffling. We also show that cell-type specific time delays between Rac1 and Cdc42 activation can be reproduced with a single signaling motif, in which the delay is controlled by feedback from Cdc42 to Rac1. The resolution of our simulation output matches those of the time-lapsed recordings of cell dynamics and GTPase activity. This approach allows us to validate simulation results with quantitative precision using the same pipeline for the analysis of simulated and experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Organoids are currently one of the most widely used ex vivo models in epithelial biology. Combined with genetic editing strategies, organoids offer a promise of rapid and efficient investigation of gene function in many models of human disease. However, to date, the editing efficiency of organoids with the use of non-viral electroporation methods has been only up to 30%, with implications for the subsequent need for selection including including turnaround time and exhaustion or adaptation of the organoid population. Here, we describe an efficient method of intestinal organoid editing using a Ribonucleoprotein CRISPR-based approach. Editing efficiencies of up to 98% in target genes were robustly achieved across different anatomical gut locations and developmental timepoints from multiple patient samples with no off-target editing. The method allowed us to study the effect of the loss of the tumour suppressor gene, PTEN, in normal human intestinal cells. Analysis of PTEN deficient organoids defined phenotypes that likely relate to its tumour suppressive function in vivo, such as a proliferative advantage and increased organoid budding. Transcriptional profiling revealed differential expression of genes in pathways commonly known to be associated with PTEN loss including mTORC1 activation.",

Proteins such as the Origin Recognition Complex (ORCs) associate with origins, but this does not show clear sequence specificity for DNA binding. Genome-wide origin mapping studies have shown that the region surrounding the replication initiation site contains motifs such as the Origin G-rich Repeated Element (OGRE), proximal to the majority of origins. Here, using an approach coupling DNA affinity purification to quantitative proteomics, we identified proteins that interact specifically with an OGRE. Three of the top-scoring interactors, Dhx36, Pura and Tial1, were selected for further study. We show that Dhx36 and Tial1 localise to the nucleus and their knockdown decreased cells in S-phase resulting in their accumulation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Altogether these results indicate that these OGRE-binding factors may play roles in DNA synthesis in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of DNA mixtures from sexual assault evidence is an ongoing challenge for DNA casework laboratories. There is a significant need for new techniques that can provide information as to the source of DNA, particularly for sexual assault samples that do not involve semen. The goal of this study was to develop a new biological signature system that provides additional probative value to samples comprised of mixtures of epidermal and vaginal cells, as may be observed in cases involving digital penetration. Signatures were based on morphological and autofluorescence properties of individual cells collected through Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC). Comparisons to reference cell populations from vaginal tissue and epidermal cells collected from hands showed strong multivariate differences across >80 cellular measurements. These differences were used to build a predictive framework for classifying unknown cell populations as originating from epithelial cells associated with digital penetration or epidermal tissue. As part of the classification scheme, posterior probabilities of specific tissue group membership were calculated for each cell, along with multivariate similarity to that tissue type. We tested this approach on cell populations from reference tissue as well as mock casework samples involving digital penetration. Many more cells classifying as non-epidermal tissue were detected in digital penetration samples than control hand swabbings. Minimum interpretation thresholds were developed to minimize false positives; these thresholds were also effective when screening licked hands, indicating the potential utility of this method for a variety of biological mixture types and depositional events relevant to forensic casework. Results showed that samples collected subsequent to digital penetration possessed markedly higher numbers of cells classifying as vaginal tissue as well as higher posterior probabilities for vaginal tissue ([&ge;] 0.90) compared to cell populations collected from hands without prior contact with vaginal tissue. Additionally, digital penetration cell populations may be resolved from saliva cell populations and other non-target tissue types.",

    "abstract": "Long-term space flight will lead to bone loss and osteoblasts dysfunction. The underlying mechanism is still far to reveal. Frizzled-9 (Fzd9) is a Wnt receptor which is essential to osteoblasts differentiation and bone formation. Here we investigate whether Fzd9 plays a role in simulated microgravity (SMG) induced osteoblasts dysfunction. After 1-3 days of SMG, the osteogenic markers were decreased which accompanied the decline of Fzd9 expression. Fzd9 also decreased in the femur of the rats after 3 weeks of hindlimb unloading. Overexpression of Fzd9 will counteract SMG-induced osteoblasts dysfunction. However, Fzd9 overexpression did not affect SMG induced pGSK3{beta} and {beta}-catenin expression or sublocalization. Overexpression of Fzd9 regulates the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, as well as induces F-actin polymerization to form the actin cap, presses the nuclei, and increases the nuclear pore size, which promotes nuclear translocation of YAP. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the role of Fzd9 triggers actin polymerization and activates mechano-transducer YAP to rescue SMG-mediated osteoblasts dysfunction and indicates Fzd9 as a potential target to restore osteoblast function in bone diseases and space flight.",
