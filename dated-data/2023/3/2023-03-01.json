    "abstract": "Biological membrane channels mediate information exchange between cells and facilitate molecular recognition1-4. While tuning the shape and function of membrane channels for precision molecular sensing via de-novo routes is complex, an even more significant challenge is interfacing membrane channels with electronic devices for signal readout5-8. This challenge at the biotic-abiotic interface results in low efficiency of information transfer - one of the major barriers to the continued development of high-performance bioelectronic devices9. To this end, we integrate membrane spanning DNA nanopores with bioprotonic contacts to create programmable, modular, and efficient artificial ion-channel interfaces that resolve the  iono-electronic disparity between the biotic environment and electronics. Through simulations and experiments, we show that cholesterol modified DNA nanopores spontaneously and with remarkable affinity span the lipid bilayer formed over the planar bio-protonic electrode surface and mediate proton transport across the bilayer. Using the ability to easily modify DNA nanostructures, we illustrate that this bioelectronic device can be programmed for electronic recognition of biomolecular signals such as presence of Streptavidin, without disrupting the native environment of the biomolecule. We anticipate this robust biotic-abiotic interface will allow facile electronic measurement of inter-cellular ionic communication and also open the door for active control of cell behavior through externally controlled selective gating of the channels.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary and functional studies suggested that the emergence of the Omicron variants can be determined by multiple fitness trade-offs including the immune escape, binding affinity, conformational plasticity, protein stability and allosteric modulation. In this study, we embarked on a systematic comparative analysis of the conformational dynamics, electrostatics, protein stability and allostery in the different functional states of spike trimers for BA.1, BA.2, and BA.2.75 variants. Using efficient and accurate coarse-grained simulations and atomistic reconstruction of the ensembles, we examined conformational dynamics of the spike trimers that agrees with the recent functional studies, suggesting that BA.2.75 trimers are the most stable among these variants. A systematic mutational scanning of the inter-protomer interfaces in the spike trimers revealed a group of conserved structural stability hotspots that play a key role in modulation of functional dynamics and are also involved in the inter-protomer couplings through local contacts and interaction networks with the Omicron mutational sites. The results of mutational scanning provided evidence that BA.2.75 trimers are more stable than BA.2 and comparable in stability to BA.1 variant. Using dynamic network modeling of the S Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.2.75 trimers we showed that the key network positions driving long-range signaling are associated with the major stability hotspots that are inter-connected along potential communication pathways, while sites of Omicron mutations may often correspond to weak spots of stability and allostery but are coupled to the major stability hotspots through interaction networks. The presented analysis of the BA.1, BA.2 and BA.2.75 trimers suggested that thermodynamic stability of BA.1 and BA.2.75 variants may be intimately linked with the residue interaction network organization that allows for a broad ensemble of allosteric communications in which signaling between structural stability hotspots may be modulated by the Omicron mutational sites. The findings provided plausible rationale for mechanisms in which Omicron mutations can evolve to balance thermodynamic stability and conformational adaptability in order to ensure proper tradeoff between stability, binding and immune escape.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpinephrine treatment is recommended during neonatal resuscitation, if ventilation and chest compressions are ineffective. Endotracheal administration is an option, if the preferred intravenous route is unavailable. We aimed to determine the efficacy of endotracheal epinephrine for achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and maintaining physiological stability after ROSC, at standard and higher dose, in severely asphyxiated newborn lambs.\n\nMethodsNear-term fetal lambs were instrumented for physiological monitoring, and asphyxiated until asystole. Resuscitation was commenced with ventilation and chest compressions as per ILCOR recommendations. Lambs were randomly allocated to: IV Saline placebo (5 ml/kg, n=6), IV Epinephrine (20 micrograms/kg, n=9), Standard-dose ET Epinephrine (100 micrograms/kg, n=9), and High-dose ET Epinephrine (1 mg/kg, n=9). After three allocated treatment doses, rescue IV Epinephrine was administered if ROSC had not occurred. Lambs achieving ROSC were ventilated and monitored for 60 minutes before euthanasia. Brain histology was assessed for micro-hemorrhage.\n\nResultsROSC in response to allocated treatment (without rescue IV Epinephrine) occurred in 1/6 Saline, 9/9 IV Epinephrine, 0/9 Standard-dose ET Epinephrine, and 7/9 High-dose ET Epinephrine lambs respectively. Three Saline, six Standard-dose ET Epinephrine, and one High-dose ET Epinephrine lambs achieved ROSC after rescue IV Epinephrine. Blood pressure during CPR increased after treatment with IV Epinephrine and High-dose ET Epinephrine, but not Saline or Standard-dose ET Epinephrine.\n\nAfter ROSC, both ET Epinephrine groups had lower pH, higher lactate, and higher blood pressure than the IV Epinephrine group. Cortex micro-hemorrhage was more frequent in the High-dose ET Epinephrine lambs (8/8 lambs examined, versus 3/8 in IV Epinephrine lambs).\n\nConclusionsThe currently recommended dose of ET Epinephrine was ineffective in achieving ROSC. In the absence of convincing clinical or preclinical evidence of efficacy, use of ET Epinephrine at this dose may not be appropriate.\n\nHigh-dose ET Epinephrine requires further evaluation before clinical translation.",

Previous research has shown that patients with long QT syndrome due to HERG mutations have increased secretion of the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, the role of HERG in GLP-1 secretion remains uncertain. Here we report that HERG is expressed in GLP-1-producing L-cells in rodent intestinal epithelium. In a mouse L-cell model (GLUTag cell line), downregulation of HERG significantly prolonged action potential duration, increased intracellular calcium concentration, and stimulated GLP-1 secretion after exposure to nutrients. These findings suggest that HERG in the intestine plays a direct role in GLP-1 secretion and may be a potential target for diabetes treatment.",

These clocks enabled us to determine tissue-specific aging-slowing effects of different pro-longevity mechanisms, and identify major cell types sensitive to these regulations. Additionally, we provided a systemic view of alternative polyadenylation events in different cell types, as well as their cell-type-specific changes during aging and under different pro-longevity conditions.

    "abstract": "Rice tillers are a major yield component regulated by phytohormones and nutrients. How nutrients interact with phytohormones to control tillering remains largely elusive. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which the transcription factor NIN-like protein 4 (OsNLP4) integrates nitrogen (N)-iron (Fe) nutrient signals to promote tillering by repressing OsD3 in strigolactone (SL) signaling. We show that the N-Fe balance modulates OsNLP4 nuclear accumulation, which is increased by Fe through H2O2 reduction. Furthermore, OsNLP4 upregulates multiple H2O2 scavenging genes, providing a positive regulatory loop for OsNLP4 nuclear accumulation. Our findings uncover a fundamental mechanism by which the OsNLP4-OsD3 module integrates N-Fe nutrient signals to downregulate SL signaling and thereby promote rice tillering and yield, thus facilitating sustainable agriculture worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Actin dynamic is critical for cell morphogenesis in plants, but the signaling mechanisms underlying its regulation are not well understood. Here we found PRL1 (Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus1) modulates leaf pavement cell (PC) morphogenesis in Arabidopsis by maintaining the dynamic homeostasis of actin microfilaments (MF). Our previous studies indicated PC shape formation was mediated by the counteracting ROP2 and ROP6 signaling pathways that promote the organization of cortical MF and microtubules (MT), respectively. Our genetic screen for ROP6 enhancers identified prl1 alleles. Genetic analysis suggested that prl1 acted synergistically with ROP2 and ROP6 in regulation of PC morphogenesis. We further found that the activities of ROP2 and ROP6 were increased and decreased in prl1 mutants, respectively. Interestingly prl1 was found to prefer to depolymerize MF independent of ROP2 and ROP6. Stress (high salinity and low temperature) induced similar changes of ROP activities as do prl1 mutations. Together our findings provided evidence that PRL1 governed two signaling pathways that counteractively maintain actin dynamics and resultant cell morphogenesis.",

A cyclic regime for short{square}term OSKM expression has been shown to promote regeneration of several organs however its impact on the brain remains largely unknown. We investigated the effects of a cyclic short-term OSKM expression on the choroid plexus (CP), a highly vascularized tissue found within the brain ventricles which is responsible for producing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Transient reprogramming was done on 8-week-old mice carrying the polycistronic OSKM cassette under tetracycline operator (tetO) and confirmed the successful transient reprogramming. We then performed the analysis of the CP at cellular and molecular levels. The CP tissue exhibited minor morphological changes in height and area of epithelial cells. We did not observe any significant differences in the integrity of the brain-CSF barrier but noticed an increase of NKCC1 expression, a protein involved in CSF production. A whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) was also carried on the tissue and showed no difference in gene expression after the transient reprogramming, at the exception of blood-related genes. Our results indicate that surprisingly the CP mainly remains insensible to in vivo transient reprogramming as only morphological and protein changes were observed in the tissue, suggesting that translational changes might be at stake during the reprogramming process but are not present at the transcriptomic level. Our results also highlight that more tailored strategies need to be developed for exploring the potential of CP reprogramming in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic {beta}-cell dysfunction and death are central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have identified a novel role for the inflammatory extracellular matrix polymer hyaluronan (HA) in this pathophysiology. Low levels of HA are present in healthy pancreatic islets. However, HA substantially accumulates in cadaveric islets of human T2D and islets of the db/db mouse model of T2D in response to hyperglycemia. Treatment with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of HA synthesis, or the deletion of the major HA receptor CD44, preserve glycemic control and insulin levels in db/db mice despite ongoing weight gain, indicating a critical role for this pathway in T2D pathogenesis. 4-MU treatment and the deletion of CD44 likewise preserve glycemic control in other settings of {beta}-cell injury including streptozotocin treatment and islet transplantation. Mechanistically, we find that 4-MU increases the expression of the apoptosis inhibitor survivin, a downstream transcriptional target of CD44 dependent on HA/CD44 signaling, on {beta}-cells such that caspase 3 activation does not result in {beta}-cell apoptosis. These data indicate a role for HA accumulation in diabetes pathogenesis and suggest that it may be a viable target to ameliorate {beta}-cell loss in T2D. These data are particularly exciting, because 4-MU is already an approved drug (also known as hymecromone), which could accelerate translation of these findings to clinical studies.",

Understanding the requirements, flow, and availability of energy among organisms then becomes synonymous for our understanding of the sustainability of biodiversity. In this regard, metabolic scaling and coexistence theories have been pivotal in mathematizing the energy expenditures by an organism and the energy transformation across organisms, respectively. Yet, a simple formal integration of these theories has remained overdue. Here, we provide a tractable and scalable framework to link metabolic scaling relationships at the population level and the persistence of ecological communities under different environmental conditions. Specifically, this framework focuses on exploring the dependence of community feasibility on body size. This integration predicts that the exponent defining the dependence of pairwise interaction effects on body sizes is linked to the optimal distribution of environmental carrying capacities compatible with community persistence. Additionally, this integration predicts that the compatibility between community persistence and distributions of environmental carrying capacities is maximized when interaction effects are homogeneous across all pairs of interacting populations. Similarly, the optimal tolerance of community persistence to environmental changes is achieved when populations are energetically equivalent. We believe this integration can open up new opportunities to increase our understanding of how metabolic scaling relationships at the population level have evolved to optimize process at the community level.",

Using rigorous analyses of mutations, expression changes, and alternative splicing, we show that trans-effects are the major contributor to the variance in gene expression and alternative splicing between the wildtype and mutant lines, whereas cis mutations only affected a limited number of genes and do not always alter gene expression. Moreover, we show that there is a significant association between DE genes and exonic mutations, indicating that exonic mutations are an important driver of altered gene expression.",

Characteristics of the first primary cancer largely impact the risk of developing subsequent primary cancers. Hence, model-based risk characterization of cancer survivors that captures patient-specific variables is needed for healthcare policy making. We propose a Bayesian semi-parametric framework, where the occurrence processes of the competing cancer types follow independent non-homogeneous Poisson processes and adjust for covariates including the type and age at diagnosis of the first primary. Applying this framework to a historically collected cohort with families presenting a highly enriched history of multiple primary tumors and diverse cancer types, we have derived a suite of age-to-onset penetrance curves for cancer survivors. This includes penetrance estimates for second primary lung cancer, potentially impactful to ongoing cancer screening decisions. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, we have validated the good predictive performance of our models in predicting second primary lung cancer, sarcoma, breast cancer, and all other cancers combined, with areas under the curves (AUCs) at 0.89, 0.91, 0.76 and 0.68, respectively. In conclusion, our framework provides covariate-adjusted quantitative risk assessment for cancer survivors, hence moving a step closer to personalized health management for this unique population.",

    "abstract": "Aging represents the greatest risk factor for chronic diseases and mortality, but to understand it we need the ability to measure biological age. In recent years, many machine learning algorithms based on omics data, termed aging clocks, have been developed that can accurately predict the age of biological samples. However, there is currently no resource for systematic profiling of biological age. Here, we describe ClockBase, a platform that features biological age estimates based on multiple aging clock models applied to more than 2,000 DNA methylation datasets and nearly 200,000 samples. We further provide an online interface for statistical analyses and visualization of the data. To show how this resource could facilitate the discovery of biological age-modifying factors, we describe a novel anti-aging drug candidate, zebularine, which reduces the biological age estimates based on all aging clock models tested. We also show that pulmonary fibrosis accelerates epigenetic age. Together, ClockBase provides a resource for the scientific community to quantify and explore biological ages of samples, thus facilitating discovery of new longevity interventions and age-accelerating conditions.",

    "abstract": "Reduced responsiveness of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) to chemotherapy can be inferred when leukemia cells persist after 28 days of initial treatment. Survival of these long-term persister (LTP) / minimal residual disease (MRD) cells is partly due to bone marrow stromal cells that protect them under conditions of chemotherapy stress. We used RNA-seq to analyse BCP-ALL cells that survived a long-term, 30-day vincristine chemotherapy treatment while in co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells. RNAs of as many as 10% of the protein-encoding genes were differentially expressed. There was substantial overlap with genes associated with MRD cell persistence reported in other studies. The top pathway regulated in the LTP cells was that involving p53, a master regulator of a spectrum of responses relevant to drug resistance and cytotoxic drug exposure including control of autophagy. We tested a select number of genes for contribution to BCP-ALL cell survival using Cas9/CRISPR in a 2-step selection, initially for overall effect on cell fitness, followed by 21 days of exposure to vincristine. Many genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal function were found to contribute to survival both at steady-state and during drug treatment. We also identified MYH9, NCSTN and KIAA2013 as specific genes contributing to fitness of BCP-ALL cells. CD44 was not essential for growth under steady state conditions but was needed for survival of vincristine treatment. Finally, although the drug transporter ABCC1/MRP1 is not overexpressed in BCP-ALL, a functional gene was needed for DTP cells to survive treatment with vincristine. This suggests that addition of possible ABCC1 inhibitors during induction therapy could provide benefit in eradication of minimal residual disease in patients treated with a chemotherapy regimen that includes vincristine.",

    "abstract": "Cell functions are based on integrity of actin filaments. The Actin cytoskeleton is typically the target but also the source of signals. An evolutionarily conserved WD-40 protein PRL1 (Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus1) in Arabidopsis was investigated with multilayer functions in development, innate immunity, alternative splicing activation, transcription regulation, genome maintenance, ubiquitination-based protein turnover et al., but the underlying mechanisms are undefined. Here, we show PRL1 maintains actin integrity and concomitant cellular homeostasis. To explore causes for developmental root defect, we found depolymerization of cortical actin cytoskeleton and ROS imbalance in prl1 mutant. Further, we revealed that actin de-polymerization was the fundamental cause and dominant to ROS imbalance (H2O2 and O2{middle dot}-) for retarded root of prl1; NAC085 was up-regulated by and cooperated with actin depolymerization to mediate to stele cell death. Moreover, we revealed stress-related differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing defects were mutually independent and were responses to actin depolymerization in prl1. Our work ravels out cause-effect relationships between actin configuration and downstream hierarchical signals and explores underlying mechanism for functions of PRL1.",

NIN-like protein 4 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the N-Fe balance by coordinately regulating the expression of multiple genes in N and Fe metabolism and signaling. Moreover, we show that foliar spraying of balanced N-Fe at the tillering stage can effectively increase rice tillers, yield and NUE in the field, which can be reproduced with wheat.

Our group examined an upper bound for the Hill coefficient of the composition of two functions, namely the product of their individual Hill coefficients. We proved that this upper bound holds for compositions of Hill functions, and that there are instances of counterexamples that exist for more general sigmoidal functions. Additionally, we tested computationally other types of sigmoidal functions, such as the logistic and inverse trigonometric functions, and we provided evidence that in these cases the inequality also holds. We show that in large generality there is a limit to how ultrasensitive the composition of two functions can be, which has applications to understanding signaling cascades in biochemical reactions.",

    "abstract": "As the brain is dynamic and complex, knowledge of brain signal variability and complexity is crucial in our understanding of brain function. Recent resting-fMRI studies revealed links between BOLD signal variability or complexity with static/dynamics features of functional brain networks (FBN). However, no study has examined the relationships between these brain metrics. The association between brain signal variability and complexity is still understudied. Here we investigated the association between movie naturalistic-fMRI BOLD signal variability/complexity and static/dynamic FBN features using graph theory analysis. We found that variability positively correlated with fine-scale complexity but negatively correlated with coarse-scale complexity. Hence, variability and coarse-scale complexity correlated with static FC oppositely. Specifically, regions with high centrality and clustering coefficient were related to less variable but more complex signal. Similar relationship persisted for dynamic FBN, but the associations with certain aspects of regional centrality dynamics became insignificant. Our findings demonstrate that the relationship between BOLD signal variability, static/dynamic FBN with BOLD signal complexity depends on the temporal scale of signal complexity. Additionally, altered correlation between variability and complexity with dynamic FBN features may indicate the complex, time-varying feature of FBN and reflect how BOLD signal variability and complexity co-evolve with dynamic FBN over time.",

We coupled single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR) {beta} profiling of intratumoral and peripheral T cells in ovarian cancer patients to identify transcriptional programs and infer their relationship by trajectory and TCR overlap analyses. We proposed a model of differentiation pathway from an intermediate GZMH-expressing CD8 T cell subset found in the blood and tumor that progressively reinforces the exhaustion and tissue residency programs from a CCL4-expressing cluster towards XCL1- and CXCL13-expressing terminally exhausted cells. Inferred cell communication analysis suggests that interaction with CXCL13-expressing CD4 T cells, which we refer to as Tfh-like cells, sustains the effector function of this intermediate GZMH-expressing CD8 T cell subset. Moreover, our results suggest that Tfh-like cells attract cells expressing GPR183 through the production of its ligand 7,25 dihydroxycholesterol (7,25-HC). Finally, we demonstrated that GPR183 is highly expressed in a subset of pre-effector GZMK-expressing CD8 T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Collectively, our results suggest that Tfh-like cells expressing IL-21 help promote antitumor immunity against ovarian tumors by coordinating the action of immune cells responsive to 7,25-HC.",

Here, we studied the neural mechanisms that underlie the inhibitory control of speech, specifically the ability to stop speaking on demand. We recorded direct cortical activity while participants made continuous speech production and were given a visual cue to stop speaking. Neural recordings revealed activity in the premotor frontal cortex associated with speech stopping. Cortical sites showing stop activity were largely distinct from sites involved in active speech production or, more specifically, encoding articulatory movements. Electrocortical stimulation mapping at many premotor sites with stop activity caused involuntary speech arrest, an immediate inability to speak or vocalize. Furthermore, many speech arrest sites did not co-localize with neural activity correlating with speech motor planning or execution, contrary to this long-assumed function in clinical brain mapping. Together, these results suggest a previously unknown premotor cortical network that underlies the inhibitory control of speech, which has significant implications for understanding the dynamics of normal and altered speech production, as well as clinical brain mapping.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical models of Parkinsons disease are imperative to gain insight into the neural circuits that contribute to gait dysfunction in advanced stages of the disease. The PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (P1) knockout (KO) early onset model of Parkinsons disease may be a useful rodent model to study the effects of neurotransmitter degeneration caused by loss of P1 function on brain activity during volitional gait. The goal of this study was to measure changes in neural activity at the cerebellar vermis (CBLv) at 8 months of age. Gait deficits, except run speed, were not significantly different from age-matched wild-type (WT) controls as previously reported. P1KO (n=4) and WT (n=4) rats were implanted with a micro-electrocorticographic array placed over CBLv lobules VI (a, b, and c) and VII. Local field potential recordings were obtained during volitional gait across a runway. Power spectral analysis and coherence analysis were used to quantify network oscillatory activity in frequency bands of interest. CBLv power was hypoactive in the beta (VIb, VIc, and VII) and alpha (VII) bands at CBLv lobules VIb, VIc, and VII in P1KO rats compared to WT controls during gait (p<0.05). These results suggest that gait improvement in P1KO rats at 8 months may be a compensatory mechanism attributed to movement corrections caused by decreased inhibition of the alpha band of CBLv lobule VII and beta band of lobules VIb, VIc, and VII. The P1KO model may be a valuable tool for understanding the circuit mechanisms underlying gait dysfunction in early-onset Parkinsons disease patients with functional loss of P1. Future studies investigating the CBLv as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of gait dysfunction in Parkinsons disease are warranted.",

    "abstract": "For visual working memory to serve upcoming behavior, it is crucial that we prepare for the potential use of working-memory contents ahead of time. Recent studies have demonstrated how the prospection and planning for an upcoming manual action starts early after visual encoding, and occurs alongside visual retention. Here, we address whether such  output planning in visual working memory flexibly adapts to different visual-motor mappings, and occurs even when an upcoming action will only potentially become relevant for behavior. Participants performed a visual-motor working memory task in which they remembered one or two visual items for later (potential) use. We tracked planning of upcoming behavior through contralateral attenuation of beta-band activity - a canonical motor-cortical EEG signature of manual-action planning. This revealed how action encoding and subsequent planning alongside visual working memory (1) reflects anticipated task demands rather than specific visual-motor mappings, (2) occurs even for actions that will only potentially become relevant for behavior, and (3) is associated with better performance for the encoded item, at the expense of performance to other working-memory content. This reveals how the potential prospective use of visual working memory content is flexibly planned early on, with consequences for later performance.",

The role of these structures in speech understanding can be investigated by measuring their electrical activity using scalpmounted electrodes. Typical analysis methods involve averaging responses to many short repetitive stimuli. Recently, responses to more ecologically relevant continuous speech were detected using linear encoding models called temporal response functions (TRFs). Non-linear predictors derived from complex auditory models may improve TRFs. Here, we compare predictors from both simple and complex auditory models for estimating brainstem TRFs on electroencephalography (EEG) data from 24 subjects listening to continuous speech. Predictors from simple models result in comparable TRFs to those from complex models, and are much faster to compute. We also discuss the effect of data length on TRF peaks for efficient estimation of subcortical TRFs.",

    "abstract": "Investigators have recently introduced powerful methods for population genetic inference that rely on supervised machine learning from simulated data. Despite their performance advantages, these methods can fail when the simulated training data does not adequately resemble data from the real world. Here, we show that this \"simulation mis-specification\" problem can be framed as a \"domain adaptation\" problem, where a model learned from one data distribution is applied to a dataset drawn from a different distribution. By applying an established domain-adaptation technique based on a gradient reversal layer (GRL), originally introduced for image classification, we show that the effects of simulation mis-specification can be substantially mitigated. We focus our analysis on two state-of-the-art deep-learning population genetic methods--SIA, which infers positive selection from features of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), and ReLERNN, which infers recombination rates from genotype matrices. In the case of SIA, the domain adaptive framework also compensates for ARG inference error. Using the domain-adaptive SIA (dadaSIA) model, we estimate improved selection coefficients at selected loci in the 1000 Genomes CEU population. We anticipate that domain adaptation will prove to be widely applicable in the growing use of supervised machine learning in population genetics.",
