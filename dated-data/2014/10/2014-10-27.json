    "abstract": "This preprint is now available in published form as:  Using 2k + 2 bubble searches to find SNPs in k-mer graphs, Reda Younsi; Dan MacLean, Bioinformatics 2014; doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu706\\n\\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) discovery is an important preliminary for understanding genetic variation. With current sequencing methods we can sample genomes comprehensively. SNPs are found by aligning sequence reads against longer assembled references. De Bruijn graphs are efficient data structures that can deal with the vast amount of data from modern technologies. Recent work has shown that the topology of these graphs captures enough information to allow the detection and characterisation of genetic variants, offering an alternative to alignment-based methods. Such methods rely on depth-first walks of the graph to identify closing bifurcations. These methods are conservative or generate many false-positive results, particularly when traversing highly inter-connected (complex) regions of the graph or in regions of very high coverage.We devised an algorithm that calls SNPs in converted De Bruijn graphs by enumerating 2k + 2 cycles. We evaluated the accuracy of predicted SNPs by comparison with SNP lists from alignment based methods. We tested accuracy of the SNP calling using sequence data from sixteen ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana and found that accuracy was high. We found that SNP calling was even across the genome and genomic feature types. Using sequence based attributes of the graph to train a decision tree allowed us to increase accuracy of SNP calls further.Together these results indicate that our algorithm is capable of finding SNPs accurately in complex sub-graphs and potentially comprehensively from whole genome graphs.The source code for a C++ implementation of our algorithm is available under the GNU Public Licence v3 at:https://github.com/redayounsi/2kplus2",

    "abstract": "Deep sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens, with direct medical applications. The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures.

    "abstract": "Bioclimate-driven regression analysis is a widely used approach for modelling ecological niches and zonation. Although the bioclimatic complexity of the European continent is high, a particular combination of 12 climatic and topographic covariates was recently found able to reliably reproduce the ecological zoning of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for forest resources assessment at pan-European scale, generating the first fuzzy similarity map of FAO ecozones in Europe. The reproducible procedure followed to derive this collection of bioclimatic indices is now presented. It required an integration of data-transformation modules (D-TM) using geospatial tools such as Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and array-based mathematical implementation such as semantic array programming (SemAP). Base variables, intermediate and final covariates are described and semantically defined by providing the workflow of D-TMs and the mathematical formulation following the SemAP notation. Source layers to derive base variables were extracted by exclusively relying on global-scale public open geodata in order for the same set of bioclimatic covariates to be reproducible in any region worldwide. In particular, two freely available datasets were exploited for temperature and precipitation (WorldClim) and elevation (Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data). The working extent covers the European continent to the Urals with a resolution of 30 arc-second. The proposed set of bioclimatic covariates will be made available as open data in the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC). The forthcoming complete set of D-TM codelets will enable the 12 covariates to be easily reproduced and expanded through free software.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression is an intermediate step to understand the genetic architecture of complex diseases. RNA-seq technologies have improved the quantification of gene expression and allow to measure allelic specific expression (ASE)1-3. ASE is hypothesized to result from the direct effect of cis regulatory variants, but a proper estimation of the causes of ASE has not been performed to date. In this study we take advantage of a sample of twins to measure the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on ASE and we found substantial effects of gene x gene (GxG) and gene x environment (GxE) interactions. We propose a model where ASE requires genetic variability in cis, a difference in the sequence of both alleles, but the magnitude of the ASE effect depends on trans genetic and environmental factors that interact with the cis genetic variants. We uncover large GxG and GxE effects on gene expression and likely complex phenotypes that currently remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal complex (CC) 258/11, comprising sequence types (STs) 258, 11 and closely related STs, is associated with dissemination of the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Hospital outbreaks of KPC CC258/11 infections have been observed globally and are very difficult to treat. As a consequence there is renewed interest in alternative infection control measures such as vaccines and phage or depolymerase treatments targeting the K pneumoniae polysaccharide capsule. To date, 78 immunologically distinct capsule variants have been described in K. pneumoniae. Previous investigations of ST258 and a small number of closely related strains suggested capsular variation was limited within this clone; only two distinct ST258 capsular synthesis (cps) loci have been identified, both acquired through large-scale recombination events (>50 kbp). Here we report comparative genomic analysis of the broader K. pneumoniae CC258/11. Our data indicate that several large-scale recombination events have shaped the genomes of CC258/11, and that definition of the complex should be broadened to include ST395 (also reported to harbour KPC). We identified 11 different cps loci within CC258/11, suggesting that capsular switching is actually common within the complex. We also observed several insertion sequences (IS) within the cps loci, and show further diversification of two loci through IS activity. These findings suggest the capsular loci of clinically important K. pneumoniae are under diversifying selection, which alters our understanding of the evolution of this important clone and has implications for the design of control measures targeting the capsule.",

    "abstract": "Cotton is the largest source of renewable textile fiber and a successful model of transgenic applications in crop production. However, improving cotton production using fiber-related transgenes is somewhat difficult. This is probably related to unique epigenetic and gene expression changes during fiber development. Here we show that inhibiting DNA methylation impairs fiber development. Genome-wide methylcytosine-, mRNA-, and small RNA-sequencing analyses reveal minor changes in CG and CHG methylation and distinct changes in CHH methylation among different tissues. In ovules CHH hypermethyaltion is associated with small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and expression changes of nearby genes in euchromatin. Remarkably, ovule-derived fiber cells not only maintain euchromatic CHH methylation, but also generate additional heterochromatic CHH hypermethylation independent of RdDM, which represses transposable elements (TEs) and nearby genes including fiber-related genes. Furthermore, DNA methylation contributes to the expression bias of homoeologous genes in ovules and fibers. This spatiotemporal DNA methylation in promoters could act as a double-lock feedback mechanism to regulate TE and gene expression, which could be translated into genomic and biotechnological improvement of agronomic traits.",
