    "abstract": "BackgroundNeural circuits can spontaneously generate complex spatiotemporal firing patterns during development. This spontaneous activity is thought to help guide development of the nervous system. In this study, we had two aims. First, to characterise the changes in spontaneous activity in cultures of developing networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons dissociated from mouse. Second, to assess whether there are any functional differences in the patterns of activity in hippocampal and cortical networks.\\n\\nResultsWe used multielectrode arrays to record the development of spontaneous activity in cultured networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons every two or three days for the first month after plating. Within a few days of culturing, networks exhibited spontaneous activity. This activity strengthened and then stabilised typically around 21 days in vitro. We quantified the activity patterns in hippocampal and cortical networks using eleven features. Three out of eleven features showed striking differences in activity between hippocampal and cortical networks. 1: Interburst intervals are less variable in spike trains from hippocampal cultures. 2: Hippocampal networks have higher correlations. 3: Hippocampal networks generate more robust theta bursting patterns. Machine learning techniques confirmed that these differences in patterning are sufficient to reliably classify recordings at any given age as either hippocampal or cortical networks.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough cultured networks of hippocampal and cortical networks both generate spontaneous activity that changes over time, at any given time we can reliably detect differences in the activity patterns. We anticipate that this quantitative framework could have applications in many areas, including neurotoxicity testing and for characterising phenotype of different mutant mice.

    "abstract": "Anopheles gambiae, the primary vector of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, exists as a series of ecologically specialized subgroups that are phylogenetically nested within the Anopheles gambiae species complex. These species and subgroups exhibit varying degrees of reproductive isolation, sometimes recognized as distinct subspecies. We have sequenced 32 complete genomes from field-captured individuals of Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles gambiae M form (recently named A. coluzzii), sister species A. arabiensis, and the recently discovered \\\"GOUNDRY\\\" subgroup of A. gambiae that is highly susceptible to Plasmodium. Amidst a backdrop of strong reproductive isolation and adaptive differentiation, we find evidence for introgression of autosomal chromosomal regions among species and subgroups, some of which have facilitated adaptation. The X chromosome, however, is strongly differentiated among all species and subgroups, pointing to a disproportionately large effect of X chromosome genes in driving speciation among anophelines. Strikingly, we find that autosomal introgression has occurred from contemporary hybridization among A. gambiae and A. arabiensis despite strong divergence ({bsim}5x higher than autosomal divergence) and isolation on the X chromosome. We find a large region of the X chromosome that has swept to fixation in the GOUNDRY subgroup within the last 100 years, which may be an inversion that serves as a partial barrier to contemporary gene flow. We show that speciation with gene flow results in genomic mosaicism of divergence and introgression. Such a reticulate gene pool connecting vector species and subgroups across the speciation continuum has important implications for malaria control efforts.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySubdivision of species into ecological specialized subgroups allows organisms to access a wider variety of environments and sometimes leads to the formation of species complexes. Adaptation to distinct environments tends to result in differentiation among closely related subgroups, although hybridization can facilitate sharing of globally adaptive alleles. Here, we show that differentiation and hybridization have acted in parallel in a species complex of Anopheles mosquitoes that vector human malaria. In particular, we show that extensive adaptive differentiation and partial reproductive isolation has led to genomic differentiation among mosquito species and subgroups, especially on the X chromosome. However, we also find evidence for exchange of genes on the autosomes that has provided the raw material for recent rapid adaptation. For example, we show that A. arabiensis has shared a mutation conferring insecticide resistance with two subgroups of A. gambiae within the last 60 years, illustrating the fluid nature of species boundaries among even more advanced species pairs. Our results underscore the expected challenges in deploying vector-based disease control strategies since many of the worlds most devastating human pathogens are transmitted by arthropod species complexes.",

    "abstract": "Climate change during the last five decades has impacted significantly on natural ecosystems and the rate of current climate change is of great concern among conservation biologists. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used widely to project changes in species bioclimatic envelopes under future climate scenarios. Here, we aimed to advance this technique by assessing future changes in the bioclimatic envelopes of an entire mammalian Order, the Lagomorpha, using a novel framework for model validation based jointly on subjective expert evaluation and objective model evaluation statistics. SDMs were built using climatic, topographical and habitat variables for all 87 species under past and current climate scenarios. Expert evaluation and Kappa values were used to validate past and current distribution models and only those deemed  modellable through our framework were projected under future climate scenarios (58 species). We then used phylogenetically-controlled regressions to test whether species traits were correlated with predicted responses to climate change. Climate change will impact more than two-thirds of the Lagomorpha, with leporids (rabbits, hares and jackrabbits) likely to undertake poleward shifts with little overall change in range extent, whilst pikas are likely to show extreme shifts to higher altitudes associated with marked range declines, including the likely extinction of Kozlovs Pika (Ochotona koslowi). Smaller-bodied species were more likely to exhibit range contractions and elevational increases, but showing little poleward movement, and fecund species were more likely to shift latitudinally and elevationally. Our results suggest that species traits may be important indicators of future climate change and we believe multi-species approaches, as demonstrated here, are likely to lead to more effective mitigation measures and conservation management.",
