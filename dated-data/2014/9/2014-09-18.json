    "abstract": "Although the past decade has seen tremendous progress in our understanding of fine-scale recombination, little is known about non-crossover (NCO) gene conversion. We report the first genome-wide study of NCO events in humans. Using SNP array data from 98 meioses, we identified 103 sites affected by NCO, of which 50/52 were confirmed in sequence data. Overlap with double strand break (DSB) hotspots indicates that the events are likely of meiotic origin. We estimate that a site is involved in a NCO at a rate of 5.7x10-6/bp/generation, consistent with sperm-typing studies, and infer that tract lengths span at least an order of magnitude. Observed NCO events show strong allelic bias at heterozygous AT/GC SNPs, with 68% (58-78%) transmitting GC alleles (P=5x10-4). Strikingly, in 4 of 15 regions for which there are also resequencing data, multiple disjoint NCO tracts cluster in close proximity (~20-30 kb), a phenomenon not previously seen in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical knowledge is often represented as annotations of biological entities such as genes, genetic variants, diseases, and drugs. For gene annotations, they are fragmented across data repositories like NCBI Entrez, Ensembl, UniProt, and hundreds (or more) of other specialized databases. While the volume and breadth of annotations is valuable, their fragmentation across many data silos is often frustrating and inefficient. Bioinformaticians everywhere must continuously and repetitively engage in data wrangling in an effort to comprehensively integrate knowledge from all these resources, and these uncoordinated efforts represent an enormous duplication of work. We previously released MyGene.info (http://mygene.info) to enable bioinformatics developers to gain programmatic access to gene annotation data through our high-performance web services. This article focuses on the updates to MyGene.info since our last paper (2013 database issue). With the completely re-factored system, MyGene.info now expands the support from the original nine species to over 14K species, covering >17M genes with >50 gene-specific annotation types. Two simple web service endpoints provides high-performance query access to all these aggregated gene annotations. The infrastructure underlying MyGene.info is highly scalable, which offers both high-performance and high-concurrency, and makes MyGene.info particularly suitable for the use cases of real-time applications and analysis pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Mapping hybrid defects in contact zones between incipient species can identify genomic regions contributing to reproductive isolation and reveal genetic mechanisms of speciation. The house mouse features a rare combination of sophisticated genetic tools and natural hybrid zones between subspecies. Male hybrids often show reduced fertility, a common reproductive barrier between incipient species. Laboratory crosses have identified sterility loci, but each encompasses hundreds of genes. We map genetic determinants of testis weight and testis gene expression using offspring of mice captured in a hybrid zone between M. musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. Many generations of admixture enables high-resolution mapping of loci contributing to these sterility-related phenotypes. We identify complex interactions among sterility loci, suggesting multiple, non-independent genetic incompatibilities contribute to barriers to gene flow in the hybrid zone.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the patterns and processes underlying the uneven distribution of biodiversity across space and time constitutes a major scientific challenge in evolutionary biology. With rapidly accumulating species occurrence data, there is an increasing need for making the process of coding species into operational units for biogeographic and evolutionary analyses faster, automated, transparent and reproducible. Here we present SpeciesGeoCoder, a free software package written in Python and R, that allows for easy coding of species into user-defined areas. These areas may be of any size and be purely geographical (i.e., polygons) such as political units, conservation areas, biomes, islands, biodiversity hotspots, and areas of endemism, but may also include altitudinal ranges. This flexibility allows scoring species into complex categories, such as those encountered in topographically and ecologically heterogeneous landscapes. In addition, SpeciesGeoCoder can be used to facilitate sorting and cleaning of occurrence data. The various outputs of SpeciesGeoCoder include quantitative biodiversity statistics, global and local distribution maps, and NEXUS files that can be directly used in many phylogeny-based applications for ancestral state reconstruction, investigations on biome evolution, and diversification rate analyses. Our simulations indicate that even datasets containing hundreds of millions of records can be analysed in relatively short time using a regular desktop computer. We exemplify the use of our program through two contrasting examples: i) inferring historical dispersal of birds across the Isthmus of Panama, separating lowland vs. montane species and optimising the results onto a species-level, dated phylogeny; and ii) exploring seasonal variations in the occurrence of 10 GPS-tracked individuals of moose (Alces alces) over one year in northern Sweden. These analyses show that SpeciesGeoCoder allows an easy, flexible and fast categorisation of species distribution data for various analyses in ecology and evolution, with potential use at different spatial, taxonomic and temporal scales.",

We studied the genetic ancestry of 5,269 self-described African Americans, 8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European Americans who are 23andMe customers and show that the legacy of these historical interactions is visible in the genetic ancestry of present-day Americans. We document pervasive mixed ancestry and asymmetrical male and female ancestry contributions in all groups studied. We show that regional ancestry differences reflect historical events, such as early Spanish colonization, waves of immigration from many regions of Europe, and forced relocation of Native Americans within the US. This study sheds light on the fine-scale differences in ancestry within and across the United States, and informs our understanding of the relationship between racial and ethnic identities and genetic ancestry.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genomic annotations that differentiate causal from associated variants is critical to fine-map disease loci. While many studies have identified non-coding annotations overlapping disease variants, these annotations colocalize, complicating fine-mapping efforts. We demonstrate that conventional enrichment tests are inflated and cannot distinguish causal effects from colocalizing annotations. We developed a sensitive and specific statistical approach that is able to identify independent effects from colocalizing annotations. We first confirm that gene regulatory variants map to DNase-I hypersensitive sites (DHS) near transcription start sites. We then show that (1) 15-35% of causal variants within disease loci map to DHS independent of other annotations; (2) breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis loci harbor potentially causal variants near the summits of histone marks rather than full peak bodies; and (3) variants associated with height are highly enriched for embryonic stem cell DHS sites. We highlight specific loci where we can most effectively prioritize causal variation.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genes are composed of exons, but the evolutionary origins and functions of new internal exons are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed patterns of exon gain using deep cDNA sequencing data from five mammals and one bird, identifying thousands of species- and lineage-specific exons. Most new exons derived from unique rather than repetitive intronic sequence. Unlike exons conserved across mammals, species-specific internal exons were mostly located in 5' untranslated regions and alternatively spliced. They were associated with upstream intronic deletions, increased nucleosome occupancy, and RNA polymerase II pausing. Genes containing new internal exons had increased gene expression, but only in tissues where the exon was included. Increased expression correlated with level of exon inclusion, promoter proximity, and signatures of cotranscriptional splicing. Together these findings suggest that splicing at the 5' ends of genes enhances expression and that changes in 5' end splicing alter gene expression between tissues and between species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNext-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have emerged as a powerful tool to reveal nucleotide polymorphisms in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner. However, it remains a daunting task to proficiently analyze the enormous volume of data generated from NGS and to identify length polymorphisms for molecular marker discovery. The development of insertion-deletion polymorphism (InDel) markers is in particular computationally intensive, calling for integrated high performance methods to identify InDels with high sensitivity and specificity, which would directly benefit areas from genomic studies to molecular breeding.\\n\\nResultsWe present here a NGS-based tool for InDel marker discovery (mInDel), a high-performance computing pipeline for the development of InDel markers between any two genotypes. The mInDel pipeline proficiently develops InDel markers by comparing shared region size using sliding alignments between assembled contigs or reference genomes. mInDel has successfully designed thousands of InDel markers from maize NGS data locally and genome-wide. The program needs less than 2 hours to run when using 20 threads on a high-performance computing server to implement 40G data.\\n\\nConclusionsmInDel is an efficient, integrated pipeline for a high-throughput design of InDel markers between genotypes. It will be particularly applicable to the crop species which require a sufficient amount of DNA markers for molecular breeding selection. mInDel is freely available for downloading at www.github.com/lyd0527/mInDel website.",

    "abstract": "In the early visual cortex, information is processed within functional maps whose layouts are thought to underlie visual perception. However, the precise organization of these functional maps as well as their interrelationships remains largely unknown. Here, we show that spatial frequency representation in cat early visual cortex exhibits singularities around which the map organizes like an electric dipole potential. These singularities are precisely co-located with singularities of the orientation map: the pinwheel centers. To show this, we used high resolution intrinsic optical imaging in cat areas 17 and 18. First, we show that a majority of pinwheel centers exhibit in their neighborhood both semi-global maximum and minimum in the spatial frequency map, contradicting pioneering studies suggesting that pinwheel centers are placed at the locus of a single spatial frequency extremum. Based on an analogy with electromagnetism, we proposed a mathematical model for a dipolar structure, accurately fitting optical imaging data. We conclude that a majority of orientation pinwheel centers form spatial frequency dipoles in cat early visual cortex. Given the functional specificities of neurons at singularities in the visual cortex, it is argued that the dipolar organization of spatial frequency around pinwheel centers could be fundamental for visual processing.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

    "abstract": "Sexual antagonism occurs when there is a positive intersexual genetic correlation in trait expression but opposite fitness effects of the trait(s) in males and females. As such, it constrains the evolution of sexual dimorphism and may therefore have implications for adaptive evolution. There is currently considerable evidence for the existence of sexually antagonistic genetic variation in laboratory and natural populations, but how sexual antagonism interacts with other evolutionary phenomena is still poorly understood in many cases. Here we explore how self-fertilization and inbreeding affect the maintenance of polymorphism for sexually antagonistic loci. We expected a priori that selfing should reduce the region of polymorphism, since inbreeding reduces the frequency of heterozygotes and speeds fixation. Although this expectation was supported, our results show that there is an interactive effect between the degree of selfing and dominance such that those segregating sexually antagonistic loci that do exist are more likely to be partially dominant. In addition, inbreeding effects may influence population persistence and genomic location of sexually antagonistic loci in separate-sexed organisms.",

    "abstract": "Individual taste differences were first reported in the first half of the 20th century, but the primary reasons for these differences have remained uncertain. Much of the taste variation among different mammalian species can be explained by pseudogenization of taste receptors. In this study, by analyzing 14 ethnically diverse populations, we investigated whether the most recent disruptions of taste receptor genes segregate with their intact forms. Our results revealed an unprecedented prevalence of segregating loss-of-function (LoF) taste receptor variants, identifying one of the most pronounced cases of functional population diversity in the human genome. LoF variant frequency (2.10%) was considerably higher than the overall mutation rate (0.16%), and many humans harbored varying numbers of critical mutations. In particular, molecular evolutionary rates of sour (14.7%) and bitter receptors (1.8%) were far higher in humans than those of sweet (0.02%), salty (0.05%), and umami (0.17%) receptors compared with other carnivorous mammals although not all of the taste receptors genes were identified. Many LoF variants are population-specific, some of which arose even after the population differentiation, but not before divergence of the modern and archaic (Neanderthal and Denisovan) human. Based on these findings, we conclude that modern humans might have been losing their taste receptor genes because of high-frequency LoF taste receptor variants. Finally I actually demonstrated the genetic testing of taste receptors from personal exome sequence.",
