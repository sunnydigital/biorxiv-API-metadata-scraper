    "abstract": "I propose a method that estimates the selection response of all vital rates in an age-structured population. I assume that vital rates are determined by the additive genetic contributions of many loci. The method uses all relatedness information in the sample to inform its estimates of genetic parameters, via an MCMC Bayesian framework. One can use the results to estimate the selection response of any life history trait that is a function of the vital rates, including the age at first reproduction, total lifetime fertility, survival to adulthood, and others. This method closely ties the empirical analysis of life history evolution to dynamically complete models of natural selection, and therefore enjoys some theoretical advantages over other methods. I demonstrate the method on a simulated model of evolution with two age classes. Finally I discuss how the method can be extended to more complicated cases.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomic profiling is an emerging technique in life sciences. Human studies using these techniques have been performed in a small number of individuals or have been targeted at a restricted number of metabolites. In this article, we propose a data analysis workflow to perform non-targeted metabolomic profiling in large human population-based studies using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We describe challenges and propose solutions for quality control, statistical analysis and annotation of metabolic features. Using the data analysis workflow, we detected more than 8,000 metabolic features in serum samples from 2,489 fasting individuals. As an illustrative example, we performed a non-targeted metabolome-wide association analysis of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and detected 407 metabolic features corresponding to 90 unique metabolites that could be replicated in an external population. Our results reveal unexpected biological associations, such as metabolites identified as monoacylphosphorylcholines (LysoPC) being negatively associated with hsCRP. R code and fragmentation spectra for all metabolites are made publically available. In conclusion, the results presented here illustrate the viability and potential of non-targeted metabolomic profiling in large population-based studies.",

    "abstract": "Living at high-altitude is one of the most difficult challenges that humans had to cope with during their evolution. Whereas several genomic studies have revealed some of the genetic bases of adaptations in Tibetan, Andean and Ethiopian populations, relatively little evidence of convergent evolution to altitude in different continents has accumulated. This lack of evidence can be due to truly different evolutionary responses, but it can be also due to the low power of former studies that have mainly focused on populations from a single geographical region or performed separate analyses on multiple pairs of populations to avoid problems linked to shared histories between some populations. We introduce here a hierarchical Bayesian method to detect local adaptation that can deal with complex demographic histories. Our method can identify selection occurring at different scales, as well as convergent adaptation in different regions. We apply our approach to the analysis of a large SNP dataset from low- and high-altitude human populations from America and Asia. The simultaneous analysis of these two geographic areas allows us to identify several candidate genome regions for altitudinal selection, and we show that convergent evolution among continents has been quite common. In addition to identifying several genes and biological processes involved in high altitude adaptation, we identify two specific biological pathways that could have evolved in both continents to counter toxic effects induced by hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.",
