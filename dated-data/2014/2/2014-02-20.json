    "abstract": "Epistasis has long been thought to contribute to the genetic aetiology of complex diseases, yet few robust epistatic interactions in humans have been detected. We have conducted exhaustive genome-wide scans for pairwise epistasis in five independent celiac disease (CD) case-control studies, using a rapid model-free approach to examine over 500 billion SNP pairs in total. We found 20 significant epistatic signals within the HLA region which achieved stringent replication criteria across multiple studies and were independent of known CD risk HLA haplotypes. The strongest independent CD epistatic signal corresponded to genes in the HLA class III region, in particular PRRC2A and GPANK1/C6orf47, which are known to contain variants for non-Hodgkins lymphoma and early menopause, co-morbidities of celiac disease. Replicable evidence for epistatic variants outside the MHC was not observed. Both within and between European populations, we observed striking consistency of epistatic models and epistatic model distribution. Within the UK population, models of CD based on both epistatic and additive single-SNP effects increased explained CD variance by approximately 1% over those of single SNPs. Models of only epistatic pairs or additive single-SNPs showed similar levels of CD variance explained, indicating the existence of a substantial overlap of additive and epistatic components. Our findings have implications for the determination of genetic architecture and, by extension, the use of human genetics for validation of therapeutic targets.",

However, once a project deviates from standard work flows, custom scripts are needed.\\n\\nResultsWe present HTSeq, a Python library to facilitate the rapid development of such scripts. HTSeq offers parsers for many common data formats in HTS projects, as well as classes to represent data such as genomic coordinates, sequences, sequencing reads, alignments, gene model information, variant calls, and provides data structures that allow for querying via genomic coordinates. We also present htseq-count, a tool developed with HTSeq that preprocesses RNA-Seq data for differential expression analysis by counting the overlap of reads with genes.\\n\\nAvailabilityHTSeq is released as open-source software under the GNU General Public Licence and available from http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq or from the Python Package Index https://pypi.python.org/pypi/HTSeq.\\n\\nContactsanders@fs.tum.de",

    "abstract": "All modern approaches to molecular phylogenetics require a quantitative model for how genes evolve. Unfortunately, existing evolutionary models do not realistically represent the site-heterogeneous selection that governs actual sequence change. Attempts to remedy this problem have involved augmenting these models with a burgeoning number of free parameters. Here I demonstrate an alternative: experimental determination of a parameter-free evolutionary model via mutagenesis, functional selection, and deep sequencing. Using this strategy, I create an evolutionary model for influenza nucleoprotein that describes the gene phylogeny far better than existing models with dozens or even hundreds of free parameters. Emerging high-throughput experimental strategies such as the one employed here provide fundamentally new information that has the potential to transform the sensitivity of phylogenetic and genetic analyses.",

    "abstract": "Most animals possess the ability to actuate a vast diversity of movements, ostensibly constrained only by morphology and physics. In practice, however, a frequent assumption in behavioral science is that most of an animals activities can be described in terms of a small set of stereotyped motifs. Here we introduce a method for mapping the behavioral space of organisms, relying only upon the underlying structure of postural movement data to organize and classify behaviors. We find that six different drosophilid species each perform a mix of non-stereotyped actions and over one hundred hierarchically-organized, stereotyped behaviors. Moreover, we use this approach to compare these species behavioral spaces, systematically identifying subtle behavioral differences between closely-related species.",

    "abstract": "Non-African populations have experienced major bottlenecks in the time since their split from West Africans, which has led to the hypothesis that natural selection to remove weakly deleterious mutations may have been less effective in non-Africans. To directly test this hypothesis, we measure the per-genome accumulation of deleterious mutations across diverse humans. We fail to detect any significant differences, but find that archaic Denisovans accumulated non-synonymous mutations at a higher rate than modern humans, consistent with the longer separation time of modern and archaic humans. We also revisit the empirical patterns that have been interpreted as evidence for less effective removal of deleterious mutations in non-Africans than in West Africans, and show they are not driven by differences in selection after population separation, but by neutral evolution.",
