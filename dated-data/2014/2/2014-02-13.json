    "abstract": "Small molecule inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One inhibition strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. \\\"Pitstop\\\" compounds have been developed which block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-terminal domain interaction sites. We conclude that the inhibition observed with this compound is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes inhibition away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these compounds be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrins N-terminal domain.",

    "abstract": "From recent whole genome shotgun data of 48 mammalian species, we have used our software VgenExtractor to obtain the functional V-gene sequence repertoire in order to conduct comparative phylogenetic studies. These studies reveal a large variation in the number of V-genes across mammalian species, ranging from a mere 36 V-genes in dolphins to nearly 600 V-genes in rats. Monotremes and marsupials are the only mammals possessing an additional locus, the TRMV, apart from the seven common loci found in mammals. Also, we show evidence for the loss of the light chain loci, specifically the V{kappa} chain in one microbat, and the V{lambda} chain in one rodent species. Finally, we suggest different features related to the evolution of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor loci, where frequent sequence duplications are seen in the former, while preserved and undiversified lineages are observed in the latter. All the V-gene sequences described in this study are available in the public database repository vgenerepertoire.org.",
