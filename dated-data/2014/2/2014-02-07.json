    "abstract": "Biodiversity indices often combine data from different species when used in monitoring programs. Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. Here we develop three biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. The first index is based on the geometric mean abundance of species. A second uses a more general power mean. A third integrates both the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants, and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggests that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1% from 1970 to 2009.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe continued democratization of DNA sequencing has sparked a new wave of development of genome assembly and assembly validation methods. As individual research labs, rather than centralized centers, begin to sequence the majority of new genomes, it is important to establish best practices for genome assembly. However, recent evaluations such as GAGE and the Assemblathon have concluded that there is no single best approach to genome assembly. Instead, it is preferable to generate multiple assemblies and validate them to determine which is most useful for the desired analysis; this is a labor-intensive process that is often impossible or unfeasible.\\n\\nResultsTo encourage best practices supported by the community, we present iMetAMOS, an automated ensemble assembly pipeline; iMetAMOS encapsulates the process of running, validating, and selecting a single assembly from multiple assemblies. iMetAMOS packages several leading open-source tools into a single binary that automates parameter selection and execution of multiple assemblers, scores the resulting assemblies based on multiple validation metrics, and annotates the assemblies for genes and contaminants. We demonstrate the utility of the ensemble process on 225 previously unassembled Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes as well as a Rhodobacter sphaeroides benchmark dataset. On these real data, iMetAMOS reliably produces validated assemblies and identifies potential contamination without user intervention. In addition, intelligent parameter selection produces assemblies of R. sphaeroides that exceed the quality of those from the GAGE-B evaluation, affecting the relative ranking of some assemblers.\\n\\nConclusionsEnsemble assembly with iMetAMOS provides users with multiple, validated assemblies for each genome. Although computationally limited to small or mid-sized genomes, this approach is the most effective and reproducible means for generating high-quality assemblies and enables users to select an assembly best tailored to their specific needs.",

    "abstract": "Every level of biological organization from cells to societies require that composing units come together to form parts of a bigger unit (1). Our knowledge of how behavioral manipulating parasites change social interactions between social hosts is limited. Here we use an endoparasite to observe changes in social interactions between infected and healthy ants, using trophallaxis (liquid food exchange) and spatial data as proxies for food sharing and social segregation. We found no change in trophallaxis (p-value = 0.5156). By using K-function and nearest neighbor analyses we did see a significant difference in spatial segregation on day 3 (less than 8 millimeters; p-value < 0.05). These results suggest healthy individuals are unable to detect the parasite within the host.",

    "abstract": "Epistasis has long been thought to contribute to the genetic aetiology of complex diseases, yet few robust epistatic interactions in humans have been detected. We have conducted exhaustive genome-wide scans for pairwise epistasis in five independent celiac disease (CD) case-control studies, using a rapid model-free approach to examine over 500 billion SNP pairs in total. We found 20 significant epistatic signals within the HLA region which achieved stringent replication criteria across multiple studies and were independent of known CD risk HLA haplotypes. The strongest independent CD epistatic signal corresponded to genes in the HLA class III region, in particular PRRC2A and GPANK1/C6orf47, which are known to contain variants for non-Hodgkins lymphoma and early menopause, co-morbidities of celiac disease. Replicable evidence for epistatic variants outside the MHC was not observed. Both within and between European populations, we observed striking consistency of epistatic models and epistatic model distribution. Within the UK population, models of CD based on both epistatic and additive single-SNP effects increased explained CD variance by approximately 1% over those of single SNPs. Models of only epistatic pairs or additive single-SNPs showed similar levels of CD variance explained, indicating the existence of a substantial overlap of additive and epistatic components. Our findings have implications for the determination of genetic architecture and, by extension, the use of human genetics for validation of therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) are a promising technology for organic waste treatment and sustainable bioelectricity production. Inoculated with natural communities, they present a complex microbial ecosystem with syntrophic interactions between microbes with different metabolic capabilities. From this point of view, they are similar to anaerobic digesters, however with methanogenesis replaced by anaerobic respiration with the anode as terminal electron acceptor. Bio-electrochemically they are similar to classical fuel cells where however the electrogenic redox reaction is part of the microbial metabolism rather than mediated by an inorganic catalyst.\\n\\nIn this paper, we analyse how electric power production in MFCs depends on the composition of the anodic biofilm in terms of metabolic capabilities of identified sets of species. MFCs were started with a natural inoculum and continuously fed with sucrose, a fermentable carbohydrate. The composition of the community, power and other environmental data were sampled over a period of a few weeks during the maturation of the anodic biofilm, and the community composition was determined down to the species level including relevant metabolic capabilities.\\n\\nOur results support the hypothesis that an MFCs with natural inoculum and fermentable feedstock is essentially a two stage system with fermentation followed by anode-respiration. Our results also show that under identical starting and operating conditions, MFCs with comparable power output can develop different anodic communities with no particular species dominant across all replicas. It is only important for good power production that all cells contain a sufficient fraction of low-potential anaerobic respirators, that is respirators that can use terminal electron acceptors with a low redox potential. We conclude with a number of hypotheses and recommendations for the operation of MFCs to ensure good electric yield.",

    "abstract": "Standing genetic variation and the historical environment in which that variation arises (evolutionary history) are both potentially significant determinants of a populations capacity for evolutionary response to a changing environment. We evaluated the relative importance of these two factors in influencing the evolutionary trajectories in the face of sudden environmental change. We used the open-ended digital evolution software Avida to examine how historic exposure to predation pressures, different levels of genetic variation, and combinations of the two, impact anti-predator strategies and competitive abilities evolved in the face of threats from new, invasive, predator populations. We show that while standing genetic variation plays some role in determining evolutionary responses, evolutionary history has the greater influence on a populations capacity to evolve effective anti-predator traits. This adaptability likely reflects the relative ease of repurposing existing, relevant genes and traits, and the broader potential value of the generation and maintenance of adaptively flexible traits in evolving populations.",
