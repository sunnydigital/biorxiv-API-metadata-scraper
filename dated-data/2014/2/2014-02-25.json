    "abstract": "Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, choosing the relevant annotations for interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. We describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic element that are enriched or depleted for loci that influence a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. We applied the model to GWAS of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, BMI, and Crohns disease. For each trait, we evaluated the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over a hundred tissues and cell lines. We show that the fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs that influence protein sequence ranges from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for LDL cholesterol); that repressed chromatin is significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits; and that cell type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites are enriched for SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, by re-weighting each GWAS using information from functional genomics, we increase the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5%.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication provides a profusion of raw material for evolutionary innovation (Lynch and Conery, 2000). While most duplicates rapidly become unrecognizable some, e.g., those that are immediately useful or those that after a period of relaxed selection gain unique roles, are retained and thereby expand a genomes protein-coding repertoire. Ohno (1970) famously remarked that without gene duplication, the creation of metazoans, vertebrates, and mammals from unicellular organisms would have been impossible. Such big leaps in evolution, he argued, required the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions (Taylor and Raes, 2004). Recently, another source of new genes has been recognized: Though rare, it seems clear that new genes can emerge from formerly non-coding DNA, the  de novo protein coding genes (Zhao et al., 2014, and references therein).\\n\\nIn 2009 Knowles ...",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions benefit both partners, promoting coexistence and genetic diversity. Spatial structure can promote cooperation, but spatial expansions may also make it hard for mutualistic partners to stay together, since genetic drift at the expansion front creates regions of low genetic and species diversity. To explore the antagonism between mutualism and genetic drift, we grew cross-feeding strains of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae on agar surfaces as a model for mutualists undergoing spatial expansions. By supplying varying amounts of the exchanged nutrients, we tuned strength and symmetry of the mutualistic interaction. Strong mutualism suppresses genetic demixing during spatial expansions and thereby maintains diversity, but weak or asymmetric mutualism is overwhelmed by genetic drift even when mutualism is still beneficial, slowing growth and reducing diversity. Theoretical modeling using experimentally measured parameters predicts the size of demixed regions and how strong mutualism must be to survive a spatial expansion.",
