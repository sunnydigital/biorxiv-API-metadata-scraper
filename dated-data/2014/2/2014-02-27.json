    "abstract": "The biodiversity paradox is the central problem in theoretical ecology. The paradox consists in the contradiction between the competitive exclusion principle and the observed biodiversity. This contradiction is the key subject of the long-standing and continuing biodiversity debates. The paradox impedes our insights into biodiversity conservation. Previously we proved that due to a soliton-like behaviour of population waves complete competitors can indefinitely coexist in one closed homogeneous habitat on one and the same limiting resource under constant conditions of environment, without any trade-offs and cooperations. As this fact violates the known formulations of the competitive exclusion principle we have reformulated the principle. Here we explain why this reformulation of the principle results in a solution of the biodiversity paradox. In addition, we generalize the competitive exclusion principle. Reasoning by contradiction, we formulate a generalized principle of competitive coexistence. These principles expand theoretical basis for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear genome of every cell harbors millions of unoccupied transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences that harbor methylated cytosines. Although DNA methylation is commonly invoked as a repressive mechanism, the extent to which it actively silences specific TF occupancy sites is unknown. To define the role of DNA methylation in modulating TF binding, we quantified the effect of DNA methyltransferase abrogation on the occupancy patterns of a ubiquitous TF capable of autonomous binding to its target sites in chromatin (CTCF). Here we show that the vast majority of unoccupied, methylated CTCF recognition sequences remain unbound upon depletion of DNA methylation. Rather, methylation-regulated binding is restricted to a small fraction of elements that exhibit high intrinsic variability in CTCF occupancy across cell types. Our results suggest that DNA methylation is not a major groundskeeper of genomic transcription factor occupancy landscapes, but rather a specialized mechanism for stabilizing epigenetically labile sites.",
