    "abstract": "The many successes of synthetic biology have come in a manner largely different from those in other engineering disciplines; in particular, without well-characterized and simplified prototyping environments to play a role analogous to wind-tunnels in aerodynamics and breadboards in electrical engineering. However, as the complexity of synthetic circuits increases, the benefits--in cost savings and design cycle time--of a more traditional engineering approach can be significant. We have recently developed an in vitro  breadboard prototyping platform based on E. coli cell extract that allows biocircuits to operate in an environment considerably simpler than but functionally similar to in vivo. The simplicity of this system makes it a promising tool for rapid biocircuit design and testing, as well as for probing fundamental aspects of gene circuit operation normally masked by cellular complexity. In this work we characterize the cell-free breadboard using real-time and simultaneous measurements of transcriptional and translational activities of a small set of reporter genes and a transcriptional activation cascade. We determine the effects of promoter strength, gene concentration, and nucleoside triphosphate concentration on biocircuit properties, and we isolate the specific contributions of essential biomolecular resources--core RNA polymerase and ribosomes--to overall performance. Importantly, we show how limits on resources, particularly those involved in translation, are manifested as reduced expression in the presence of orthogonal genes that serve as additional loads on the system.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a wealth of epigenomic data has been generated by biochemical assays and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In particular, histone modification data generated by the ENCODE project and other large-scale projects show specific patterns associated with regulatory elements in the human genome. It is important to build a unified statistical model to decipher the patterns of multiple histone modifications in a cell type to annotate chromatin states such as transcription start sites, enhancers and transcribed regions rather than to map histone modifications individually to regulatory elements.\\n\\nSeveral genome-wide statistical models have been developed based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). These methods typically use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the model. Here we used spectral learning, a state-of-the-art parameter estimation algorithm in machine learning. We found that spectral learning plus a few (up to five) iterations of local optimization of the likelihood outper-forms the standard EM algorithm. We also evaluated our software implementation called Spectacle on independent biological datasets and found that Spectacle annotated experimentally defined functional elements such as enhancers significantly better than a previous state-of-the-art method.\\n\\nSpectacle can be downloaded from https://github.com/jiminsong/Spectacle.",

    "abstract": "We describe our first-hand experience with a cochlear implant (CI), being both a recent recipient and a hearing researcher. We note the promising loudness, but very unpleasant distortion, which makes understanding speech difficult in many environments, including in noise, on the phone or through the radio. We also discuss the extreme unpleasantness of music, which makes recognizing familiar melodies very difficult. We investigate the causes of the above problems through mathematical analysis and computer simulations of sound mixtures, and find that surprisingly, the culprit appears to be non-biological in origin, but primarily due to the envelope-based signal processing algorithms currently used. This distortion is generated before the signal even enters the cochlea. Hence, the long-held belief that inter-electrode interference or current spreading is the cause, appears incorrect. We explain that envelope processing may have been originally instituted based on an inaccurate understanding of the role of place coding vs. temporal coding, or alternatively, because of an incorrect analogy to radio modulation theory. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest immediate concrete steps, some possibly in firmware alone, that may lead to a much improved experience.",
