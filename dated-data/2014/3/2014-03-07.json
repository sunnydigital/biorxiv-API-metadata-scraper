    "abstract": "Functional relationship networks, which reveal the collaborative roles between genes, have significantly accelerated our understanding of gene functions and phenotypic relevance. However, establishing such networks for alternatively spliced isoforms remains a difficult, unaddressed problem due to the lack of systematic functional annotations at the isoform level, which renders most supervised learning methods difficult to be applied to isoforms. Here we describe a novel multiple instance learning-based probabilistic approach that integrates large-scale, heterogeneous genomic datasets, including RNA-seq, exon array, protein docking and pseudo-amino acid composition, for modeling a global functional relationship network at the isoform level in the mouse. Using this approach, we formulate a gene pair as a set of isoform pairs of potentially different properties. Through simulation and cross-validation studies, we showed the superior accuracy of our algorithm in revealing the isoform-level functional relationships. The local networks reveal functional diversity of the isoforms of the same gene, as demonstrated by both large-scale analyses and experimental and literature evidence for the disparate functions revealed for the isoforms of Ptbp1 and Anxa6 by our network. Our work can assist the understanding of the diversity of functions achieved by alternative splicing of a limited set of genes in mammalian genomes, and may shift the current gene-centered network prediction paradigm to the isoform level.\\n\\nAuthor summaryProteins carry out their functions through interacting with each other. Such interactions can be achieved through direct physical interactions, genetic interactions, or co-regulation. To summarize these interactions, researches have established functional relationship networks, in which each gene is represented as a node and the connections between the nodes represent how likely two genes work in the same biological process. Currently, these networks are established at the gene level only, while each gene, in mammalian systems, can be alternatively spliced into multiple isoforms that may have drastically different interaction partners. This information can be mined through integrating data that provide isoform-level information, such as RNA-seq and protein docking scores predicted from amino acid sequences. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm to integrate such data for predicting isoform-level functional relationship networks, which allows us to investigate the collaborative roles between genes at a high resolution.",

    "abstract": "One of the key questions in biology is how the metabolism of a cell responds to changes in the environment. In budding yeast, starvation causes a drop in intracellular pH, but the functional role of this pH change is not well understood. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzyme inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between nutritional stress, the metabolism and the physical organization of a cell.",
