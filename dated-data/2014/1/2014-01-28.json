    "abstract": "The development of human breast cancer is driven by changes in the genetic and epigenetic landscape of the cell. Despite growing appreciation of the importance of epigenetics in breast cancers, our knowledge of epigenetic alterations of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in breast cancers remains limited. Here, we explored the epigenetic patterns of ncRNAs in breast cancers via a sequencing-based comparative methylome analysis, mainly focusing on two most popular ncRNA biotypes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs. Besides global hypomethylation and extensive CpG islands (CGIs) hypermethylation, we observed widely aberrant methylation in the promoters of ncRNAs, which was higher than that of protein-coding genes. Specifically, intergenic ncRNAs were observed to contribute a large slice of the aberrantly methylated ncRNA promoters. Moreover, we summarized five patterns of ncRNA promoter aberrant methylation in the context of genomic CGIs, where aberrant methylation occurred not only on the CGIs, but also flanking regions and CGI sparse promoters. Integration with transcriptional datasets, we found that the ncRNA promoter methylation events were associated with transcriptional changes. Furthermore, a panel of ncRNAs were identified as biomarkers that were able to discriminate between disease phenotypes (AUCs>0.90). Finally, the potential functions for aberrantly methylated ncRNAs were predicted based on similar patterns, adjacency and/or target genes, highlighting that ncRNAs and coding genes coordinately mediated pathways dysregulation in the development and progression of breast cancers. This study presents the aberrant methylation patterns of ncRNAs, which will be a highly valuable resource for investigations at understanding epigenetic regulation of breast cancers.\\n\\n[Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org.]",

    "abstract": "Herein we demonstrate how nanojunctions between lysosomes and sarcoplasmic reticulum (L-SR junctions) serve to couple lysosomal activation to regenerative, ryanodine receptor-mediated cellular Ca2+ waves. In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) it has been proposed that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) triggers increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a manner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the SR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been estimated to be < 400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy, which has restricted detailed investigations of the junctional coupling process. The present study utilizes standard and tomographic transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough ultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. We show that L-SR nanojunctions are prominent features within these cells and estimate that the junctional membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these measurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data. Simulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients demonstrate that the magnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By correlation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated Ca2+ transients within L-SR junctions, we estimate that \\\"trigger zones\\\" with a 60-100 junctions are required to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the 130 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most importantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50 nm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. L-SR junctions are therefore a pre-requisite for efficient Ca2+ signal coupling and may contribute to cellular function in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The TcZFPs are a family of small zinc finger proteins harboring WW domains or Proline rich motifs. In Trypanosoma brucei, ZFPs are involved during stage specific differentiation. TcZFPs interact with each other using the WW domain (ZFP2 and ZFP3) and the proline rich motif (ZFP1). The tcZFP1b member is exclusive to Trypanosoma cruzi and it is only expressed in trypomastigote stage. We used a tetracycline inducible vector to express ectopically tcZFP1b in the epimastigote stage. Upon induction of tcZFP1b, the parasites stopped dividing completely after five days. Visual inspection showed abnormal distorted-morphology (monster) cells with multiple flagella and increased DNA contents. We were interested in investigate global transcription changes occurred during the generation of this abnormal phenotype. Thus, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome profiling with a 454 pyrosequencer to analyze the global changes after ectopic expression of tcZFP1b. The total mRNAs sequenced from induced and non-induced control epimastigotes showed, after filtering the data, a set of 70 genes having equal or more than 3X fold change upregulation, while 35 genes showed equal or more than 3X fold downregulation. Interestingly, several trans-sialidase-like genes and pseudogenes were upregulated along with several genes in the categories of amino acid catabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. On the other hand, hypothetical proteins, fatty acid biosynthesis and mitochondrial functions dominated the group of downregulated genes. Our data showed that several mRNAs sharing related functions and pathways changed their levels in a concerted pattern resembling post-transcriptional regulons. We also found two different motifs in the 3'UTRs of the majority of mRNAs, one for upregulated and other for downregulated genes",
