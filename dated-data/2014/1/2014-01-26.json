    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing is being increasingly used for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression. The primary goal in profiling expression is to identify genes or RNA isoforms differentially expressed between specific conditions. Yet, the next generation sequence-based count data are essentially different from the microarray data that are continuous type, therefore, the statistical methods developed well over the last decades cannot be applicable. For this reason, a variety of new statistical methods based on count data of transcript reads has been correspondingly developed. But currently the transcriptomic count data coming only from a few replicate libraries have high technical noise and small sample size bias, performances of these new methods are not desirable. We here developed a new statistical method specifically applicable to small sample count data called mBeta t-test for identifying differentially expressed gene or isoforms on the basis of the Beta t-test. The results obtained from simulated and real data showed that the mBeta t-test method significantly outperformed the existing statistical methods in all given scenarios. Findings of our method were validated by qRT-PCR experiments. The mBeta t-test method significantly reduced true false discoveries in differentially expressed genes or isoforms so that it had high work efficiencies in all given scenarios. In addition, the mBeta t-test method showed high stability in performance of statistical analysis and in estimation of FDR. These strongly suggests that our mBeta t-test method would offer us a creditable and reliable result of statistical analysis in practice.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common form of inherited mental retardation, is caused by a loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is involved in brain functions by interacting with mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that selectively control gene expression at translational level. However, little is known about the role of FMRP in regulating miRNA expression. Here, we found a development-dependant dynamic expression of Fmr1 mRNA (encoding FMRP) in mouse hippocampus with a small peak at postnatal day 7 (P7). MiRNA microarray analysis showed that the levels of 38 miRNAs showed a significant increase with about 15~250 folds and the levels of 26 miRNAs showed a significant decrease with only about 2~4 folds in the hippocampus of P7 Fmr1 KO mice. Q-PCR assay showed that 9 of the most increased miRNAs (>100 folds in microarrays) were increased about 40~70 folds and their pre-miRNAs were increased about 5~10 folds, but no significant difference in their pri-miRNA levels was observed, suggesting a role of FMRP in regulating miRNA processing from pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA. We further demonstrated that a set of protein-coding mRNAs, potentially targeted by the 9 miRNAs were down-regulated in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-34b, miR-340, miR-148a could down-regulate the reporter gene expression by interacting with the Met 3' UTR. Taken together these findings suggest that the miRNA expression alterations resulted from the absence of FMRP might contribute to molecular pathology of FXS.",
