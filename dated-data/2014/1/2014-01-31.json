    "abstract": "Background Nucleotide and protein sequence feature annotations are essential to understand biology on the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level. Using Semantic Web technologies to query biological annotations, there was no standard that described this potentially complex location information as subject-predicate-object triples.\\n\\nDescription We have developed an ontology, the Feature Annotation Location Description Ontology (FALDO), to describe the positions of annotated features on linear and circular sequences. FALDO can be used to describe nucleotide features in sequence records, protein annotations, and glycan binding sites, among other features in coordinate systems of the aforementioned \\\"omics\\\" areas. Using the same data format to represent sequence positions that are independent of file formats allows us to integrate sequence data from multiple sources and data types. The genome browser JBrowse is used to demonstrate accessing multiple SPARQL endpoints to display genomic feature annotations, as well as protein annotations from UniProt mapped to genomic locations.\\n\\nConclusions Our ontology allows users to uniformly describe - and potentially merge - sequence annotations from multiple sources. Data sources using FALDO can prospectively be retrieved using federalised SPARQL queries against public SPARQL endpoints and/or local private triple stores.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation variation has been implicated as a factor that influences inter-individual and inter-tissue phenotypic variation in numerous organisms and under various conditions. Here, using a unique collection of three tissues, derived from 24 mother-newborn dyads from war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, we estimate how stress, heritability, tissue type and genomic/regulatory context influence genome-wide DNA methylation. We also evaluate if stress-associated variation may mediate an observed phenotype - newborn birthweight. On average, a minimal influence of stress and heritability are observed, while in contrast extensive among tissues and context dependency is evident. However, a notable overlap in heritable and stress-associated variation is observed and that variation is commonly correlated with birthweight variation. Finally, we observe that variation outside of promoter regions, particularly in enhancers, is far more dynamic across tissues and across conditions than in promoters, suggesting that variation outside of promoters may play a larger role in expression variation than variation found within promoter regions.",

    "abstract": "A widely studied problem in systems biology is to predict bacterial phenotype from growth conditions, using mechanistic models such as flux balance analysis (FBA). However, the inverse prediction of growth conditions from phenotype is rarely considered. Here we develop a computational framework to carry out this inverse prediction on a computational model of bacterial metabolism. We use FBA to calculate bacterial phenotypes from growth conditions in E. coli, and then we assess how accurately we can predict the original growth conditions from the phenotypes. Prediction is carried out via regularized multinomial regression. Our analysis provides several important physiological and statistical insights. First, we show that by analyzing metabolic end products we can consistently predict growth conditions. Second, prediction is reliable even in the presence of small amounts of impurities. Third, flux through a relatively small number of reactions per growth source (~10) is sufficient for accurate prediction. Fourth, combining the predictions from two separate models, one trained only on carbon sources and one only on nitrogen sources, performs better than models trained to perform joint prediction. Finally, that separate predictions perform better than a more sophisticated joint prediction scheme suggests that carbon and nitrogen utilization pathways, despite jointly affecting cellular growth, may be fairly decoupled in terms of their dependence on specific assortments of molecular precursors.",
