    "abstract": "This paper reports an initial design of new data-structures that generalizes the idea of pattern-matching in stringology, from its traditional usage in an (unstructured) set of strings to the arena of a well-structured family of strings. In particular, the object of interest is a family of strings composed of blocks/classes of highly similar \\\"stringlets,\\\" and thus mimic a population of genomes made by concatenating haplotype-blocks, further constrained by haplotype-phasing. Such a family of strings, which we dub \\\"stringomes,\\\" is formalized in terms of a multi-partite directed acyclic graph with a source and a sink. The most interesting property of stringomes is probably the fact that they can be represented efficiently with compression up to their k-th order empirical entropy, while ensuring that the compression does not hinder the pattern-matching counting and reporting queries - either internal to a block or spanning two (or a few constant) adjacent blocks. The solutions proposed here have immediate applications to next-generation sequencing technologies, base-calling, expression profiling, variant-calling, population studies, onco-genomics, cyber security trace analysis and text retrieval.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study Copy Number Variation (CNV) data. The underlying process generating CNV segments is generally assumed to be memory-less, giving rise to an exponential distribution of segment lengths. In this paper, we provide evidence from cancer patient data, which suggests that this generative model is too simplistic, and that segment lengths follow a power-law distribution instead. We conjecture a simple preferential attachment generative model that provides the basis for the observed power-law distribution. We then show how an existing statistical method for detecting cancer driver genes can be improved by incorporating the power-law distribution in the null model.",
