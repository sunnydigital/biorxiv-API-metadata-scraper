    "abstract": "As humans dispersed out of Africa, they adapted to new environmental challenges including changes in exposure to mutagenic solar radiation. Humans in temperate latitudes have acquired light skin that is relatively transparent to ultraviolet light, and some evidence suggests that their DNA damage response pathways have also experienced local adaptation. This raises the possibility that different populations have experienced different selective pressures affecting genome integrity. Here, I present evidence that the rate of a particular mutation type has recently increased in the European population, rising in frequency by 50% during the 40,000-80,000 years since Europeans began diverging from Asians. A comparison of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) private to Africa, Asia, and Europe in the 1000 Genomes data reveals that private European variation is enriched for the transition 5-TCC-3[-&gt;]5-TTC-3. Although it is not clear whether UV played a causal role in the changing the European mutational spectrum, 5-TCC-3[-&gt;]5-TTC-3 is known to be the most common somatic mutation present in melanoma skin cancers, as well as the mutation most frequently induced in vitro by UV. Regardless of its causality, this change indicates that DNA replication fidelity has not remained stable even since the origin of modern humans and might have changed numerous times during our recent evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of next generation DNA sequencing technology is enabling high-resolution cancer genome analysis. Large-scale projects like the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) are systematically scanning cancer genomes to identify recurrent somatic mutations. Second generation DNA sequencing, however, is still an evolving technology and procedures, both experimental and analytical, are constantly changing. Thus the research community is still defining a set of best practices for cancer genome data analysis, with no single protocol emerging to fulfil this role. Here we describe an extensive benchmark exercise to identify and resolve issues of somatic mutation calling. Whole genome sequence datasets comprising tumor-normal pairs from two different types of cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, were shared within the ICGC and submissions of somatic mutation calls were compared to verified mutations and to each other. Varying strategies to call mutations, incomplete awareness of sources of artefacts, and even lack of agreement on what constitutes an artefact or real mutation manifested in widely varying mutation call rates and somewhat low concordance among submissions. We conclude that somatic mutation calling remains an unsolved problem. However, we have identified many issues that are easy to remedy that are presented here. Our study highlights critical issues that need to be addressed before this valuable technology can be routinely used to inform clinical decision-making.\\n\\nAbbreviations and Definitionsaligner = mapper, these terms are used interchangeably",

    "abstract": "As next-generation sequencing becomes a clinical tool, a full understanding of the variables affecting sequencing analysis output is required. Through the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), we compared sequencing pipelines at five independent centers (CNAG, DKFZ, OICR, RIKEN and WTSI) using a single tumor-blood DNA pair. Analyses by each center and with one standardized algorithm revealed significant discrepancies. Although most pipelines performed well for coding mutations, library preparation methods and sequencing coverage metrics clearly influenced downstream results. PCR-free methods showed reduced GC-bias and more even coverage. Increasing sequencing depth to [~]100x (two- to three-fold higher than current standards) showed a benefit, as long as the tumor:control coverage ratio remained balanced. To become part of routine clinical care, high-throughput sequencing must be globally compatible and comparable. This benchmarking exercise has highlighted several fundamental parameters to consider in this regard, which will allow for better optimization and planning of both basic and translational studies.",

    "abstract": "Almost all of mammalian genes have mRNA variants due to alternative promoters, alternative splice sites, and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation sites. In most cases, change in transcript due to choosing alternative cleavage and polyadenylation sites does not lead to change in protein sequence, while selection of alternative promoters and alternative splice sites would alter protein sequence. Nevertheless, all these alternations would give rise to different RNA isoforms. Selection of alternative RNA isoforms has been found to be associated with change in condition. For example, many studies have revealed that alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (poly(A)) are correlated to proliferation, differentiation, and cellular transformation. Thus, unlike gene expression in microarray, change in usage of splice sites or poly(A) sites associated with conditions does not involve differential expression and hence cannot be detected by differential analysis methods but can be done by association methods. Traditional association methods such as Pearson chi-square test and Fisher Exact test are single test methods and do not work on the RNA count data derived from replicate libraries. For this reason, we here developed a large-scale association method, called ranking analysis of chi-squares (RAX2). Simulations demonstrated that RAX2 worked well for finding association of changes in usage of poly(A) sites with condition change. We applied our RAX2 to our primary T-cell transcriptomic data of over 9899 tags scattered in 3812 genes and found that 1610 (16.3%) tags were associated in transcription with immune stimulation at FDR < 0.05 and most of these tags associated with stimulation also had differential expression. Analysis of two and three tags within genes revealed that under immune stimulation, short RNA isoforms were significantly preferably used. Like cell proliferation and division, short RNA isoforms are highly prioritized to be used for cell growth.",

    "abstract": "One of the major goals of population genetics is to quantitatively understand variation of genetic polymorphisms among individuals. To this end, researchers have developed sophisticated statistical methods to capture the complex population structure that underlies observed genotypes in humans, and such methods have been effective for analyzing modestly sized genomic data sets. However, the number of genotyped humans has grown significantly in recent years, and it is accelerating. In aggregate about 1M individuals have been genotyped to date. Analyzing these data will bring us closer to a nearly complete picture of human genetic variation; but existing methods for population genetics analysis do not scale to data of this size. To solve this problem we developed TeraStructure. TeraStructure is a new algorithm to fit Bayesian models of genetic variation in human populations on tera-sample-sized data sets (1012 observed genotypes, e.g., 1M individuals at 1M SNPs). It is a principled approach to Bayesian inference that iterates between subsampling locations of the genome and updating an estimate of the latent population structure of the individuals. On data sets of up to 2K individuals, TeraStructure matches the existing state of the art in terms of both speed and accuracy. On simulated data sets of up to 10K individuals, TeraStructure is twice as fast as existing methods and has higher accuracy in recovering the latent population structure. On genomic data simulated at the tera-sample-size scales, TeraStructure continues to be accurate and is the only method that can complete its analysis.\\n\\nSoftwareTeraStructure is available for download at https://github.com/premgopalan/terastructure.\\n\\nFundingThis research was supported in part by NIH grant R01 HG006448 and ONR grant N00014-12-1-0764.",
