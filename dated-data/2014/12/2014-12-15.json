    "abstract": "Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships that unite all lineages (the tree of life) is a grand challenge. The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable. To reconstruct a comprehensive tree of life we therefore synthesized published phylogenies, together with taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips -- the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: 1) a novel comprehensive global reference taxonomy; and 2) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. While data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.",

    "abstract": "HISAT is a new, highly efficient system for alignment of sequences from RNA sequencing experiments that achieves dramatically faster performance than previous methods. HISAT uses a new indexing scheme, hierarchical indexing, which is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index. Hierarchical indexing employs two types of indexes for alignment: (1) a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment, and (2) numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISATs hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ~64,000 bp. The algorithm includes several customized alignment strategies specifically designed for mapping RNA-seq reads across multiple exons. In tests on a variety of real and simulated data sets, we show that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, approximately 50 times faster than TopHat2 and 12 times faster than GSNAP, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its very large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 Gigabytes of memory to align reads to the human genome. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases. HISAT is available as free, open-source software from http://www.ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat.",

As these genes are ubiquitously expressed in the bodys cells and thereby have functions in -potentially- all tissue types, then surely their resulting defects would manifest as cancers in all tissues?\\n\\nWe hypothesize that the different susceptibility to mutations could explain the  tissue-specific paradox for cancer.",

    "abstract": "A concept of information designed to handle information conveyed by organizations is introduced. This concept of information may be used at all biological scales: from molecular and intracellular to multi-cellular organisms and human beings, and further on to collectivities, societies and culture. In this short account, two ground concepts necessary for developing the definition will also be introduced: whole-part graphs, a model for biological organization, and synexions, their immersion into space-time. This definition of information formalizes perception, observers and interpretation; allowing for considering information-exchange as a basic form of biological interaction. Some of its elements will be clarified by arguing and explaining why the immersion of whole-part graphs in (the physical) space-time is needed.",
