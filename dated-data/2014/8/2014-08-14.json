    "abstract": "The use of high-throughput experiments, such as RNA-seq, to simultaneously identify differentially abundant entities across conditions has become widespread, but the systematic planning of such studies is currently hampered by the lack of general-purpose tools to do so. Here we demonstrate that there is substantial variability in performance across statistical tests, normalization techniques and study conditions, potentially leading to significant wastage of resources and/or missing information in the absence of careful study design. We present a broadly applicable experimental design tool called EDDA, and the first for single-cell RNA-seq, Nanostring and Metagenomic studies, that can be used to i) rationally choose from a panel of statistical tests, ii) measure expected performance for a study and iii) plan experiments to minimize mis-utilization of valuable resources. Using case studies from recent single-cell RNA-seq, Nanostring and Metagenomics studies, we highlight its general utility and, in particular, show a) the ability to correctly model single-cell RNA-seq data and do comparisons with 1/5th the amount of sequencing currently used and b) that the selection of suitable statistical tests strongly impacts the ability to detect biomarkers in Metagenomic studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a novel mode-based normalization employed in EDDA uniformly improves in robustness over existing approaches (10-20%) and increases precision to detect differential abundance by up to 140%.",

    "abstract": "We report reference-grade de novo assemblies of four model organisms and the human genome from single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Long-read SMRT sequencing is routinely used to finish microbial genomes, but the available assembly methods have not scaled well to larger genomes. Here we introduce the MinHash Alignment Process (MHAP) for efficient overlapping of noisy, long reads using probabilistic, locality-sensitive hashing. Together with Celera Assembler, MHAP was used to reconstruct the genomes of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, and human from high-coverage SMRT sequencing. The resulting assemblies include fully resolved chromosome arms and close persistent gaps in these important reference genomes, including heterochromatic and telomeric transition sequences. For D. melanogaster, MHAP achieved a 600-fold speedup relative to prior methods and a cloud computing cost of a few hundred dollars. These results demonstrate that single-molecule sequencing alone can produce near-complete eukaryotic genomes at modest cost.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of the long, slow human life history is a major challenge to evolutionary biologists. A compelling theory states that our late age at maturity allows us to acquire the many skills needed to survive in the economically intensive human foraging niche. Cultural transmission may be a crucial part of this process, by exposing learners to a wealth of information and skills that they would otherwise not likely discover. I use mathematical models to show that whether cultural transmission allows a later age at maturity depends on the details of selection and population regulation. In particular, cultural transmission appears to readily allow a later age at maturity under density-dependent fertility, but may not under density-dependent mortality or density-independent population growth. I close with a discussion of possibilities for future theoretical and empirical research.",

    "abstract": "One of the central tasks in evolutionary biology is to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among species from sequence data, particularly from multilocus data. In the last ten years, many methods have been proposed to use the variance in the gene histories to estimate species trees by explicitly modeling deep coalescence. However, gene flow, another process that may produce gene history variance, has been less studied. In this paper, we propose a simple yet innovative method for species trees estimation in the presence of gene flow. Our method, called STEST (Species Tree Estimation from Speciation Times), constructs species tree estimates from pairwise speciation time or species divergence time estimates. By using methods that estimate speciation times in the presence of gene flow, (for example, M1 (Yang 2010) or SIM3s (Zhu and Yang 2012)), STEST is able to estimate species trees from data subject to gene flow. We develop two methods, called STEST (M1) and STEST (SIM3s), for this purpose. Additionally, we consider the method STEST (M0), which instead uses the M0 method (Yang 2002), a coalescent-based method that does not assume gene flow, to estimate speciation times. It is therefore devised to estimate species trees in the absence of gene flow. Our simulation studies show that STEST (M0) outperforms STEST(M1), STEST (SIM3s) and STEM in terms of estimation accuracy and outperfroms *BEAST in terms of running time when the degree of gene flow is small. STEST (M1) outperforms STEST (M0), STEST (SIM3s), STEM and *BEAST in term of estimation accuracy when the degree of gene flow is large. An empirical data set analyzed by these methods gives species tree estimates that are consistent with the previous results.",

    "abstract": "Principal components analysis on allele frequencies for 14 and 50 populations (from 1K Genomes and ALFRED databases) produced a factor accounting for over half of the variance, which indicates selection pressure on intelligence or genotypic IQ. Very high correlations between this factor and phenotypic IQ, educational achievement were observed (r>0.9 and r>0.8), also after partialling out GDP and the Human Development Index. Regression analysis was used to estimate a genotypic (predicted) IQ also for populations with missing data for phenotypic IQ. Socio-economic indicators (GDP and Human Development Index) failed to predict residuals, not providing evidence for the effects of environmental factors on intelligence. Another analysis revealed that the relationship between IQ and the genotypic factor was not mediated by race, implying that it exists at a finer resolution, a finding which in turn suggests selective pressures postdating sub-continental population splits.\\n\\nGenotypic height and IQ were inversely correlated but this correlation was mostly mediated by race. In at least two cases (Native Americans vs East Asians and Africans vs Papuans) genetic distance inferred from evolutionarily neutral genetic markers contrasts markedly with the resemblance observed for IQ and height increasing alleles.\\n\\nA principal component analysis on a random sample of 20 SNPs revealed two factors representing genetic relatedness due to migrations. However, the correlation between IQ and the intelligence PC was not mediated by them. In fact, the intelligence PC emerged as an even stronger predictor of IQ after entering the \\\"migratory\\\" PCs in a regression, indicating that it represents selection pressure instead of migrational effects.\\n\\nFinally, some observations on the high IQ of Mongoloid people are made which lend support to the \\\"cold winters theory\\\" on the evolution of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Radio telemetry has advanced the field of wildlife biology, especially with the miniaturization of radio-tags. However, the major limitation faced with radio-tagging birds is the size of the animal to which a radio-tag can be attached. We tested how miniature radio-tags affected flight performance and behavior of Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris), possibly the smallest bird species to be fitted with radio-tags. Using eyelash adhesive, we fitted hatch year individuals (n=20 males and 15 females) with faux radio-tags of three sizes varying in mass and antenna length (220mg-12.7cm, 240mg-12.7cm, and 220mg-6.35cm), then filmed the birds in a field aviary to quantify activity budgets. We also estimated flight range using flight simulation models. When the three radio-tag packages were pooled for analysis, the presence of a radio-tag significantly decreased both flight time (-8%) and modeled flight range (-23%) when compared to control birds. However, a multiple comparison analysis between the different packages revealed that there was a significant difference in flight time when the larger radio-tag package (240mg) was attached and no significant difference in flight time when the lighter radio-tag packages (220mg) were attached. Our results are similar to other studies which analyzed the flight time or flight range of birds wearing radio-tags. Therefore, currently available light weight radio-tags ([&le;]220mg) may be a new option to aid in the study of hummingbird biology. Future study should focus upon the additional drag created by the radio-tag and the effects of the lightest radio-tag packages on free ranging birds. These studies would provide additional information to determine the feasibility on the use of radio-tags to study hummingbird biology.",
