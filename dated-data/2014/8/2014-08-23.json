    "abstract": "We describe a novel computational method for estimating the probability that a point mutation at each position in a genome will influence fitness. These fitness consequence (fit-Cons) scores serve as evolution-based measures of potential genomic function. Our approach is to cluster genomic positions into groups exhibiting distinct \\\"fingerprints\\\" based on high-throughput functional genomic data, then to estimate a probability of fitness consequences for each group from associated patterns of genetic polymorphism and divergence. We have generated fitCons scores for three human cell types based on public data from EN-CODE. Compared with conventional conservation scores, fitCons scores show considerably improved prediction power for cis-regulatory elements. In addition, fitCons scores indicate that 4.2-7.5% of nucleotides in the human genome have influenced fitness since the human-chimpanzee divergence, and, in contrast to several recent studies, they suggest that recent evolutionary turnover has had limited impact on the functional content of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports have proposed a new paradigm for obtaining mature somatic cell types from fibroblasts without going through a pluripotent state, by briefly expressing canonical iPSC reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc (abbreviated as OSKM) in cells expanded in lineage differentiation promoting conditions. Here we apply genetic lineage tracing for endogenous Nanog locus and X chromosome reactivation during OSKM induced trans-differentiation, as these molecular events mark final stages for acquisition of induced pluripotency. Remarkably, the majority of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes or neural stem cells derived from mouse fibroblasts via OSKM mediated trans-differentiation ([~]>90%), are attained after transient acquisition of pluripotency, and followed by rapid differentiation. Our findings underscore a molecular and functional coupling between inducing pluripotency and obtaining \\\"trans-differentiated\\\" somatic cells via OSKM induction, and have implications on defining molecular trajectories assumed during different cell reprogramming methods.",

    "abstract": "PCR permits the exponential and sequence-specific amplification of DNA, even from minute starting quantities. PCR is a fundamental step in preparing DNA samples for high-throughput sequencing. However, there are errors associated with PCR-mediated amplification. Here we examine the effects of four important sources of error -- bias, stochasticity, template switches and polymerase errors -- on sequence representation in low-input next-generation sequencing libraries. We designed a pool of diverse PCR amplicons with a defined structure, and then used Illumina sequencing to search for signatures of each process. We further developed quantitative models for each process, and compared predictions of these models to our experimental data. We find that PCR stochasticity is the major force skewing sequence representation after amplification of a pool of unique DNA amplicons. Polymerase errors become very common in later cycles of PCR but have little impact on the overall sequence distribution as they are confined to small copy numbers. PCR template switches are rare and confined to low copy numbers. Our results provide a theoretical basis for removing distortions from high-throughput sequencing data. In addition, our findings on PCR stochasticity will have particular relevance to quantification of results from single cell sequencing, in which sequences are represented by only one or a few molecules.",
