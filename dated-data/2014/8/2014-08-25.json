    "abstract": "Epistasis can make adaptation highly unpredictable, rendering evolutionary trajectories contingent on the chance effects of initial mutations. We used experimental evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify this effect, finding dramatic differences in adaptability between 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 105 evolved clones showed no significant effect of initial genotype on future sequence-level evolution. Instead, reconstruction experiments revealed a consistent pattern of diminishing returns epistasis. Our results suggest that many beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled: they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. Sequence-level adaptation is thus highly stochastic. Nevertheless, fitness evolution is strikingly predictable because differences in adaptability are determined only by global fitness-mediated epistasis, not by the identity of individual mutations.",

    "abstract": "Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been proposed to coordinate neural dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. Despite its potential relevance for understanding healthy and pathological brain function, the standard CFC analysis and physiological interpretation come with fundamental problems. For example, apparent CFC can appear because of spectral correlations due to common non-stationarities that may arise in the total absence of interactions between neural frequency components. To provide a road map towards an improved mechanistic understanding of CFC, we organize the available and potential novel statistical/modeling approaches according to their biophysical interpretability. While we do not provide solutions for all the problems described, we provide a list of practical recommendations to avoid common errors and to enhance the interpretability of CFC analysis.\\n\\nHighlightsFundamental caveats and confounds in the methodology of assessing CFC are discussed.\\n\\nSignificant CFC can be observed without any underlying physiological coupling.\\n\\nNon-stationarity of a time-series leads to spectral correlations interpreted as CFC.\\n\\nWe offer practical recommendations, which can relieve some of the current confounds.\\n\\nFurther theoretical and experimental work is needed to ground the CFC analysis.",

    "abstract": "Snake venom has been hypothesised to have originated and diversified via a process that involves duplication of genes encoding body proteins with subsequent recruitment of the copy to the venom gland, where natural selection acts to develop or increase toxicity. However, gene duplication is known to be a rare event in vertebrate genomes and the recruitment of duplicated genes to a novel expression domain (neofunctionalisation) is an even rarer process that requires the evolution of novel combinations of transcription factor binding sites in upstream regulatory regions. Therefore, whilst this hypothesis concerning the evolution of snake venom is therefore very unlikely and should be regarded with caution, it is nonetheless often assumed to be established fact, hindering research into the true origins of snake venom toxins. To critically evaluate this hypothesis we have generated transcriptomic data for body tissues and salivary and venom glands from five species of venomous and non-venomous reptiles. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis of these data reveals that snake venom does not evolve via the hypothesised process of duplication and recruitment of genes encoding body proteins. Indeed, our results show that many proposed venom toxins are in fact expressed in a wide variety of body tissues, including the salivary gland of non-venomous reptiles and that these genes have therefore been restricted to the venom gland following duplication, not recruited. Thus snake venom evolves via the duplication and subfunctionalisation of genes encoding existing salivary proteins. These results highlight the danger of the elegant and intuitive ?just-so story? in evolutionary biology.",

    "abstract": "Because mutations are mostly deleterious, mutation rates should be reduced by natural selection. However, mutations also provide the raw material for adaptation. Therefore, evolutionary theory suggests that the mutation rate must balance between adaptability - the ability to adapt - and adaptedness - the ability to remain adapted. We model an asexual population crossing a fitness valley and analyze the rate of complex adaptation with and without stress-induced mutagenesis - the increase of mutation rates in response to stress or maladaptation. We show that stress-induced mutagenesis increases the rate of complex adaptation without reducing the population mean fitness, thus breaking the evolutionary trade-off between adaptability and adaptedness. Our theoretical results support the hypothesis that stress-induced mutagenesis promotes adaptation and provide quantitative predictions of the rate of complex adaptation with different mutational strategies.",

    "abstract": "Text mining is a flexible technology that can be applied to numerous different tasks in biology and medicine. We present a system for extracting disease-gene associations from biomedical abstracts. The system consists of a highly efficient dictionary-based tagger for named entity recognition of human genes and diseases, which we combine with a scoring scheme that takes into account co-occurrences both within and between sentences. We show that this approach is able to extract half of all manually curated associations with a false positive rate of only 0.16%. Nonetheless, text mining should not stand alone, but be combined with other types of evidence. For this reason, we have developed the DISEASES resource, which integrates the results from text mining with manually curated disease-gene associations, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies from existing databases. The DISEASES resource is accessible through a user-friendly web interface at http://diseases.jensenlab.org/, where the text-mining software and all associations are also freely available for download.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNext-generation sequencing platforms for measuring digital expression such as RNA-Seq are displacing traditional microarray-based methods in biological experiments. The detection of differentially expressed genes between groups of biological conditions has led to the development of numerous bioinformatics tools, but so far few, exploit the expanded dynamic range afforded by the new technologies. We present edgeRun, an R package that implements an unconditional exact test that is a more powerful version of the exact test in edgeR. This increase in power is especially pronounced for experiments with as few as 2 replicates per condition, for genes with low total expression and with large biological coefficient of variation. In comparison with a panel of other tools, edgeRun consistently captures functionally similar differentially expressed genes.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe package is freely available under the MIT license from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/edgeRun)\\n\\nContactedimont@mail.harvard.edu",

    "abstract": "In the life sciences, many measurement methods yield only the relative abundances of different components in a sample. With such relative---or compositional---data, differential expression needs careful interpretation, and correlation---a statistical workhorse for analyzing pairwise relationships---is an inappropriate measure of association. Using yeast gene expression data we show how correlation can be misleading and present proportionality as a valid alternative for relative data. We show how the strength of proportionality between two variables can be meaningfully and interpretably described by a new statistic {varphi} which can be used instead of correlation as the basis of familiar analyses and visualization methods, including co-expression networks and clustered heatmaps. While the main aim of this study is to present proportionality as a means to analyse relative data, it also raises intriguing questions about the molecular mechanisms underlying the proportional regulation of a range of yeast genes.",
