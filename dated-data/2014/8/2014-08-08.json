    "abstract": "A tandem cell is proposed for DNA sequencing in which an exonuclease enzyme cleaves bases (mononucleotides) from a strand of DNA for identification inside a nanopore. It has two nanopores and three compartments with the structure [cis1, upstream nanopore (UNP), trans1 = cis2, downstream nanopore (DNP), trans2]. The exonuclease is attached to the exit side of UNP in trans1/cis2. A cleaved base cannot regress into cis1 because of the remaining DNA strand in UNP. A profiled electric field over DNP with positive and negative components slows down base translocation through DNP. The proposed structure is modeled with a Fokker-Planck equation and a piecewise solution presented. Results from the model indicate that with probability approaching 1 bases enter DNP in their natural order, are detected without any loss, and do not regress into DNP after progressing into trans2. Sequencing efficiency with a tandem cell would then be determined solely by the level of discrimination among the base types inside DNP.",

    "abstract": "Understanding seasonal cycles of viruses originating in wildlife can provide insight into their likelihood of persistence in animal populations and inform policies to limit spillover to human populations. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is an important zoonotic agent causing seasonal occurrence of avian influenza (AI) in wild birds in temperate areas. Although the seasonality of AIV transmission in tropical birds is largely unknown, peaks of influenza activity in human populations in the tropics coincide with the rainy season. To assess the seasonality of AI in tropical birds, from 2010-14, we sampled 40,099 birds at 32 sites in Central Africa (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, and Gabon) and West Africa (Benin, Cote dIvoire, and Togo). Although AIV was not isolated by egg culture, in Central Africa, detection rates by real-time RT-PCR were 3.57% for passerine songbirds and 8.74% for Anatid ducks. RT-PCR positivity in resident birds increased when Palearctic migrants arrived in Central Africa. At sampling sites with two annual wet seasons, the positive rate in wild birds was greatest during the big rainy season in September - October. This study provides the first evidence that AI is present in Central African birds and identifies environmental factors associated with cases.",

    "abstract": "Neotropical migratory birds are declining across the Western Hemisphere, but conservation efforts have been hampered by the inability to assess where migrants are most limited - the breeding grounds, migratory stopover sites, or wintering areas. A major challenge has been the lack of an efficient, reliable, and broadly applicable method for connecting populations across the annual cycle. Here we show how high-resolution genetic markers can be used to identify populations of a migratory bird, the Wilsons warbler (Cardellina pusilla), at fine enough spatial scales to facilitate assessing regional drivers of demographic trends. By screening 1626 samples using 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from a large pool of candidates ([~]450,000), we identify novel region-specific migratory routes and timetables of migration along the Pacific Flyway. Our results illustrate that high-resolution genetic markers are more reliable, accurate, and amenable to high throughput screening than previously described tracking techniques, making them broadly applicable to large-scale monitoring and conservation of migratory organisms.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of reduced representation libraries obtained through digestion with restriction enzymes - generically known as restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) - is a common strategy to generate genome-wide genotypic and sequence data from eukaryotes. A critical design element of any RAD-seq study is a knowledge of the approximate number of genetic markers that can be obtained for a taxon using different restriction enzymes, as this number determines the scope of a project, and ultimately defines its success. This number can only be directly determined if a reference genome sequence is available, or it can be estimated if the genome size and restriction recognition sequence probabilities are known. However, both scenarios are uncommon for non-model species. Here, we performed systematic in silico surveys of recognition sequences, for diverse and commonly used type II restriction enzymes across the eukaryotic tree of life. Our observations reveal that recognition-sequence frequencies for a given restriction enzyme are strikingly variable among broad eukaryotic taxonomic groups, being largely determined by phylogenetic relatedness. We demonstrate that genome sizes can be predicted from cleavage frequency data obtained with restriction enzymes targeting  neutral elements. Models based on genomic compositions are also effective tools to accurately calculate probabilities of recognition sequences across taxa, and can be applied to species for which reduced-representation data is available (including transcriptomes and  neutral RAD-seq datasets). The analytical pipeline developed in this study, PredRAD (https://github.com/phrh/PredRAD), and the resulting databases constitute valuable resources that will help guide the design of any study using RAD-seq or related methods.",

There is no need to change the solution for several weeks when up to 60 lateral roots per seed can appear.\\n\\nA modification of the two-stage growing technique where the seeds are first suspended in moist air over the cultivating solution to grow primary roots, and then, the primary roots are covered with the cultivating solution to grow lateral roots, was used.\\n\\nThe hypothesis is put forward that primary roots actually need water as a liquid to expel air, as the air is probably preventing the appearance of lateral roots.",
