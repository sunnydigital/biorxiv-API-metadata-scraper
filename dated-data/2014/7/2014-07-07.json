    "abstract": "Cancer genomics has been instrumental to determine the genetic alterations that are predictive of various tumor conditions. However, the majority of these alterations occur at low frequencies, motivating the need to expand the catalogue of cancer signatures. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing alterations, which bear major importance for the understanding of cancer, have not been exhaustively studied yet in the context of recent cancer genome projects. In this article we analyze RNA sequencing data for more than 4000 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, including paired normal samples, to detect recurrent alternative splicing isoform switches in 9 different cancer types. We first investigate whether alternative splicing isoform changes are predictive of tumors by applying a rank-based algorithm based on the reversal of the relative expression of transcript isoforms. We find that consistent alternative splicing isoform changes can separate with high accuracy tumor and normal samples, as well as some cancer subtypes. We then searched for those changes that occur in the most abundant isoform, i.e isoform switches, and are therefore more likely to have a functional impact. In total we detected 244 isoform switches, which are associated to functional pathways that are frequently altered in cancer and also separate tumor and normal samples accurately. We further assessed whether these isoform changes are associated to somatic mutations. Surprisingly, only a few cases appear to have association, including the putative tumor suppressor FBLN2 and the tumor driver MYH11, which show association of an isoform switch to mutations and indels on the alternatively spliced exon. However, the number of observed mutations is in general not sufficient to explain the frequency of the found isoform switches, suggesting that recurrent isoform switching in cancer is mostly independent of somatic mutations. In summary, we present an effective approach to detect novel alternative splicing signatures that are predictive of tumors. Moreover, the same methodology has led to uncover recurrent isoform switches in tumors, which may provide novel prognostic and therapeutic targets.\\n\\nSoftware and data are available at: https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/iso-ktsp and http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1061917",
