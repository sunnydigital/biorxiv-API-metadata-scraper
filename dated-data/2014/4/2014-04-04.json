    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that bind to the 3'-UTR of mRNAs and function mainly in post-transcriptional regulation. MiRNAs have been implicated to play roles in organ development, including that of the pancreas. Many miRNAs, such as miR-375, miR-124, miR-7, miR-21 and miR-221, have been shown to regulate insulin production as well as insulin secretion. However, it is not known whether miRNAs can regulate insulin secretion via the control of intracellular Ca2+ in pancreatic beta cells. In this research, expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs were investigated using RNA-sequencing and microarray analysis in chicken pancreatic nestin-positive progenitor cells and differentiated pancreatic beta cells. A number of miRNAs were up-regulated after differentiation of progenitors into beta cells, which regulate cell signaling pathways to control cell function. miR-223 and miR146a were shown to promote insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells by regulating the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ via the down-regulation of their target genes.",

    "abstract": "The entomopathogenic Fungi comprise a wide range of ecologically diverse species. This group of parasites can be found distributed among all fungal phyla and as well as among the ecologically similar but phylogenetically distinct Oomycetes or water molds, that belong to a different kingdom (Stramenopila). As a group, the entomopathogenic fungi and water molds parasitize a wide range of insect hosts from aquatic larvae in streams to adult insects of high canopy tropical forests. Their hosts are spread among 18 orders of insects, in all developmental stages such as: eggs, larvae, pupae, nymphs and adults exhibiting completely different ecologies. Such assortment of niches has resulted in these parasites evolving a considerable morphological diversity, resulting in enormous biodiversity, much of which remains unknown. Here we gather together a huge amount of records of these entomopathogens to comparing and describe both their morphologies and ecological traits. These findings highlight a wide range of adaptations that evolved following the evolutionary transition to infecting the most diverse and widespread animals on Earth, the insects.",

    "abstract": "Most evolving populations are subdivided into multiple subpopulations connected to each other by varying levels of gene flow. However, how population structure and gene flow (i.e., migration) affect adaptive evolution is not well understood. Here, we studied the impact of migration on asexually reproducing evolving computer programs (digital organisms). We found that digital organisms evolve the highest fitness values at intermediate migration rates, and we tested three hypotheses that could potentially explain this observation: (i) migration promotes passage through fitness valleys, (ii) migration increases genetic variation, and (iii) migration reduces clonal interference through a process called leapfrogging. We found that migration had no appreciable effect on the number of fitness valleys crossed and that genetic variation declined monotonously with increasing migration rates, instead of peaking at the optimal migration rate. However, the number of leapfrogging events, in which a superior beneficial mutation emerges on a genetic background that predates the previously best genotype in the population, did peak at the optimal migration rate. We thus conclude that in structured, asexual populations intermediate migration rates allow for optimal exploration of multiple, distinct fitness peaks, and thus yield the highest long-term adaptive success.",
