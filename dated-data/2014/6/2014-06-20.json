    "abstract": "While reducing the burden of brain disorders remains a top priority of organizations like the World Health Organization and National Institutes of Health (BRAIN, 2013), the development of novel, safe and effective treatments for brain disorders has been slow. In this paper, we describe the state of the science for an emerging technology, real time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) neurofeedback, in clinical neurotherapeutics. We review the scientific potential of rtfMRI and outline research strategies to optimize the development and application of rtfMRI neurofeedback as a next generation therapeutic tool. We propose that rtfMRI can be used to address a broad range of clinical problems by improving our understanding of brain-behavior relationships in order to develop more specific and effective interventions for individuals with brain disorders. We focus on the use of rtfMRI neurofeedback as a clinical neurotherapeutic tool to drive plasticity in brain function, cognition, and behavior. Our overall goal is for rtfMRI to advance personalized assessment and intervention approaches to enhance resilience and reduce morbidity by correcting maladaptive patterns of brain function in those with brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "What does it mean when we say a cells biochemistry is regulated during changes to the phenotype? While there are a plethora of potential mechanisms and contributions to the final outcome, a more tractable approach is to examine the dynamics of mRNA. This way, we can assess the contributions of both known and unknown decay and aggregation processes for maintaining levels of gene product on a gene-by-gene basis. In this extended protocol, drug treatments that target specific cellular functions (termed mechanism disruption) can be used in tandem with mRNA extraction from the polysome to look at the dynamics of mRNA levels associated with transcription and translation at multiple stages during a physiological perturbation. This is accomplished through validating the polysome isolation method in human cells and comparing fractions of mRNA for each experimental treatment at multiple points in time. First, three different drug treatments corresponding to the arrest of various cellular processes are administered to populations of human cells. For each treatment, the transcriptome and translatome are compared directly at different time points by assaying both cell-type specific and non-specific genes. There are two findings of note. First, extraction of mRNA from the polysome and comparison with the transcriptome can yield interesting information about the regulation of cellular mRNA during a functional challenge to the cell. In addition, the conventional application of such drugs to assess mRNA decay is an incomplete picture of how severely challenged or senescent cells regulate mRNA in response. This extended protocol demonstrates how the gene- and process-variable degradation of mRNA might ultimately require investigations into the course-grained dynamics of cellular mRNA, from transcription to ribosome.",

    "abstract": "It is widely appreciated that short tandem repeat (STR) variation underlies substantial phenotypic variation in organisms. Some propose that the high mutation rates of STRs in functional genomic regions facilitate evolutionary adaptation. Despite their high mutation rate, some STRs show little to no variation in populations. One such STR occurs in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene PFT1 (MED25), where it encodes an interrupted polyglutamine tract. Though the PFT1 STR is large ([~]270 bp), and thus expected to be extremely variable, it shows only minuscule variation across A. thaliana strains. We hypothesized that the PFT1 STR is under selective constraint, due to previously undescribed roles in PFT1 function. We investigated this hypothesis using plants expressing transgenic PFT1 constructs with either an endogenous STR or with synthetic STRs of varying length. Transgenic plants carrying the endogenous PFT1 STR generally performed best across adult PFT1-dependent traits, in terms of complementing a pft1 null mutant. In stark contrast, transgenic plants carrying a PFT1 transgene lacking the STR entirely phenocopied a pft1 loss-of-function mutant for flowering time phenotypes, and were generally hypomorphic for other traits, establishing the functional importance of this domain. Transgenic plants carrying various synthetic constructs occupied the phenotypic space between wild-type and pft1-loss-of-function mutants. By varying PFT1 STR length, we discovered that PFT1 can act as either an activator or repressor of flowering in a photoperiod-dependent manner. We conclude that the PFT1 STR is constrained to its approximate wild-type length by its various functional requirements. Our study implies that there is strong selection on STRs not only to generate allelic diversity, but also to maintain certain lengths pursuant to optimal molecular function.",
