    "abstract": "We present a new open-source algorithm, Scalpel, for sensitive and specific discovery of INDELs in exome-capture data. By combining the power of mapping and assembly, Scalpel searches the de Bruijn graph for sequence paths (contigs) that span each exon. The algorithm creates a single path for exons with no INDEL, two paths for an exon with a heterozygous mutation, and multiple paths for more exotic variations. A detailed repeat composition analysis coupled with a self-tuning k-mer strategy allows Scalpel to outperform other state-of-the-art approaches for INDEL discovery. We extensively compared Scalpel with a battery of >10000 simulated and >1000 experimentally validated INDELs between 1 and 100bp against two recent algorithms for INDEL discovery: GATK HaplotypeCaller and SOAPindel. We report anomalies for these tools in their ability to detect INDELs, especially in regions containing near-perfect repeats which contribute to high false positive rates. In contrast, Scalpel demonstrates superior specificity while maintaining high sensitivity. We also present a large-scale application of Scalpel for detecting de novo and transmitted INDELs in 593 families with autistic children from the Simons Simplex Collection. Scalpel demonstrates enhanced power to detect long ([&ge;]20bp) transmitted events, and strengthens previous reports of enrichment for de novo likely gene-disrupting INDEL mutations in children with autism with many new candidate genes. The source code and documentation for the algorithm is available at http://scalpel.sourceforge.net.",

    "abstract": "Third generation single molecule sequencing technology is poised to revolutionize genomics by enabling the sequencing of long, individual molecules of DNA and RNA. These technologies now routinely produce reads exceeding 5,000 basepairs, and can achieve reads as long as 50,000 basepairs. Here we evaluate the limits of single molecule sequencing by assessing the impact of long read sequencing in the assembly of the human genome and 25 other important genomes across the tree of life. From this, we develop a new data-driven model using support vector regression that can accurately predict assembly performance. We also present a novel hybrid error correction algorithm for long PacBio sequencing reads that uses pre-assembled Illumina sequences for the error correction. We apply it several prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, and show it can achieve near-perfect assemblies of small genomes (< 100Mbp) and substantially improved assemblies of larger ones. All source code and the assembly model are available open-source.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STR) variation has been proposed as a major explanatory factor in the heritability of complex traits in humans and model organisms. However, we still struggle to incorporate STR variation into genotype-phenotype maps. Here, we review the promise of STRs in contributing to complex trait heritability, and highlight the challenges that STRs pose due to their repetitive nature. We argue that STR variants are more likely than single nucleotide variants to have epistatic interactions, reiterate the need for targeted assays to accurately genotype STRs, and call for more appropriate statistical methods in detecting STR-phenotype associations. Lastly, somatic STR variation within individuals may serve as a read-out of disease susceptibility, and is thus potentially a valuable covariate for future association studies.",
