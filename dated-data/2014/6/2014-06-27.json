    "abstract": "Tumors often contain multiple, genetically distinct subpopulations of cancerous cells. These so-called subclonal populations are defined by distinct somatic mutations that include point mutations such as single nucleotide variants and small indels - collectively called simple somatic mutations (SSMs) - as well as larger structural changes that result in copy number variations (CNVs). In some cases, the genotype and prevalence of these subpopulations can be reconstructed based on high-throughput, short-read sequencing of DNA in one or more tumor samples. To date, no automated SSM-based subclonal reconstructions have been attempted on WGS data; and CNV-based reconstructions are limited to tumors with two or fewer cancerous subclonal populations and with a small number of CNVs.\\n\\nWe describe a new automated method, PhyloWGS, that can be applied to WGS data from one or more tumor samples to perform subclonal reconstruction based on both CNVs and SSMs. PhyloWGS successfully recovers the composition of mixtures of a highly rearranged TGCA cell line when a CNV-based method fails. On WGS data with average read depth of 40 from five time-series chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, PhyloWGS recovers the same tumor phylogeny previously reconstructed using deep targeted resequencing. To further explore the limits of WGS-based subclonal reconstruction, we ran PhyloWGS on simulated data: PhyloWGS can reliably reconstruct as many as three cancerous subpopulations based on 30-50x coverage WGS data from a single tumor sample with 10s to 1000s of SSMs per subpopulation. At least five cancerous subpopulations can be reconstructed if provided with read depths of 200 or more.\\n\\nPhyloWGS is the first automated method that can be applied to WGS tumor data that accurately reconstructs the frequency, genotype and phylogeny of the subclonal populations based on both SSMs and CNVs. It also provides a principled, automated approach to combining overlapping SSM and CNV data. By demonstrating the utility of PhyloWGS on medium depth WGS data, including from examples with highly rearranged chromosomes, we have greatly expanded the range of tumors for which subclonal reconstruction is possible.",

    "abstract": "In order to take full advantage of next generation genomics data, I need informatics methods to be based on agreed upon formally specified standards that can be implemented easily in a uniform fashion without ambiguity. These standards should be encoded as logical formulae, so that provably correct and efficient decision procedures can be used for query answering and validation. In this paper I present the core of such a standard for sequence data: a collection of definitions of relations that hold between genomic intervals, and an alegbra for performing operations upon these intervals. I show how these relations can be used to extend formalize concepts in the Sequence Ontology (SO).",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection maintains advantageous genetic and phenotypic diversity in populations. When selection acts for long evolutionary periods selected polymorphisms may survive species splits and segregate in present-day populations of different species. Here, we investigated the role of long-term balancing selection in the evolution of protein-coding sequences in the Pan-Homo clade. We sequenced the exome of 20 humans, 20 chimpanzees and 20 bonobos and detected eight coding trans-species polymorphisms (trSNPs) that are shared among the three species and have segregated for approximately 14 million years of independent evolution. While the majority of these trSNPs were found in three genes of the MHC cluster, we also uncovered one coding trSNP (rs12088790) in the gene LAD1. All these trSNPs show clustering of sequences by allele rather than by species and also exhibit other signatures of long-term balancing selection, such as segregating at intermediate frequency and lying in a locus with high genetic diversity. Here we focus on the trSNP in LAD1, a gene that encodes for Ladinin-1, a collagenous anchoring filament protein of basement membrane that is responsible for maintaining cohesion at the dermal-epidermal junction; the gene is also an autoantigen responsible for linear IgA disease. This trSNP results in a missense change (Leucine257Proline) and, besides altering the protein sequence, is associated with changes in gene expression of LAD1.",

    "abstract": "Connecting genetic variation to trait variation is a grand challenge in biology. Natural populations contain a vast reservoir of fascinating and potentially useful variation, but it is unclear if the causal alleles will generally have large enough effects for us to detect. Without knowing the effect sizes or allele frequency of typical variants, it is also unclear what methods will be most successful. Here, we use a multi-parent advanced intercross population (the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource) to map natural variation in Drosophila courtship song traits. Most additive genetic variation in this population can be explained by a modest number of highly resolved QTL. Mapped QTL are universally multiallelic, suggesting that individual genes are \\\"hotspots\\\" of natural variation due to a small target size for major mutations and/or filtering of variation by positive or negative selection. Using quantitative complementation in randomized genetic backgrounds, we provide evidence that one causal allele is harbored in the gene Fhos, making this one of the few genes associated with behavioral variation in any taxon.",

    "abstract": "The causes of individual variability in the length of time between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the development of AIDS are incompletely understood. Here, we present a novel hypothesis: that the relative magnitude of responses to HIV mediated by CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) cells vs. CD4+ T effector (Teff) cells is a critical determinant of variability in AIDS progression rates. We use a simple mathematical model to show that this hypothesis can plausibly explain three qualitatively different outcomes of HIV infection - fast or slow progression to AIDS, and long-term non-progression to AIDS - based on individual variation in underlying T-cell response. This hypothesis also provides a unifying explanation for various other empirical observations, suggesting in particular that both aging and certain dual infections increase the rate of AIDS progression because they increase the strength of the Treg cell response. We discuss potential therapeutic implications of our results.",

    "abstract": "Correlations in neuronal spike times are thought to be key to processing in many neural systems. Many measures have been proposed to summarise these correlations and of these the correlation index is widely used and is the standard in studies of spontaneous retinal activity. We show that this measure has two undesirable properties: it is unbounded above and confounded by firing rate. We list properties needed for a measure to fairly quantify and compare correlations and we propose a novel measure of correlation -- the Spike Time Tiling Coefficient. This coefficient, the correlation index and 33 other measures of correlation of spike times are blindly tested for the required properties on synthetic and experimental data. On the basis of this, we propose a measure (the Spike Time Tiling Coefficient) to replace the correlation index. To demonstrate the benefits of this measure, we re-analyse data from seven key studies which previously used the correlation index to investigate the nature of spontaneous activity. We re-analyse data from {beta}2(KO) and {beta}2(TG) mutants, mutants lacking connexin isoforms and also the age-dependent changes in wild type and {beta}2(KO) correlations. Re-analysis of the data using the proposed measure can significantly change the conclusions. It leads to better quantification of correlations and therefore better inference from the data. We hope that the proposed measure will have wide applications, and will help clarify the role of activity in retinotopic map formation.",
