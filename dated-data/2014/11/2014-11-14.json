    "abstract": "Functional metagenomic analyses commonly involve a normalization step, where measured levels of genes or pathways are converted into relative abundances. Here, we demonstrate that this normalization scheme introduces marked biases both across and within human microbiome samples and systematically identify various sample-and gene-specific properties that contribute to these biases. We introduce an alternative normalization paradigm, MUSiCC, which combines universal single-copy genes with machine learning methods to correct these biases and to obtain a more accurate and biologically meaningful measure of gene abundances. Finally, we demonstrate that MUSiCC significantly improves downstream discovery of functional shifts in the microbiome.\\n\\nMUSiCC is available at http://elbo.gs.washington.edu/software.html.",

    "abstract": "Anatomically modern humans (AMHs) left Africa {small tilde}60,000 years ago, marking the first of multiple dispersal events by AMH between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The southern dispersal route (SDR) out of Africa (OOA) posits that early AMHs crossed the Bab el-Mandeb strait from the Horn of Africa into what is now Yemen and followed the coast of the Indian Ocean into eastern Eurasia. If AMHs followed the SDR and left modern descendants in situ, Yemeni populations should retain old autochthonous mitogenome lineages. Alternatively, if AMHs did not follow the SDR or did not leave modern descendants in the region, only young autochthonous lineages will remain as evidence of more recent dispersals. We sequenced 113 whole mitogenomes from multiple Yemeni regions with a focus on haplogroups M, N, and L3(xM,N) as they are considered markers of the initial OOA migrations. We performed Bayesian evolutionary analyses to generate time-measured phylogenies calibrated by Neanderthal and Denisovan mitogenome sequences in order to determine the age of Yemeni-specific clades in our dataset. Our results indicate that the M1, N1, and L3(xM,N) sequences in Yemen are the product of recent migration from Africa and western Eurasia. Although these data suggest that modern Yemeni mitogenomes are not markers of the original OOA migrants, we hypothesize that recent population dynamics may obscure any genetic signature of an ancient SDR migration.",

    "abstract": "Gire et al. (Science 345:1369-1372, 2014) analyzed 81 complete genomes sampled from the 2014 Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak and reported \\\"rapid accumulation of [...] genetic variation\\\" and a substitution rate that was \\\"roughly twice as high within the 2014 outbreak as between outbreaks.\\\" These findings have received widespread attention, and many have perceived Gire et al. (2014)s results as implying rapid adaptation of EBOV to humans during the current outbreak. Here, we argue that, on the contrary, sequence divergence in EBOV is rather limited, and that the currently available data contain no robust signal of particularly rapid evolution or adaptation to humans. The doubled substitution rate can be attributed entirely to the application of a molecular-clock model to a population of sequences with minimal divergence and segregating polymorphisms. Our results highlight how subtle technical aspects of sophisticated evolutionary analysis methods may result in highly-publicized, misconstrued statements about an ongoing public health crisis.",

    "abstract": "We studied the V exons of 14 rodent species obtained from whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets. Compared to other mammals, we found an increase in the number of immunoglobulin (IG) V genes in the heavy (IGH) and kappa chain (IGK) loci. We provide evidence for a reduction genes in lambda chain (IGL) locus, disappearing entirely in one of the species(Dipodomys ordii). We show relationships amongst the V genes of the T-cell receptors (TR) found in primates, possessing ortholog sequences between them. As compared with other mammals, there is an increase in the number of TRAV genes within rodents. Such an increase within this locus is caused by duplication events involving a few putative V genes. This duplication phenomenon does not occur in the TRBV locus. In those species that underwent an expansion of TRAV genes, we found that they also have a correspondingly larger number of MHC Class I genes. The results suggest that selective pressures have conditioned the expansion of V genomic repertoire the TRA, IGK and IGH loci during the diversification process of rodents.",
