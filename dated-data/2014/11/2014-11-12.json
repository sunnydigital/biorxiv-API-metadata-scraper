    "abstract": "We present an open-source visual-analytics web platform, Ginkgo (http://qb.cshl.edu/ginkgo), for the interactive analysis and quality assessment of single-cell copy-number alterations. Ginkgo automatically constructs copy-number profiles of individual cells from mapped reads, as well as constructing phylogenetic trees of related cells. We validate Ginkgo by reproducing the results of five major studies and examine the data characteristics of three commonly used single-cell amplification techniques to conclude DOP-PCR to be the most consistent for CNV analysis.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the genomic regions that regulate transcription remains an important open problem. We have recently shown that global run-on and sequencing (GRO-seq) with enrichment for 5'-capped RNAs reveals patterns of divergent transcription that accurately mark active transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs), including enhancers and promoters. Here, we demonstrate that active TREs can be identified with comparable accuracy by applying sensitive machine-learning methods to standard GRO-seq and PRO-seq data, allowing TREs to be assayed together with transcription levels, elongation rates, and other transcriptional features, in a single experiment. Our method, called discriminative Regulatory Element detection from GRO-seq (dREG), summarizes GRO-seq read counts at multiple scales and uses support vector regression to predict active TREs. The predicted TREs are strongly enriched for marks associated with functional elements, including H3K27ac, transcription factor binding sites, eQTLs, and GWAS-associated SNPs. Using dREG, we survey TREs in eight cell types and provide new insights into global patterns of TRE assembly and function.",

    "abstract": "Species showing repeated evolution of similar traits can help illuminate the molecular and developmental basis of diverging traits and specific adaptations. Following the last glacial period, dwarfism and specialized bottom feeding morphology evolved rapidly in several landlocked Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) populations in Iceland. To initiate study of the genetic divergence between small benthic morphs and larger morphs with limnetic morphotype, we conducted an RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of developing charr. We sequenced mRNA from whole embryos at four stages in early development of two stocks with contrasting morphologies, the small benthic (SB) charr from Lake Thingvallavatn and Holar aquaculture (AC) charr.\\n\\nThe data reveal significant differences in expression of several biological pathways during charr development. There was also an expression difference between SB- and AC-charr in genes involved in energy metabolism and blood coagulation genes. We confirmed expression difference of five genes in whole embryos with qPCR, including lysozyme and natterin like which was previously identified as a fish-toxin of a lectin family that may be a putative immunopeptide. We also verified differential expression of 7 genes in developing heads, that associated consistently with benthic v.s. limnetic craniofacial morphology (studied in 4 morphs total). Comparison of Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies reveals extensive genetic differentiation between the SB- and AC-charr (60 fixed SNPs and around 1300 differing by more than 50% in frequency). In SB-charr the high frequency derived SNPs are in genes related to translation and oxidative processes. Curiously, three derived alleles in the otherwise conserved 12s and 16s mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes are found in benthic charr.\\n\\nThe data implicate multiple genes and molecular pathways in divergence of small benthic charr and/or the response of aquaculture charr to domestication. Functional, genetic and population genetic studies on more freshwater and anadromous populations are needed to confirm the specific loci and mutations relating to specific ecological or domestication traits in Arctic charr.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrate polymers are ubiquitous in biological systems and their roles are highly diverse, ranging from energy storage over mechanical stabilisation to mediating cell-cell or cell-protein interactions. The functional diversity is mirrored by a chemical diversity that results from the high flexibility of how different sugar monomers can be arranged into linear, branched or cyclic polymeric structures. Mathematical models describing biochemical processes on polymers are faced with various difficulties. First, polymer-active enzymes are often specific to some local configuration within the polymer but are indifferent to other features. That is they are potentially active on a large variety of different chemical compounds, meaning that polymers of different size and structure simultaneously compete for enzymes. Second, especially large polymers interact with each other and form water-insoluble phases that restrict or exclude the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes. This heterogeneity of the reaction system has to be taken into account by explicitly considering processes at the, often complex, surface of the polymer matrix. We review recent approaches to theoretically describe polymer biochemical systems. All attempts address a particular challenge, which we discuss in more detail. We emphasise a recent attempt which draws novel analogies between polymer biochemistry and statistical thermodynamics and illustrate how this parallel leads to novel insights about non-uniform polymer reactant mixtures. Finally, we discuss the future challenges of the young and growing field of theoretical polymer biochemistry.",
