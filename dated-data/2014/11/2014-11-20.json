    "abstract": "Interspecific gene flow is pervasive throughout the tree of life. Although detecting gene flow between populations has been facilitated by new analytical approaches, determining the timing and geography of hybridization has remained difficult, particularly for historical gene flow. A geographically explicit phylogenetic approach is needed to determine the ancestral population overlap. In this study, we performed population genetic analyses, species delimitation, simulations, and a recently developed approach of species tree diffusion to infer the phylogeographic history, timing and geographic extent of gene flow in the Sceloporus spinosus group. The two species in this group, S. spinosus and S. horridus, are distributed in eastern and western portions of Mexico, respectively, but populations of these species are sympatric in the southern Mexican highlands. We generated data consisting of three mitochondrial genes and eight nuclear loci for 148 and 68 individuals, respectively. We delimited six lineages in this group, but found strong evidence of mito-nuclear discordance in sympatric populations of S. spinosus and S. horridus owing to mitochondrial introgression. We used coalescent simulations to differentiate ancestral gene flow from secondary contact, but found mixed support for these two models. Bayesian phylogeography indicated more than 60% range overlap between ancestral S. spinosus and S. horridus populations since the time of their divergence. Isolation-migration analyses, however, revealed near-zero levels of gene flow between these ancestral populations. Interpreting results from both simulations and empirical data indicate that despite a long history of sympatry among these two species, gene flow in this group has only recently occurred.",

    "abstract": "The human and chimpanzee X chromosomes are less divergent than expected based on autosomal divergence. This has led to a controversial hypothesis proposing a unique role of the X chromosome in human-chimpanzee speciation. We study incomplete lineage sorting patterns between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas to show that this low divergence is entirely due to megabase-sized regions comprising one-third of the X chromosome, where polymorphism in the human-chimpanzee ancestral species was severely reduced. Background selection can explain 10% of this reduction at most. Instead, we show that several strong selective sweeps in the ancestral species can explain this reduction of diversity in the ancestor. We also report evidence of population specific sweeps in extant humans that overlap the regions of low diversity in the ancestral species. These regions further correspond to chromosomal sections shown to be devoid of Neanderthal introgression into modern humans. This suggests that the same X-linked regions that undergo selective sweeps are among the first to form reproductive barriers between diverging species. We hypothesize that meiotic drive is the underlying mechanism causing these two observations.\\n\\nAuthors' SummaryBecause the speciation events that leads to human, chimpanzee and gorilla were close in time, their genetic relationship of these species varies along the genome. While human and chimpanzee species are most closely related, 15% of the human genome is more closely related to the gorilla genome than the chimpanzee genome, a phenomenon called incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). The amount and distribution of ILS can be predicted using population genetics theory, and is affected by demography and selection in the ancestral populations. It was previously reported that the X chromosome, in contrast to autosomes, is deprived of ILS, and this givies rise to controversial theories about the speciation event that splits humans and chimpanzees. Using a full genome alignment of the X chromosome, we show that this deprivation of ILS affects only one third of the chromosome. These regions also show reduced diversity in the extant populations of human and great apes, and coincide with regions devoid of Neanderthal introgression. We propose that these regions are targets of selection and that they played a role in the formation of reproductive barriers.",

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing of cellular RNA is making it possible to characterize genes and alternative splicing in unprecedented detail. However, designing bioinformatics tools to capture splicing variation accurately has proven difficult. Current programs find major isoforms of a gene but miss finer splicing variations, or are sensitive but highly imprecise. We present CLASS, a novel open source tool for accurate genome-guided transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq reads. CLASS employs a splice graph to represent a gene and its splice variants, combined with a linear program to determine an accurate set of exons and efficient splice graph-based transcript selection algorithms. When compared against reference programs, CLASS had the best overall accuracy and could detect up to twice as many splicing events with precision similar to the best reference program. Notably, it was the only tool that produced consistently reliable transcript models for a wide range of applications and sequencing strategies, including very large data sets and ribosomal RNA-depleted samples. Lightweight and multi-threaded, CLASS required <3GB RAM and less than one day to analyze a 350 million read set, and is an excellent choice for transcriptomics studies, from clinical RNA sequencing, to alternative splicing analyses, and to the annotation of new genomes.",

    "abstract": "The standard view of adaptation to larval crowding in fruitflies, built on results from 25 years of multiple experimental evolution studies on D. melanogaster, is that enhanced competitive ability evolves primarily through increased larval feeding and foraging rate, at the cost of efficiency of food conversion to biomass, and increased larval tolerance to nitrogenous wastes. These results, moreover, were at odds from the predictions of classical K-selection theory, notably the expectation that selection at high density should result in the increase of efficiency of conversion of food to biomass, and were better interpreted through the lens of -selection. We show here that populations of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta subjected to extreme larval crowding evolve greater competitive ability and pre-adult survivorship at high density primarily through a combination of reduced larval duration, faster attainment of minimum critical size for pupation, greater time efficiency of food conversion to biomass, increased pupation height with a relatively small role of increased urea/ammonia tolerance, if at all. This is a very different suite of traits than that seen to evolve under similar selection in D. melanogaster and seems to be closer to the expectations from the canonical theory of K-selection. We discuss possible reasons for these differences in results across the three species. Overall, the results reinforce the view that our understanding of the evolution of competitive ability in fruitflies needs to be more nuanced than before, with an appreciation that there may be multiple evolutionary routes through which higher competitive ability can be attained.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) affects plant development and defense responses. Recent studies revealed that SA is also involved in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, but the details of this regulation remain to be explored. Here, we use in silico Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) with published microarray data to construct a whole-cell simulation model, including 23 pathways, 259 reactions and 172 metabolites, to predict the alterations in flux of major sphingolipid species after treatment with exogenous SA. This model predicts significant changes in fluxes of certain sphingolipid species after SA treatment, changes that likely trigger downstream physiological and phenotypic effects. To validate the simulation, we used isotopic non-stationary metabolic flux analysis to measure sphingolipid contents and turnover rate in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with SA or the SA analog benzothiadiazole (BTH). The results show that both SA and BTH affect sphingolipid metabolism by not only concentration of certain species, but also the optimal flux distribution and turnover rate of sphingolipid contents. Our strategy allows us to formally estimate sphingolipid fluxes on a short time scale and gives us a systemic view of the effect of SA on sphingolipid homeostasis.",
