Here we focus on characterizing the human brains large-scale network organization, as it provides an overall framework for the organization of all other levels. We developed a highly principled approach to identify cortical network communities at the level of functional systems, calibrating our community detection algorithm using extremely well-established sensory and motor systems as guides. Building on previous network partitions, we replicated and expanded upon well-known and recently identified networks, including several higher-order cognitive networks such as a left-lateralized language network. We expanded these cortical networks to subcortex, revealing 358 highly organized subcortical parcels that take part in forming whole-brain functional networks. Notably, the identified subcortical parcels are similar in number to a recent estimate of the number of cortical parcels (360). This whole-brain network atlas - released as an open resource for the neuroscience community - places all brain structures across both cortex and subcortex into a single large-scale functional framework, with the potential to facilitate a variety of studies investigating large-scale functional networks in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "There is much debate about the mechanisms by which molecular motions influence catalysis in enzymes. This work investigates the connection between stochastic protein dynamics and function for the enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) in wild-type (WT) form, and three variants that features several mutations that are distal from the active site. Previous biophysical studies have suggested that conformational exchange between a  major active and a  minor inactive state on millisecond time scales plays a key role in catalysis for CypA. Here this hypothesis was addressed by a variety of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation techniques. The simulations reproduce X-ray crystallography derived evidence for a shift in populations of major and minor active site conformations between the wild-type and mutant forms. Strikingly, exchange between these active site conformations occurs at a rate that is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed. Further analyses indicate that the minor active site conformation is catalytically impaired, and that decreased catalytic activity of the mutants may be explained by changes in Phe113 motions on a ns-s time scale. Therefore previously described millisecond time scale motions may not be necessary to explain allosteric effects in CypA mutants.",

    "abstract": "For long-read sequencing applications, shearing of DNA is a significant issue as it limits the read-lengths generated by sequencing. During extraction and storage of DNA the DNA polymers are susceptible to physical and chemical shearing. In particular, the mechanisms of physical shearing are poorly understood in most laboratories as they are of little relevance to commonly used short-read sequencing technologies. This study draws upon lessons learned in a diverse set of research fields to create a comprehensive theoretical framework for obtaining high molecular weight DNA (HMW-DNA) to support improved quality management in laboratories and biobanks for long-read sequencing applications.\\n\\nUnder common laboratory conditions physical and chemical shearing yields DNA fragments of 5-35 kilobases (kb) in length. This fragment length is sufficient for DNA sequencing using short-read technologies but for Nanopore sequencing, linked reads and single molecular real time sequencing (SMRT) poorly preserved DNA will limit the length of the reads generated.\\n\\nThe shearing process can be divided into physical and chemical shearing which generates different patterns of fragmentation. Exposure to physical shearing creates a characteristic fragment length where the main cause of shearing is shear stress induced by turbulence. The characteristic fragment length is several thousand base pairs longer than the reads produced by short-read sequencing as the shear stress imposed on short DNA fragments is insufficient to shear the DNA. This characteristic length can be measured using gel electrophoresis or instruments for DNA fragment analysis. Chemical shearing generates randomly distributed fragment lengths visible as a smear of DNA below the peak fragment length. By measuring the peak of the DNA fragment length distribution and the proportion of very short DNA fragments, both sources of shearing can be measured using commonly used laboratory techniques, providing a suitable quantification of DNA integrity of DNA for sequencing with long-read technologies.",

Recent gene-editing technologies have provided new opportunities to characterize essential genes. Here, we present an integrated analysis for comprehensively and systematically elucidating the genetic and regulatory characteristics of human essential genes. First, essential genes act as \\\"hubs\\\" in protein-protein interactions networks, in chromatin structure, and in epigenetic modifications, thus are essential for cell growth. Second, essential genes represent the conserved biological processes across species although gene essentiality changes itself. Third, essential genes are import for cell development due to its discriminate transcription activity in both embryo development and oncogenesis. In addition, we develop an interactive web server, the Human Essential Genes Interactive Analysis Platform (HEGIAP) (http://sysomics.com/HEGIAP/), which integrates abundant analytical tools to give a global, multidimensional interpretation of gene essentiality. Our study provides a new view for understanding human essential genes.",

    "abstract": "Most neuroscientific studies have focused on task-evoked activations (activity amplitudes at specific brain locations), providing limited insight into the functional relationships between separate brain locations. Task-state functional connectivity (FC) - statistical association between brain activity time series during task performance moves beyond task-evoked activations by quantifying functional interactions during tasks. However, many task-state FC studies do not remove the first-order effect of taskevoked activations prior to estimating task-state FC. It has been argued that this results in the ambiguous inference \\\"likely active or interacting during the task\\\", rather than the intended inference \\\"likely interacting during the task\\\". Utilizing a neural mass computational model, we verified that task-evoked activations substantially and inappropriately inflate task-state FC estimates, especially in functional MRI (fMRI) data. Various methods attempting to address this problem have been developed, yet the efficacies of these approaches have not been systematically assessed. We found that most standard approaches for fitting and removing mean task-evoked activations were unable to correct these inflated correlations. In contrast, methods that flexibly fit mean task-evoked response shapes effectively corrected the inflated correlations without reducing effects of interest. Results with empirical fMRI data confirmed the models predictions, revealing activation-induced task-state FC inflation for both Pearson correlation and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) approaches. These results demonstrate that removal of mean task-evoked activations using an approach that flexibly models task-evoked response shape is an important preprocessing step for valid estimation of task-state FC.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIComputational model shows task inflation of functional connectivity estimates\\nC_LIO_LIHemodynamic responses cause task activations to further inflate estimates\\nC_LIO_LIStandard approaches to remove task activations leave many false positives\\nC_LIO_LIMethods that flexibly fit hemodynamic response shape effectively correct inflation\\nC_LIO_LICorrection of functional connectivity inflation verified with empirical fMRI data\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We investigated age-related differences in syntactic comprehension in young and older adults. Most previous research found no evidence of age-related decline in syntactic processing. We investigated elementary syntactic comprehension of minimal sentences (e.g. I cook), minimizing the influence of working memory. We also investigated the contribution of semantic processing by comparing sentences containing real verbs (e.g. I cook) versus pseudoverbs (e.g. I spuff). We measured the speed and accuracy of detecting syntactic agreement errors (e.g. I cooks, I spuffs). We found that older adults were slower and less accurate than younger adults in detecting syntactic agreement errors for both real and pseudoverb sentences, suggesting there is age-related decline in syntactic comprehension. The age-related decline in accuracy was smaller for the pseudoverb sentences, and the decline in speed was larger for the pseudoverb sentences, compared to real verb sentences. We suggest that syntactic comprehension decline is stronger in the absence of semantic information, which causes older adults to produce slower responses in order to make more accurate decisions. In line with these findings, performance for older adults was positively related to a measure of processing speed capacity. Taken together, we found evidence that elementary syntactic processing abilities decline in healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "Healthy ageing does not affect all features of language processing equally. In this study, we investigated the effects of ageing on different processes involved in fluent sentence production, a complex task that requires the successful execution and coordination of multiple processes. In Experiment 1, we investigated age-related effects on the speed of syntax selection using a syntactic priming paradigm. Both young and older adults produced target sentences quicker following syntactically related primes compared to unrelated primes, indicating that syntactic facilitation effects are preserved with age. In Experiment 2, we investigated age-related effects in syntactic planning and lexical retrieval using a planning scope paradigm: participants described moving picture displays designed to elicit sentences with either initial coordinate or simple noun phrases and, on half of the trials, the second picture was previewed. Without preview, both age groups were slower to initiate sentences with larger coordinate phrases, suggesting a similar phrasal planning scope. However, age-related differences did emerge relating to the preview manipulation: while young adults displayed speed benefits of preview in both phrase conditions, older adults only displayed speed preview benefits within the initial phrase (coordinate condition). Moreover, preview outside the initial phrase (simple condition) caused older adults to become significantly more error-prone. Thus, while syntactic planning scope appears unaffected by ageing, older adults do appear to encounter problems with managing the activation and integration of lexical items into syntactic structures. Taken together, our findings indicate that healthy ageing disrupts the lexical, but not the syntactic, processes involved in sentence production.",

    "abstract": "Auditory stimulus reconstruction is a technique that finds the best approximation of the acoustic stimulus from the population of evoked neural activity. Reconstructing speech from the human auditory cortex creates the possibility of a speech neuroprosthetic to establish a direct communication with the brain and has been shown to be possible in both overt and covert conditions. However, the low quality of the reconstructed speech has severely limited the utility of this method for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we combined the recent advances in deep learning with the latest innovations in speech synthesis technologies to reconstruct closed-set intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex. We investigated the dependence of reconstruction accuracy on linear and nonlinear (deep neural network) regression methods and the acoustic representation that is used as the target of reconstruction, including auditory spectrogram and speech synthesis parameters. In addition, we compared the reconstruction accuracy from low and high neural frequency ranges. Our results show that a deep neural network model that directly estimates the parameters of a speech synthesizer from all neural frequencies achieves the highest subjective and objective scores on a digit recognition task, improving the intelligibility by 65% over the baseline method which used linear regression to reconstruct the auditory spectrogram. These results demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning and speech synthesis algorithms for designing the next generation of speech BCI systems, which not only can restore communications for paralyzed patients but also have the potential to transform human-computer interaction technologies.",

We simultaneously measured excitatory and inhibitory neurons in posterior parietal cortex of mice judging multisensory stimuli. Surprisingly, excitatory and inhibitory neurons were equally selective for the animals choice, both at the single cell and population level. Further, both cell types exhibited similar changes in selectivity and temporal dynamics during learning, paralleling behavioral improvements.

    "abstract": "The clock of life ticks as fast as how efficiently proteins could perform their functional dynamics. Protein complexes execute functions via several large-scale intrinsic motions across multiple conformational states, which occur at a timescale of nano-to milliseconds for well-folded proteins. Computationally expensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been the only theoretical tool to time and size these motions, though barely to their slowest ends. Here, we convert a simple elastic network model (ENM), which takes a few seconds (ubiquitin) to hours (ribosome) for the analysis, into a molecular timer and sizer to gauge the slowest functional motions of proteins. Quasi-harmonic analysis, fluctuation-profile matching (FPM) and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem (WKT) are used to define the \\\"time-periods\\\", t, for anharmonic principal components (PCs) which are validated by NMR order parameters. The PCs with their respective \\\"time-periods\\\" are mapped to the eigenvalues ({lambda}ENM) of the corresponding ENM modes. Thus, the power laws t(ns) = 86.9{lambda}ENM-1.9 and {sigma}2([A]2) = 46.1 {lambda}ENM-2.5 are established allowing the characterization of the time scales of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-solved conformers, crystallographic anisotropic displacement parameters, and important ribosomal motions, as well as motional sizes of the latter.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe time scale of biological processes is governed by protein functional dynamics that often corresponds to the largest conformational spread and the longest time scales among all possible motions. Current simulation methodologies cannot reach the slowest, often functional, motions especially for supramolecular machineries. Borrowing the spring-bead model used in polymer physics since 60s, the efficient elastic network model (ENM), introduced in 90s, captured all modes of protein motions but largely underestimated the time scales of slowest modes due to its harmonic approximation.\\n\\nHere we map water-damped modes sampled by MD simulations to corresponding ones in ENM and thereby establish 2 power laws that describe the authentic time scales and sizes for the slowest anharmonic modes as functions of ENM eigenvalues. With that, we adequately describe the sizes and time scales for three proteins, confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and ribosome that contains ~0.2 million heavy atoms (~ 20 thousands coarse-grained nodes).",

While the general organization of the vTA complex has been mapped, the individual roles of these proteins, and how they coordinate to activate late gene promoters, remains largely unknown. Here, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of the conserved residues in ORF18, which is a highly interconnected vTA component. Surprisingly, the mutants were largely selective for disrupting the interaction with ORF30 but not the other three ORF18 binding partners. Furthermore, disrupting the ORF18-ORF30 interaction weakened the vTA complex as a whole, and an ORF18 point mutant that failed to bind ORF30 was unable to complement an ORF18 null virus. Thus, contacts between individual vTAs are critical, as even small disruptions in this complex result in profound defects in KSHV late gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Linked-read sequencing provides long-range information on short-read sequencing data by barcoding reads originating from the same DNA molecule, and can improve the detection and breakpoint identification for structural variants (SVs). We present LinkedSV for SV detection on linked-read sequencing data. LinkedSV considers barcode overlapping and enriched fragment endpoints as signals to detect large SVs, while it leverages read depth, paired-end signals and local assembly to detect small SVs. Benchmarking studies demonstrates that LinkedSV outperforms existing tools, especially on exome data and on somatic SVs with low variant allele frequencies. We demonstrate clinical cases where LinkedSV identifies disease causal SVs from linked-read exome sequencing data missed by conventional exome sequencing, and show examples where LinkedSV identifies SVs missed by high-coverage long-read sequencing. In summary, LinkedSV can detect SVs missed by conventional short-read and long-read sequencing approaches, and may resolve negative cases from clinical genome/exome sequencing studies.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic genes comprise exons and introns thus requiring the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNAs to enable protein biosynthesis. U2 and U12 spliceosomes catalyze this step by recognizing motifs on the transcript in order to remove the introns. A process which is dependent on precise definition of exon-intron borders by splice sites, which are consequently highly conserved across species. Only very few combinations of terminal dinucleotides are frequently observed at intron ends, dominated by the canonical GT-AG splice sites on the DNA level.\\n\\nHere we investigate the occurrence of diverse combinations of dinucleotides at predicted splice sites. Analyzing 121 plant genome sequences based on their annotation revealed strong splice site conservation across species, annotation errors, and true biological divergence from canonical splice sites. The frequency of non-canonical splice sites clearly correlates with their divergence from canonical ones indicating either an accumulation of probably neutral mutations, or evolution towards canonical splice sites. Strong conservation across multiple species and non-random accumulation of substitutions in splice sites indicate a functional relevance of non-canonical splice sites. The average composition of splice sites across all investigated species is 98.7% for GT-AG, 1.2% for GC-AG, 0.06% for AT-AC, and 0.09% for minor non-canonical splice sites. RNA-Seq data sets of 35 species were incorporated to validate non-canonical splice site predictions through gaps in sequencing reads alignments and to demonstrate the expression of affected genes. We conclude that bona fide non-canonical splice sites are present and appear to be functionally relevant in most plant genomes, if at low abundance.",

Yet little is known about the underlying complex dynamics that leads to such a single \\\"correct\\\" solution. Observing mutations in fine detail along the adaptation trajectory is necessary for understanding this phenomenon. We studied coadaptation between E. coli and a common artificial plasmid, pBR322, in a continuous turbidostat culture. To obtain a high resolution picture of early adaptive events, we used a highly sensitive duplex sequencing strategy to directly observe and track mutations with frequencies undetectable with conventional methods. The observed highly reproducible trajectories are governed by clonal interference and show rapid increases in the frequencies of beneficial mutations controlling plasmid replication followed by a profound diversity crash corresponding to the emergence of chromosomal variants. To the best of our knowledge our study represents the first comprehensive assessment of adaptive processes at a very fine level of resolution. Our work highlights the hidden complexity of coadaptation, and provides an experimental and theoretical foundation for future studies.",

We validate our findings with 32 blood samples collected from different patients covering a wide spectrum of anemia and subsequently, compare with standard pathological results measured using a hematology analyzer. POC based Hgb estimates are correlated with the pathological gold standard estimates of Hgb levels (r = 0.909), and the POC test method yielded similar sensitivity and specificity for detecting mild anemia (n = 8) (<11 g/dl) (sensitivity: 87.5%, specificity: 100 %) and for severe anemia (n = 3) (<7 g/dl) (sensitivity: 100 %, specificity: 100 %). The estimated Hgb levels are, within 1.5 g/dl from the pathological estimate, for 91 % of the blood samples.

    "abstract": "One of the key questions in biology is whether all cells of a \"cell type\" have more or less the same phenotype, especially with relation to non-imprinted autosomal loci. Recent studies point to differential allelic expression of autosomal genes being a prevalent phenomenon responsible to confer phenotypic variability at individual cell level. However, most studies have been carried out in actively transcribing cells. Here we display cellular mosaicism arising from differential allelic expression for the cell surface glycoprotein in the enucleated RBCs. We studied the expression of the A and B histo-blood group antigens encoded by the co-dominant alleles in individual RBCs using immunofluorescence. We assessed the relative levels of the co-dominant alleles IA and IB in 2512 RBC from 24 individuals with AB blood group using Cy3- and FITC- tagged antibodies. Quantification of individual fluorescence intensities from each cell and test of their normal distribution revealed that contrary to the general belief that all RBC in AB individuals express both antigens in comparable amounts, they segregated into 4 groups: showing normal distribution for both antigens, either antigen, and neither antigen; the deviation from normal distribution could not be correlated to maternal/paternal origin, thus appear to be stochastic. Surprisingly, very few people showed any correlation between the amounts of these two antigens on RBC. In fact, the ratio of antigen A to B in the entire set of samples spanned over 5 orders of magnitude. This variability in amount of the antigens A and/or B, combined with a lack of correlation between the amounts of these two antigens resulted in unique staining patterns for RBC, generating widespread mosaicism in the RBC population of AB blood group individuals.",

    "abstract": "SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTAlstrom syndrome is an autosomal recessive obesity ciliopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALMS1 gene. In addition to multi-organ dysfunction, such as cardiomyopathy, retinal degeneration, and renal dysfunction, the disorder is characterized by high rates of obesity, insulin resistance and early onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To investigate mechanisms linking disease phenotypes we generated a loss-of-function deletion of alms1 in the zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9. We demonstrate conserved phenotypic effects including cardiac defects, retinal degeneration, and metabolic deficits that included propensity for obesity and fatty livers in addition to hyperinsulinemia and glucose response defects. Gene expression changes in {beta}-cells isolated from alms1-/- mutants revealed changes consistent with insulin hyper-secretion and glucose sensing failure, which were also identified in cultured murine {beta}-cells lacking Alms1. These data present a zebrafish model to assess etiology and new secretory pathway defects underlying Alstrom syndrome-associated metabolic phenotypes. Given the hyperinsulinemia and reduced glucose sensitivity in these animals we also propose the alms1 loss-of-function mutant as a monogenic model for studying T2DM phenotypes.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThese data comprise a thorough characterization of a zebrafish model of Alstrom syndrome, a human obesity syndrome caused by loss-of-function deletions in a single gene, ALMS1. The high rates of obesity and insulin resistance found in these patients suggest this disorder as a single-gene model for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), a disorder caused by a variety of environmental and genetic factors in the general population. We identify a propensity for obesity, excess lipid storage, loss of {beta}-cells in islets, and hyperinsulinemia in larval and adult stages of zebrafish alms1 mutants. We isolated {beta}-cells from the alms1 mutants and compared the gene expression profiles from RNASeq datasets to identify molecular pathways that may contribute to the loss of {beta}-cells and hyperinsulinemia. The increase in genes implicated in generalized pancreatic secretion, insulin secretion, and glucose transport suggest potential {beta}-cell exhaustion as a source of {beta}-cell loss and excess larval insulin. We propose this mutant as a new genetic tool for understanding the metabolic failures found in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",

    "abstract": "Domoic acid (DA) is an excitatory neurotoxin produced by marine algae and responsible for Amnesiac Shellfish Poisoning in humans. Current regulatory limits (~0.075-0.1 mg/kg/day) protect against acute toxicity, but recent studies suggest that the chronic consumption of DA below the regulatory limit may produce subtle neurotoxicity in adults, including decrements in memory. As DA-algal blooms are increasing in both severity and frequency, we sought to better understand the effects of chronic DA exposure on reproductive and neurobehavioral endpoints in a preclinical nonhuman primate model. To this end, we initiated a long-term study using adult, female Macaca fascicularis monkeys exposed to daily, oral doses of 0.075 or 0.15 mg/kg of DA for a range of 321-381, and 346-554 days, respectively. This time period included a pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum period. Throughout these times, trained data collectors observed intentional tremors in some exposed animals during biweekly clinical examinations.\n\nThe present study explores the basis of this neurobehavioral finding with in vivo imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Diffusion tensor analyses revealed that, while DA exposed macaques did not significantly differ from controls, increases in DA-related tremors were negatively correlated with fractional anisotropy, a measure of structural integrity, in the internal capsule, fornix, pons, and corpus callosum. Brain concentrations of lactate, a neurochemical closely linked with astrocytes, were also weakly, but positively associated with tremors. These findings are the first documented results suggesting that chronic oral exposure to DA at concentrations near the current human regulatory limit are related to structural and chemical changes in the adult primate brain.",

    "abstract": "SWATH-MS has been widely used for proteomics analysis given its high-throughput and reproducibility but ensuring consistent quantification of analytes across large-scale studies of heterogeneous samples such as human-plasma remains challenging. Heterogeneity in large-scale studies can be caused by large time intervals between data-acquisition, acquisition by different operators or instruments, intermittent repair or replacement of parts, such as the liquid chromatography column, all of which affect retention time (RT) reproducibility and successively performance of SWATH-MS data analysis. Here, we present a novel algorithm for retention time alignment of SWATH-MS data based on direct alignment of raw MS2 chromatograms using a hybrid dynamic programming approach. The algorithm does not impose a chronological order of elution and allows for alignment of elution-order swapped peaks. Furthermore, allowing RT-mapping in a certain window around coarse global fit makes it robust against noise. On a manually validated dataset, this strategy outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, on a real-world clinical data, our approach outperforms global alignment methods by mapping 98% of peaks compared to 67% cumulatively and DIAlignR can reduce alignment error up to 30-fold for extremely distant runs. The robustness of technical parameters used in this pairwise alignment strategy has also been demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Spectral gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP) (Tiwary and Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 113 2839 (2016)) is a method for constructing the reaction coordinate (RC) in molecular systems, especially when they are plagued with hard to sample rare events, given a larger dictionary of order parameters or basis functions, and limited static and dynamic information about the system. In its original formulation, SGOOP is designed to construct a 1-dimensional RC. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple but powerful extension based on the notion of conditional probability factorization where known features are washed out to learn additional and possibly hidden features of the energy landscape. We show how SGOOP can be used to proceed in a sequential and bottom-up manner to (i) systematically probe the need for extending the dimensionality of the RC, and (ii) if such a need is identified, learn additional coordinates of the RC in a computationally efficient manner. We formulate the method and demonstrate its usefulness through three illustrative examples, including the challenging and important problem of calculating the kinetics of benzene unbinding from the protein T4L99A lysozyme, where we obtain excellent agreement in terms of dissociation pathway and kinetics with other sampling methods and experiments. In this last case, starting from a larger dictionary of fairly generic and arbitrarily chosen 11 order parameters, we demonstrate how to automatically learn a 2-dimensional RC, which we then use in the infrequent metadynamics protocol to obtain 16 independent unbinding trajectories. We believe our method will be a big step in increasing the usefulness of SGOOP in performing intuition-free sampling of complex systems. Finally, we believe that the usefulness of our protocol is amplified by its applicability to not just SGOOP but also other generic methods for constructing the RC.",

    "abstract": "Increasing average population age, and the accompanying burden of ill health, is one of the public health crises of our time. Understanding the basic biology of the ageing process may help ameliorate the pathologies that characterise old age. Ageing can be modulated, often through changes in gene expression where regulation of transcription plays a pivotal role. Activities of Forkhead transcription factors (TFs) are known to extend lifespan, but detailed knowledge of the broader transcriptional networks that promote longevity is lacking. This study focuses on the E twenty-six (ETS) family of TFs. This family of TFs is large, conserved across metazoa, and known to play roles in development and cancer, but the role of its members in ageing has not been studied extensively. In Drosophila, an ETS transcriptional repressor, Aop, and an ETS transcriptional activator, Pnt, are known to genetically interact with Foxo and activating Aop is sufficient to extend lifespan. Here, it is shown that Aop and Foxo effect a related gene-expression programme. Additionally, Aop can modulate Foxos transcriptional output to moderate or synergise with Foxo activity depending on promoter context, both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo genome-wide mRNA expression analysis in response to Aop, Pnt or Foxo indicated, and further experiments confirmed, that combinatorial activities of the three TFs dictate metabolic status, and that direct reduction of Pnt activity is sufficient to promote longevity. The role of ETS factors in longevity was not limited to Pnt and Aop. Knockdown of Ets21c or Eip74EF in distinct cell types also extended lifespan, revealing that lifespan is limited by transcription from the ETS binding site in multiple cellular contexts. Reducing the activity of the C. elegans ETS TF Lin-1 also extended lifespan, a finding that corroborates established evidence of roles of this TF family in ageing. Altogether, these results reveal the ETS family of TFs as pervasive and evolutionarily conserved brokers of longevity.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders are early onset neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted repetitive behaviors, yet they are quite heterogeneous in terms of their genetic basis and phenotypic manifestations. Recently, de novo pathogenic mutations in DYRK1A, a chromosome 21 gene associated to neuropathological traits of Down syndrome, have been identified in patients presenting a recognizable syndrome included in the autism spectrum. These mutations produce DYRK1A kinases with partial or complete absence of the catalytic domain, or they represent missense mutations located within this domain. Here, we undertook an extensive biochemical characterization of the DYRK1A missense mutations reported to date and show that most of them, but not all, result in enzymatically dead DYRK1A proteins. We also show that haploinsufficient Dyrk1a+/- mutant mice mirror the neurological traits associated with the human pathology, such as defective social interactions, stereotypic behaviors and epileptic activity. These mutant mice present altered proportions of excitatory and inhibitory neocortical neurons and synapses. Moreover, we provide evidence that alterations in the production of cortical excitatory neurons are contributing to these defects. Indeed, by the end of the neurogenic period, the expression of developmental regulated genes involved in neuron differentiation and/or activity is altered. Therefore, our data indicate that altered neocortical neurogenesis could critically affect the formation of cortical circuits, thereby contributing to the neuropathological changes in DYRK1A haploinsufficiency syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Only a minority of individuals who experience traumatic event(s) subsequently develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, whether differences in vulnerability to PTSD result from predisposition or a consequence of trauma exposure remains unclear. A major challenge in differentiating these possibilities is that clinical studies focus on individuals already exposed to traumatic experiences, and do not take into account pre-trauma conditions. Here using the predator scent model of PTSD in rats and a longitudinal design, we measured pre-trauma brain-wide neural circuit functional connectivity (FC), behavioral and corticosterone responses to trauma exposure, and post-trauma anxiety. Individual differences in freezing responses to predator scent exposure correlated with differences in pre-trauma FC in a set of neural circuits, especially in olfactory and stress-related systems, indicating that pre-existing function in these circuits could predispose animals to differential fearful responses to threats. Counterintuitively, rats with the lowest freezing showed more avoidance of the predator scent, a prolonged corticosterone response, and higher anxiety long after exposure. This study provides a comprehensive framework of pre-existing circuit function that determines threat response strategy, which might be directly related to the development of PTSD-like behaviors.",

Alcohol is known to alter blood lipid concentrations; however, the association of the types of alcohol on the lipid profile has not been investigated extensively. A cross-sectional study involving male participants (n = 86) aged 20 to 60 from the Ranchi and Dhanbad zone of Jharkhand, India, was carried out to investigate the effects of cumulative lifetime consumption of Haria, a local rice-based fermented alcohol, Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL), and a combination of the two on the blood lipid profiles. Demographic characteristics, dietary intake and medical history were obtained from the participants by questionnaire, and lipid levels were determined by analysis of blood samples. The effect of Haria alone on the blood lipids was also investigated on the local female population (n = 31). After adjusting for demographic and dietary factors, IMFL and combination of IMFL and Haria consumption was associated with increased serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (P < 0.05) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (P < 0.05). None of the blood lipids changed significantly in Haria consumers in both male and female groups. This study suggests that Haria, a popular alcoholic beverage of West Bengal and east-central India, is a relatively safe local alcoholic beverage and does not alter the lipid profile in consumers.",

MPS1 kinase is recruited to unattached kinetochores to initiate SAC signaling, and is removed from kinetochores once stable microtubule attachments have been formed to allow normal mitotic progression. Here we show that a helical fragment within the kinetochore-targeting NTE module of MPS1 is required for interactions with kinetochores, and also forms intramolecular interactions with its adjacent TPR domain. Bypassing this NTE-TPR interaction results in high MPS1 levels at kinetochores due to loss of regulatory input into MPS1 localization, ineffecient MPS1 delocalization from kinetochores upon microtubule attachment, and SAC silencing defects. These results show that SAC responsiveness to attachments relies on regulated intramolecular interactions in MPS1 and highlight the sensitivity of mitosis to perturbations in the dynamics of the MSP1-NDC80-C interactions.",

    "abstract": "When perturbed ecosystems undergo rapid and non-linear changes, this can result in  regime shifts to an entirely different ecological state. The need to understand the extent, nature, magnitude and reversibility of these changes is urgent given the profound effects that humans are having on the natural world. It remains very challenging to empirically document non-linear changes and regime shifts within complex, real ecological communities, or even to demonstrate such shifts in simplified experimental systems. General ecosystem models, which simulate the dynamics of entire ecological communities based on a mechanistic representation of ecological processes, provide an alternative and novel way to project ecosystem changes across all scales and trophic levels and to forecast impact thresholds beyond which dramatic or irreversible changes may occur. We model non-linear changes in four terrestrial biomes subjected to human removal of plant biomass, such as occurs through agricultural land-use change. We find that irreversible and non-linear responses are predicted to be common where removal of vegetation exceeds 80% (a level that occurs across nearly 10% of the terrestrial surface), especially for organisms at higher trophic levels and in less productive ecosystems such as drylands. Very large, irreversible changes to the entire ecosystem structure are expected at levels of vegetation removal akin to those in the most intensively used real-world ecosystems. Our results suggest that the projected 21st century rapid increases in agricultural land conversion to feed an expanding human population, may lead to widespread trophic cascades and in some cases irreversible changes to the structure of ecological communities.",

    "abstract": "This study examined factors contributing to temporal variability (2009-2017) in total mercury (THg) concentrations in aquatic bird eggs collected in the Peace-Athabasca Delta and Lake Athabasca in northern Alberta. Factors examined included annual changes in oil sands production, bird diets, forest fires, and flow of the Athabasca River. Surface mining activities associated with Albertas Athabasca oil sands are centered north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, adjacent to the northward-flowing Athabasca River. Previous studies have found that oil sands industrial operations release mercury into the local (within ~50 km) environment. However, temporal trends in egg THg levels did not track trends in synthetic oil production from the oil sands. Intraspecific fluctuations in bird diet also could not explain annual variability in egg THg levels. Annual extent of forest fires in Alberta was only related to egg THg concentrations in California Gulls from Lake Athabasca; annual levels in other species showed no relationship with fire extent. The inclusion of more terrestrial foods in gull diets may have contributed to this difference. For the majority of species, annual fluctuations in maximal flow of the Athabasca River were important in influencing annual egg THg levels. Eggs collected following years of high flow had higher THg concentrations with distinct stable Hg isotope compositions. Riverine processes associated with suspended sediment were likely critical in regulating Hg availability to nesting birds. This study highlights the importance of the Athabasca River as a conduit for Hg transport to ecologically-sensitive downstream ecosystems such as the Peace-Athabasca Delta and Wood Buffalo National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Human activities that increase atmospheric Hg deposition to the Athabasca River watershed, or that enhance Hg releases to the river through erosion of Hg-bearing soils, will likely increase the availability of Hg to organisms inhabiting downstream areas.",

    "abstract": "The diversity-productivity, diversity-invasibility, and diversity-stability hypotheses propose that increasing species diversity should lead, respectively, to increased average biomass productivity, increased invasion resistance, and increased stability. We tested these three hypotheses in the context of cover crop mixtures, evaluating the effects of increasing cover crop mixture diversity on aboveground biomass, weed suppression, and biomass stability. Twenty to forty cover crop treatments were replicated three or four times at eleven sites using eighteen species representing three cover crop species each from six pre-defined functional groups: cool-season grasses, cool-season legumes, cool-season brassicas, warm-season grasses, warm-season legumes, and warm-season broadleaves. Each species was planted in monoculture, and the most diverse treatment contained all eighteen species. Remaining treatments included treatments representing intermediate levels of cover crop species and functional richness and a no cover crop control. Cover crop planting dates ranged from late July to late September with both cover crop and weed aboveground biomass being sampled prior to winterkill. Stability was assessed by evaluating the variability in cover crop biomass for each treatment across plots within each site. While increasing cover crop mixture diversity was associated with increased average aboveground biomass, this was the result of the average biomass of the monocultures being drawn down by low yielding species rather than due to niche complementarity or increased resource use efficiency. At no site did the highest yielding mixture out-yield the highest yielding monoculture. Furthermore, while increases in cover crop mixture diversity were correlated with increases in weed suppression and increases in biomass stability, we argue that this was largely the result of diversity co-varying with aboveground biomass, and that differences in aboveground biomass rather than differences in diversity drove the differences observed in weed suppression and stability. The results of this study contradict popular interpretations of the diversity-productivity, diversity-invasibility, and diversity-stability hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Preparation of high-quality sequencing libraries is a costly and time-consuming component of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). While the overall cost of sequencing has dropped significantly over recent years, the reagents needed to prepare sequencing samples are likely to become the dominant expense in the process. Furthermore, libraries prepared by hand are subject to human variability and needless waste due to limitations of manual pipetting volumes. Reduction of reaction volumes, combined with sub-microliter automated dispensing of reagents without consumable pipette tips, has the potential to provide significant advantages. Here, we describe the integration of several instruments, including the Labcyte Echo 525 acoustic liquid handler and the iSeq and NovaSeq Illumina sequencing platforms, to miniaturize and automate mNGS library preparation, significantly reducing the cost and the time required to prepare samples. Through the use of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in RNAs, we demonstrated the fidelity of the miniaturized preparation to be equivalent to full volume reactions. Furthermore, detection of viral and microbial species from cell culture and patient samples was also maintained in the miniaturized libraries. For 384-well mNGS library preparations, we achieved a savings of over 80% in materials and reagents alone, and reduced preparation time by 90% compared to manual approaches, without compromising quality or representation within the library.",

To address this question, we conducted two functional MRI experiments in which we dissociated the periods related to perceptual decision making and confidence report by either separating their respective regressors or asking for confidence ratings only in the second half of the experiment. We found that perceptual decision making and confidence reports gave rise to activations in large and mostly overlapping brain circuits including frontal, parietal, posterior, and cingulate regions with the results being remarkably consistent across the two experiments. Further, the confidence report period activated a number of unique regions, whereas there was no evidence for the decision period activating unique regions not involved in the confidence period.

    "abstract": "Cognitive control and decision-making relies on the interplay of medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (mPFC/LPFC), particularly for circumstances in which correct behavior requires integrating and selecting among multiple sources of interrelated information. While the interaction between mPFC and LPFC is generally acknowledged as a crucial circuit in adaptive behavior, the nature of this interaction remains open to debate, with various proposals suggesting complementary roles in (i) signaling the need for and implementing control, (ii) identifying and selecting appropriate behavioral policies from a candidate set, and (iii) constructing behavioral schemata for performance of structured tasks. Although these proposed roles capture salient aspects of conjoint mPFC/LPFC function, none are sufficiently well-specified to provide a detailed account of the continuous interaction of the two regions during ongoing behavior. A recent computational model of mPFC and LPFC, the Hierarchical Error Representation (HER) model, places the regions within the framework of hierarchical predictive coding, and suggests how they interact during behavioral periods preceding and following salient events. In this manuscript, we extend the HER model to incorporate real-time temporal dynamics and demonstrate how the extended model is able to capture single-unit neurophysiological, behavioral, and network effects previously reported in the literature. Our results add to the wide range of results that can be accounted for by the HER model, and provide further evidence for predictive coding as a unifying framework for understanding PFC function and organization.",

    "abstract": "Sensory signals from the outside world are transduced at the periphery, passing through thalamus before reaching cortex, ultimately giving rise to the sensory representations that enable us to perceive the world. The thalamocortical circuit is particularly sensitive to the temporal precision of thalamic spiking due to highly convergent synaptic connectivity. Thalamic neurons can exhibit burst and tonic modes of firing that strongly influence timing within the thalamus. The impact of these changes in thalamic state on sensory encoding in the cortex, however, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of thalamic state on timing in the thalamocortical circuit of the vibrissa pathway in the anesthetized rat. We optogenetically hyperpolarized thalamus while recording single unit activity in both thalamus and cortex. Tonic spike triggered analysis revealed temporally precise thalamic spiking that was locked to weak white-noise sensory stimuli, while thalamic burst spiking was associated with a loss in stimulus-locked temporal precision. These thalamic state dependent changes propagated to cortex such that the cortical timing precision was diminished during the hyperpolarized (burst biased) thalamic state. While still sensory driven, the cortical neurons became significantly less precisely locked to the weak white-noise stimulus. The results here suggests a state dependent differential regulation of spike timing precision in the thalamus that could gate what signals are ultimately propagated to cortex.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are the most common congenital anomalies, accounting for a third of all congenital anomaly cases. While surgical correction dramatically improved survival rates, the lag behind normal neurodevelopment appears to persist. Deficits of higher cognitive functions are particularly common, including developmental delay in communication and oral-motor apraxia. It remains unclear whether the varying degree of cognitive developmental delay is reflected in variability in brain growth patterns. To answer this question, we aimed to investigate whether the rate of regional brain growth is correlated with later life neurodevelopment. 44 newborns were included in our study, out of whom 33 were diagnosed with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) and 11 with other forms of severe CHD. During the first month of life, neonates underwent corrective or palliative cardiovascular bypass surgery, pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI were performed 18.7 {+/-} 7.03 days apart. MRI was performed in natural sleep on a 3.0T scanner using an 8-channel head coil, fast spin-echo T2-weighted anatomical sequences were acquired in three planes. Based on the principles of deformation based morphometry, we calculated brain growth rate maps that reflected the rate of non-linear deformation that occurs between pre- and post-operative brain images. An explorative, whole-brain, threshold-free cluster enhancement analysis revealed strong correlation between the growth rate of the left planum temporale and the posterior operculum of the left frontal lobe and language score at 12 months of age, corrected for demographic variables (p=0.018, t=5.656). No significant correlation was found between brain growth rates and motor or cognitive scores. Post hoc analysis showed that the length of hospitalization interacts with this correlation with longer hospitalization stay results in faster enlargement of the internal cerebro-spinal fluid spaces. Our study provides evidence to the early importance of left-dominant perisylvian regions in language development even before the direct postnatatal exposure to native language. In CHD patients, the perioperative period results in a critical variability of brain growth rate in this region, which is a reliable neural correlate of language development at one year of age.",

    "abstract": "Gambling disorder is a serious psychiatric condition characterized by decision-making and reward processing impairments that are associated with dysfunctional brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, it remains unclear whether OFC functional abnormalities in gambling disorder are accompanied by structural abnormalities. We addressed this question by examining the organization of sulci and gyri in the OFC. This organization is in place very early and stable across life, such that OFC sulcogyral patterns (classified into Type I, II and III) can be regarded as potential pre-morbid markers of pathological conditions. We gathered structural brain data from nine existing studies, reaching a total of 165 individuals with gambling disorder and 159 healthy controls. Our results, supported by both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, show that the distribution of OFC sulcogyral patterns is skewed in individuals with gambling disorder, with an increased prevalence of Type II pattern compared with healthy controls. Examination of gambling severity did not reveal any significant relationship between OFC sulcogyral patterns and disease severity. Altogether, our results provide evidence for a skewed distribution of OFC sulcogyral patterns in gambling disorder, and suggest that pattern Type II might represent a pre-morbid structural brain marker of the disease. It will be important to investigate more closely the functional implications of these structural abnormalities in future work.",

    "abstract": "The amygdaloid complex, including the basolateral nucleus (BLA) contributes crucially to emotional and cognitive brain functions, and is thus a major target of research in both humans and rodents. However, delineating structural amygdala plasticity in both normal and disease-related contexts using neuroimaging has been hampered by the difficulty of unequivocally identifying the boundaries of the BLA. This challenge is a result of poor contrast between BLA and the surrounding gray matter, including other amygdala nuclei. Here we describe a novel DTI approach to enhance contrast, enabling optimal identification of BLA in rodent brain from MR images. We employed this methodology together with a slice-shifting approach to measure BLA volume. We then validated the results by direct comparison to both histological and cellular-identity (parvalbumin)-based conventional techniques for defining BLA in the same brains used for MRI. We also confirmed the BLA region using DTI based tractography. The novel approach used here enables accurate and reliable delineation of BLA. Because this nucleus is involved in, and is changed by, developmental, degenerative and adaptive processes, the instruments provided here should be highly useful to a broad range of neuroimaging studies. Finally, the principles used here are readily applicable to numerous brain regions and across species.\\n\\nSummary StatementUse of MRI directionally encoded diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can delineate the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and volumes derived from DTI were found to match those obtained using histological methods.

    "abstract": "Older adults experience difficulties in daily situations that require flexible information selection in the presence of multiple competing sensory inputs, like for instance multi-talker situations. Modulations of rhythmic neural activity in the alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) frequency range in posterior brain areas have been established as a cross-modal neural correlate of selective attention. However, research linking compromised auditory selective attention to changes in rhythmic neural activity in aging is sparse.\\n\\nWe tested younger (n = 25; 22-35 years) and older adults (n = 26; 63-76 years) in an attention modulated dichotic listening task. In this, two streams of highly similar auditory input were simultaneously presented to participants' both ears (i.e., dichotically) while attention had to be focused on the input to only one ear (i.e. target) and the other, distracting information had to be ignored.\\n\\nWe here demonstrate a link between severely compromised auditory selective attention in aging and a partial reorganization of attention-related rhythmic neural responses. In particular, in old age we observed a shift from a self-initiated, preparatory modulation of alpha rhythmic activity to an externally driven, response in the alpha-beta range. Critically, moment-to-moment fluctuations in the age-specific patterns of self-initiated and externally driven lateralized rhythmic activity were tied to selective attention. We conclude that adult age difference in spatial selective attention likely derive from a functional reorganization of rhythmic neural activity within the aging brain.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal functional connectivity of the amygdala with several other brain regions has been observed in patients with higher anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, both in a resting state and threatening conditions. However, findings on the specific connections of the amygdala might be varied due to temporal and individual fluctuations in the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala and its lateral asymmetry, as well as possible variability in anxiety among healthy subjects. We studied reproducibility of rsFC data for the right and left amygdala, obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging twice in a one-week interval in 20 healthy volunteers with low to moderate anxiety. We found resting-state amygdala network, which included not only areas involved in the emotion circuit, but regions of the default mode network (DMN) associated with memory and other brain areas involved in motor inhibition and emotion suppression. The amygdala network was stable in time and within subjects, but between-session reproducibility was asymmetrical for the right and left amygdala rsFC. The right amygdala had more significant connections with DMN regions and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The rsFC values of the right amygdala were more sustained across the week than the left amygdala rsFC. Our results support a hypothesis of functional lateralization of the amygdala. The left amygdala is more responsible for the conscious processing of threats, which may produce more variable rsFC; the right amygdala rsFC is more stable due to its greater engagement in continuous automatic evaluation of stimuli.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAmygdala resting state network included areas of emotion circuit and motor control\\nC_LIO_LIDuring rest amygdala was functionally connected with areas of default mode network\\nC_LIO_LIFunctional connectivity of the right amygdala was more sustained across the week\\nC_LIO_LIFunctional connections of amygdala network were more stable in the right hemisphere\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cerebral lateralisation for language can vary from task to task, but it is unclear if this reflects error of measurement or independent lateralisation of different language systems. We used functional transcranial Doppler sonography to assess language lateralisation in 37 adults (7 left-handers) on six tasks, each given on two occasions. Tasks taxed different aspects of language function. A preregistered structural equation analysis was used to compare models of means and covariances. For most people, a single lateralised factor explained most of the covariance between tasks. A minority, however, showed dissociation of asymmetry, giving a second factor. This was mostly derived from a receptive task, which was highly reliable but not lateralised. The results suggest that variation in strength of language lateralisation reflects true individual differences and not just error of measurement. Inclusion of several tasks in a laterality battery makes it easier to detect cases of atypical asymmetry.",

Sudden and irreversible transitions between these states make external manipulation of these systems more complicated. To better understand the mechanisms and origins of multistability in microbial communities, we introduce and study a model of a microbial ecosystem colonized by multiple specialist species selected from a fixed pool. Growth of each species can be limited by essential nutrients of two types, e.g. carbon and nitrogen, each represented in the environment by multiple metabolites. We demonstrate that our model has an exponentially large number of potential stable states realized for different environmental parameters. Using game theoretical methods adapted from the stable marriage problem we predict all of these states based only on ranked lists of competitive abilities of species for each of the nutrients. We show that for every set of nutrient influxes, several mutually uninvadable stable states are generally feasible and we distinguish them based upon their dynamic stability. We further explore an intricate network of discontinuous transitions (regime shifts) between these alternative states both in the course of community assembly, or upon changes of nutrient influxes.",

    "abstract": "Mutation accumulation has been proposed as a cause of senescence. In this process, both constitutional and recurrent mutations accumulate gradually and differentially among differentiating cells, tissues and organs, in relation to stage and age, analogous to Mullers ratchet in asexually reproducing organisms. Latent and cascading deleterious effects of mutations might initiate steady \\\"accumulation of deficits\\\" in cells, leading to cellular senescence, and functional decline of tissues and organs, and ultimately manifest as frailties and disease. We investigated a few of these aspects in cell populations through modeling and simulation using the Moran birth-death process, under varied scenarios of mutation accumulation. Our results agree with the principle of Mullers ratchet. The ratchet speed in a given tissue depends on the population size of cells, mutation rate, and selection coefficient. Additionally, deleterious mutations seem to rapidly accumulate particularly early in the life-course, during which the rate of cell division is high, thereby exerting a greater effect on cellular senescence. The speed of the ratchet afterward varies greatly between cells nested in tissues and tissues within organs due to heterogeneity in the life span and turnover rate of specific cell types. Importantly, the ratchet accelerates with age, resulting in a synergistic fitness decay in cell populations. We extend Fishers average excess concept and rank order scale to interpret differential phenotypic effects of mutation load in a given tissue. We conclude that classical evolutionary genetic models could explain partially, the origins of frailty, subclinical conditions, morbidity and health consequences of senescence.\\n\\nSignificanceFrailty is defined as physiological and functional decline of organs and organ systems, due to deficit accumulation from stochastic damages within the organism with advanced age. Equivalently, with age, both constitutional and somatic mutations accumulate gradually and differentially among cells, cell lineages, tissues, and organs. Since most mutations are deleterious, accumulation of random and recurrent mutations could create a \\\"load,\\\" on the genome and contextually express in the epigenome and phenotype spaces. Here we extend Mullers ratchet principle to explain frailty and multi-morbidity using the Moran model and simulations. Our results agree with the Mullers ratchet principle. We emphasize the need for considering cumulative effects of the entire spectrum of mutations for explaining the origin of frailty, sub-clinical conditions, and morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a complex eating disorder with genetic, metabolic, and psychosocial underpinnings. Using unbiased genome-wide methods, recent studies have associated a variety of genes with the disorder. We characterized these genes by projecting them into aggregated gene expression data from reference transcriptomic atlases of the prenatal and adult human brain. We found that genes from an induced stem cell study of anorexia nervosa are expressed at higher levels in the lateral parabrachial and the ventral tegmental areas. The adult expression enrichment of the lateral parabrachial is confirmed with genes from two independent genetic studies. In the fetal brain, enrichment of the ventral tegmental area is also observed for the six genes near the only common variant associated with the disorder (rs4622308). We also observed signals in the adult and fetal pontine raphe, but they were not observed when using the genes from the genetic studies. In addition to signals related to calcitonin gene-related peptide neurons and the tachykinin, we found more than the expected number of microglia marker genes within the gene sets. Using mouse transcriptomic data, we identified several anorexia nervosa associated genes that are differentially expressed during food deprivation. While these genes that respond to fasting are not enriched in the gene sets, we highlight RPS26 which is proximal to rs4622308. We did not observe expression enrichment in the cingulate cortex or hypothalamus suggesting other targets for deep brain stimulation should be considered for severe cases. This work improves our understanding of the neurobiological causes of anorexia nervosa by suggesting disturbances in subcortical appetitive circuits.",

    "abstract": "In the rodent olfactory bulb the smooth dendrites of the principal glutamatergic mitral cells (MCs) form reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with large spines on GABAergic granule cells (GC), where unitary release of glutamate can trigger postsynaptic local activation of voltage-gated Na+-channels (Navs), i.e. a spine spike. Can such single MC input evoke reciprocal release? We find that unitary-like activation via two-photon uncaging of glutamate causes GC spines to release GABA both synchronously and asynchronously onto MC dendrites. This release indeed requires activation of Navs and high-voltage-activated Ca2+-channels (HVACCs), but also of NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Simulations show temporally overlapping HVACC- and NMDAR-mediated Ca2+-currents during the spine spike, and ultrastructural data prove NMDAR presence within the GABAergic presynapse. This cooperative action of presynaptic NMDARs allows to implement synapse-specific, activity-dependent lateral inhibition and thus could provide an efficient solution to combinatorial percept synthesis in a sensory system with many receptor channels.",

    "abstract": "Under typical daytime light levels, the human pupillary light response (PLR) is driven by the activity of the L, M, and S cones, and melanopsin expressed in the so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). However, the importance of each of these photoreceptive mechanisms in defining pupil size under real-world viewing conditions remains to be established. To address this question, we embedded photoreceptor-specific modulations in a movie displayed using a novel projector-based five-primary spatial stimulation system, which allowed for the precise control of photoreceptor activations in time and space. We measured the pupillary light response in eleven observers, who viewed short cartoon movies which contained hidden low-frequency (0.25 Hz) silent-substitution modulations of the L, M and S cones (no stimulation of melanopsin), melanopsin (no stimulation of L, M and S cones), both L, M, and S cones and melanopsin or no modulation at all. We find that all photoreceptors active at photopic light levels regulate pupil size under this condition. Our data imply that embedding modulations in photoreceptor contrast could provide a method to manipulate key adaptive aspects of the human visual system in everyday, real-world activities such as watching a movie.",

    "abstract": "Musical interaction is a unique model for understanding humans ability to align goals, intentions, and actions, which also allows for the manipulation of participants internal predictive models of upcoming events. Here we used polyrhythms to construct two joint finger tapping tasks that even when rhythmically dissimilar resulted in equal inter-tap intervals (ITIs). Thus, behaviourally a dyad of two musicians tap isochronously at the same rate, yet with their own distinct rhythmical context model (RCM). We recruited 22 highly skilled musicians (in 11 dyads) and contrasted the effect of having a shared versus non-shared RCM on dyads synchronization behaviour. As expected, tapping synchronization was significantly worse at the start of trials with non-shared models compared to trials with a shared model. However, the musicians were able to quickly recover when holding dissimilar predictive models. We characterised the directionality in the tapping behaviour of the dyads and found patterns mostly of mutual adaptation. Yet, in a subset of dyads primarily consisting of drummers, we found significantly different synchronization patterns, suggesting that instrument expertise can significantly affect synchronization strategies. Overall, this demonstrates that holding different predictive models impacts synchronization in musicians performing joint finger tapping.\\n\\nPublic significance statementThis study shows that when a pair of musicians thinks differently about a rhythm they play together, their performance is worse. However, they are able to recover back to normal performance levels after a few taps for which they use different strategies. Interestingly, we find that the strategies used by drummers may be different from other musicians.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic retinal development, six types of retinal neurons are generated from a pool of multipotent progenitors in a strict spatiotemporal pattern. This pattern requires cell cycle exit (i.e. neurogenesis) and differentiation to be precisely regulated in a lineage-specific manner. In zebrafish, the bHLH transcription factor NeuroD governs photoreceptor genesis through Notch signaling but also governs photoreceptor differentiation though distinct mechanisms that are currently unknown. Also unknown are the mechanisms that regulate NeuroD and the spatiotemporal pattern of photoreceptor development. Members of the miR-17-92 microRNA cluster regulate CNS neurogenesis, and a member of this cluster, miR-18a, is predicted to target neuroD mRNA. The purpose of this study was to determine if miR-18a regulates NeuroD in the retina and if it plays a role in photoreceptor development. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that, of the three miR-18 family members (miR-18a, b and c), miR-18a expression most closely parallels neuroD expression. Morpholino oligonucleotides and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing were used for miR-18a loss-of-function (LOF) and both approaches resulted in larvae with more mature photoreceptors at 70 hpf without affecting cell proliferation. Western blot showed that miR-18a LOF increases NeuroD protein levels and in vitro dual luciferase assay showed that miR-18a directly interacts with the 32UTR of neuroD. Finally, tgif1 mutants have increased miR-18a expression, less NeuroD protein and fewer mature photoreceptors, and the photoreceptor deficiency is rescued by miR-18a knockdown. Together these results show that, independent of neurogenesis, miR-18a regulates the timing of photoreceptor differentiation and indicate that this occurs through post-transcriptional regulation of NeuroD.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D3 (vitD3) and its active metabolite, calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2D3), affect multiple tissue types by interacting with the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Although vitD3 deficiency has been correlated with increased incidence of breast cancer and less favorable outcomes across ethnic groups and latitudes, randomized human clinical trials have yet to provide conclusive evidence on the efficacy of vitD3 in treating and/or preventing breast cancer. When considering that carcinogenesis is \\\"development gone awry\\\", it becomes imperative to understand the role of vitD3 during breast development. Mammary gland development in VDR KO mice is altered by increased ductal elongation and lateral branching during puberty, precocious and increased alveologenesis at pregnancy and delayed post-lactational involution. These developmental processes are largely influenced by mammotropic hormones, i.e., ductal elongation by estrogen, branching by progesterone and alveologenesis by prolactin. However, research on vitD3s effects on mammary gland morphogenesis focused on cell proliferation and apoptosis in 2D culture models and utilized supra-physiological doses of vitD3, conditions that spare the microenvironment in which morphogenesis takes place. Here, using two 3D culture models, we investigated the role of vitD3 in mammary epithelial morphogenesis. We found that vitD3 interferes with estrogens actions on T47D human breast cancer cells in 3D differently at different doses, and recapitulates what is observed in vivo. Also, vitD3 can act autonomously and affect the organization of MCF10A cells in 3D collagen matrix by influencing collagen fiber organization. Thus, we uncovered how vitD3 modulates mammary tissue organization independent of its already known effects on cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Cellular functions are shaped by reaction networks whose dynamics are determined by the concentrations of underlying components. However, cellular mechanisms ensuring that a components concentration resides in a given range remain elusive. We present network properties which suffice to identify components whose concentration ranges can be efficiently computed in mass-action metabolic networks. We show that the derived ranges are in excellent agreement with simulations from a detailed kinetic metabolic model of Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that the approach can be used with genome-scale metabolic models to arrive at predictions concordant with measurements from Escherichia coli under different growth scenarios. By application to 14 genome-scale metabolic models from diverse species, our approach specifies the cellular determinants of concentration ranges that can be effectively employed to make predictions for a variety of biotechnological and medical applications.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe present a computational approach for inferring concentration ranges from genome-scale metabolic models. The approach specifies a determinant and molecular mechanism underling facile control of concentration ranges for components in large-scale cellular networks. Most importantly, the predictions about concentration ranges do not require knowledge of kinetic parameters (which are difficult to specify at a genome scale), provided measurements of concentrations in a reference state. The approach assumes that reaction rates follow the mass action law used in the derivations of other types of kinetics. We apply the approach with large-scale kinetic and stoichiometric metabolic models of organisms from different kingdoms of life to show that we can identify a proportion of metabolites to which our approach is applicable. By challenging the predictions of concentration ranges in the genome-scale metabolic network of E. coli with real-world data sets, we further demonstrate the prediction power and limitations of the approach.",

    "abstract": "It is unknown how growth in one tissue impacts morphogenesis in a neighboring tissue. To address this, we used the Drosophila ovarian follicle, where a cluster of 15 nurse cells and a posteriorly located oocyte are surrounded by a layer of epithelial cells. It is known that as the nurse cells grow, the overlying epithelial cells flatten in a wave that begins in the anterior. Here, we demonstrate that an anterior to posterior gradient of decreasing cytoplasmic pressure is present across the nurse cells and that this gradient acts through TGF{beta} to control both the triggering and the progression of the wave of epithelial cell flattening. Our data indicate that intrinsic nurse cell growth is important to control proper nurse cell pressure. Finally, we reveal that nurse cell pressure and subsequent TGF{beta} activity in the StC combine to increase follicle elongation in the anterior, which is crucial for allowing nurse cell growth and pressure control. More generally, our results reveal that during development, inner cytoplasmic pressure in individual cells has an important role in shaping their neighbors.\n\nImpact StatementCell shape change depends on extrinsic forces exerted by cytoplasmic pressure in neighbouring cells.",

New analysis methods were used to estimate the frequency and spatial scales of activity in dendritic branches and spines. The majority of dendritic calcium transients were coincident with global events. However, task-associated calcium signals in dendrites and spines were compartmentalized by dendritic branching and clustered within branches over approximately 10 m. Diverse behavior-related signals were intermingled and distributed throughout the dendritic arbor, potentially supporting a large computational repertoire and learning capacity in individual neurons.",

    "abstract": "Signalling by surface receptors often relies on tethered reactions whereby an enzyme bound to the cytoplasmic tail f a receptor catalyses reactions on substrates within reach. The overall length and stiffness of the receptor tail, the enzyme, and the substrate determine a biophysical parameter termed the molecular reach of the reaction. This parameter determines the probability that the receptor-tethered-enzyme will contact the substrate, in the volume proximal to the membrane, when separated by different distances within the membrane plane. Here, we develop particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion models to study the interplay between molecular reach and diffusion. We find that increasing the molecular reach can increase reaction efficacy when diffusion is slow, but when diffusion is fast, increasing molecular reach reduces reaction efficacy. This switching is lost if reactions are forced to take place within the 2D plasma membrane instead of the 3D volume proximal to it, or if molecules diffuse in 3D. We show results in the context of immune receptors (PD-1 dephosphorylating CD28), a standard opposing kinase-phosphatase reaction, and a minimal two-particle model. The work highlights the 3D nature of many 2D membrane-confined interactions, illustrating a role for molecular reach in controlling biochemical reactions.",

However the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences are poorly defined. Here, we identify extensive transcriptome-3end-alterations in neuroblastoma, a tumour entity with a paucity of recurrent somatic mutations and an unusually high frequency of spontaneous regression. Utilising extensive RNAi-screening we reveal the landscape and drivers of transcriptome-3end-diversification, discovering PCF11 as critical regulator, directing alternative polyadenylation (APA) of hundreds of transcripts including a differentiation RNA-operon. PCF11 shapes inputs converging on WNT-signalling, and governs cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis and neurodifferentiation. Postnatal PCF11 down-regulation induces a neurodifferentiation program, and low-level PCF11 in neuroblastoma associates with favourable outcome and spontaneous tumour regression. Our findings document a critical role for APA in tumourigenesis and describe a novel mechanism for cell fate reprogramming in neuroblastoma with important clinical implications.

    "abstract": "Abundance of urea cycle enzymes in the liver is regulated by the dietary protein intake. Although urea cycle enzyme levels rise in response to a high protein diet, signaling networks that sense dietary protein intake and trigger changes in expression of urea cycle genes have not been identified. The aim of this study was to identify signaling pathway(s) that respond to changes in protein intake and regulate expression of urea cycle genes in mice and human hepatocytes. Mice were adapted to either control or high (HP) protein diets followed by isolation of liver protein and mRNA and integrated analysis of the proteomic and transcriptome profiles. HP diet led to increased expression of mRNA and enzymes in amino acid degradation pathways, and decreased expression of mRNA and enzymes in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, which implicated AMPK as a possible regulator. Primary human hepatocytes, treated with AICAR an activator of AMPK, were used to test whether AMPK regulates expression of urea cycle genes. The abundance of CPS1 and OTC mRNA increased in hepatocytes treated with AICAR, which supports a role for AMPK signaling in regulation of the urea cycle. Because AMPK is either a target of drugs used to treat type-2 diabetes, these drugs might increase the expression of urea cycle enzymes in patients with urea cycle disorders, which could be the basis of a new therapeutic approach.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIntegrated analysis of transcriptional and proteomic profiles of the liver tissue from mice fed different protein content diets revealed that AMPK signaling pathway regulates expression of urea cycle enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder is increasingly associated with atypical perceptual and sensory symptoms. Here we explore the hypothesis that aberrant sensory processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder could be linked to atypical intra- (local) and inter-regional (global) brain connectivity. To elucidate oscillatory dynamics and connectivity in the visual domain we used magnetoencephalography and a simple visual grating paradigm with a group of 18 adolescent autistic participants and 18 typically developing controls. Both groups showed similar increases in gamma (40-80Hz) and decreases in alpha (8-13Hz) frequency power in occipital cortex. However, systematic group differences emerged when analysing intra- and inter-regional connectivity in detail. Firstly, directed connectivity was estimated using non-parametric Granger causality between visual areas V1 and V4. Feedforward V1-to-V4 connectivity, mediated by gamma oscillations, was equivalent between Autism Spectrum Disorder and control groups, but importantly, feedback V4-to-V1 connectivity, mediated by alpha (8-13Hz) oscillations, was significantly reduced in the Autism Spectrum Disorder group. This reduction was positively correlated with autistic quotient scores, consistent with an atypical visual hierarchy in autism, characterised by reduced top-down modulation of visual input via alpha-band oscillations. Secondly, at the local level in V1, coupling of alpha-phase to gamma amplitude (alpha-gamma phase amplitude coupling, PAC) was reduced in the Autism Spectrum Disorder group. This implies dysregulated local visual processing, with gamma oscillations decoupled from patterns of wider alpha-band phase synchrony (i.e. reduced PAC), possibly due to an excitation-inhibition imbalance. More generally, these results are in agreement with predictive coding accounts of neurotypical perception and indicate that visual processes in autism are less modulated by contextual feedback information.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 15% of all human tumors harbor mutant KRAS, a membrane-associated small GTPase and a notorious oncogene. Somatic mutations that render KRAS constitutively active lead to uncontrolled cell growth, survival, proliferation, and eventually cancer. KRAS is thus a critical anticancer drug target. However, despite aggressive efforts in recent years, there is no drug on the market that directly targets KRAS. In the current work, we combined molecular simulation and high-throughput virtual screening with a battery of cell-based and biophysical assays to discover a novel, pyrazolopyrimidine-based allosteric KRAS inhibitor that exhibits promising biochemical properties. The compound selectively binds to active KRAS with sub-micromolar affinity, slightly modulates exchange factor activity, disrupts effector Raf binding, significantly reduces signal transduction through mutant KRAS and inhibits cancer cell growth. Moreover, by studying two of its analogues, we identified key chemical features of the compound that are critical for affinity, effect on effector binding and mode of action. We propose a set of specific interactions with key residues at the switch regions of KRAS as critical for abrogating effector binding and reducing the rate of nucleotide exchange. Together, these findings not only demonstrate the viability of direct KRAS inhibition and offer guidance for future optimization efforts, but also show that pyrazolopyrimidine-based compounds may represent a first-in-class lead toward a clinically relevant targeting of KRAS by allosteric non-covalent inhibitors.",

Light-field microscopy (LFM) has recently emerged as a scanning-free, scalable method that allows for high-speed, volumetric functional brain imaging. Given those promising applications at the tissue level, at its other extreme, this highly-scalable approach holds great potential for observing structures and dynamics in single-cell specimens. However, the challenge remains for current LFM to achieve subcellular level, near-diffraction-limited 3D spatial resolution. Here, we report high-resolution LFM (HR-LFM) for live-cell imaging with a resolution of 300-700 nm in all three dimensions, an imaging depth of several micrometers, and a volume acquisition time of milliseconds. We demonstrate the technique by imaging various cellular dynamics and structures and tracking single particles. The method may advance LFM as a particularly useful tool for understanding biological systems at multiple spatio-temporal levels.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of biology-based precision drugs are available that neutralize aberrant molecular pathways in cancer. Molecular heterogeneity and the lack of reliable companion diagnostic biomarkers for many drugs makes targeted treatment of cancer inaccurate for many individuals, leading to futile overtreatment. To acquire a comprehensive insight in aberrant actionable biological pathways in individual cancers we applied a cost-effective targeted RNA next generation sequencing (NGS) technique. The test allows NGS-based measurement of transcript levels and splice variants of hundreds of genes with established roles in the biological behavior in many cancer types. We here present proof of concept that the technique generates a correct molecular diagnosis and a prognosis for glioma patients. The test not only confirmed known brain cancer-associated molecular aberrations but also identified aberrant expression levels of actionable genes and mutations that are associated with other cancer types. Targeted RNA-NGS is therefore a highly attractive method to guide precision therapy for the individual patient based on pathway analysis.",

    "abstract": "Motile cilia on multiciliated cells (MCCs) function in fluid clearance over epithelia. Studies with Xenopus embryos and patients with the congenital respiratory disorder reduced generation of multiple motile cilia, have implicated the nuclear protein MCIDAS (MCI), in the transcriptional regulation of MCC specification and differentiation. Recently, a paralogous protein, GMNC, was also shown to be required for MCC formation. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the presently held view, we find that Mci mutant mice can specify MCC precursors. However, these precursors cannot produce multiple basal bodies, and mature into single ciliated cells. We show that MCI is required specifically to induce deuterosome pathway components for the production of multiple basal bodies. Moreover, GMNC and MCI associate differentially with the cell-cycle regulators E2F4 and E2F5, which enables them to activate distinct sets of target genes (ciliary transcription factor genes versus genes for basal body generation). Our data establish a previously unrecognized two-step model for MCC development: GMNC functions in the initial step for MCC precursor specification. GMNC induces Mci expression, which then drives the second step of basal body production for multiciliation.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe show how two GEMININ family proteins function in mammalian multiciliated cell development: GMNC regulates precursor specification and MCIDAS induces multiple basal body formation for multiciliation.",

    "abstract": "During gastrulation, the pluripotent epiblast is patterned into the three germ layers, which form the embryo proper. This patterning requires a signaling cascade involving the BMP, WNT and NODAL pathways; however, how these pathways regulate one another in space and time to generate cell-fate patterns remains unknown. Using a human gastruloid model, we show that BMP signaling initiates a wave of WNT signaling, which, in turn, initiates a wave of NODAL signaling. While WNT propagation depends on continuous BMP activity, NODAL propagates independently of upstream signals. We further show that the duration of BMP signaling determines the position of mesodermal differentiation while WNT and NODAL synergize to achieve maximal differentiation. The waves of both WNT and NODAL signaling activity extend farther into the colony than mesodermal differentiation. Combining dynamic measurements of signaling activity with mathematical modeling revealed that the formation of signaling waves is inconsistent with WNT and NODAL forming a stable spatial pattern in signaling activities, and the final signaling state is spatially homogeneous. Thus, dynamic events in the BMP, WNT, and NODAL signaling cascade, in the absence of a signaling gradient, have the potential to mediate epiblast patterning.",

Following application of WNT ligand, E-CAD mediates a wave of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) conversion analogous to PS extension in an embryo. By knocking out the secreted WNT inhibitors active in our system, we show that DKK1 alone controls the extent and duration of patterning. The NODAL inhibitor CERBERUS1 acts downstream of WNT to refine the endoderm versus mesoderm fate choice.

    "abstract": "By gut microbiota metagenomic analysis, we found that the abundance of sulfatase-secreting bacteria (SSB) in the gut of mice fed chondroitin sulfate (CS) increases with significant individual difference. The fluctuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory indicators with significant individual and tissue variations was also observed. After mice were fed mixed with CS or injected separately with LPS, the breast cancer-related transcriptional factor genes, BCL11A and RUNX1, were upregulated, whereas the tumor suppressor gene, TP53BP1, were downregulated. Further, the mammary myopithelium marker CK5/6, the mammary hyperplasia marker Ki-67, and other tumor markers were also upregulated. While the exogenous estradiol does not induce the expression of BCL11A, RUNX1, and TP53BP1, the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist Fulvestrant that mimics estradiol action not only elevates estradiol concentrations, but also upregulates tumor marker expression levels, revealing that ER inflammatory inactivation and hyperestrogenemia induction might be the etiological cues of breast cancer origin. This study has preliminarily established a possible correlation of gut microbiota dysbiosis and chronic low-grade inflammation with the early-phase onset of breast cancer in mice.

    "abstract": "Bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) is an atypical kinase and a histone acetyl transferase (HAT) which plays an important role in chromatin remodeling and early transcriptional elongation. During transcription elongation, BRD4 travels with the elongation complex. Since most of the alternative splicing events take place co-transcriptionally, we asked if BRD4 plays a role in regulation of alternative splicing. We find that distinct patterns of alternative splicing are associated with conditional deletion of BRD4 during thymocyte differentiation in vivo. Similarly, depletion of BRD4 in T-ALL cells alters patterns of splicing. Most of the alternatively spliced events affected by BRD4 are usage of exon skipping. In an established insulin receptor minigene model of splicing, BRD4 over expression modulates alternative splicing. Importantly, as assessed by both immunoprecipitation (IP) and proximity ligation (PLA) assays, BRD4 interacts with components of the splicing machinery. BRD4 also co-localizes on chromatin with one of the splicing regulators. We propose that BRD4 contributes to patterns of alternative splicing through its interaction with the splicing machinery during transcription elongation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe bromodomain protein, BRD4, is a transcriptional and epigenetic regulator that plays a critical role in both cancer and inflammation. It has pleiotropic activities, including chromatin organization, transcriptional pause release and initiation. We now report that it also contributes to the regulation of alternative splicing. Taken together, these findings indicate that BRD4 functions to coordinate the various steps in gene expression.",

E2~dID exploits the central position of E2-conjugating enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade and provides in vitro generated biotinylated E2~ubiquitin thioester conjugates as the sole source for ubiquitination in extracto. This enables purification and mass spectrometry-based identification of modified proteins under stringent conditions independently of the biological source of the extract. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of E2-dID by identifying and validating substrates of APC/C in human cells. Finally, we perform E2~dID with SUMO in S. cerevisiae, showing that this approach can be easily adapted to other ubiquitin-like modifiers and experimental models.",

    "abstract": "Navigation of cells and organisms is typically achieved by detecting and processing orienteering cues. Occasionally, a cue may be assessed over a much larger range than the individuals body size, as in visual scanning for landmarks. In this paper we formulate models that account for orientation in response to short- or long-range cue evaluation. Starting from an underlying random walk movement model, where a generic cue is evaluated locally or nonlocally to determine a preferred direction, we state corresponding macroscopic partial differential equations to describe population movements. Under certain approximations, these models reduce to well-known local and nonlocal biological transport equations, including those of Keller-Segel type. We consider a case-study application: \\\"hilltopping\\\" in Lepidoptera and other insects, a phenomenon in which populations accumulate at summits to improve encounter/mating rates. Nonlocal responses are shown to efficiently filter out the natural noisiness (or roughness) of typical landscapes and allow the population to preferentially accumulate at a subset of hilltopping locations, in line with field studies. Moreover, according to the timescale of movement, optimal responses may occur for different perceptual ranges.",
