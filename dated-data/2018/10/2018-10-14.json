    "abstract": "Heterogeneity in strategies for survival and proliferation among the cells which constitute a tumour is a driving force behind the evolution of resistance to cancer therapy. The rules mapping the tumours strategy distribution to the fitness of individual strategies can be represented as an evolutionary game. We develop a game assay to measure effective evolutionary games in co-cultures of non-small cell lung cancer cells which are sensitive and resistant to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor Alectinib. The games are not only quantitatively different between different environments, but targeted therapy and cancer associated fibroblasts qualitatively switch the type of game being played by the in-vitro population from Leader to Deadlock. This observation provides empirical confirmation of a central theoretical postulate of evolutionary game theory in oncology: we can treat not only the player, but also the game. Although we concentrate on measuring games played by cancer cells, the measurement methodology we develop can be used to advance the study of games in other microscopic systems by providing a quantitative description of non-cell-autonomous effects.",

In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes, using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, LDL cholesterol and Crohns disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene, as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some of which are unlikely to be causal, because they share the same variants as eQTLs. We illustrate that TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization when using expression data from tissues or cell types that are less related to the trait, due to substantial variation in both expression levels and eQTL strengths across cell types. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes at GWAS loci more accurately than simple baselines based on proximity to lead GWAS variant and expression in trait-related tissue. We discuss current strategies and future opportunities for improving the performance of TWAS for causal gene prioritization. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using expression variation across individuals to determine causal genes at GWAS loci and provide guidelines and best practices when using TWAS to prioritize candidate causal genes.",

    "abstract": "Hemispheric lateralization is a fundamental organizing principle of nervous systems across taxonomic groups with bilateral symmetry. The mammalian hippocampus is lateralized anatomically, physiologically, and chemically; however, functional asymmetries are not yet well understood. Imaging studies in humans have implicated the left and right hippocampus in specialized processing. However, it is not clear if lateralized activity occurs in the rodent hippocampus. c-Fos imaging in animals provides a measure of neuronal activity with a resolution at the level of single cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether lateralized activity-dependent c-Fos expression occurs in the rodent hippocampus. To understand functional lateralization of hippocampal processing, we compared interhemispheric expression of c-Fos in the dentate gyrus (DG), a structure involved in encoding new experiences, in mice that ran on a wheel, encoded a novel object, or remained in home cages. We found that wheel running induced the greatest amount of DG c-Fos expression in both hemispheres, with no difference between hemispheres. Object exploration resulted in left-lateralized DG c-Fos expression, whereas control mice were not lateralized. We then sought to determine whether differential consideration of hemispheres might influence the conclusions of a study by simulating common cell quantification methods. We found that different approaches led to different conclusions. These data demonstrate lateralization of neuronal activity in the mouse DG corresponding to the experience of the animal and show that differentially considering hemisphere leads to alternative conclusions.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that memories about experienced stimuli are represented by groups of highly interconnected neurons called cell assemblies. This requires allocating and storing information in the neural circuitry, which happens through synaptic weight adaptation. It remains, however, largely unknown how memory allocation and storage can be achieved and coordinated to allow for a faithful representation of multiple memories without disruptive interference between them. In this theoretical study, we show that the interplay between conventional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling organizes synaptic weight adaptations such that a new stimulus forms a new memory and where different stimuli are assigned to distinct cell assemblies. The resulting dynamics can reproduce experimental in-vivo data, focusing on how diverse factors as neuronal excitability and network connectivity, influence memory formation. Thus, the here presented model suggests that a few fundamental synaptic mechanisms may suffice to implement memory allocation and storage in neural circuitry.",

Here we present Cancer Integration via Multikernel Learning (CIMLR), a new cancer subtyping method that integrates multi-omic data to reveal molecular subtypes of cancer. We apply CIMLR to multi-omic data from 36 cancer types and show significant improvements in both computational efficiency and ability to extract biologically meaningful cancer subtypes. The discovered subtypes exhibit significant differences in patient survival for 27 of 36 cancer types. Our analysis reveals integrated patterns of gene expression, methylation, point mutations and copy number changes in multiple cancers and highlights patterns specifically associated with poor patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "IFN{beta} typically induces an antiviral and immunoregulatory transcriptional program through the activation of ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9) transcriptional complexes. The response to IFN{beta} is context-dependent and is prone to crosstalk with other cytokines, such as TNF IFN{beta} and TNF synergize to drive a specific delayed transcriptional program. Previous observation led to the hypothesis that an alternative STAT1-independent pathway involving STAT2 and IRF9 might be involved in gene induction by the combination of IFN{beta} and TNF. Using genome wide transcriptional profiling by RNASeq, we found that the costimulation with IFN{beta} and TNF induces a broad antiviral and immunoregulatory transcriptional program independently of STAT1. Additionally, STAT2 and IRF9 are involved in the regulation of only a subset of these STAT1-independent genes. Consistent with the growing literature, STAT2 and IRF9 act in concert to regulate a subgroup of these genes. Unexpectedly, STAT2 and IRF9 were also engaged in specific independent pathways to regulate distinct sets of IFN{beta} and TNF-induced genes. Altogether these observations highlight the existence of distinct previously unrecognized non-canonical STAT1-independent, but STAT2 and/or IRF9-dependent pathways in the establishment of a delayed antiviral and immunoregulatory transcriptional program in conditions where elevated levels of both IFN{beta} and TNF are present.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome profiles of individual cells reflect true and often unexplored biological diversity, but are also affected by noise of biological and technical nature. This raises the need to explicitly model the resulting uncertainty and take it into account in any downstream analysis, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference, stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space.\\n\\nBy doing so, scVI pools information between similar cells or genes while taking nuisance factors of variation such as batch effects and limited sensitivity into account. To evaluate scVI, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to existing methods for distributional modeling and dimensionality reduction, all of which rely on generalized linear models. We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks - including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression - and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Since Denis Gabors pioneering paper on the discrete Gabor Expansion (Gabor, 1946), time-frequency signal analysis has proven to be an important tool for many fields. In neurophysiology, time-frequency analysis has often been used to characterize and describe transient bursts in local field potential data. However, these transient bursts have a wide range of variable durations, suggesting that a time-frequency-scale dictionary composed of elementary signal \"atoms\" may prove useful to more accurately match recorded bursts. While overcomplete multiscale dictionaries are useful, generating a sparse code over such dictionaries is a difficult computational problem. Existing adaptive algorithms for discovering a sparse description are slow and computationally intensive. Here we describe the Multiscale Adaptive Gabor Expansion (MAGE), which uses an implicit dictionary of parametric time-frequency-scale Gabor atoms to perform fast parameter reassignment to accelerate discovery of a sparse decomposition. Using analytic expressions together with numerical computation, MAGE is a greedy pursuit algorithm similar to Matching Pursuit, restricted to a dictionary of multiscale Gaussian-envelope Gabor atoms. MAGE parameter reassignment is robust in the presence of moderate noise. By expressing a unknown signal as a weighted sum of Gabor atoms, MAGE permits a more accurate estimate of the amplitude and phase of transient bursts than existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations arise during the life history of a cell. Mutations occurring in cancer driver genes may ultimately lead to the development of clinically detectable disease. Nascent cancer lineages continue to acquire somatic mutations throughout the neoplastic process and during cancer evolution (Martincorena and Campbell, 2015). Extrinsic and endogenous mutagenic factors contribute to the accumulation of these somatic mutations (Zhang and Pellman, 2015). Understanding the underlying factors generating somatic mutations is crucial for developing potential preventive, therapeutic and clinical decisions. Earlier studies have revealed that DNA replication timing (Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009) and chromatin modifications (Schuster-Bockler and Lehner, 2012) are associated with variations in mutational density. What is unclear from these early studies, however, is whether all extrinsic and exogenous factors that drive somatic mutational processes share a similar relationship with chromatin state and structure. In order to understand the interplay between spatial genome organization and specific individual mutational processes, we report here a study of 3000 tumor-normal pair whole genome datasets from more than 40 different human cancer types. Our analyses revealed that different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions between chromatin folding domains. APOBEC- or MSI-related mutations are enriched in transcriptionally-active domains while mutations occurring due to tobacco-smoke, ultraviolet (UV) light exposure or a signature of unknown aetiology (signature 17) enrich predominantly in transcriptionally-inactive domains. Active mutational processes dictate the mutation distributions in cancer genomes, and we show that mutational distributions shift during cancer evolution upon mutational processes switch. Moreover, a dramatic instance of extreme chromatin structure in humans, that of the unique folding pattern of the inactive X-chromosome leads to distinct somatic mutation distribution on X chromosome in females compared to males in various cancer types. Overall, the interplay between three-dimensional genome organization and active mutational processes has a substantial influence on the large-scale mutation rate variations observed in human cancer.",

    "abstract": "How do humans search for rewards? This question is commonly studied using multi-armed bandit tasks, which require participants to trade off exploration and exploitation. Standard multi-armed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We study a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an options spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. Our experiments rule out several heuristic explanations and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.",

Acrylamide is found in food products which have been subjected to very high temperatures. The application of LAB to remove many mutagens, by using the binding mechanism was assessed for acrylamide. When this acrylamide degrades it produces toxic gases like ammonia, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Asparagine is an important precursor to acrylamide formation. So in foods containing free asparagine group with reducing sugars will form acrylamide. We used liquid chromatography to determine the presence of acrylamide in the food product. Acrylamide content in the body is responsible for various mutations at the genomic level thereby, leading to cancers like colon, breast. It also leads to neural damages and is directly linked to Alzhimers disease. This study concludes the beneficial effects of consuming probiotics and suggests a way to reduce the acrylamide formation in food products.",

    "abstract": "Much effort has been made toward understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. Recent results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) suggest the importance of regulatory genetic effects and pervasive pleiotropy among complex traits. In this study, we propose a unified statistical approach, aiming to characterize relationship among complex traits, and prioritize risk variants by leveraging regulatory information collected in functional annotations. Specifically, we consider a latent probit model (LPM) to integrate summary-level GWAS data and functional annotations. The developed computational framework not only makes LPM scalable to hundreds of annotations and phenotypes, but also ensures its statistically guaranteed accuracy. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we evaluated LPMs performance and compared it with related methods. Then we applied it to analyze 44 GWASs with nine genic category annotations and 127 cell-type specific functional annotations. The results demonstrate the benefits of LPM and gain insights of genetic architecture of complex traits. The LPM package is available at https://github.com/mingjingsi/LPM.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiological invasions are major anthropogenic changes associated with threats to biodiversity and health. What determines the successful establishment of introduced populations still remains unsolved. Here we explore the appealing assertion that invasion success relies on immune phenotypic traits that would be advantageous in recently invaded sites.\n\nResultsWe compared gene expression profiles between anciently and recently established populations of two major invading species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus, in Senegal. Transcriptome analyses revealed respectively 364 and 83 differentially expressed genes along the mouse and rat invasion routes. Among them, 20.0% and 10.6% were annotated with functions related to immunity. All immune-related genes detected along the mouse invasion route were over-expressed in recently invaded sites. Genes of the complement activation pathway were over-represented. Results were less straightforward when considering the black rat as no particular immunological process was over-represented.\n\nConclusionsWe revealed changes in transcriptome profiles along invasion routes. Patterns differed between both invasive species. These changes potentially be driven by increased infection risks in recently invaded sites for the house mouse and stochastic events associated with colonization history for the black rat. These results provide a first step in identifying the immune ecoevolutionary processes potentially involved in invasion success.",

    "abstract": "The endangered whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is the largest fish on Earth and is a long-lived member of the ancient Elasmobranchii clade. To characterize the relationship between genome features and biological traits, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the whale shark and compared its genomic and physiological features to those of 81 animals and yeast. We examined scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic features also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length. Our large-scale comparative genomic analysis uncovered general features of metazoan genome architecture: GC content and codon adaptation index are negatively correlated, and neural connectivity genes are longer than average genes in most genomes. Focusing on the whale shark genome, we identified multiple features that significantly correlate with lifespan. Among these were very long gene length, due to large introns highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like LINEs, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neurodegeneration genes. The whale sharks genome had an expansion of gene families related to fatty acid metabolism and neurogenesis, with the slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date. Our comparative genomics approach uncovered multiple genetic features associated with body size, metabolic rate, and lifespan, and showed that the whale shark is a promising model for studies of neural architecture and lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Covalent probes can display unmatched potency, selectivity and duration of action, however, their discovery is challenging. In principle, fragments that can irreversibly bind their target can overcome the low affinity that limits reversible fragment screening. Such electrophilic fragments were considered non-selective and were rarely screened. We hypothesized that mild electrophiles might overcome the selectivity challenge, and constructed a library of 993 mildly electrophilic fragments. We characterized this library by a new high-throughput thiol-reactivity assay and screened them against ten cysteine-containing proteins. Highly reactive and promiscuous fragments were rare and could be easily eliminated. By contrast, we found selective hits for most targets. Combination with high-throughput crystallography allowed rapid progression to potent and selective probes for two enzymes, the deubiquitinase OTUB2, and the pyrophosphatase NUDT7. No inhibitors were previously known for either. This study highlights the potential of electrophile fragment screening as a practical and efficient tool for covalent ligand discovery.",

Mutations in the gene encoding for the centromere associated Drosophila speciation factor HMR show very similar phenotypes suggesting a role of HMR in chromocenter architecture and function. We performed confocal and super resolution microscopy as well as proximity based biotinylation experiments of HMR and its associated protein HP1a to generate a molecular map of HMR and HP1a bound chromatin.

    "abstract": "Inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein composition regulates nuclear function, affecting processes such as gene expression, chromosome organization, nuclear shape and stability. Mechanisms that drive changes in the INM proteome are poorly understood in part because it is difficult to definitively assay INM composition rigorously and systematically. Using a split-GFP complementation system to detect INM access, we examined the distribution of all C-terminally tagged Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane proteins in wild-type cells and in mutants affecting protein quality control pathways, such as INM-associated degradation (INMAD), ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and vacuolar proteolysis. Deletion of the E3 ligase Asi1 had the most pronounced effect on the INM compared to mutants in vacuolar or ER-associated degradation pathways, consistent with a role for Asi1 in the INMAD pathway. Our data suggests that Asi1 not only removes mis-targeted proteins at the INM, but it also controls the levels and distribution of native INM components, such as the membrane nucleoporin Pom33. Interestingly, loss of Asi1 does not affect Pom33 protein levels but instead alters Pom33 distribution in the NE through Pom33 ubiquitination, which drives INM redistribution. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the Asi1 E3 ligase has a novel function in INM protein regulation in addition to protein turnover.",

    "abstract": "Kainate receptors (KARs) regulate neuronal excitability and network function. Most KARs contain the subunit GluK2 and the properties of these receptors are determined in part by ADAR2-mediated mRNA editing of GluK2 that changes a genomically encoded glutamine (Q) to arginine (R). Suppression of synaptic activity reduces ADAR2-dependent Q/R editing of GluK2 with a consequential increase in GluK2-containing KAR surface expression. However, the mechanism underlying this reduction in GluK2 editing has not been addressed. Here we show that induction of KAR upscaling results in proteasomal degradation of ADAR2, which reduces GluK2 Q/R editing. Because KARs incorporating unedited GluK2(Q) assemble and exit the ER more efficiently this leads to an upscaling of KAR surface expression. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that partial ADAR2 knockdown phenocopies and occludes KAR upscaling. Moreover, we show that although the AMPAR subunit GluA2 also undergoes ADAR2-dependent Q/R editing, this process does not mediate AMPAR upscaling. These data demonstrate that activity-dependent regulation of ADAR2 proteostasis and GluK2 Q/R editing are key determinants of KAR, but not AMPAR, trafficking and upscaling.\\n\\nSummary statementSynaptic suppression promotes proteasomal degradation of the mRNA-editing enzyme ADAR2. Decreased ADAR2 levels reduce Q/R editing of the kainate receptor subunit GluK2 leading to enhanced surface expression and homeostatic upscaling.",

Here we present single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of LRRC8A in complex with the inhibitor DCPIB reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. DCPIB plugs the channel like a cork in a bottle - binding in the extracellular selectivity filter and sterically occluding ion conduction. Constricted and expanded structures reveal coupled dilation of cytoplasmic LRRs and the channel pore, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by internal stimuli. Conformational and symmetry differences between LRRC8A structures determined in detergent micelles and lipid bilayers related to reorganization of intersubunit lipid binding sites demonstrate a critical role for the membrane in determining channel structure. These results provide insight into LRRC8 gating and inhibition and the role of lipids in the structure of an ionic-strength sensing ion channel.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are cylindrical polymers of {beta}-tubulin that play critical roles in fundamental processes like chromosome segregation and vesicular transport. Microtubules display dynamic instability, switching stochastically between growing and rapid shrinking as a consequence of GTPase activity in the lattice. The molecular mechanisms behind microtubule catastrophe, the switch from growing to rapid shrinking, remain poorly defined. Indeed, two-state stochastic models that seek to describe microtubule dynamics purely in terms of the biochemical properties of GTP- and GDP-bound {beta}-tubulin incorrectly predict the concentration-dependence of microtubule catastrophe. Recent studies provided evidence for three distinct conformations of {beta}-tubulin in the lattice that likely correspond to GTP, GDP.Pi, and GDP. The incommensurate lattices observed for these different conformations raises the possibility that in a mixed nucleotide state lattice, neighboring tubulin dimers might modulate each others conformations and hence their biochemistry. We explored whether incorporating a GDP.Pi state or the likely effects of conformational accommodation can improve predictions of catastrophe. Adding a GDP.Pi intermediate did not improve the model. In contrast, adding neighbor-dependent modulation of tubulin biochemistry improved predictions of catastrophe. Conformational accommodation should propagate beyond nearest-neighbor contacts, and consequently our modeling demonstrates that long-range, through-lattice effects are important determinants of microtubule catastrophe.",

    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are key for the cells to adapt and response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimulus. It has been shown that genotoxic stress induces global hypomethylation as a result of decreased expression of DNA methyl transferases (DNMT). We hypothesized that DNA damage suppresses long non-coding RNA expression in the vasculature via DNA methylation leading to more robust DNA repair/survival or cellular senescence/death cell fate decisions. We show here that ionizing radiation reduces the expression of DNMTs in the vascular endothelium and this leads to increased expression of the anti-apoptotic lncRNA MEG9. MEG9 is a lncRNA from the DLK1-DIO3 ncRNA cluster. Loss-of-function studies using RNA gapmers indicate that MEG9 protects endothelial cells from DNA damage induced cell death. Consistent with this phenotype, knockdown of MEG9 decreases growth factor dependent angiogenesis in a 3D fibrin gel angiogenesis assay. Mechanistically, we observed that MEG9 knockdown decreased the expression of cell survival genes including survivin and induced the expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bad/Bax. Taken together, our findings illustrate how DNA methylation at selective lncRNA loci can regulate their expression and drive endothelial cell fate decisions.",

Using micropatterned stimulatory substrates that enable synapse growth in three dimensions, we found that perforin release occurs at the base of actin-rich protrusions that extend from central and intermediate locations within the synapse. These protrusions, which depended on the cytoskeletal regulator WASP and the Arp2/3 actin nucleation complex, were required for synaptic force exertion and efficient killing. They also mediated physical distortion of the target cell surface during CTL-target cell interactions.

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to explore cell types, states, and developmental trajectories to broaden understanding of cell heterogeneity in tissues and organs. Analysis of these sparse, high-dimensional experimental results requires dimension reduction. Several methods have been developed to estimate low-dimensional embeddings for filtered and normalized single cell data. However, methods have yet to be developed for unfiltered and unnormalized count data. We present a nonlinear latent variable model with robust, heavy-tailed error and adaptive kernel learning to estimate low-dimensional nonlinear structure in scRNA-seq data. Gene expression in a single cell is modeled as a noisy draw from a Gaussian process in high dimensions from low-dimensional latent positions. This model is called the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM). We model residual errors with a heavy-tailed Students t-distribution to estimate a manifold that is robust to technical and biological noise. We compare our approach to common dimension reduction tools to highlight our models ability to enable important downstream tasks, including clustering and inferring cell developmental trajectories, on available experimental data. We show that our robust nonlinear manifold is well suited for raw, unfiltered gene counts from high throughput sequencing technologies for visualization and exploration of cell states.",

We compared our new assay to our previous image analysis method and the trypsin-hydroxyproline assay, which is the only other available method to directly quantify denatured collagen. Relative quantification of denatured collagen was performed in rat tail tendon fascicles subjected to incremental tensile overload, and normal and ostoeoarthritic guinea pig cartilage. In addition, the absolute amount of denatured collagen was determined in rat tail tendon by correlating F-CHP fluorescence with percent denatured collagen as determined by the trypsin-hydroxyproline assay. Rat tail tendon fascicles stretched to low strains (<7.5%) exhibited minimal denature collagen, but values rapidly increased at medium strains (7.5-10.5%) and plateaued at high strains ([&ge;]12%). Osteoarthritic cartilage had higher F-CHP fluorescence than healthy cartilage. Both of these outcomes are consistent with previous studies. With the calibration curve, the microplate assay was able to absolutely quantify denatured collagen in mechanically damaged rat tail tendon fascicles as reliably as the trypsin-hydroxyproline assay. Further, we achieved these results more efficiently than current methods in a rapid, high-throughput manner, with multiple types of collagenous tissue while maintaining accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific genes are believed to be good drug targets due to improved safety. Here we show that this intuitive notion is not reflected in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, despite the historic success of tissue-specific targets and their 2.3-fold overrepresentation among targets of marketed non-oncology drugs. We compare properties of tissue-specific genes and drug targets. We show that tissue-specificity of the target may also be related to efficacy of the drug. The relationship may be indirect (enrichment in Mendelian disease genes) or direct (elevated ability to spread perturbations in human protein-protein interactome for tissue-specifically produced enzymes and secreted proteins). Reduced evolutionary conservation of tissue-specific genes may represent a bottleneck for drug projects, prompting development of novel models with smaller evolutionary gap to humans. We highlight numerous open opportunities to use tissue-specific genes in drug research and hope that the current study will facilitate discovery efforts.",

    "abstract": "Several post-translational modifications of proteins lie within regions of disorder, stretches of amino acid residues that exhibit a dynamic tertiary structure and resist crystallization. Such localization has been proposed to expand the binding versatility of the disordered regions, and hence, the repertoire of interacting partners for the proteins. However, investigating a dataset of 500 human N-linked glycoproteins, we observed that the sites of N-linked glycosylations, or N-glycosites, lay predominantly within the regions of predicted order rather than their unstructured counterparts. This mutual exclusivity between disordered stretches and N-glycosites could not be reconciled merely through asymmetry in distribution of asparagines, serines or threonines residues, which comprise the minimum-required signature for conjugation by N-linked glycans, but rather by a contextual enrichment of these residues next to each other within the ordered portions. In fact, N-glycosite neighborhoods and disordered stretches showed distinct sets of enriched residues suggesting their individualized roles in protein phenotype. N-glycosite neighborhood residues also showed higher phylogenetic conservation than disordered stretches within amniote orthologs of glycoproteins. However, a universal search for residue-combinations that are putatively domain-constitutive ranked the disordered regions higher than the N-glycosite neighborhoods. We propose that amino acid residue-combinations bias the permissivity for N-glycoconjugation within ordered regions, so as to balance the tradeoff between the evolution of protein stability, and function, contributed by the N-linked glycans and disordered regions respectively.",

    "abstract": "Boswellia serrata, an economically important indigenous tree of dry deciduous forests, provides oleoresin gum of pharmaceutical significance and excellent pulp for paper industries, but faces threat to extinction due to poor natural regeneration and commercial exploitation. 240 individuals of the species representing 12 locations of its natural distribution in central India were investigated to compare the genetic differentiation indices, QST for GBH and wood fiber length and {phi}ST for neutral (RAPD+ISSR) markers. The comparison for paired locations was more informative than for metapopulation. The most paired locations were either under the stabilizing selection (QST (L) < {Phi}ST (L)) or in the genetic drift (QST(L) = {Phi}ST (L)) whereas a relatively small number of paired locations was under the divergent selection (QS T(L) > {Phi}ST (L)). The comparison for the metapopulation generating only a single trend of QST (P) > {Phi}ST (P) is, therefore, misleading. For conservation, the genetically deficit locations (QST (L) < {Phi}ST (L) and QST (L) = {Phi}ST (L)) of B. serrata warrant for reinforcement of their genetic diversity by introduction of genotypes from other genetically divergent locations (QST (L) > {Phi}ST (L)), which would check the fragmentation and genetic drift, resulting in reproductive vigour, natural regeneration and reverse the endangered status of the species.",

    "abstract": "More and more genome-wide association studies are being designed to uncover the full genetic basis of common diseases. Nonetheless, the resulting loci are often insufficient to fully recover the observed heritability. Epistasis, or gene-gene interaction, is one of many hypotheses put forward to explain this missing heritability. In the present work, we propose epiGWAS, a new approach for epistasis detection that identifies interactions between a target SNP and the rest of the genome. This contrasts with the classical strategy of epistasis detection through exhaustive pairwise SNP testing. We draw inspiration from causal inference in randomized clinical trials, which allows us to take into account linkage disequilibrium. EpiGWAS encompasses several methods, which we compare to state-of-the-art techniques for epistasis detection on simulated and real data. The promising results demonstrate empirically the benefits of EpiGWAS to identify pairwise interactions.\n\nAuthor summaryGenome-wide association studies are now a major tool for the discovery of biomarkers for complex diseases. However, the complexity of genetic architecture, in particular linkage disequilibrium, complicates that mission. Moreover, intergenic interactions, or epistasis, are often not correctly captured by the classical statistical methodologies. In our work, we propose a new framework to model linkage disequilibrium, which is based on propensity scores. Our goal is to detect epistatic interactions between a predetermined target locus and the rest of the genotype. The target may be identified from the literature, experiments, or top hits in previous genome-wide association studies. Recovering interactions with validated causal loci helps improve both interpretability and statistical power. Multi-targeting drug discovery can also benefit from our work through the combination of existing drugs with new ones for greater drug response.",

Here we report first use of a modified INTACT method in behavioral epigenetics of Drosophila: a method we call mini-INTACT. Using ChIP-seq on mini-INTACT purified dopaminergic nuclei, we identified epigenetic signatures in socially-isolated and socially-enriched Drosophila males. Social experience altered the epigenetic landscape in clusters of genes involved in transcription and neural function. Some of these alterations were predicted by expression changes of four transcription factors and the prevalence of their binding sites in several clusters. These transcription factors were previously identified as activity-regulated genes and their knockdown in dopaminergic neurons reduced the effects of social experience on sleep. Our work enables the use of Drosophila as a model for cell-type-specific behavioral epigenetics.",

    "abstract": "Histopathology defines the gold standard in oncology. Automatic analysis of pathology images could thus have a significant impact on diagnoses, prognoses and treatment decisions for cancer patients. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown strong performance in computational histopathology tasks. However, given it remains intractable to process pathology slides in their entirety, CNNs have traditionally performed inference on small individual patches extracted from the image. This often requires a significant amount of computation and can result in ignoring potentially relevant spatial and contextual information. Being able to process larger input patches and locating discriminatory regions more efficiently could help improve both computational and task specific performance. Inspired by the recent success of Deep Recurrent Attention Models (DRAMs) in image recognition tasks, we propose a novel attention-based architecture for classification in histopathology. Similar to CNNs, DRAMs have a degree of translation invariance built-in, but the amount of computation performed can be controlled independently from the input image size. The model is a deep recurrent neural network trained with reinforcement learning to attend to the most relevant areas of large input patches. We evaluate our model on histological and molecular subtype classification tasks for the glioma cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our results suggest that the DRAM has comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNNs despite only processing a select number of patches.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in nosocomial pathogens has restricted the clinical efficacy of this antibiotic class. In Acinetobacter baumannii, the majority of clinical isolates now show high-level resistance due to mutations in gyrA (DNA gyrase) and parC (Topo IV). To investigate the molecular basis for fluoroquinolone resistance, an exhaustive mutation analysis was performed in both drug sensitive and resistant strains to identify loci that alter the sensitivity of the organism to ciprofloxacin. To this end, parallel fitness tests of over 60,000 unique insertion mutations were performed in strains with various alleles in genes encoding the drug targets. The spectrum of mutations that altered drug sensitivity was found to be similar in the drug sensitive and double mutant gyrAparC background having resistance alleles in both genes. In contrast, introduction of a single gyrA resistance allele, resulting in preferential poisoning of Topo IV by ciprofloxacin, led to extreme alterations in the insertion mutation fitness landscape. The distinguishing feature of preferential Topo IV poisoning was induction of DNA synthesis in the region of two endogenous prophages, which appeared to occur in situ. Induction of the selective DNA synthesis in the gyrA background was also linked to enhanced activation of SOS response and heightened transcription of prophage genes relative to that observed in either the WT or gyrAparC double mutants. Therefore, the accumulation of mutations that result in the stepwise evolution of high ciprofloxacin resistance is tightly connected to suppression of hyperactivation of the SOS response and endogenous prophage DNA synthesis.\\n\\nImportanceFluoroquinolones have been extremely successful antibiotics. Their clinical efficacy derives from the ability to target multiple bacterial enzymes critical to DNA replication, the topoisomerases DNA gyrase and Topo IV. Unfortunately, mutations lowering drug affinity for both enzymes are now widespread, rendering these drugs ineffective for many pathogens. To undermine this form of resistance, we sought to understand how bacteria with target alterations differentially cope with fluoroquinolone exposures. We studied this problem in the nosocomial pathogen A. baumannii, which causes resistant, life-threating infections. Employing genome-wide approaches, we uncovered numerous pathways that could be exploited to lower fluoroquinolone resistance independently of target alteration. Remarkably, fluoroquinolone targeting of Topo IV in specific mutants caused dramatic prophage hyperinduction, a response that was muted in strains with DNA gyrase as the primary target. This work demonstrates that resistance evolution via target modification can profoundly modulate the antibiotic stress response, revealing potential resistance-associated liabilities.",

Specifically, we propose that people leverage insights from response-based performance monitoring - outcome predictions and confidence - to control learning from feedback. In line with predictions from a Bayesian inference model, we find that people who are better at calibrating their confidence to the precision of their outcome predictions learn more quickly. Further in line with our proposal, EEG signatures of feedback processing are sensitive to the accuracy of, and confidence in, post-response outcome predictions.

Here, we tested this by asking participants to reproduce the perceived spatial trajectory of an isolated point stimulus moving on different horizontal-depth paths either peri-foveally or peripherally while participants gaze was oriented at different vergence and version angles. We found large systematic errors in the perceived motion trajectory that reflected an intermediate reference frame between a purely retinal interpretation of binocular retinal motion (ignoring vergence and version) and the spatially correct motion. A simple geometric model could capture the behavior well, revealing that participants tended to underestimate their version by as much as 17%, overestimate their vergence by as much as 22%, and underestimate the overall change in retinal disparity by as much as 64%. Since such large perceptual errors are not observed in everyday viewing, we suggest that other monocular and/or contextual cues are required for accurate real-world motion in depth perception.",

    "abstract": "We have explored the synaptic networks responsible for the unique capacity of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) to encode overall light intensity. This luminance signal is crucial for circadian, pupillary and related reflexive responses light. By combined glutamate-sensor imaging and patch recording of postsynaptic RGCs, we show that the capacity for intensity-encoding is widespread among cone bipolar types, including OFF types.\\n\\nNonetheless, the bipolar cells that drive ipRGCs appear to carry the strongest luminance signal. By serial electron microscopic reconstruction, we show that Type 6 ON cone bipolar cells are the dominant source of such input, with more modest input from Types 7, 8 and 9 and virtually none from Types 5i, 5o, 5t or rod bipolar cells. In conventional RGCs, the excitatory drive from bipolar cells is high-pass temporally filtered more than it is in ipRGCs. Amacrine-to-bipolar cell feedback seems to contribute surprisingly little to this filtering, implicating mostly postsynaptic mechanisms. Most ipRGCs sample from all bipolar terminals costratifying with their dendrites, but M1 cells avoid all OFF bipolar input and accept only ectopic ribbon synapses from ON cone bipolar axonal shafts. These are remarkable monad synapses, equipped with as many as a dozen ribbons and only one postsynaptic process.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety results in sub-optimal motor performance and learning; yet, the precise mechanisms through which these modifications occur remain unknown. Using a reward-based motor sequence learning paradigm, we show that concurrent and prior anxiety states impair learning by biasing estimates about the hidden performance goal and the stability of such estimates over time (volatility). In an electroencephalography study, three groups of participants completed our motor task, which had separate phases for motor exploration (baseline) and reward-based learning. Anxiety was manipulated either during the initial baseline exploration phase or while learning. We show that anxiety induced at baseline reduced motor variability, undermining subsequent reward-based learning. Mechanistically, however, the most direct consequence of state anxiety was an underestimation of the hidden performance goal and a higher tendency to believe that the goal was unstable over time. Further, anxiety decreased uncertainty about volatility, which attenuated the update of beliefs about this quantity. Changes in the amplitude and burst distribution of sensorimotor and prefrontal beta oscillations were observed at baseline, which were primarily explained by the anxiety induction. These changes extended to the subsequent learning phase, where phasic increases in beta power and in the rate of long (> 500 ms) oscillation bursts following reward feedback were linked to smaller updates in predictions about volatility, with a higher anxiety-related increase explaining the biased volatility estimates. These data suggest that state anxiety alters the dynamics of beta oscillations during general performance, yet more prominently during reward processing, thereby impairing proper updating of motor predictions when learning in unstable environments.",

    "abstract": "Many models of classical conditioning fail to describe important phenomena, notably the rapid return of fear after extinction. To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the models ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla-Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputational researchers are increasingly interested in a structured form of learning known as latent-state inferences. Latent-state inferences is a type of learning that involves categorizing, generalizing, and recalling disparate associations between observations in ones environment and is used in situations when the correct association is latent or unknown. This type of learning has been used to explain overgeneralization of a fear memory and the cognitive role of certain brain regions important to cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry. Accordingly, latent-state inferences are an important area of inquiry. Through simulation and theory, we establish a new model of latent-state inferences. Moving forward, we aim to use this framework to measure latent-state inferences in healthy and psychiatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Microbes face a tradeoff between being metabolically independent and relying on neighboring organisms for the supply of some essential metabolites. This balance of conflicting strategies affects microbial community structure and dynamics, with important implications for microbiome research and synthetic ecology. A \\\"gedanken experiment\\\" to investigate this tradeoff would involve monitoring the rise of mutual dependence as the number of metabolic reactions allowed in an organism is increasingly constrained. The expectation is that below a certain number of reactions, no individual organism would be able to grow in isolation, and cross-feeding partnerships and division of labor would emerge. We implemented this idealized experiment using in silico genome-scale models. In particular, we used mixed integer linear programming to identify tradeoff solutions in communities of Escherichia coli strains. The strategies we found reveal a large space of nuanced and nonintuitive metabolic division of labor opportunities, including, for example, splitting the TCA cycle into two separate halves. The systematic computation of possible division of labor solutions for 1-, 2-, and 3-strain consortia resulted in a rich and complex landscape. This landscape displays a nonlinear boundary, indicating that the loss of an intracellular reaction is not necessarily compensated by a single imported metabolite. Different regions in this landscape are associated with specific solutions and patterns of exchanged metabolites. Our approach also predicts the existence of regions in this landscape where independent bacteria are viable, but outcompeted by cross-feeding pairs, providing a possible incentive for the rise of division of labor.",

    "abstract": "Small molecule docking has proven to be invaluable for drug design and discovery. However, existing docking methods have several limitations, such as, improper treatment of the interactions of essential components in the chemical environment of the binding pocket (e.g. cofactors, metal-ions, etc.), incomplete sampling of chemically relevant ligand conformational space, and the inability to consistently correlate docking scores of the best binding pose with experimental binding affinities. We present CANDOCK, a novel docking algorithm that utilizes a hierarchical approach to reconstruct ligands from an atomic grid using graph theory and generalized statistical potential functions to sample biologically relevant ligand conformations. Our algorithm accounts for protein flexibility, solvent, metal ions and cofactors interactions in the binding pocket that are traditionally ignored by current methods. We evaluate the algorithm on the PDBbind and Astex proteins to show its ability to reproduce the binding mode of the ligands that is independent of the initial ligand conformation in these benchmarks. Finally, we identify the best selector and ranker potential functions, such that, the statistical score of best selected docked pose correlates with the experimental binding affinities of the ligands for any given protein target. Our results indicate that CANDOCK is a generalized flexible docking method that addresses several limitations of current docking methods by considering all interactions in the chemical environment of a binding pocket for correlating the best docked pose with biological activity.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=28 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/442897v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (16K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c1b2b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba66a4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a8bfd3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c9d3bb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Since the initial description of the genomic patterns expected under models of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation and on multiple beneficial mutations--so-called soft selective sweeps--researchers have sought to identify these patterns in natural population data. Indeed, over the past two years, large-scale data analyses have argued that soft sweeps are pervasive across organisms of very different effective population size and mutation rate--humans, Drosophila, and HIV. Yet, others have evaluated the relevance of these models to natural populations, as well as the identifiability of the models relative to other known population-level processes, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. Here, we look to reconcile these opposing results by carefully evaluating three recent studies and their underlying methodologies. Using population genetic theory, as well as extensive simulation, we find that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps serve as the more parsimonious explanation. These findings represent a necessary response to the growing tendency of invoking parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of pervasive positive selection, and neglecting best practices regarding the construction of proper demographic null models.",

Over evolutionary time, dhole and the subsequent divergent wild canids have lost coat patterns found in African wild dog. Here we report the first high coverage genome survey of Asiatic wild dog and mapped it with African wild dog, dingo and domestic dog to assess the structural variants. We generated a total of 124.8 Gb data from 416140921 raw read pairs and retained 398659457 reads with 52X coverage and mapped 99.16% of the clean reads to the three reference genomes. We identified ~13553269 SNVs, ~2858184 InDels, ~41000 SVs, ~1854109 SSRs and about 1000 CNVs. We compared the annotated genome of dingo and domestic dog with dhole genome sequence to understand the role of genes responsible in pelage pattern, dentition and mammary glands. Positively selected genes for these phenotypes were looked for SNP variants and top ranked genes for coat pattern, dentition and mammary glands were found to play a role in signalling and developmental pathways. Mitochondrial genome assembly predicted 35 genes, 11 CDS and 24 tRNA. This genome information will help in understanding the divergence of two monophlyletic canids, Cuon and Lycaon, and the evolutionary adaptations of dholes with respect to other canids.",

    "abstract": "Metatranscriptomic sequencing has recently been applied to study how pathogens and probiotics affect human gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota, which provides new insights into their mechanisms of action. In this study, metatranscriptomic sequencing was applied to deduce the in vivo expression patterns of an ingested Lactobacillus casei strain, which was compared with its in vitro growth transcriptomes. Extraction of the strain-specific reads revealed that transcripts from the ingested L. casei were increased, while those from the resident L. paracasei strains remained unchanged. Mapping of all metatranscriptomic reads and transcriptomic reads to L. casei genome showed that gene expression in vitro and in vivo differed dramatically. About 39% (1163) mRNAs and 45% (93) sRNAs of L. casei well-expressed were repressed after ingested into human gut. Expression of ABC transporter genes and amino acid metabolism genes was induced at day-14 of ingestion; and genes for sugar and SCFA metabolisms were activated at day-28 of ingestion. Moreover, expression of sRNAs specific to the in vitro log phase was more likely to be activated in human gut. Expression of rli28c sRNA with peaked expression during the in vitro stationary phase was also activated in human gut; this sRNA repressed L. casei growth and lactic acid production in vitro. These findings implicate that the ingested L. casei might have to successfully change its transcription patterns to survive in human gut, and the time-dependent activation patterns indicate a highly dynamic cross-talk between the probiotic and human gut including its microbe community.\\n\\nImportanceProbiotic bacteria are important in food industry and as model microorganisms in understanding bacterial gene regulation. Although probiotic functions and mechanisms in human gastrointestinal tract are linked to the unique probiotic gene expression, it remains elusive how transcription of probiotic bacteria is dynamically regulated after being ingested. Previous study of probiotic gene expression in human fecal samples has been restricted due to its low abundance and the presence of of closely related species. In this study, we took the advantage of the good depth of metatranscriptomic sequencing reads and developed a strain-specific read analysis method to discriminate the transcription of the probiotic Lactobacillus casei and those of its resident relatives. This approach and additional bioinformatics analysis allowed the first study of the dynamic transcriptome profiles of probiotic L casei in vivo. The novel findings indicate a highly regulated repression and dynamic activation of probiotic genome in human GI tract.",

However, host shutoff is not indiscriminate, since viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are still synthesized during shutoff. The molecular determinants of target selectivity in host shutoff remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the influenza A virus shutoff factor PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. PA-X preferentially degrades spliced mRNAs, both transcriptome-wide and in reporter assays. Moreover, proximity-labeling proteomics revealed that PA-X interacts with cellular proteins involved in RNA splicing. The interaction with splicing contributes to target discrimination and is unique among viral host shutoff nucleases. This novel mechanism sheds light on the specificity of viral control of host gene expression and may provide opportunities for development of new host-targeted antivirals.",

Representational shifts with changes in the context, referred to as remapping, have been extensively studied. However, less is known about the nature of transitions between representations. In this study, we leverage a large dataset of 2056 neurons recorded while rats performed an olfactory memory task with a predictable temporal structure involving trials and inter-trial intervals, separated by salient boundaries at the trial start and trial end. We found that trial epochs were associated with stable hippocampal population representations, despite moment to moment variability in stimuli and behavior. Representations of trial and inter-trial interval epochs were far more distinct than spatial factors would predict and the transitions between the two were abrupt, with a sharp boundary suggestive of a dynamic shift in the representational state. This boundary was associated with a large spike in multi-unit activity, with many individual cells specifically active at the start or end of each trial. Both epochs and boundaries were encoded by hippocampal populations, and these representations carried information on orthogonal axes readily identified using principal component analysis. We suggest that the activity spike at trial boundaries might serve to drive hippocampal activity from one stable state to another, and may play a role in segmenting continuous experience into discrete episodic memories.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in biology is how organisms integrate sensory and social evidence to make decisions. However, few models describe how both these streams of information can be combined to optimize choices. Here we develop a normative model for collective decision making in a network of agents performing a two-alternative forced choice task. We assume that rational (Bayesian) agents in this network make private measurements, and observe the decisions of their neighbors until they accumulate sufficient evidence to make an irreversible choice. As each agent communicates its decision to those observing it, the flow of social information is described by a directed graph. The decision-making process in this setting is intuitive, but can be complex. We describe when and how the absence of a decision of a neighboring agent communicates social information, and how an agent must marginalize over all unobserved decisions. We also show how decision thresholds and network connectivity affect group evidence accumulation, and describe the dynamics of decision making in social cliques. Our model provides a bridge between the abstractions used in the economics literature and the evidence accumulator models used widely in neuroscience and psychology.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental property of topological dimension of neural activity has never been measured before. We measured the topological dimension of the activity of 89 rat hippocampal place cells recorded during foraging using the neighborhood boundary countdown method. Points were rate vectors forming a manifold in an 89 dimensional rate space Since a boundary has one less dimension than the neighborhood it encloses, reducing the dimension in sequential radial cuts finally arrives at boundary that is two points. The number of cuts required is the topological dimension of the set. Due to sparsity, we used a shell-like boundary with thickness. As expected, we found the large inductive dimension of this set of points to be two. To examine the robustness of the method, we used both real and modeled place cells and varied the number of neurons, duration of the time step and smoothing, radius and thickness for the boundary, decrement of the radius with each cut, requirements for the center point, and number of points in the final cluster. With the exception of shell thickness, the result was insensitive to these variations. Knowing the topological dimension allows application of rigorous topological principles to the activity of neuron populations. The method potentially can be applied to other neural classes and other behaviors, to enumerate firing variables when they are unknown, even count the factors influencing neural activity in sleep.",

    "abstract": "The electrophysiological signatures of encoding and retrieval recorded from mesial temporal lobe (MTL) structures are observed as event related potentials (ERPs) during visual memory tasks. The waveforms of the ERPs associated with the onset of visual stimuli (image-onset) and eye movements (saccades and fixations) provide insights into the mechanisms of their generation. We hypothesized that since eye movements and image-onset (common methods of stimulus presentation when testing memory) provide MTL structures with salient visual information, that perhaps they both engage similar neural mechanisms. To explore this question, we used intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) data from the MTLs of 11 patients with medically refractory epilepsy who participated in a visual search task. We sought to characterize electrophysiological responses of MTL structures to saccades, fixations and image onset. We demonstrate that the image-onset response is an evoked/additive response with a low-frequency power increase and post-stimulus phase clustering. In contrast, ERPs following eye movements appeared to arise from phase resetting of higher frequencies than the image onset ERP. Intriguingly, this reset was associated with saccade onset and not saccade termination (fixation), suggesting it is likely the MTL response to a corollary discharge, rather than a response to visual stimulation - in stark contrast to the image onset response. The distinct mechanistic underpinnings of these two ERP may help guide future development of visual memory tasks.",

When models contain many long contexts, existing implementations are either unable to handle genome-scale training datasets within typical memory budgets, or they are optimized for specific model variants and are thus inflexible.\\n\\nResultsWe provide practical, versatile representations of variable-order Markov models and of interpolated Markov models, that support a large number of context-selection criteria, scoring functions, probability smoothing methods, and interpolations, and that take up to 4 times less space than previous implementations based on the suffix array, regardless of the number and length of contexts, and up to 10 times less space than previous trie-based representations, or more, while matching the size of related, state-of-the-art data structures from Natural Language Processing. We describe how to further compress our indexes to a quantity related to the redundancy of the training data, saving up to 90% of their space on repetitive datasets, and making them become up to 60 times smaller than previous implementations based on the suffix array. Finally, we show how to exploit constraints on the length and frequency of contexts to further shrink our compressed indexes to half of their size or more, achieving data structures that are 100 times smaller than previous implementations based on the suffix array, or more. This allows variable-order Markov models to be trained on bigger datasets and with longer contexts on the same hardware, thus possibly enabling new applications.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationhttps://github.com/jnalanko/VOMM",

    "abstract": "Due to their capability to transport chemicals or proteins into target cells, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are being developed as therapy delivery tools. However, and despite their interesting properties, arginine-rich CPPs often show toxicity for reasons that remain poorly understood. Using a (PR)n dipeptide repeat that has been linked to amyotrophic-lateral sclerosis (ALS) as a model of an arginine-rich CPP, we here show that the presence of (PR)n leads to a generalized displacement of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins from chromatin and mRNA. Accordingly, any reaction involving nucleic acids such as RNA transcription, translation, splicing and degradation or DNA replication and repair are impaired by the presence of the CPP. Interestingly, the effects of (PR)n are fully mimicked by PROTAMINE, a small arginine-rich protein that displaces histones from chromatin during spermatogenesis. We propose that widespread coating of nucleic acids and consequent displacement of RNA- and DNA-binding factors from chromatin and mRNA accounts for the toxicity of arginine-rich CPPs, including those that have been recently associated to the onset of ALS.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that emotionally salient stimuli evoke greater visual cortex activation than neutral ones, and can distract attention from competing tasks. Yet less is known about underlying neurobiological processes. As a proxy of population level biased competition, EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials are sensitive to competition effects from salient stimuli. Here we wished to examine whether individual differences in norepinephrine activity play a role in emotionally-biased competition.\\n\\nOur previous research has found robust effects of a common variation in the ADRA2B gene, coding for alpha2B norepinephrine (NE) receptors, on emotional modulation of attention and memory. In the present study, EEG was collected while 87 carriers of the ADRA2B deletion variant and 95 non-carriers (final sample) performed a change detection task in which target gratings (gabor patches) were superimposed directly over angry, happy, and neutral faces. Participants indicated the number of phase changes (0-3) in the target. Overlapping targets and distractors were flickered at a distinct driving frequencies. Relative EEG power for faces vs. targets at the driving frequency served as an index of cortical resources allocated to each of the competing stimuli. Deletion carriers and non-carriers were randomly assigned to Discovery and Replication samples and reliability of results across samples was assessed before the groups were combined for greater power.\\n\\nOverall happy faces evoked higher competition than angry or neutral faces; however, we observed no hypothesized effects of ADRA2B. Increased competition from happy faces was not due to the effect of low-level visual features or individuals low in social anxiety. Our results indicate that emotionally biased competition during sustained attention, while reliably observed in young adults, is not influenced by commonly observed individual differences linked to NE receptor function. They further indicate an overall pattern of affectively-biased competition for happy faces, which we interpret in relation to previously observed boundary conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite much progress in cancer research, its incidence and mortality continue to rise. A robust biomarker that would predict tumor behavior is highly desirable and could improve patient treatment and prognosis.\\n\\nMethodsIn a retrospective bioinformatics analysis involving patients with liver cancer (n=839), we developed a prognostic signature consisting of 45 genes associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cellular responses to hypoxia. From this gene set, we were able to identify a second prognostic signature comprised of 8 genes. Its performance was further validated in five other cancers: head and neck (n=520), renal papillary cell (n=290), lung (n=515), pancreas (n=178) and endometrial (n=370).\\n\\nFindingsThe 45-gene signature predicted overall survival in three liver cancer cohorts: hazard ratio (HR)=1.82, P=0.006; HR=1.84, P=0.008 and HR=2.67, P=0.003. Additionally, the reduced 8-gene signature was sufficient and effective in predicting survival in liver and five other cancers: liver (HR=2.36, P=0.0003; HR=2.43, P=0.0002 and HR=3.45, P=0.0007), head and neck (HR=1.64, P=0.004), renal papillary cell (HR=2.31, P=0.04), lung (HR=1.45, P=0.03), pancreas (HR=1.96, P=0.006) and endometrial (HR=2.33, P=0.003). Receiver operating characteristic analyses demonstrated both signatures superior performance over current tumor staging parameters. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that both 45-gene and 8-gene signatures were independent of other clinicopathological features in these cancers. Combining the gene signatures with somatic mutation profiles increased their prognostic ability.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study, to our knowledge, is the first to identify a gene signature uniting both tumor hypoxia and lymphocytic infiltration as a prognostic determinant in six cancer types (n=2,712). The 8-gene signature can be used for patient risk stratification by incorporating hypoxia information to aid clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "Local populations of the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can be genetically almost as diverse as global populations. To investigate the effect of local genetic variation on heritable traits, we developed a new recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from four wild isolates. The wild isolates were collected from two closely located sites in France: Orsay and Santeuil. By crossing these four genetically diverse parental isolates a population of 200 RILs was constructed. RNA-seq was used to obtain sequence polymorphisms identifying almost 9000 SNPs variable between the four genotypes with an average spacing of 11 kb, possibly doubling the mapping resolution relative to currently available RIL panels. The SNPs were used to construct a genetic map to facilitate QTL analysis. Life history traits, such as lifespan, stress resistance, developmental speed and population growth were measured in different environments. For most traits substantial variation was found, and multiple QTLs could be detected, including novel QTLs not found in previous QTL analysis, for example for lifespan or pathogen responses. This shows that recombining genetic variation across C. elegans populations that are in geographical close proximity provides ample variation for QTL mapping. Taken together, we show that RNA-seq can be used for genotyping, that using more parents than the classical two parental genotypes to construct a RIL population facilitates the detection of QTLs and that the use of wild isolates permits analysis of local adaptation and life history trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Genomic selection offers several routes for increasing genetic gain or efficiency of plant breeding programs. In various species of livestock there is empirical evidence of increased rates of genetic gain from the use of genomic selection to target different aspects of the breeders equation. Accurate predictions of genomic breeding value are central to this and the design of training sets is in turn central to achieving sufficient levels of accuracy. In summary, small numbers of close relatives and very large numbers of distant relatives are expected to enable accurate predictions.\\n\\nTo quantify the effect of some of the properties of training sets on the accuracy of genomic selection in crops we performed an extensive field-based winter wheat trial. In summary, this trial involved the construction of 44 F2:4 bi- and triparental populations, from which 2992 lines were grown on four field locations and yield was measured. For each line, genotype data were generated for 25,000 segregating single nucleotide polymorphism markers. The overall heritability of yield was estimated to 0.65, and estimates within individual families ranged between 0.10 and 0.85. Within cross genomic prediction accuracies of yield BLUEs were 0.125 - 0.127 using two different cross-validation approaches, and generally increased with training set size. Using related crosses in training and validation sets generally resulted in higher prediction accuracies than using unrelated crosses. The results of this study emphasize the importance of the training set design in relation to the genetic material to which the resulting prediction model is to be applied.",

    "abstract": "Early childhood is a period of tremendous growth in both language ability and brain maturation. To understand the dynamic interplay between neural activity and spoken language development, we used resting-state EEG recordings to explore the relation between alpha oscillations (7-10 Hz) and oral language ability in 4- to 6-year-old children with typical development (N=41). Three properties of alpha oscillations were investigated: a) alpha power using spectral analysis, b) flexibility of the alpha frequency quantified via the oscillation's moment-to-moment fluctuations, and c) scaling behavior of the alpha oscillator investigated via the long-range temporal correlation in the alpha-amplitude time course. All three properties of the alpha oscillator correlated with children's oral language abilities. Higher language scores were correlated with lower alpha power, greater flexibility of the alpha frequency, and longer temporal correlations in the alpha-amplitude time course. Our findings demonstrate a cognitive role of several properties of the alpha oscillator that has largely been overlooked in the literature.",
