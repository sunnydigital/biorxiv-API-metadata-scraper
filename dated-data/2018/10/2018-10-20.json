    "abstract": "A-to-I RNA editing is widespread in eukaryotic transcriptomes and plays an essential role in the creation of proteomic and phenotypic diversity. Loss of ADARs, the proteins responsible for A-to-I editing, results in lethality in mammals. In C. elegans, knocking out both ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, results in aberrant behavior and abnormal development. Studies have shown that ADR-2 can actively deaminate dsRNA while ADR-1 cannot. However, as most studies of C. elegans ADARs were performed on worms mutated in both ADAR genes, the effects observed cannot be attributed to a single ADAR or to the interactions between ADAR genes. Therefore, we set to study the effects of each C. elegans ADAR on RNA editing, gene expression, protein levels and the contribution of each of ADAR to the phenotypes observed in worms mutated in both genes, in order to elucidate their distinct functions. We found significant differences in the phenotypes observed in worms mutated in a single ADAR gene. Worms harboring adr-1 mutations have a significant reduction in their lifespan, while worms harboring adr-2 mutations have extended lifespan. We also observed severe abnormalities in vulva formation in adr-1 mutants, and we suggest that these phenotypes are a result of an RNA editing independent function of ADR-1. Mutations in each ADAR resulted in expressional changes in hundreds of genes, and a significant downregulation of edited genes. However, very few changes in the protein levels were observed. In addition, we found that ADR-1 binds many edited genes and primarily promotes editing at the L4 stage of development. While editing still occurs in the absence of ADR-1, most of the editing occurs in genes that are edited in wildtype worms, suggesting that ADR-1 does not prevent editing by binding to and protecting the RNA but rather enhances or promotes editing. Our results suggest that ADR-1 plays a significant role in the RNA editing process and by altering editing levels it causes the severe phenotypes that we observed. In contrast, a complete lack of RNA editing is less harmful to the worms. Furthermore, our results indicate that the effect of RNA editing on the protein content in the cell is minor and probably the main purpose of these modifications is to antagonize or enhance other gene regulatory mechanisms that act on RNA.",

    "abstract": "Plants developed various reversible and non-reversible acclimation mechanisms to cope with the multifaceted nature of abiotic stress combinations. We hypothesized that in order to endure these stress combinations, plants elicit distinctive acclimation strategies through specific trade-offs between reproduction and defense. To investigate Brachypodium distachyon acclimation strategies to combinations of salinity, drought and heat, we applied a system biology approach, integrating physiological, metabolic and transcriptional analyses. We analyzed the trade-offs among functional and performance traits, and their effects on plant fitness. A combination of drought and heat resulted in escape strategy, while under a combination of salinity and heat, plants exhibited avoidance strategy. On the other hand, under combinations of salinity and drought, with or without heat stress, plant fitness (i.e. germination rate of subsequent generation) was severely impaired. These results indicate that under combined stresses, plants life-history strategies were shaped by the limits of phenotypic and metabolic plasticity and the trade-offs between traits, thereby giving raise to distinct acclimations. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of plant acclimations to combinations of abiotic stresses and shed light on the different life-history strategies that can contribute to grass fitness and possibly to their dispersion under changing environments.",

    "abstract": "SYNGAP1, a Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein, regulates synapse maturation during a critical developmental window. Heterozygous mutation in SYNGAP1 (SYNGAP1+/-) has been shown to cause Intellectual Disability (ID) in children. Recent studies have provided evidence for altered neuronal protein synthesis in a mouse model of Syngap1+/-. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the same is unclear. Here, we report the reduced expression of a known translation regulator, FMRP, during a specific developmental period in Syngap1+/- mice. Our results demonstrated that FMRP interacts with and regulates the translation of Syngap1 mRNA. We further show that, during development, reduced translation of FMRP and this decrease in FMRP leads to a compensatory increase of Syngap1 translation in Syngap1+/-. These developmental changes are reflected in the altered response of eEF2 phosphorylation downstream of NMDA receptor signalling. We propose a cross-talk between FMRP and SYNGAP1 mediated signalling which can also explain the compensatory effect of impaired signalling observed in Syngap1+/- mice.",

    "abstract": "Identifying driver genes is a central problem in cancer biology, and many methods have been developed to identify driver genes from somatic mutation data. However, existing methods either lack explicit statistical models, or rely on very simple models that do not capture complex features in somatic mutations of driver genes. Here, we present driverMAPS (Model-based Analysis of Positive Selection), a more comprehensive model-based approach to driver gene identification. This new method explicitly models, at the single-base level, the effects of positive selection in cancer driver genes as well as highly heterogeneous background mutational process. Its selection model captures elevated mutation rates in functionally important sites using multiple external annotations, as well as spatial clustering of mutations. Its background mutation model accounts for both known covariates and unexplained local variation. Simulations under realistic evolutionary models demonstrate that driverMAPS greatly improves the power of driver gene detection over state-of-the-art approaches. Applying driverMAPS to TCGA data across 20 tumor types identified 159 new potential driver genes. Cross-referencing this list with data from external sources strongly supports these findings. The novel genes include the mRNA methytransferases METTL3-METTL14, and we experimentally validated METTL3 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer. Our results thus provide strong support to the emerging hypothesis that mRNA modification is an important biological process underlying tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Plants synthesize hundreds of thousands of ecologically specialized, lineage-specific metabolites through biosynthetic gene duplication and functional specialization. However, the rewiring of duplicated genes into existing regulatory networks remains unclear. We show that the duplicated gene CYP82C2 was recruited into the WRKY33 regulon and indole-3-carbonylnitrile (ICN) biosynthetic pathway through exaptation of a retroduplicated LINE retrotransposon (EPCOT3) into a novel enhancer. The stepwise development of a chromatin-accessible WRKY33-binding site on EPCOT3 potentiated the regulatory neofunctionalization of CYP82C2 and the evolution of inducible defense metabolite 4-hydroxy-ICN in Arabidopsis thaliana. Transposable elements (TEs) have long been recognized to have the potential to rewire regulatory networks; these results establish a more complete understanding of how duplicated genes and TEs contribute in concert to chemical diversity and pathogen defense.",

The method is widely applicable in data-driven science. Calculating the components is based on a unified physical framework which introduces the objective function, namely the Kullback-Leibler divergence, appropriate for quantifying the change of the macroscopic state as it is effected by the microscopic features. To demonstrate the applicability of RPCA, we analyze the thermodynamically relevant conformational changes of the protein HIV-1 protease upon binding to different drug molecules. In this case, the RPCA method provides a sound thermodynamic foundation for the analysis of the binding process. The relevant collective (global) conformational changes can be reconstructed from the informative latent variables to exhibit both the enhanced and the restricted conformational fluctuations upon ligand association. Moreover, RPCA characterizes the locally relevant conformational changes which can be presented on the structure of the protein.",

    "abstract": "Apical polarity of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is essential for solute and water transport in secretory epithelia and can be impaired in human diseases. Maintenance of apical polarity in the face of CFTR non-polarized delivery and compromised apical retention of mutant CFTRs lacking PDZ-domain protein (NHERF1) interaction, remains enigmatic. Here we show that basolateral CFTR delivery originates from biosynthetic (~35%) and endocytic (~65%) recycling missorting. Basolateral channels are retrieved via basolateral-to-apical transcytosis, enhancing CFTR apical expression by two-fold and suppressing its degradation. CFTR transcytosis is microtubule-dependent but independent of Myo5B-, Rab11- and NHERF1 binding to its C-terminal DTRL motif in airway epithelia. Increased basolateral delivery due to compromised apical recycling and accelerated internalization upon impaired NHERF1-CFTR association is largely counterbalanced by CFTR efficient basolateral internalization and apical transcytosis. Thus, transcytosis represents a previously unrecognized but indispensable mechanism for maintaining CFTR apical polarity by attenuating its constitutive and mutation-induced basolateral missorting.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are small, bulbous protrusions along dendrites in neurons and play a critical role in synaptic transmission. Dendritic spines come in a variety of shapes that depend on their developmental state. Additionally, roughly 14-19% of mature spines have a specialized endoplasmic reticulum called the spine apparatus. How does the shape of a postsynaptic spine and its internal organization affect the spatio-temporal dynamics of short timescale signaling? Answers to this question are central to our understanding the initiation of synaptic transmission, learning, and memory formation. In this work, we investigated the effect of spine and spine apparatus size and shape on the spatio-temporal dynamics of second messengers using mathematical modeling using reaction-diffusion equations in idealized geometries (ellipsoids, spheres, and mushroom-shaped). Our analyses and simulations showed that in the short timescale, spine size and shape coupled with the spine apparatus geometries govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of second messengers. We show that the curvature of the geometries gives rise to pseudo-harmonic functions, which predict the locations of maximum and minimum concentrations along the spine head. Furthermore, we showed that the lifetime of the concentration gradient can be fine-tuned by localization of fluxes on the spine head and varying the relative curvatures and distances between the spine apparatus and the spine head. Thus, we have identified several key geometric determinants of how the spine head and spine apparatus may regulate the short timescale chemical dynamics of small molecules that control synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Landing maneuvers in flies are complex behaviors that may be conceptually decomposed into a sequence of modular behaviors such as body deceleration, extension of legs, and body rotations which are coordinated to ensure controlled touchdown. The composite nature of these behaviors means that there is variability in the kinematics of landing maneuvers, making it difficult to identify the general rules that govern this behavior. Many previous studies have relied on tethered preparations to study landing behaviors, but tethering constrains some behavioral modules to operate in an open feedback control loop while others remain in closed-loop, thereby inducing experimental artefacts. On the other hand, freely flying insects are hard to precisely control, which may also increase behavioral variability. One approach towards understanding the general rules underlying landing behavior is to determine the common elements of landing kinematics on surfaces that are oriented in different ways. We conducted a series of experiments in which the houseflies, Musca Domestica, were lured to specific visual targets on either vertical or inverted horizontal substrates. These conditions elicited landing behaviors in the flies that could be captured accurately using multiple high-speed video cameras. We filmed the houseflies landing on surfaces oriented along two directions: vertical (vertical landings), and upside down (inverted landings). Our experiments reveal that flies that are able to land feet-first in a controlled manner must satisfy specific criteria, failing which their landing performance is compromised causing their heads to bump into the surface during landing. Flies landing smoothly on both surfaces initiate deceleration at approximately fixed distances from the substrate and in direct proportion to the component of flight velocity normal to the landing surface. The ratio of perpendicular distance to the substrate and velocity at the onset of deceleration was conserved, despite the large differences in the mechanics of the vertical vs. inverted landings. Flies extend their legs independently of distance from the landing surface or their approach velocity normal to the surface, regardless of the orientation of the landing substrate. Together, these results show that the visual initiation of deceleration is robust to orientation of the landing surface, whereas the initiation of leg-extension may be context-dependent and variable which allows flies to land on substrates of various orientations in a versatile manner. These findings may also be of interest to roboticists that are interested in developing flapping robots that can land on surfaces of different orientations.",

The implications for stream biogeochemistry and food webs remain largely unknown, notably the metabolic balance (biotic CO2 emissions), reciprocal subsidies between autotrophs and bacteria, and trophic transfer efficiencies.\\nC_LIO_LIWe use a flow food web approach to test how a small addition of labile dissolved organic matter affects the strength and dynamics of the autotrophs-bacteria interaction in streams. Our paired streams whole-ecosystem experimental approach combined with continuous whole-stream metabolism and stable isotope probing allowed to unravel carbon fluxes in the control and treatment streams.\\nC_LIO_LIWe increased the natural supply of dissolved organic matter for three weeks by only 12% by continuously adding 0.5 mg L-1 of sucrose with a {delta}13C signature different from the natural organic matter. Both photosynthesis and heterotrophic respiration increased rapidly following C addition, but this was short lived due to N and P stoichiometric constraints. The resulting peak in heterotrophic respiration was of similar magnitude to natural peaks in the control observed when soils were hydrologically connected to the streams and received soil derived carbon.\\nC_LIO_LICarbon reciprocal subsidies between autotrophs and bacteria in the control stream accounted for about 50% of net primary production and 75% of bacterial production, under low flow conditions when stream water was hydrologically disconnected from soil water. The reciprocal subsidies were weaker by 33% (autotrophs to bacteria) and 55% (bacteria to autotrophs) in the treatment relative to the control. Net primary production relied partly (11% in the control) on natural allochthonous dissolved organic carbon via the CO2 produced by bacterial respiration.\\nC_LIO_LIMany large changes in ecosystem processes were observed in response to the sucrose addition. The light use efficiency of the autotrophs increased by 37%. Ecosystem respiration intensified by 70%, and the metabolic balance became relatively more negative, i.e. biotic CO2 emissions increased by 125%. Heterotrophic respiration and production increased by 89%, and this was reflected by a shorter (-40%) uptake length (SwOC) and faster (+92%) mineralisation velocity of organic carbon. The proportion of DOC flux respired and organic carbon use efficiency by bacteria increased by 112%.\\nC_LIO_LIMacroinvertebrate consumer density increased by 72% due to sucrose addition and consumer production was 1.8 times higher in the treatment than in the control at the end of the experiment. The trophic transfer efficiencies from resources to consumers were similar between the control and the treatment (2-5%).\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. Part of the carbon derived from natural allochthonous organic matter can feed the autotrophs via the CO2 produced by stream bacterial respiration, intermingling the green and brown webs. The interaction between autotrophs and bacteria shifted from mutualism to competition with carbon addition under nutrient limitation (N, P) increasing biotic CO2 emissions. Without nutrient limitation, mutualism could be reinforced by a positive feedback loop, maintaining the same biotic CO2 emissions. A small increase in dissolved organic carbon supply from climate and land use change could have large effects on stream food web and biogeochemistry with implications for the global C cycle under stoichiometric constraints.\\nC_LI",

We conclude that the paracrine effects of BMMNCs lacks efficacy to modulate events associated with AMI in the rat.",

    "abstract": "Social groups whose members have had sustained prior experience with each other frequently exhibit improved coordination and outperform groups whose members are unfamiliar with one another. The mechanisms by which familiarity assists coordination are not well known. Prior social experience may simply allow individuals to learn the behavioral tendencies of familiar group-mates and coordinate accordingly. In the absence of prior social experience, it would be adaptive for individuals to develop strategies for coping with unfamiliar others to minimize the disadvantage of unfamiliarity. To explore the dynamics of familiarity in shaping group behaviors, we used a highly social catfish, Corydoras aeneus, that utilizes a distinctive, observable tactile interactions. Here we describe this tactile interaction behavior, physical \\\"nudges\\\" that are deployed to initiate group movements and maintain contact with group-mates during group movements. We then report the results of two experiments exploring the relationship between nudges and coordination. First, within triplets of two familiar and one unfamiliar individual, we found no individual differences in nudging rate based on familiarity. Despite all individuals interacting at similar rates, however, unfamiliar individuals failed to coordinate as well as their familiar group-mates, and were more frequently absent from group movements. Second, comparing pairs of familiar with pairs of unfamiliar fish, there was no difference in the level of coordination between pairs. Instead, we found that unfamiliar pairs exhibited significantly higher nudging rates, suggesting that unfamiliar pairs could compensate for their unfamiliarity by nudging more frequently. In contrast, familiar individuals coordinated with comparatively little nudging, presumably because they were experienced with each other. Overall, these results suggest that nudges can be used to improve coordination of group activities, but that their usage is reduced in the case of familiar individuals, implying that these potential signals may be costly.",

    "abstract": "IDH1 and IDH2 are human enzymes that convert isocitrate (ICT) into -ketoglutarate (AKG). However, mutations in positions R132 of IDH1 and R140 and R172 of IDH2 cause these enzymes to convert AKG into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Concurrently, accumulation of 2HG in the cell is correlated with the development of cancer. This activity change is mainly due to the loss of the competitive inhibition by ICT of these enzymes, but the molecular mechanism behind this loss of inhibition is currently unknown. In this work we characterized the inhibition and loss of inhibition of IDH1 and IDH2 by means of the binding energies derived from molecular docking calculations. We characterized the substrate binding sites and how they differ among the mutant and wild type enzymes using a Jaccard similarity coefficient based on the residues involved in binding the substrates. We found that molecular docking effectively identifies the inhibition by ICT in the wild type and mutant enzymes that do not appear in tumors, and the loss of inhibition in the mutant enzymes that appear in tumors. Additionally, we found that the binding sites of the mutant enzymes are different among themselves. Finally, we found that the regulatory segment of IDH1 plays a prominent role in the change of binding sites between the mutant enzymes and the wild-type enzymes. Our findings show that the loss of inhibition is related to variations in the enzyme binding sites. Additionally, our findings show that a drug capable of targeting all IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in cancer is unlikely to be found due to significant differences among the binding sites of these paralogs. Moreover, the methodology developed here, which combines molecular docking calculations with binding site similarity estimation, can be useful for engineering enzymes, for instance, when aiming to modify the substrate affinity of an enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have long been recognized to be capable of entering a phenotypically non-growing persister state, in which the cells exhibit an extended regrowth lag and a multidrug tolerance, thus posing a great challenge in treating infectious diseases. Owing to their non-inheritability, low abundance of existence, lack of metabolic activities, and high heterogeneity, properties of persisters remain poorly understood. Here, we report our accidental discovery of a hitherto unreported subcellular structure that we term the regrowth-delay body, which is formed only in non-growing bacterial cells and sequesters multiple key proteins. As of now, this structure, that dissolves when the cell resumes growth, is the most distinguishable subcellular structure marking persisters. Our studies also indicate that persisters exhibit different depth of persistence, as determined by the status of their regrowth-delay bodies. Our findings imply that suppressing the formation and/or promoting the dissolution of regrowth-delay bodies could be viable strategies for eradicating persisters.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic associations impact and are impacted by their surrounding ecosystem. The association between Burkholderia bacteria and the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a tractable model to unravel the biology underlying symbiont-endowed phenotypes and their impacts. Several Burkholderia species stably associate with D. discoideum and typically reduce host fitness in food-rich environments while increasing fitness in food-scarce environments. Burkholderia symbionts are themselves inedible to their hosts but induce co-infections with secondary bacteria that can serve as a food source. Thus, Burkholderia hosts are \\\"farmers\\\" that carry food bacteria to new environments, providing a benefit when food is scarce. We examined the ability of specific Burkholderia genotypes to induce secondary co-infections and assessed host fitness under a range of co-infection conditions and environmental contexts. Although all Burkholderia symbionts intracellularly infected Dictyostelium, we found that co-infections are predominantly extracellular, suggesting that farming benefits are derived from extracellular infection of host structures. Furthermore, levels of secondary infection are linked to conditional host fitness; B. agricolaris infected hosts have the highest level of co-infection and have the highest fitness in food scarce environments. This study illuminates the phenomenon of co-infection induction across Dictyostelium associated Burkholderia species and exemplifies the contextual complexity of these associations.",

We show that plasma cfDNA of healthy donors originates from white blood cells (55%), erythrocyte progenitors (30%), vascular endothelial cells (10%) and hepatocytes (1%). Deconvolution of cfDNA from patients reveals tissue contributions that agree with clinical findings in sepsis, islet transplantation, cancer of the colon, lung, breast and prostate, and cancer of unknown primary.

This oversight yields an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that underlie environmental adaptation and can be tackled leveraging the biological properties of ciliates. When Paramecium reproduces sexually, its polyploid somatic genome regenerates from the germline genome via a developmental process, Programmed DNA elimination (PDE), that involves the removal of thousands of ORF-interrupting germline sequences. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to sub-optimal temperatures impacts PDE efficiency, prompting the emergence of hundreds of alternative DNA splicing variants that dually embody cryptic (germline) variation and de novo induced (somatic) mutations. In contrast to trivial biological errors, many of these alternative DNA isoforms display a patterned genomic topography, are epigenetically controlled, inherited trans-somatically, and under purifying selection. Developmental thermoplasticity in Paramecium is a likely source of evolutionary innovation.",

Yet, the degree to which brain activity and functional connectivity during learning is constrained across subjects, for example by conserved anatomy and physiology or by the nature of the task, remains unknown. Here, we measured brain activity and functional connectivity in a longitudinal experiment in which healthy adult human participants learned the values of novel objects over the course of four days. We assessed the presence of constraints on activity and functional connectivity using an inter-subject correlation approach. Constraints on activity and connectivity were greater in magnitude than expected in a non-parametric permutation-based null model, particularly in primary sensory and motor systems, as well as in regions associated with the learning of value. Notably, inter-subject connectivity in activity and connectivity displayed marked temporal variations, with inter-subject correlations in activity exceeding those in connectivity during early learning and visa versa in later learning. Finally, individual differences in performance accuracy tracked the degree to which a subjects connectivity, but not activity, tracked subject-general patterns. Taken together, our results support the notion that brain activity and connectivity are constrained across subjects in early learning, with constraints on activity, but not connectivity, decreasing in later learning.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental findings indicate that Purkinje cells in the cerebellum represent time intervals by mechanisms other than conventional synaptic weights. This finding adds to the theoretical and experimental observations suggesting the presence of intra-cellular mechanisms for adaptation and processing. To account for these experimental results we developed a biophysical model for time interval learning in a Purkinje cell. The numerical model focuses on a classical delay conditioning task (e.g. eyeblink conditioning) and relies on a few computational steps. In particular, the model posits the activation by the parallel fiber input of a local intra-cellular calcium store which can be modulated by intra-cellular pathways. The reciprocal interaction of the calcium signal with several proteins forming negative and positive feedback loops ensures that the timing of inhibition in the Purkinje cell anticipates the interval between parallel and climbing fiber inputs during training. We show that the model is able to learn along the 150-1000 ms interval range. Finally, we discuss how this model would allow the cerebellum to detect and generate specific spatio-temporal patterns, a classical theory for cerebellar function.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe prevailing view in neurosciences considers synaptic weights between neurons the determinant factor for learning and processing information in the nervous system. Theoretical considerations [1, 2] and experiments [3, 4] examined some potential limitations of this classical paradigm, pointing out that adaptation and computation might also have to rely on other mechanisms besides the learning of synaptic weights. Recent experimental findings [5-7] indicate that Purkinje cells in the cerebellum represent time intervals by mechanisms other than conventional synaptic weights. We propose here a biologically plausible model which complements the modification of synaptic weights for learning one time interval in one synapse of one Purkinje cell. In the model a calcium signal in a small domain keeps track of time. Several molecules read and modify this calcium signal to learn a time interval. We discuss how this model would allow the cerebellum to detect and generate specific patterns in space and time, a classical theory for cerebellar function proposed by Braitenberg [8, 9].",

Here we implement, for the first time, bio-inspired QS in robots fabricated from DNA origami, which communicate by transmitting and receiving diffusing signals. The mechanism we describe includes features such as programmable response thresholds and quorum quenching, and is capable of being triggered by proximity of a specific target cell. Nanoscale robots with swarm intelligence could carry out tasks that have been so far unachievable in diverse fields such as industry, manufacturing and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Immune response by T cells is essential for a healthy body against cancer, infection, and pathophysiological alteration. The activation and expansion of T cells can be inhibited by dasatinib, a tyrosine inhibitor, thus improving the outcome of diseases, such as autoimmune disease, graft-versus-host disease, and transplant rejection. The underlying mechanism of inhibition by dasatinib is elusive. Here, we designed and synthesized a CRISPR/Cas9 screening library that includes 6,149 genes. Using the library, we performed dasatinib CRISPR/cas9 screening in Jurkat cell, a T lymphocyte cell. We firstly identified survival essential genes for Jurkat cells. Comparing with other CRISPR/Cas9 screenings, we obtained Jurkat cell specific essential genes. By comparing dasatinib treatment to control, we identified a set of dasatinib targets, which includes known targets: CSK, LCK, ZAP70, and previously unknown targets: ZFP36L2, LRPPRC, CFLAR, PD-1, CD45 et al. Visualizing these target genes on T cell receptor signaling pathway, we found several genes could be inhibited by dasatinib. Furthermore, we introduced a framework, 9-square, to classify genes and found a group of genes that are associated with dasatinib resistance, possibly linking the side effects of dasatinib. These data reveal a set of dasatinib targets and demonstrate the molecular potential functions of dasatinib. Identification of dasatinib targets will broaden our understanding to its molecular mechanism, and thus benefits to clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "We describe the development and application of a novel series of vectors that facilitate CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing in mammalian cells, which we call CRISPR-Bac. CRISPR-Bac leverages the piggyBac transposon to randomly insert CRISPR-Cas9 components into mammalian genomes. In CRISPR-Bac, a single piggyBac cargo vector containing a doxycycline-inducible Cas9 or catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) variant and a gene conferring resistance to Hygromycin B is co-transfected with a plasmid expressing the piggyBac transposase. A second cargo vector, expressing a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) of interest, the reverse-tetracycline TransActivator (rtTA), and a gene conferring resistance to G418, is also cotransfected. Subsequent selection on Hygromycin B and G418 generates polyclonal cell populations that stably express Cas9, rtTA, and the sgRNA(s) of interest. Using Mus musculus-derived embryonic and trophoblast stem cells, we show that CRISPR-Bac can be used to knockdown proteins of interest, to create targeted genetic deletions with high efficiency, and to activate or repress transcription of protein-coding genes and an imprinted long noncoding RNA. The ratio of sgRNA-to-Cas9-to-transposase can be adjusted in transfections to alter the average number of cargo insertions into the genome. sgRNAs targeting multiple genes can be inserted in a single transfection. CRISPR-Bac is a versatile platform for genome editing that simplifies the generation of mammalian cells that stably express the CRISPR-Cas9 machinery.",

    "abstract": "Structural biologists have fit increasingly complex model types to protein X-ray crystallographic data, motivated by higher-resolving crystals, greater computational power, and a growing appreciation for protein dynamics. Once fit, a more complex model will generally fit the experimental data better, but it also provides greater capacity to overfit to experimental noise. While refinement progress is normally monitored for a given model type with a fixed number of parameters, comparatively little attention has been paid to the selection among distinct model types where the number of parameters can vary. Using metrics derived in the statistical field of model comparison, we develop a framework for statistically rigorous inference of model complexity. From analysis of simulated data, we find that the resulting information criteria are less likely to prefer an erroneously complex model type and are less sensitive to noise, compared to the crystallographic cross-validation criterion Rfree. Moreover, these information criteria suggest caution in using complex model types and for inferring protein conformational heterogeneity from experimental scattering data.",

    "abstract": "Cellular architectural proteins often participate in organ development and maintenance. Although functional decay of some of these proteins during aging is known, the cell-type specific developmental role and the cause and consequence of their subsequent decay remain to be established especially in mammals. By studying lamins, the nuclear structural proteins, we demonstrate that lamin-B1 functions specifically in the thymic epithelial cells (TECs) for proper thymus organogenesis. An upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the intra-thymic myeloid immune cells during aging accompanies a gradual reduction of adult TEC lamins-B1. These cytokines cause adult TEC senescence and lamin-B1 reduction. We identify 17 adult TEC subsets and show that TEC lamin-B1 maintains the composition of these TECs. Lamin-B1 supports the expression of TEC genes needed for maintaining adult thymic architecture and function. Thus, structural proteins involved in organ building and maintenance can undergo inflammation-driven decay which can in turn contribute to age-associated organ degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Changes in brain metabolism are a hallmark of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Determining how AUD changes the brain proteome is critical for understanding the effects of alcohol consumption on biochemical processes in the brain. We used data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry proteomics to study differences in the abundance of proteins associated with AUD in pre-frontal lobe and motor cortex from autopsy brain. AUD had a substantial effect on the overall brain proteome exceeding the inherent differences between brain regions. Proteins associated with glycolysis, trafficking, the cytoskeleton, and excitotoxicity were altered in abundance in AUD. We observed extensive changes in the abundance of key metabolic enzymes, consistent with a switch from glucose to acetate utilization in the AUD brain. We propose that metabolic adaptations allowing efficient acetate utilization contribute to ethanol dependence in AUD.",

    "abstract": "Cells need to reliably sense external ligand concentrations to achieve various biological functions such as chemotaxis or signaling. The molecular recognition of ligands by surface receptors is degenerate in many systems leading to crosstalk between different receptors. Crosstalk is often thought of as a deviation from optimal specific recognition, as the binding of non-cognate ligands can interfere with the detection of the receptors cognate ligand, possibly leading to a false triggering of a downstream signaling pathway. Here we quantify the optimal precision of sensing the concentrations of multiple ligands by a collection of promiscuous receptors. We demonstrate that crosstalk can improve precision in concentration sensing and discrimination tasks. To achieve superior precision, the additional information about ligand concentrations contained in short binding events of the noncognate ligand should be exploited. We present a proofreading scheme to realize an approximate estimation of multiple ligand concentrations that reaches a precision close to the derived optimal bounds. Our results help rationalize the observed ubiquity of receptor crosstalk in molecular sensing.",
