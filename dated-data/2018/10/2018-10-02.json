    "abstract": "Under physiological conditions, strength and persistence of memory must be regulated in order to produce behavioral flexibility. In fact, impairments in memory flexibility are associated with pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder or autism; however the underlying mechanisms that enable memory flexibility are still poorly understood. Here we identified the transcriptional repressor Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) as a critical synaptic plasticity regulator that decreases memory strength, promoting memory flexibility. WT1 was activated in the hippocampus following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or learning. WT1 knockdown enhanced CA1 neuronal excitability, LTP and long-term memory whereas its over-expression weakened memory retention. Moreover, forebrain WT1-deficient mice showed deficits in both reversal, sequential learning tasks and contextual fear extinction, exhibiting impaired memory flexibility. We conclude that WT1 limits memory strength or promotes memory weakening, thus enabling memory flexibility, a process that is critical for learning from new experience.",

    "abstract": "Extinction threatens many species, yet few factors predict this risk across the plant Tree of Life (ToL). Taxon age is one factor that may associate with extinction if occupancy of geographic and adaptive zones varies with time, but evidence for such an association has been equivocal. Age-dependent occupancy can also influence diversification rates and thus extinction risk where new taxa have small range and population sizes. Here we analysed 509 well-sampled genera from across the plant ToL. We found that a greater proportion of species were threatened by extinction in younger and faster-diversifying genera. Repeating our analyses in two large, well-sampled groups, we found that extinction risk increased with evolutionary age in conifer species but not palms. Potential range size decreased in older, non-threatened conifers more strongly than in threatened taxa, suggesting that range size dynamics may explain differing patterns of extinction risk across the ToL with consequences for biodiversity conservation.",

In this study we tested the hypothesis that motor response influences perceptual awareness judgements. We design a procedure in which participants were asked to decide whether Gabor grating was oriented towards the left or the right. Presentation of the stimuli was immediately followed by a cue requiring motor response that was irrelevant to the task but could be the same, opposite or neutral to the correct response to the Gabor patch. After responding to the cue participants were asked to rate their stimulus awareness using Perceptual Awareness Scale and then to report their discrimination decision.\\n\\nThe results showed that participants reported a higher level of stimulus awareness after carrying out responses that were either congruent or incongruent with a response required by a stimulus, compared to the neutral condition. The results suggest that directional motor response (congruent or incongruent with correct response to the stimulus) provides information about the decision process and its outcome increasing reported awareness of a stimulus.",

Here, we unveil novel roles for the HIPPO signaling pathway segregates pluripotent and extraembryonic fates by controlling cell positioning as well as expression of Sox2, the first marker of pluripotency in the mouse early embryo. We show that maternal and zygotic YAP1 and WWTR1 repress Sox2 while promoting expression of the trophectoderm gene Cdx2 in parallel. Yet, Sox2 is more sensitive than Cdx2 to Yap1/Wwtr1 dosage, leading cells to a state of conflicted cell fate when YAP1/WWTR1 activity is moderate. Remarkably, HIPPO signaling activity resolves conflicted cell fate by repositioning cells to the interior of the embryo, independent of its role in regulating Sox2 expression. Rather, HIPPO antagonizes apical localization of Par complex components PARD6B and aPKC. Thus, negative feedback between HIPPO and Par complex components ensure robust lineage segregation.",

    "abstract": "Synapses change their strength in response to specific activity patterns. This functional plasticity is assumed to be the brains primary mechanism for information storage. We used optogenetic stimulation of rat hippocampal slice cultures to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), or both forms of plasticity in sequence. Two-photon imaging of spine calcium signals allowed us to identify stimulated synapses and to follow their fate for the next 7 days. We found that plasticity-inducing protocols affected the synapses chance for survival: LTP increased synaptic stability, LTD destabilized synapses, and the effect of the last stimulation protocol was dominant over earlier stimulations. Interestingly, most potentiated synapses were resistant to depression-inducing protocols delivered 24 hours later. Our findings suggest that activity-dependent changes in the transmission strength of individual synapses are transient, but have long-lasting consequences for synaptic lifetime.",

On the other hand, robotics studies have suggested the importance of physical properties made by body structure. However, it remains unclear how morphology affects movement coordination in animals independent of neuronal activity. To begin to understand this issue, this study reports a rhythmic movement in the green brittle star. We found this animal moved five radially symmetric parts in a well-ordered unsynchronized pattern. We explained the coordinated pattern without considering neuronal activity, by building a phenomenological model where internal fluid flows between the body parts. Changing the number of body parts from five to six simulated a synchronized pattern, which is also demonstrated by a rare individual with six symmetric parts. This model suggests the different number in morphology changes the symmetry of the fluid flow, leading to the different synchronization patterns.",

    "abstract": "Despite their discovery over 25 years ago, the Marine Group II Euryarchaea (MGII) have remained a difficult group of organisms to study, lacking cultured isolates and genome references. The MGII have been identified in marine samples from around the world and evidence supports a photoheterotrophic lifestyle combining phototrophy via proteorhodopsins with the remineralization of high molecular weight organic matter. Divided between two clades, the MGII have distinct ecological patterns that are not understood based on the limited number of available genomes. Here, I present the comparative genomic analysis of 250 MGII genomes, providing the most detailed view of these mesophilic archaea to-date. This analysis identified 17 distinct subclades including nine subclades that previously lacked reference genomes. The metabolic potential and distribution of the MGII genera revealed distinct roles in the environment, identifying algal-saccharide-degrading coastal subclades, protein-degrading oligotrophic surface ocean subclades, and mesopelagic subclades lacking proteorhodopsins common in all other subclades. This study redefines the MGII and provides an avenue for understanding the role these organisms play in the cycling of organic matter throughout the water column.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanism and pathobiology of SPINK1 in PCa remains largely unknown.\\n\\nExperimental DesignMicroRNA-prediction tools were employed to examine the SPINK1-3UTR for miRNAs binding. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm the SPINK1-3UTR binding of shortlisted miR-338-5p/miR-421. Further, miR-338-5p/-421 overexpressing cancer cells (SPINK1-positive) were evaluated for oncogenic properties using cell-based functional assays and mice xenograft model. Global gene expression profiling was performed to unravel the biological pathways altered by miR-338-5p/-421. Immunohistochemistry and RNA in-situ hybridization was carried-out on PCa patients tissue microarray for SPINK1 and EZH2 expression respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine EZH2 occupancy on the miR-338-5p/-421 regulatory regions. Bisulfite sequencing and methylated DNA-immunoprecipitation was performed on PCa cell lines and patients specimens.\\n\\nResultsWe established a critical role of miRNA-338-5p/-421 in post-transcriptional regulation of SPINK1. Ectopic expression of miRNA-338-5p/-421 in SPINK1-positive PCa cells abrogate oncogenic properties including cell-cycle progression, stemness and drug resistance, and show reduced tumor burden and distant metastases in mice model. Importantly, we show SPINK1-positive PCa patients exhibit increased EZH2 expression, suggesting its role in miRNA-338-5p/-421 epigenetic silencing. Furthermore, presence of CpG dinucleotide DNA methylation marks on the regulatory regions of miR-338-5p/-421 in SPINK1-positive PCa cells and patients specimens confirms epigenetic silencing.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings revealed that miRNA-338-5p/-421 are epigenetically silenced in SPINK1-positive PCa, while restoring the expression of these miRNAs using epigenetic drugs or synthetic mimics could abrogate SPINK1-mediated oncogenesis.\\n\\nTRANSLATIONAL IMPACTWe establish a regulatory model involving the functional interplay between SPINK1, miRNA-338-5p/miRNA-421 and EZH2, thereby, revealing hitherto unknown mechanism of SPINK1 up-regulation in SPINK1-positive subtype. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the development of potential therapeutic strategies for SPINK1-positive malignancies. We demonstrate that restoring miRNA-338-5p/miRNA-421 expression using epigenetic drugs including DNMTs inhibitors in combination with HDACs or HKMTs inhibitors or miRNA synthetic mimics in SPINK1-positive prostate cancer abrogate SPINK1-mediated oncogenicity. The major findings of this study will not only advance the prostate cancer field, but will also be valuable for treatment and disease management of other SPINK1-positive malignancies.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of time-varying activity and connectivity patterns (i.e., the chronnectome) using resting-state magnetic resonance imaging has become an important part of ongoing neuroscience discussions. The majority of previous work has focused on variations of temporal coupling among fixed spatial nodes or transition of the dominant activity/connectivity pattern over time. Here, we introduce an approach to capture spatial dynamics within functional domains (FD), as well as temporal dynamics within and between FD. The approach models the brain as a hierarchical functional architecture with different levels of granularity, where lower levels have higher functional homogeneity and less dynamic behavior and higher levels have less homogeneity and more dynamic behavior. First, a high-order spatial independent component analysis is used to approximate functional units. A functional unit is a pattern of regions with very similar functional activity over time. Next, functional units are used to construct FDs. Finally, functional modules (FMs) are calculated from FDs, providing an overall view of brain dynamics. Results highlight the spatial fluidity within FDs, including a broad spectrum of changes in regional associations from strong coupling to complete decoupling. Moreover, FMs capture the dynamic interplay between FDs. Patients with schizophrenia show transient reductions in functional activity and state connectivity across several FDs, particularly the subcortical domain. Activity and connectivity differences convey unique information in many cases (e.g. the default mode) highlighting their complementarity information. The proposed hierarchical model to capture FD spatiotemporal variation provides new insight into the macroscale chronnectome and identifies changes hidden from existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "During gastrulation, physical forces reshape the simple embryonic tissue to form a complex body plan of multicellular organisms1. These forces often cause large-scale asymmetric movements of the embryonic tissue2,3. In many embryos, the tissue undergoing gastrulation movements is surrounded by a rigid protective shell4,5. While it is well recognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces generated by tissue-intrinsic contractility6,7, it is not known if interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that impact gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope surrounding the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts the tissue-intrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. Furthermore, this localized attachment is mediated by a specific integrin, and its knock-down leads to a gastrulation phenotype consistent with complete loss of attachment. Moreover, analysis of another integrin in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline. Together, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism whereby the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to the vitelline envelope provides controllable counter-forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects.",

    "abstract": "Imputation has been routinely used to infer sequence variants in large genotyped populations based on reference populations of sequenced individuals. With increasing numbers of animals sequenced and the implementation of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project, fine-mapping of causal variants for complex traits is becoming possible in cattle. Using 404 ancestor bull sequences as reference, we imputed over 3 million selected sequence variants to 27,214 Holstein bulls with highly reliable phenotypes (breeding values) for 35 production, reproduction, and body conformation traits. We first performed whole-genome single-marker scans for each of the 35 traits using a mixed-model association test. The single-trait association statistics were then merged into multi-trait tests of 3 trait groups: production, reproduction, and body conformation. Both single- and multi-trait GWAS results were used to identify 282 candidate QTL regions for fine-mapping in the cattle genome. To facilitate fast and powerful fine-mapping analyses, we developed a Bayesian Fine-MAPping approach (BFMAP) to integrate fine-mapping with functional enrichment analysis. Our fine-mapping results identified 69 promising candidate genes for dairy traits, including ABCC9, VPS13B, MGST1, SCD, MKL1, and CSN1S1 for production traits; CHEK2, GC, and KALRN for reproduction traits; and TMTC2, ARRDC3, ZNF613, CCND2, and FGF6 for body conformation traits. Based on existing functional annotation data for cattle, we revealed biologically meaningful enrichment in our fine-mapped variants that can be readily tested in functional validation studies. In summary, these results demonstrated the utility of a fast Bayesian approach for fine-mapping and functional enrichment analysis, identified candidate causative genes and variants, and enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits in dairy cattle.",

    "abstract": "Bestrophin (BEST1-4 in humans) channels are ligand gated chloride (Cl-) channels that are activated by calcium (Ca2+). Mutations in BEST1 cause retinal degenerative diseases. Partly because these channels have no sequence or structural similarity to other ion channels, the molecular mechanisms underlying gating are unknown. Here, we present a series of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of chicken BEST1, determined at 3.1 [A] resolution or better, that represent the principal gating states of the channel. Unlike other channels, opening of the pore is due to the repositioning of tethered pore-lining helices within a surrounding protein shell that dramatically widens a \\\"neck\\\" of the pore through a concertina of amino acid rearrangements within the protein core. The neck serves as both the activation and the inactivation gate. The binding of Ca2+ to a cytosolic domain instigates pore opening and the structures reveal that, unlike voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, similar molecular rearrangements are responsible for inactivation and deactivation. A single aperture within the 95 [A]-long opened pore separates the cytosol from the extracellular milieu and controls anion permeability. The studies define the basis for Ca2+-activated Cl- channel function and reveal a new molecular paradigm for gating in ligand-gated ion channels.",

Therefore, we characterised 27 FPs in vivo using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model organism. We linked the FPs via a T2A peptide to a control FP, producing equimolar expression of the 2 FPs from 1 plasmid. Using this strategy, we characterised the FPs for brightness, photostability, photochromicity and pH-sensitivity, achieving a comprehensive in vivo characterisation. Many FPs showed different in vivo properties compared to existing in vitro data. Additionally, various FPs were photochromic, which affects readouts due to complex bleaching kinetics. Finally, we codon optimized the best performing FPs for optimal expression in yeast, and found that codon-optimization alters FP characteristics. These FPs improve experimental signal readout, opening new experimental possibilities. Our results may guide future studies in yeast that employ fluorescent proteins.",

How this pathogenic DM1 condition translates into cardiac conduction disorders remains poorly understood. Here, we simulated MBNL1 and CELF1 misbalance in the Drosophila heart and identified associated gene deregulations using TU-tagging based transcriptional profiling of cardiac cells. We detected deregulations of several genes controlling cellular calcium levels and among them increased expression of straightjacket/2{delta}3 that encodes a regulatory subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel. Straightjacket overexpression in the fly heart leads to asynchronous heart beating, a hallmark of affected conduction, whereas cardiac straightjacket knockdown improves these symptoms in DM1 fly models. We also show that ventricular 2{delta}3 expression is low in healthy mice and humans but significantly elevated in ventricular muscles from DM1 patients with conduction defects. Taken together, this suggests that reducing the straightjacket/2{delta}3 transcript levels in ventricular cardiomyocytes could represent a strategy to prevent conduction defects and in particular intraventricular conduction delay associated with DM1 pathology.",

Disassembly is critically important: misregulation or delay of disassembly leads to cell cycle defects. The physical means by which cilia are disassembled are poorly understood, and thought to involve resorption of disassembled components into the cell body. To investigate cilium disassembly in mammalian cells, we used rapid live-cell imaging to comprehensively characterize individual disassembly events. The predominant mode of disassembly was rapid cilium loss via deciliation, in which the membrane and axoneme of the cilium was shed from the cell. Gradual resorption was also observed, as well as events in which a period of gradual resorption ended with rapid deciliation. Deciliation resulted in intact shed cilia that could be recovered from culture medium and contained both membrane and axoneme proteins. We modulated levels of katanin and intracellular calcium, two putative regulators of deciliation, and found that excess katanin promotes disassembly by deciliation, independently of calcium. Together, these results demonstrate that mammalian ciliary disassembly involves a tunable decision between deciliation and resorption.",

    "abstract": "cGMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that plays a role in sensory signaling and plasticity through its regulation of ion channels and kinases. Previous studies that primarily used genetic and biochemical tools suggest that cGMP is spatiotemporally regulated in multiple sensory modalities, including light, heat, gases, salt and odor. FRET- and GFP-based cGMP sensors were developed to visualize cGMP in primary cell culture and Caenorhabditis elegans to corroborate these findings. While a FRET-based sensor has been used in an intact animal to visualize cGMP, the requirement of a multiple emission system limits its ability to be used on its own as well as with other sensors and fluorescent markers. Here, we demonstrate that WincG2, a codon-optimized version of the cpEGFP-based cGMP sensor FlincG3, can be used in C. elegans to visualize rapidly changing cGMP levels in living, behaving animals using a single fluorophore. We coexpressed the sensor with the blue light-activated guanylyl cyclases BeCyclOp and bPGC in body wall muscles and found that the rate of WincG2 fluorescence correlated with the rate of cGMP production by each cyclase. Furthermore, we show that WincG2 responds linearly upon NaCl concentration changes and SDS presentation in the cell bodies of the gustatory neuron ASER and the nociceptive phasmid neuron PHB, respectively. Intriguingly, WincG2 fluorescence in the ASER cell body decreased in response to a NaCl concentration downstep and either stopped decreasing or increased in response to a NaCl concentration upstep, which is opposite in sign to previously published calcium recordings. These results illustrate that WincG2 can be used to report rapidly changing cGMP levels in an intact animal and that the reporter can potentially reveal unexpected spatiotemporal landscapes of cGMP in response to stimuli.\\n\\nAuthor SummarycGMP is a second messenger that plays an important role in sensory signaling and neural plasticity. Previous genetic and biochemical studies indirectly suggest that cGMP is spatiotemporally regulated in neurons to modulate neural activity. While a FRET-based sensor for cGMP has been used in intact Caenorhabditis elegans to examine its spatiotemporal regulation in neurobiological processes, its use has been limited due to the complicated setup required to image this type of sensor. Here, we describe a GFP-based cGMP sensor that has been codon optimized for use in C. elegans and demonstrate that it responds robustly and reliably to endogenously changing cGMP levels. We show that the sensor responds to cGMP production by coexpressing it with blue light-activated guanylyl cyclases, and we show that it responds to NaCl and sodium dodecyl sulfate when expressed in a gustatory and nociceptive neuron, respectively. We think that this sensor can be used to investigate the spatiotemporal regulation of cGMP in neurons and its relationship to neural activity.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenomic analyses have increasingly adopted species tree reconstruction using methods that account for gene tree discordance using pipelines that require both human effort and computational resources. As the number of available genomes continues to increase, a new problem is facing researchers. Once more species become available, they have to repeat the whole process from the beginning because updating species trees is currently not possible. However, the de novo inference can be prohibitively costly in human effort or machine time. In this paper, we introduce INSTRAL, a method that extends ASTRAL to enable phylogenetic placement. INSTRAL is designed to place a new species on an existing species tree after sequences from the new species have already been added to gene trees; thus, INSTRAL is complementary to existing placement methods that update gene trees.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol is essential to the formation of phase separated lipid domains in membranes. Lipid domains can exist in different thermodynamic phases depending on the molecular composition, and play significant roles in determining structure and function of membrane proteins. We investigate the role of cholesterol in the structure and dynamics of ternary lipid mixtures displaying phase separation using Molecular Dynamics simulations, employing a physiologically-relevant span of cholesterol concentration. We find that cholesterol can induce formation of three regimes of phase behavior, I) miscible liquid disordered bulk, II) phase separated, domain registered coexistence of liquid disordered and liquid ordered and domains, and III) phase separated, domain-anti-registered coexistence of liquid-disordered and newly-identified nanoscopic gel domains composed of cholesterol threads we name \\\"cholesterolic gel\\\" domains.

The geographic patterns of different drivers, and the spatial overlap among these drivers, have important implications for the direction and pace of biodiversity change, yet are not well documented. Moreover, it is unknown if the geographic patterns of drivers differ between the terrestrial and marine realm, as expected due to marked differences in how humans interact with the land and ocean.\nC_LIO_LIWe compiled global gridded datasets on climate change, land-use, resource exploitation, pollution, species invasions, and human population density. We used multivariate statistics to examine the spatial relationships among the datasets and to characterize the typical combinations of drivers experienced by different parts of the world.\nC_LIO_LIWe found stronger positive correlations among drivers in the terrestrial than in the marine realm, leading to areas of high intensities of multiple drivers on land. Climate change tended to be negatively correlated with other drivers in the terrestrial realm (e.g., in the tundra and boreal forest with high climate change but low human use and pollution) whereas the opposite was true in the marine realm (e.g., in the Indo-Pacific with high climate change and high fishing).\nC_LIO_LIWe show that different regions of the world can be defined by anthropogenic threat complexes (ATCs), distinguished by different sets of drivers with varying intensities. The ATCs can be used to test hypothesis about the pattern of biodiversity change, especially the joint effects of multiple drivers. More generally, our global analysis highlights the broad conservation priorities needed to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic change on biodiversity responses, with different priorities emerging on land and in the ocean, and in different parts of the world.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Partial neutralization of the Golgi lumen pH by ectopic expression of influenza virus M2 proton channel stabilizes acid-labile and protease-susceptible recombinant proteins in the plant cell secretory pathway. Here, we assessed the impact of M2 channel expression on the proteome of Nicotiana benthamiana leaf tissue infiltrated with the bacterial gene vector Agrobacterium tumefaciens, keeping in mind the key role of pH homeostasis on secreted protein processing and the involvement of protein secretion processes in plant cells upon microbial challenge. The proteomes of leaves agroinfiltrated with an empty vector or with an M2 channel-encoding vector were compared with the proteome of non-infiltrated leaves using a iTRAQ quantitative proteomics procedure. Leaves infiltrated with the empty vector had a low soluble protein content compared to non-infiltrated leaves, associated with a strong decrease of photosynthesis-associated proteins (including Rubisco) and a parallel increase of stress-related secreted proteins (including pathogenesis-related proteins, protease inhibitors and molecular chaperones). M2 expression partly compromised these alterations of the proteome to restore original soluble protein and Rubisco contents, associated with higher levels of translation-associated (ribosomal) proteins and reduced levels of stress-related proteins in the apoplast. Proteome changes in M2-expressing leaves were determined both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, to alter the steady-state levels of proteins not only along the secretory pathway but also in other cellular compartments including the chloroplast, the cytoplasm, the nucleus and the mitochondrion. These data illustrate the cell-wide influence of Golgi lumen pH homeostasis on the leaf proteome of N. benthamiana plants responding to microbial challenge. They underline in practice the relevance of carefully considering the eventual off-target effects of accessory proteins used to modulate specific cellular or metabolic functions in plant protein biofactories.",

    "abstract": "The toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules widely exist in bacteria, and their activities are associated with the persister phenotype of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). M. tb causes Tuberculosis, a contagious and severe airborne disease. There are ten MazEF TA systems in M. tb, which play important roles in stress adaptation. How the antitoxins antagonize toxins in M. tb or how the ten TA systems crosstalk to each other are of interests, but the detailed molecular mechanisms are largely unclear. MazEF-mt9 is a unique member among the MazEF families due to its tRNase activity, which is usually carried out by the VapC family toxins. Here we present the cocrystal structure of the MazEF-mt9 complex at 2.7 [A]. By characterizing the association mode between the TA pairs through various characterization techniques, we found that MazF-mt9 not only bound its cognate antitoxin, but also the non-cognate antitoxin MazE-mt1, a phenomenon that could be also observed in vivo. Based on our structural and biochemical work, we proposed that the cognate and heterologous interactions among different TA systems work together to relieve MazF-mt9s toxicity to M. tb cells, which may facilitate their adaptation to the stressful conditions encountered during host infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCETuberculosis (TB) is one of the most severe contagious diseases. Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), it poses a serious threat to human health. Additionally, TB is difficult to cure because of the multipledrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tb strains. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been discovered to widely exist in prokaryotic organisms with diverse roles, normally composed of a pair of molecules that antagonize each other. M. tb has ten MazEF systems, and some of them have been proved to be directly associated with the genesis of persisters and drug-resistance of M. tb. We here report the MazEF-mt9 complex structure, and thoroughly characterized the interactions between MazF-mt9 with MazEs within or outside the MazEF-mt9 family. Our study not only revealed the crosstalks between TA families and its significance to M. tb survival but also offers insights into potential anti-TB drug design.",

    "abstract": "Among the many factors influencing fibrin formation and structure (concentration, temperature, composition, pH,...), it has been suggested that the polydispersity of fibrinogen may play an important role. We propose here a detailed investigation of the influence of this parameter on fibrin multiscale structure.\\n\\nTwo commercial fibrinogen preparations were used, a monodisperse and a polydisperse one. First, the respective compositions of both fibrinogen preparations were thoroughly determined by measuring the FXIII, fibronectin, ,{beta} and {gamma} intact-chains contents, the{gamma}/{gamma} chains ratio, the N-glycosylation and the post-translational modifications. Slight variations between the composition of the two fibrinogen preparations were found which are much smaller than the compositional variations necessary to alter significantly fibrin multiscale structure as observed in the literature. Conversely, MALLS coupled SEC and DLS measurements showed that the polydisperse preparation contains significant amounts of aggregates while the other preparation is essentially monodisperse.\\n\\nThe multiscale structure of the fibrins produced from those two fibrinogen preparations was determined by using X-ray scattering, spectrophotometry, and confocal microscopy. Results show that fibers from the monodisperse fibrinogen present a crystalline longitudinal and lateral structure and form a needle-like network. The internal structure of fibers produced from the polydisperse fibrinogen looks amorphous with star-like branching nodes. The multiscale structure of mixtures between the two preparations shows a smooth evolution, demonstrating that the quantity of aggregates is a major determining factor for fibrin multiscale structure. Indeed, the effect of a few percent in mass of aggregates is larger than any other effect due to compositional differences under the same reaction conditions. Finally we propose a mechanistic interpretation of our results which points at a direct role of the aggregates during polymerization which disrupt the ideal ordering of monomers inside fibrin protofibrils and fibers.",

Here we develop an optogenetic approach to specifically tune the binding half-life of a light-responsive ligand to a chimeric antigen receptor without changing other binding parameters. By simultaneously manipulating binding half-life while controlling for receptor occupancy, we find that signaling is strongly gated by ligand binding half-life.

    "abstract": "Anti-tumor mAbs are the most widely used and characterized cancer immunotherapy agents. Despite having a significant impact on some malignancies, most cancer patients respond poorly or develop resistance to this therapy. A known mechanism of action of these therapeutic mAbs is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is a primarily effector function of NK cells. CD16A on human NK cells has an exclusive role in binding to tumor-bound IgG antibodies. Though CD16A is a potent activating receptor, it is a low affinity Fc{gamma}R and its cell surface levels can be rapidly downregulated by a proteolytic process involving ADAM17 upon NK cell activation, which are likely to limit the efficacy of tumor-targeting therapeutic mAbs in the tumor environment. We sought to enhance NK cell binding to anti-tumor mAbs by engineering these cells with a recombinant Fc{gamma}R consisting of the extracellular region of CD64, the highest affinity IgG Fc receptor expressed by leukocytes, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of CD16A. This novel recombinant Fc{gamma}R (CD64/16A) was expressed in the human NK cell line NK92 and in induced pluripotent stem cells from which primary NK cells were derived. CD64/16A also lacked the ADAM17 cleavage region in CD16A and it was not rapidly downregulated in expression following NK cell activation during ADCC. CD64/16A on NK cells facilitated conjugation to antibody-treated tumor cells, ADCC, and cytokine production, demonstrating functional activity by its two components. Unlike NK cells expressing CD16A, CD64/16A captured soluble therapeutic mAbs and the modified NK cells mediated tumor cell killing. Hence, CD64/16A could potentially be used as a docking platform on engineered NK cells for therapeutic mAbs and IgG Fc chimeric proteins, allowing for switchable targeting elements, and a novel cancer cellular therapy.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection worldwide, and a frequent cause of hearing loss or debilitating neurologic disease in newborn infants. Thus, a vaccine to prevent HCMV-associated congenital disease is a public health priority. One potential strategy is vaccination of women of child-bearing age to prevent maternal HCMV acquisition during pregnancy. The glycoprotein B (gB) + MF59 adjuvant subunit vaccine is the most efficacious tested clinically to date, demonstrating approximately 50% protection against HCMV infection of seronegative women in multiple phase 2 trials. Yet, the impact of gB/MF59-elicited immune responses on the population of viruses acquired by trial participants has not been assessed. In this analysis, we employed quantitative PCR as well as multiple sequencing methodologies to interrogate the magnitude and genetic composition of HCMV populations infecting gB/MF59 vaccinees and placebo recipients. We identified several differences between the viral dynamics of acutely-infected vaccinees and placebo recipients. First, there was reduced magnitude viral shedding in the saliva of gB vaccinees. Additionally, employing a panel of tests for genetic compartmentalization, we noted tissue-specific gB haplotypes in the majority of vaccinees though only in a single placebo recipient. Finally, we observed reduced acquisition of genetically-related gB1, gB2, and gB4 genotype \\\"supergroup\\\" HCMV variants among vaccine recipients, suggesting that the gB1 genotype vaccine construct may have elicited partial protection against HCMV viruses with antigenically-similar gB sequences. These findings indicate that gB immunization may have had a measurable impact on viral intrahost population dynamics and support future analysis of a larger cohort.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThough not a household name like Zika virus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes permanent neurologic disability in one newborn child every hour in the United States - more than Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and neural tube defects combined. There are currently no established effective preventative measures to inhibit congenital HCMV transmission following acute or chronic HCMV infection of a pregnant mother. However, the glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine is the most effective HCMV vaccine tried clinically to date. Here, we utilized high-throughput, next-generation sequencing of viral DNA isolated from patients enrolled in a gB vaccine trial, and identified several impacts that this vaccine had on the size, distribution, and composition of the in vivo viral population. These results have increased our understanding of why the gB/MF59 vaccine was partially efficacious and will inform future rational design of a vaccine to prevent congenital HCMV.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a medically important emerging arbovirus causing serious neuroinfections in humans against which no approved antiviral therapy is currently available. In this study, we demonstrate that 2'-C- methyl- or 4'-azido-modified nucleosides are highly effective inhibitors of WNV replication, showing nanomolar or low micromolar anti-WNV activity and negligible cytotoxicity in cell culture. One representative of C2'-methylated nucleosides, 7-deaza-2'-C- methyladenosine, significantly protected WNV-infected mice from disease progression and mortality. Twice daily treatment at 25 mg/kg starting at the time of infection resulted in 100% survival of the mice. This compound was highly effective, even if the treatment was initiated 3 days post-infection, at the time of a peak of viremia, which resulted in a 90% survival rate. However, the antiviral effect of 7-deaza-2'-C- methyladenosine was absent or negligible when the treatment was started 8 days post-infection (i.e., at the time of extensive brain infection). The 4'-azido moiety appears to be another important determinant for highly efficient inhibition of WNV replication in vitro. However, the strong anti-WNV effect of 4'-azidocytidine and 4'-azido-aracytidine was cell type-dependent and observed predominantly in PS cells. The effect was much less pronounced in Vero cells. Our results indicate that 2'-C- methylated or 4'-azidated nucleosides merit further investigation as potential therapeutic agents for treating WNV infections, as well as infections caused by other medically important flaviviruses.",

    "abstract": "Over forty years have passed since the first evidence showing the unbalanced attentional allocation of humans across the two visual fields, and since then, a wealth of behavioral, neurophysiological, and clinical data increasingly showed a right hemisphere dominance for orienting of attention. However, inconsistent evidence exists regarding the right-hemisphere dominance for executive control of attention, possibly due to a lack of consideration of its dynamics with the alerting and orienting functions. In this study, we used a version of the Attentional Network Test with lateralized presentation of the stimuli to the left visual field (processed by the right hemisphere, RH) and right visual field (processed by the left hemisphere, LH) to examine visual field differences in executive control of attention under conditions of alerting or orienting. Analyses of behavioral performance (reaction time and error rate) showed a more efficient executive control (reduced conflict effect) in the RH compared to the LH for the reaction time, under conditions of increased alerting and of informative spatial orienting. These results demonstrate the right-hemisphere superiority for executive control, and that this effect depends on the activation of the alerting and orienting functions.",

    "abstract": "Alexithymia represents a transdiagnostic marker across psychiatric entities associated with emotional impairments, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Accumulating evidence suggests that interoceptive dysfunctions that underpin the core symptomatic emotion recognition and empathy deficits in ASD may be contributed to by high levels of alexithymia rather than autistic symptoms per se. However, previous findings are hampered by generally elevated alexithymia in ASD patients, and thus were not able to differentiate common and distinct contributions across the entire spectrum of variations of autism and alexithymia. Moreover, the multi-factorial nature of the domains affected, such as distinct neural reactivity towards perceiving physical and affective pain, has not been accounted for. Against this background the present fMRI study employed a dimensional trait approach in n = 242 healthy subjects to determine common and distinct associations between both traits and pain empathic responses towards physical and affective pain. Higher levels of alexithymia associated with increased left anterior insula pain empathic reactivity. Disentangling these effects revealed a positive association during perceived physical pain, but a negative one during affective pain. No significant associations with trait autism were found, but an interaction effect between the trait dimensions was observed in the mid-cingulate cortex. Moderation analysis demonstrated that trait autism only impacted mid-cingulate reactivity towards physical pain in high alexithymia subjects, whereas reactivity towards affective pain was specifically associated with trait autism in low alexithymia subjects. Findings confirm previous patient studies suggesting that alexithymia rather than autism per se may drive altered insula pain empathic reactivity. Importantly, the present approach allowed for the first time to demonstrate that the impact of alexithymia on insula reactivity varies as a function of the pain empathic domain and that effects on other core empathy nodes evolve in interaction with trait autism.",

    "abstract": "Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis is a modification of the core C3 photosynthetic pathway that improves the ability of plants to assimilate carbon in water-limited environments. CAM plants fix CO2 mostly at night, when transpiration rates are low. All of the CAM pathway genes exist in ancestral C3 species, but the timing and magnitude of expression are greatly altered between C3 and CAM species. Understanding these regulatory changes is key to elucidating the mechanism by which CAM evolved from C3. Here we use two closely related species in the Orchidaceae, Erycina pusilla (CAM) and Erycina crista-galli (C3), to conduct comparative transcriptomic analyses across multiple time points. Clustering of genes with expression variation across the diel cycle revealed some canonical CAM pathway genes similarly expressed in both species, regardless of photosynthetic pathway. However, gene network construction indicated that 149 gene families had significant differences in network connectivity and were further explored for these functional enrichments. Genes involved in light sensing and ABA signaling were some of the most differently connected genes between the C3 and CAM Erycina species, in agreement with the contrasting diel patterns of stomatal conductance in C3 and CAM plants. Our results suggest changes to transcriptional cascades are important for the transition from C3 to CAM photosynthesis in Erycina.",

Using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as the model system, we revealed that chloroplast chaperonin is consisted of CPN60, CPN60{beta}1, and CPN60{beta}2, and co-chaperonin is composed of three subunits CPN20, CPN11 and CPN23 in vivo. CPN20 homo-oligomers and all possible other chloroplast co-chaperonin hetero-oligomers are functional, but only CPN11/20/23-CPN60{beta}1{beta}2 pair can fully replace GroES/GroEL in E. coli at stringent growth condition. Endogenous CPN60 was purified and its stoichiometry was determined to be 6:2:6 for CPN60:CPN60{beta}1:CPN60{beta}2. The cryo-EM structures of endogenous CPN60{beta}1{beta}2/ADP and CPN60{beta}1{beta}2/co-chaperonin/ADP were solved at resolutions of 4.06 [A] and 3.82[A], respectively. In both hetero-oligomeric complexes the chaperonin subunits within each ring are highly symmetric. The chloroplast co-chaperonin CPN11/20/23 formed seven GroES-like domains through hetero-oligomerization which symmetrically interact with CPN60{beta}1{beta}2. Our structures also reveal an uneven distribution of roof-like structures in the dome-shaped CPN11/20/23 and potentially diversified surface properties in the folding cavity of CPN60{beta}1{beta}2 that might enable the chloroplast chaperonin system to assist in the folding of specific substrates.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the StudyHerbarium specimens are increasingly used as records of plant flowering phenology, which has advanced for many species in response to climate change. However, most herbarium-based studies on plant phenology focus on taxa from temperate parts of the northern hemisphere. Here, we explore flowering phenologic responses to climate in a temperate/subtropical plant genus Protea (Proteaceae), an iconic group of woody plants with year-round flowering phenology and endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. Protea is widely used in horticulture and is a flagship genus for the flora of the hyperdiverse Cape Floristic Region.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a database of 2154 herbarium records of 25 Protea species to explore patterns in flowering spanning the past 100 years. We used a circular sliding window analysis to characterize phenological patterns in these aseasonal species, plus a novel linear mixed effects model formulation to test how both site-to-site and year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation affect flowering date across species.\\n\\nResultsBoth warmer sites and warmer years were associated with earlier flowering of 3-5 days/{degrees}C. In general, the timing of peak flowering was influenced more strongly by temperature than precipitation. Although species vary widely in when they flower during the year, their phenological responses to temperature are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species tending to shift flowering time similarly with increasing temperature.\\n\\nDiscussionTogether, our results point to climate-responsive phenology for this important plant genus. Our results indicate that the subtropical, aseasonally-flowering genus Protea has temperature-driven flowering phenologic responses that are remarkably similar in magnitude to those of better-studied northern temperate plant species, suggesting a generality across biomes that has not been described elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Resources available in the human nasal cavity are limited. Therefore, to successfully colonize the nasal cavity, bacteria must compete for scarce nutrients. Competition may occur directly through interference (e.g., antibiotics) or indirectly by nutrient sequestration. To investigate the nature of nasal bacterial competition, we performed co-culture inhibition assays between nasal Actinobacteria and Staphylococcus spp. We found that Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates were sensitive to growth inhibition by Actinobacteria but Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to inhibition. Among Actinobacteria, we observed that Corynebacterium spp. were variable in their ability to inhibit S. epidermidis. We sequenced the genomes of ten Corynebacterium spp. isolates, including three Corynebacterium propinquum that strongly inhibited S. epidermidis and seven other Corynebacterium spp. isolates that only weakly inhibited S. epidermidis. Using a comparative genomics approach, we found that the C. propinquum genomes were enriched in genes for iron acquisition and encoded a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for siderophore production, absent in the non-inhibitory Corynebacterium spp. genomes. Using a chromeazurol S assay, we confirmed that C. propinquum produced siderophores. We demonstrated that iron supplementation rescued S. epidermidis from inhibition by C. propinquum, suggesting that inhibition was due to iron restriction through siderophore production. Using comparative metabolomics, we identified the siderophore produced by C. propinquum as dehydroxynocardamine. Finally, we confirmed that the dehydroxynocardamine BGC is expressed in vivo by analyzing human nasal metatranscriptomes from the NIH Human Microbiome Project.\\n\\nTogether, our results suggest that bacteria produce siderophores to compete for limited available iron in the nasal cavity and improve their fitness.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWithin the nasal cavity, interference competition through antimicrobial production is prevalent. For instance, nasal Staphylococcus spp. strains can inhibit the growth of other bacteria through the production of nonribosomal peptides and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. In contrast, bacteria engaging in exploitation competition modify the external environment to prevent competitors from growing, usually by depleting access to essential nutrients. As the nasal cavity is a nutrient limited environment, we hypothesized that exploitation competition occurs in this system. We determined that Corynebacterium propinquum produces an iron-chelating siderophore and is able to use this molecule to sequester iron and inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Further, we found that the genes required for siderophore production are expressed in vivo. Thus, though siderophore production by bacteria is often considered a virulence trait, our work indicates that bacteria may produce siderophores to compete for limited iron in the human nasal cavity.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function mutations in the protein kinase DYRK1A lead to a syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Conversely, increased DYRK1A dosage is implicated in atypical brain development and neurocognitive deficits in trisomy 21. DYRK1A regulates a diverse array of cellular processes through kinase dependent and independent interactions with substrates and binding partners. Recent evidence implicates DYRK1A in direct regulation of the transcriptional machinery, but many of the molecular details are not yet known. Furthermore, the landscape of DYRK1A interactions in the nucleus is incomplete, impeding progress toward understanding its function in transcription. Here, we used immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify nuclear interaction partners of endogenous DYRK1A. These were enriched in DNA damage repair factors, transcriptional elongation factors and E3 ubiquitin ligases. We validated an interaction with RNF169, a factor that promotes homology directed repair upon DNA damage. We further show that knockout of DYRK1A or treatment with DYRK1A inhibitors in HeLa cells impaired efficient recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation. This nuclear interactome thus reveals a new role for DYRK1A in DNA damage repair and provides a resource for exploring new functions of DYRK1A in the nucleus.",

Ubiquitin is covalently conjugated to the substrate to alter its stability or to modulate signal transduction. In this study, we examined the importance of ubiquitination for HCV propagation. We found that inhibition of de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) or overexpression of non-specific DUBs impaired HCV replication, suggesting that ubiquitination regulates HCV replication. To identify specific DUBs involved in HCV propagation, we set up an RNAi screening against DUBs and successfully identified ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as a novel host factor for HCV propagation. Our studies showed that USP15 is involved in translation of HCV RNA and production of infectious HCV particles. In addition, deficiency of USP15 in human hepatic cell lines (Huh7 and Hep3B/miR122 cells) but not in a non-hepatic cell line (293T cells) impaired HCV propagation, suggesting that USP15 participates in HCV propagation through the regulation of hepatocyte-specific functions. Moreover, we showed that loss of USP15 had no effect on innate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. We also found that USP15-deficient Huh7 cells showed reductions in the sizes and numbers of lipid droplets (LDs), and addition of palmitic acids restored the production of infectious HCV particles.

These serotypes are antigenically distinct: symptomatic reinfection with a homotypic virus is very rare, while reinfection with a heterotypic virus is sometimes associated with severe disease. Until recently, it has been assumed that viruses within each serotype are antigenically uniform. However, specific genotypes within each serotype have been anecdotally associated with varying severity of patient outcomes and epidemic magnitude. One hypothesis is that each serotype contains overlooked, meaningful antigenic diversity. While antigenic cartography conducted on neutralization titers suggests that heterogeneity may exist within each serotype, its source, extent and impact is unclear. Here, we analyze a previously published titer dataset to quantify and characterize the extent of DENV intraserotype antigenic diversity. We map antigenic changes to specific mutations in E, the dengue envelope protein, and interpolate across the alignment to estimate the antigenic distance between pairs of viruses based on their genetic differences. We identify 49 specific substitutions and four colinear substitution clusters that contribute to dengue antigenic evolution. We find that DENV antigenic divergence is tightly coupled to DENV genetic divergence, and is likely a gradual, ongoing process. We report modest but significant antigenic diversity within each serotype of DENV, which may have important ramifications for vaccine design. To understand the impact of this antigenic heterogeneity on real-world DENV population dynamics, we also quantify the extent to which population immunity--accumulated through recent circulation of antigenically similar genotypes--determines the success and decline of DENV clades in a hyperendemic population. We find that antigenic fitness is a key determinant of DENV population turnover, although this appears to be driven by coarser serotype-level antigenic differences. By leveraging both molecular data and real-world population dynamics, these results provide a more nuanced understanding of dengue antigenic evolution, with important ramifications for improving vaccine design and epidemic preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Pacific geoduck aquaculture is a growing industry, however, little is known about how geoduck respond to varying environmental conditions, or how the industry will fare under projected climate conditions. To understand how geoduck production may be impacted by low pH associated with ocean acidification, multi-faceted environmental heterogeneity needs to be included to understand species and community responses. In this study, eelgrass habitats and environmental heterogeneity across four estuarine bays were leveraged to examine low pH effects on geoduck under different natural regimes, using targeted proteomics to assess physiology. Juvenile geoduck were deployed in eelgrass and adjacent unvegetated habitats for 30 days while pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity were monitored. Across the four bays, pH was lower in unvegetated habitats compared to eelgrass habitats. However this did not impact geoduck growth, survival, or proteomic abundance patterns in gill tissue. Temperature and dissolved oxygen differences across all locations corresponded to differences in growth and targeted protein abundance patterns. Specifically, three protein abundance levels (trifunctional-enzyme {beta}-subunit, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, and heat shock protein 90-) and shell growth positively correlated with dissolved oxygen variability and inversely correlated with mean temperature. These results demonstrate that geoduck may be resilient to low pH in a natural setting, but other abiotic factors (i.e. temperature, dissolved oxygen variability) may have a greater influence on geoduck physiology. In addition this study contributes to the understanding of how eelgrass patches influences water chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres provide a robust model for epigenetic inheritance as they are specified by sequence-independent mechanisms involving the histone H3-variant CENP-A. Prevailing models indicate that the high intrinsic stability of CENP-A nucleosomes maintains centromere identity indefinitely. Here, we demonstrate that CENP-A is not stable at centromeres, but is instead gradually and continuously incorporated in quiescent cells including G0-arrested tissue culture cells and prophase I-arrested oocytes. Quiescent CENP-A incorporation involves the canonical CENP-A deposition machinery, but displays distinct requirements from cell cycle-dependent deposition. We demonstrate that Plk1 is required specifically for G1 CENP-A deposition, whereas transcription promotes CENP-A incorporation in quiescent oocytes. Preventing CENP-A deposition during quiescence results in significantly reduced CENP-A levels and perturbs chromosome segregation following the resumption of cell division. In contrast to quiescent cells, terminally differentiated cells fail to maintain CENP-A levels. Our work reveals that quiescent cells actively maintain centromere identity providing an indicator of proliferative potential.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating how stem cells adjust to a demand for specialized cells. A failure of the stem cells to respond to this demand can have serious consequences, such as tissue loss, or prolonged recovery post injury.\n\nHere, we challenge the male germline stem cells (GSCs) of Drosophila melanogaster for the production of specialized cells using mating experiments. We show that repeated mating reduced the sperm pool and accelerated germline stem cell (GSC) divisions. The increase in GSC divisions depended on the activity of the highly conserved G-proteins. Germline expression of RNA-Interference (RNA-i) constructs against G-proteins or a dominant negative G-protein eliminated the increase in GSC divisions in mated males. Consistent with a role for the G-proteins in the regulation of GSC divisions, RNA-i against seven out of 35 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) within the germline cells also eliminated the capability of males to accelerate their GSC divisions in response to mating. Our data show that GSCs are receptive to GPCR stimulus, potentially through a network of interactions among multiple signaling pathways.",

Upon low temperature or limited nutrient availability, the cells enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. Characteristic of this state are an altered morphology, low metabolic activity and lack of growth under standard laboratory conditions. Here, for the first time, the cellular ultrastructure of V. cholerae VBNC cells raised in natural waters was investigated using electron cryo-tomography complemented by comparison of the proteomes and the peptidoglycan composition of LB overnight culture and VBNC cells. The extensive remodeling of the VBNC cells was most obvious in the passive dehiscence of the cell envelope, resulting in improper embedment of flagella and pili. Only minor changes of the peptidoglycan and osmoregulated periplasmic glucans were observed. Active changes in VBNC cells included the production of cluster I chemosensory arrays and change of abundance of cluster II array proteins. Components involved in iron acquisition and storage, peptide import and arginine biosynthesis were overrepresented in VBNC cells, while enzymes of the central carbon metabolism were found at lower levels. Finally, several pathogenicity factors of V. cholerae were less abundant in the VBNC state, potentially limiting their infectious potential.",

Right and left ovaries are not equal, and neither are the eggs and follicular fluid that they produce, and I further hypothesise that during times of stress, the implantation threshold is shifted sufficiently to favour survival of females, most likely those originating from the right ovary, and that this, rather than simply a greater loss of males, explains at least some of the variability in the human sex ratio at birth.",

    "abstract": "Small molecules are the primary communication media of the microbial world. Recent bioinformatics studies, exploring the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) which produce many small molecules, have highlighted the incredible biochemical potential of the signaling molecules encoded by the human microbiome. Thus far, most research efforts have focused on understanding the social language of the gut microbiome, leaving crucial signaling molecules produced by oral bacteria, and their connection to health versus disease, in need of investigation. In this study, a total of 4,915 BGCs were identified across 461 genomes representing a broad taxonomic diversity of oral bacteria. Sequence similarity networking provided a putative product class for over 100 unclassified novel BGCs. The newly identified BGCs were cross-referenced against 254 metagenomes and metatranscriptomes derived from individuals with either good oral health, dental caries, or periodontitis. This analysis revealed 2,473 BGCs, which were differentially represented across the oral microbiomes associated with health versus disease. Co-abundance network analysis identified numerous inverse correlations between BGCs and specific oral taxa. These correlations were present in health, but greatly reduced in dental caries, which may suggest a defect in colonization resistance. Finally, corroborating mass spectrometry identified several compounds with homology to products of the predicted BGC classes. Together, these findings greatly expand the number of known biosynthetic pathways present in the oral microbiome and provide an atlas for experimental characterization of these abundant, yet poorly understood, molecules and socio-chemical relationships, which impact the development of caries and periodontitis, two of the worlds most common chronic diseases.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe healthy oral microbiome is symbiotic with the human host, importantly providing colonization resistance against potential pathogens. Dental caries and periodontitis are two of the worlds most common and costly chronic infectious diseases, and are caused by a localized dysbiosis of the oral microbiome. Bacterially produced small molecules, often encoded by BGCs, are the primary communication media of bacterial communities, and play a crucial, yet largely unknown, role in the transition from health to dysbiosis. This study provides a comprehensive mapping of the BGC repertoire of the human oral microbiome and identifies major differences in health compared to disease. Furthermore, BGC representation and expression is linked to the abundance of particular oral bacterial taxa in health versus dental caries and periodontitis. Overall, this study provides a significant insight into the chemical communication network of the healthy oral microbiome, and how it devolves in the case of two prominent diseases.",

    "abstract": "Transcription by RNA polymerases (RNAPs) is essential for cellular life. Genes are often transcribed by multiple RNAPs. While the properties of individual RNAPs are well appreciated, it remains less explored whether group behaviors can emerge from co-transcribing RNAPs under most physiological levels of gene expression. Here, we provide evidence in Escherichia coli that well-separated RNAPs can exhibit collaborative and antagonistic group dynamics. Co-transcribing RNAPs translocate faster than a single RNAP, but the density of RNAPs has no significant effect on their average speed. When a promoter is inactivated, RNAPs that are far downstream from the promoter slow down and experience premature dissociation, but only in the presence of other co-transcribing RNAPs. These group behaviors depend on transcription-induced DNA supercoiling, which can also mediate inhibitory dynamics between RNAPs from neighboring divergent genes. Our findings suggest that transcription on topologically-constrained DNA, a norm across organisms, can provide an intrinsic mechanism for modulating the speed and processivity of RNAPs over long distances according to the promoters on/off state.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria acquire sulfur through the sulfur assimilation pathway, but under sulfur limiting conditions bacteria must acquire sulfur from alternative sources. The alkanesulfonate monooxygenase enzymes are expressed under sulfur-limiting conditions, and catalyze the desulfonation of wide-range of alkanesulfonate substrates. The SsuE enzyme is an NADPH-dependent FMN reductase that provides reduced flavin to the SsuD monooxygenase. The mechanism for the transfer of reduced flavin in flavin dependent two-component systems occurs either by free-diffusion or channeling. Previous studies have shown the presence of protein-protein interactions between SsuE and SsuD, but the identification of putative interaction sights have not been investigated. Current studies utilized HDX-MS to identify protective sites on SsuE and SsuD. A conserved -helix on SsuD showed a decrease in percent deuteration when SsuE was included in the reaction. This suggests the role of -helix in promoting protein-protein interactions. Specific SsuD variants were generated in order to investigate the role of these residues in protein-protein interactions and catalysis. Variant containing substitutions at the charged residues showed a six-fold decrease in the activity, while a deletion variant of SsuD lacking the -helix showed no activity when compared to wild-type SsuD. In addition, there was no protein-protein interactions identified between SsuE and his-tagged SsuD variants in pull-down assays, which correlated with an increase in the Kd value. The -helix is located right next to a dynamic loop region, positioned at the entrance of the active site. The putative interaction site and dynamic loop region located so close to the active site of SsuD suggests the importance of this region in the SsuD catalysis. Stopped-flow studies were performed to analyze the lag-phase which signifies the stabilization and transfer of reduced flavin from SsuE to SsuD. The SsuD variants showed a decrease in lag-phase, which could be because of a downturn in flavin transfer. A competitive assay was devised to evaluate the mechanism of flavin transfer in the alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system. A variant of SsuE was generated which interacted with SsuD, but was not able to reduce FMN. Assays that included varying concentrations of Y118A SsuE and wild-type SsuE in the coupled assays showed a decrease in the desulfonation activity of SsuD. The decrease in activity could be by virtue of Y118A SsuE competing with the wild-type SsuE for the putative docking site on SsuD. These studies define the importance of protein-protein interactions for the efficient transfer of reduced flavin from SsuE to SsuD leading to the desulfonation of alkanesulfonates.",

We demonstrate 100-fold heterogeneity in AR output within cell lines and show that cells with high AR output have reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Through transcriptomic and shRNA knockdown studies, together with analysis of clinical datasets, we identify GREB1 as a gene responsible for high AR output. We show that GREB1 is an AR target gene that amplifies AR output by enhancing AR DNA binding and promoting p300 recruitment. GREB1 knockdown in high AR output cells restores enzalutamide sensitivity in vivo. Thus, GREB1 is a candidate driver of enzalutamide resistance through a novel feed forward mechanism.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAntigenic variation is employed by many pathogens to evade the host immune response, and Trypanosoma brucei has evolved a complex system to achieve this phenotype, involving sequential use of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes encoded from a large repertoire of [~]2,000 alleles. T. brucei express multiple, sometimes closely related, VSGs in a population at any one time, and the ability to resolve and analyse this diversity has been limited. We applied long read sequencing (PacBio) to VSG amplicons generated from blood extracted from batches of mice sacrificed at time points (days 3, 6, 10 and 12) post-infection with T. brucei TREU927. The data showed that long read sequencing is reliable for resolving allelic differences between VSGs, and demonstrated that there is significant expressed diversity (449 VSGs detected across 20 mice) and across the timeframe of study there was a clear semi-reproducible pattern of expressed diversity (median of 27 VSGs per sample at day 3 post infection (p.i.), 82 VSGs at day 6 p.i., 187 VSGs at day 10 p.i. and 132 VSGs by day 12 p.i.). There was also consistent detection of one VSG dominating expression across replicates at days 3 and 6, and emergence of a second dominant VSG across replicates by day 12. The innovative application of ecological diversity analysis to VSG reads enabled characterisation of hierarchical VSG expression in the dataset, and resulted in a novel method for analysing such patterns of variation. Additionally, the long read approach allowed detection of mosaic VSG expression from very few reads - this was observed as early as day 3, the earliest that such events have been detected. Therefore, our results indicate that long read analysis is a reliable tool for resolving diverse allele expression profiles, and provides novel insights into the complexity and nature of VSG expression in trypanosomes, revealing significantly higher diversity than previously shown and identifying mosaic gene formation unprecedentedly early during the infection process.",

Using computational tools and biochemical assays, we discovered that xrRNA elements are widely found in viruses belonging to the Tombusviridae and Luteoviridae families of plant-infecting RNA viruses, demonstrating their importance and widespread utility. Unexpectedly, many xrRNAs are located in intergenic regions rather than in the 3UTR and some are associated with the 5' ends of subgenomic RNAs with protein-coding potential, suggesting that xrRNAs with similar scaffolds are involved in the maturation or maintenance of diverse subgenomic RNAs, not just the ones generated from the 3'UTR.",

    "abstract": "The impact that {beta}-arrestin proteins have on G-protein-coupled receptor trafficking, signaling and physiological behavior has gained much appreciation over the past decade. A number of studies have attributed the side effects associated with the use of naturally occurring and synthetic opioids, such as respiratory depression and constipation, to excessive recruitment of {beta}-arrestin. These findings have led to the development of biased opioid small molecule agonists that do not recruit {beta}-arrestin, activating only the canonical G-protein pathway. Similar G-protein biased small molecule opioids have been found to occur in nature, particularly within kratom, and opioids within salvia have served as a template for the synthesis of other G-protein-biased opioids. Here, we present the first report of naturally occurring peptides that selectively activate G-protein signaling pathways with minimal {beta}-arrestin recruitment. We find that rubiscolin peptides, which are produced as cleavage products of the plant protein rubisco, bind to and activate G-protein signaling at {delta} opioid receptors. However, unlike the naturally occurring {delta} opioid peptides leu-enkephalin and deltorphin II, the rubiscolin peptides only very weakly recruit {beta}-arrestin 2 and have undectable recruitment of {beta}-arrestin 1 at the {delta} opioid receptor.",

    "abstract": "The cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase (CRL) family consists of ~250 complexes that catalyze ubiquitylation of proteins to achieve cellular regulation. All CRLs are inhibited by the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN) through both enzymatic (deneddylation) and non-enzymatic (steric) mechanisms. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms is unclear. Here, we decouple the mechanisms using CSNAP, the recently discovered ninth subunit of the CSN. We find that CSNAP reduces the affinity of CSN toward CRL complexes. Removing CSNAP does not affect deneddylation, but leads to global effects on the CRL, causing altered reproductive capacity, suppressed DNA damage response, decreased viability, and delayed cell cycle progression. Thus, although CSNAP is only 2% of the CSN mass, it plays a critical role in the steric regulation of CRLs by the CSN.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells balance with the equilibrium of cell death and growth to expand and metastasize. The activity of mammalian sterile20-like kinases MST1/2 has been linked to apoptosis and tumor suppression via YAP/Hippo pathway dependent and independent mechanisms. With a kinase substrate screen we identified here MST1 and MST2 among the top substrates for fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4). In COS-1 cells, MST1 was phosphorylated at Y433 residue in an FGFR4 kinase activity-dependent manner, as assessed by mass spectrometry. Blockade of this phosphorylation by Y433F mutation induced MST1 activation, as reflected by increased autophosphorylation at T183 in FGFR4 overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, the specific short-term inhibition or knockdown of FGFR4 also led to MST1/2 activation in conjunction with induction of MST1/2-dependent apoptosis in an endogenous model of HER2+ breast cancer cells. Moreover, FGFR4 knockdown increased the level of active nuclear MST1 coincidentally with cell polarization and membrane-association of YAP in three-dimensional breast cancer cell spheres. Consistently, FGFR4 overexpression correlated with reduced Hippo pathway-mediated, nuclear translocation-inhibiting YAP phosphorylation, and abysmal HER2+ breast carcinoma patient outcome in TCGA cohort. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for FGFR4 oncogenic activity via suppression of the stress-associated MST1/2-dependent apoptosis machinery in the tumor cells with prominent HER/ERBB signaling driven proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytosis of invading pathogens or cellular debris requires a dramatic change in cell shape driven by actin polymerization. For antibody-covered targets, phagocytosis is thought to proceed through the sequential engagement of Fc-receptors on the phagocyte with antibodies on the target surface, leading to the extension and closure of the phagocytic cup around the target. We have found that two actin-dependent molecular motors, class 1 myosins myosin 1e and myosin 1f, are specifically localized to Fc-receptor adhesions and required for efficient phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized targets. Using primary macrophages lacking both myosin 1e and myosin 1f, we found that without the actin-membrane linkage mediated by these myosins, the organization of individual adhesions is compromised, leading to excessive actin polymerization, slower adhesion turnover, and deficient phagocytic internalization. This work identifies a novel role for class 1 myosins in coordinated adhesion turnover during phagocytosis and supports a model for a membrane-tension based feedback mechanism for phagocytic cup closure.\\n\\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveIrritability is a common reason for referral to services, strongly associated with impairment and negative outcomes, but is a nosological and treatment challenge. A major issue is how irritability should be conceptualized. This study used a developmental approach to test the hypothesis that there are several forms of irritability, including a  neurodevelopmental/ADHD-like subtype with onset in childhood and a  depression/mood subtype with onset in adolescence.\\n\\nMethodData were analyzed in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective UK population-based cohort. Irritability trajectory-classes were estimated for 7924 individuals with data at multiple time-points across childhood and adolescence (4 possible time-points from approximately ages 7 to 15 years). Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed at approximately ages 7 and 15 years. Psychiatric genetic risk was indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRS) for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) derived using large genome-wide association study results.\\n\\nResultsFive irritability trajectory classes were identified: low (81.2%), decreasing (5.6%), increasing (5.5%), late-childhood limited (5.2%) and high-persistent (2.4%). The early-onset, high-persistent trajectory was associated with male preponderance, childhood ADHD (OR=108.64 (57.45-204.41), p<0.001) and ADHD PRS (OR=1.31 (1.09-1.58), p=0.005); the adolescent-onset, increasing trajectory was associated with female preponderance, adolescent MDD (OR=5.14 (2.47-10.73), p<0.001) and MDD PRS (OR=1.20, (1.05-1.38), p=0.009). Both trajectory classes were associated with MDD diagnosis and ADHD genetic risk.\\n\\nConclusionsThe developmental context of irritability may be important in its conceptualization: early-onset persistent irritability maybe more  neurodevelopmental/ADHD-like and later-onset irritability more  depression/mood-like. This has implications for treatment as well as nosology.",

    "abstract": "The colonial tunicate Botrylloides leachii is exceptional at regenerating from a piece of vascular tunic after loss of all adults from the colony. Previous transcriptome analyses indicate a brief period of healing before regeneration of a new adult (zooid) in as little as 8-10 days. However, there is little understanding of how the resulting changes to gene expression, required to drive regeneration, are initiated and how the overall process is regulated. Rapid changes to gene expression often occur in response to chromatin changes, mediated by histone modifications such as histone acetylation. Here, we investigated a group of key epigenetic modifiers, histone deacetylases (HDAC) that are known to play an important role in many biological processes such as development, healing and regeneration.\\n\\nThrough our transcriptome data, we identified and quantified the expression levels of HDAC and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes during whole body regeneration (WBR). To determine if HDAC activity is required for WBR, we inhibited its action using valproic acid (VPA) and Trichostatin A (TSA). HDAC inhibition prevented the final morphological changes normally associated with WBR and resulted in aberrant gene expression. B. leachii genes including Slit2, TGF-{square}, Piwi and Fzd4 all showed altered gene expression upon HDAC inhibition in comparison to the control samples. Additionally, atypical expression of Bl_Piwi was found in immunocytes upon HDAC inhibition.\\n\\nTogether, these results show that HDAC function, specifically HDAC I/IIa class enzymes, are vital for B. leachii to undergo WBR successfully.",

    "abstract": "Spatial working memory is important for foraging and navigating the environment. However, its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. The hippocampus, known for its spatial coding and involvement in spatial memory, is widely understood to be necessary for spatial working memory when retention intervals increase beyond seconds into minutes. Here, we describe new evidence that the dorsal hippocampus is not always necessary for spatial working memory for retention intervals of 8 minutes. Rats were trained to perform a delayed spatial win shift radial arm maze task (DSWS) with an 8-minute delay between study and test phases. We then tested whether bilateral inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus between the study and test phases impaired behavioral performance at test. Inactivation was achieved through a bilateral infusion of lidocaine. Performance following lidocaine was compared to control trials, in which, sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was infused. Test performance did not differ between the lidocaine and PBS conditions, remaining high in each. To explore the possibility that this insensitivity to inactivation was a result of overtraining, a second cohort of animals received substantially less training prior to the infusions. In this second cohort, lidocaine infusions did significantly impair task performance. These data indicate that successful performance of a spatial win-shift task on the 8-arm maze need not always be hippocampally dependent.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical work predicts that decisions made with low confidence should lead to increased information-seeking. This is an adaptive strategy because it can increase the quality of a decision, and previous behavioral work has shown that decision-makers engage in such confidence-driven information seeking. The present study aimed to characterize the neural markers that mediate the relationship between confidence and information-seeking. A paradigm was used in which human participants made an initial perceptual decision, and then decided whether or not they wanted to sample more evidence before committing to a final decision and confidence judgment. Pre-decisional and post-decisional ERP components were similarly modulated by the level of confidence and by information-seeking choices. Time-resolved multivariate decoding of scalp EEG signals first revealed that information-seeking choices could be decoded from the time of the initial decision to the time of the subsequent information-seeking choice (within-condition decoding). No above-chance decoding was visible in the pre-response time window. Crucially, a classifier trained to decode high versus low confidence predicted information-seeking choices after the initial perceptual decision (across-condition decoding). This time window corresponds to that of a post-decisional neural marker of confidence. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that neural indices of confidence are functionally involved in information-seeking decisions.",

    "abstract": "Procedural memory facilitates the efficient processing of complex environmental stimuli and contributes to the acquisition of automatic behaviours and habits. Learning can occur intentionally or incidentally, yet, how the mode of learning affects procedural memory is still poorly understood. Importantly, procedural memory is a complex cognitive function composed of different subprocesses, including the acquisition and consolidation of statistical, frequency-based and sequential, order-based knowledge. Therefore, we tested how statistical and sequence knowledge develops during incidental versus intentional procedural memory formation and during consolidation. Seventy-four young adults performed either the uncued, incidental (N = 37) or the cued, intentional (N = 37) version of a probabilistic sequence learning task. Performance was retested after a 12-hour offline period, enabling us to test the effect of sleep on consolidation; therefore, half of the participants slept during the delay, while the other half had normal daily activity (PM-AM versus AM-PM design). The mode of learning (incidental versus intentional) had no effect on the acquisition of statistical knowledge, while intention to learn increased sequence learning performance. Consolidation was not affected by intention to learn: Both statistical and sequence knowledge was retained over the 12-hour delay, irrespective of the mode of learning and whether the delay included sleep or wake activity. These results suggest a time-dependent instead of sleep-dependent consolidation of both statistical and sequence knowledge. Our findings could contribute to a better understanding of how the mode of learning (intentional or incidental) affects procedural memory formation and consolidation.",

For both outcomes, multivariate models which included all variables resulted in the best fit, reflecting the complex influences of a variety of factors on the ictal response.

    "abstract": "DNA metabarcoding is an attractive approach for monitoring biodiversity. However, it is subject to biases that often impede detection of all species in a sample. In particular, the proportion of sequences recovered from each species depends on its biomass, mitome copy number, and primer set employed for PCR. To examine these variables, we constructed a mock community of terrestrial arthropods comprised of 374 BINs, a species proxy. We used this community to examine how species recovery was impacted when amplicon pools were constructed in four ways. The first two protocols involved the construction of bulk DNA extracts from different body partitions (Bulk Abdomen, Bulk Leg). The other protocols involved the production of DNA extracts from single legs which were then merged prior to PCR (Composite Leg) or PCR-amplified separately (Single Leg) and then pooled. The amplicon generated by these four treatments were then sequenced on three platforms (Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM and Ion Torrent S5). The choice of sequencing platform did not substantially influence species recovery, other variables did. As expected, the best recovery was obtained from the Single Leg treatment, but the Bulk Abdomen produced a more uniform read abundance than the Bulk Leg or Composite Leg samples. Primer choice also influenced species recovery. Our results reveal how variation in protocols can have substantive impacts on perceived diversity unless sequencing coverage is sufficient to reach an asymptote. Although metabarcoding is a powerful approach, further optimization of analytical protocols is crucial to obtain reproducible results and increase its cost-effectiveness.",

(Viscaceae) are keystone species in many ecosystems across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia because of their complex faunal interactions. We here reconstructed the evolutionary history of Viscum based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data. We obtained a highly resolved phylogenetic tree with ten well-supported clades, which we used to understand the spatio-temporal evolution of these aerial parasites and evaluate the contribution of reproductive switches and shifts in host ranges to their distribution and diversification. The genus Viscum originated in the early Eocene in Africa and appeared to have diversified mainly through geographic isolation, in several cases apparently coinciding with shifts in host preferences. During its evolution, switches in the reproductive mode from ancestral dioecy to monoecy imply an important role in the long-distance dispersal of the parasites from Africa to continental Asia and Australia. We also observed multiple cases of photosynthetic surface reduction (evolution of scale leaves) within the genus, probably indicative of increasing specialization associated with the parasitic lifestyle. Even compared with other parasitic angiosperms, where more host generalists than specialists exist, Viscum species are characterized by extraordinarily broad host ranges. Specialization on only a few hosts from a single family or order occurs rarely and is restricted mostly to very recently evolved lineages. The latter mostly derive from or are closely related to generalist parasites, implying that niche shifting to a new host represents an at least temporary evolutionary advantage in Viscum.",

This requires sensory, motor-planning, and cognitive neural mechanisms. But what are the unique contributions of these mechanisms to performance, and when exactly are they engaged? By introducing an urgency requirement into the antisaccade task, we track the evolution of the choice process with millisecond resolution and find a singular, nonlinear dependence on cue exposure: when viewed briefly ([~]100-140 ms), the cue captures attention so powerfully that looking at it (erroneously) is virtually inevitable, but as the cue viewing time increases, the probability of success quickly rises and saturates. The psychophysical and modeling results reveal concerted interactions between reflexive and voluntary cognitive mechanisms that (1) unfold extremely rapidly, (2) are qualitatively consistent across participants, and (3) are nevertheless quantitatively distinctive of each individuals perceptual capacities",

Can the magnitude of expectation-based decision biases be flexibly modulated based on the outcome of previous decisions? We trained rats in several two-alternative forced choice auditory tasks, where the probability to repeat the previous stimulus category was varied in blocks of trials. All rats capitalized on the serial correlations of the stimulus sequence by consistently exploiting a transition bias: a tendency to repeat or alternate their previous response using an internal trial-by-trial estimate of the sequence repeating probability. Surprisingly, this expectation bias was null in trials immediately following an error. The internal estimate however was not reset and it became effective again causing a bias after the next correct response. This ability to rapidly activate and inactivate the bias was captured by a non-linear generative model of rat behavior, whereby a reward-driven modulatory signal gated the use of the latent estimate of the environment statistics on the current decision. These results demonstrate that rats use behavioral outcomes to flexibly modulate how expectations derived from the recent history influence their decisions.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in macaque area LIP exhibit gradual ramping in their trial-averaged spike responses during sensory decision-making. However, recent work has sparked debate over whether single-trial LIP spike trains are better described by discrete \\\"stepping\\\" or continuous drift-diffusion (\\\"ramping\\\") dynamics. Here we address this controversy using powerful model-based analyses of LIP spike responses. We extended latent dynamical models of LIP spike trains to incorporate non-Poisson spiking, baseline firing rates, and various nonlinear relationships between the latent variable and firing rate. Moreover, we used advanced model-comparison methods, including cross-validation and a fully Bayesian information criterion, to evaluate and compare models. These analyses revealed that when non-Poisson spiking was incorporated into existing stepping and ramping models, a majority of neurons remained better described by stepping dynamics, even when conditioning on evidence level or choice. However, an extended ramping model with a non-zero baseline and a compressive output nonlinearity accounted for roughly as many neurons as the stepping model. The latent dynamics inferred under this model exhibited high diffusion variance for many neurons, making them qualitatively different than slowly-evolving continuous dynamics. These findings generalized to alternative tasks, suggesting that a robust fraction of LIP neurons are better described by each model class.",

    "abstract": "Site-specific recombination promoted by serine integrases can be used for ordered assembly of DNA fragments into larger arrays. When a plasmid vector is included in the assembly, the circular product DNA molecules can transform E. coli cells. A convenient \\\"one-pot\\\" method using a single integrase involves recombination between pairs of matched orthogonal attachment sites, allowing assembly of up to six DNA fragments. However, the efficiency of assembly decreases as the number of fragments increases, due to accumulation of incorrect products in which recombination has occurred between mismatched sites. Here we use mathematical modelling to analyse published experimental data for the assembly reactions and suggest potential ways to improve assembly efficiency. We assume that unproductive synaptic complexes between pairs of mismatched sites become predominant as the number and diversity of sites increase. Our modelling predicts that the proportion of correct products can be improved by raising fragment DNA concentrations and lowering plasmid vector concentration. The assembly kinetics is affected by the inactivation of integrase in vitro. The model also predicts that the precision might be improved by redesigning the location of attachment sites on fragments to reduce the formation of the wrong circular products. Our preliminary experimental explorations of assembly with {phi}C31 integrase confirmed that assembly efficiency might be improved. However, optimization of efficiency would require more experimental work on the mechanisms of wrong product formation. The use of a more efficient integrase (such as Bxb1) might be a more promising approach to assembly optimization. The model might be easily extended for different integrases or/and different assembly strategies, such as those using multiple integrases or multiple substrate structures.",

However, the triggering mechanisms of this process are mostly unknown. Using pathway enrichment tools applied to GWAS we show that genes at risk loci are involved in biological functions relevant to cell adhesion and migration during cardiac development and in response to shear stress.

    "abstract": "The auditory system in many mammals is immature at birth but precisely organized in adults. Spontaneous activity in the inner ear plays a critical role in guiding this process. This is shaped by an efferent pathway that descends from the brainstem and makes transient direct synaptic contacts with inner hair cells (IHCs). In this work, we used an 9 cholinergic receptor knock-in mouse model (of either sex) with enhanced medial efferent activity (Chrna9L9T, L9T) to understand the role of the olivocochlear system in the correct establishment of auditory circuits. Wave III of auditory brainstem responses (which represents synchronized activity of synapses within the superior olivary complex) were smaller in L9T mice, suggesting a central dysfunction. The mechanism underlying this functional alteration was analysed in brain slices containing the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), where neurons are topographically organized along a medio-lateral axis. The topographic organization of MNTB physiological properties observed in WT mice was abolished in the L9T mice. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings in slices evidenced MNTB synaptic alterations, which were further supported by morphological alterations. The present results suggest that the transient cochlear efferent innervation to IHCs during the critical period before the onset of hearing is involved in the refinement of topographic maps as well as in setting the correct synaptic transmission at central auditory nuclei.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCochlear inner hair cells of altricial mammals display spontaneous electrical activity before hearing onset. The pattern and firing rate of these cells is crucial for the correct maturation of the central auditory pathway. A descending efferent innervation from the central nervous system contacts hair cells during this developmental window. The function of this transient efferent innervation remains an open question. The present work shows that the genetic enhancement of efferent function disrupts the orderly topographic distribution at the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body level and causes severe synaptic dysfunction. Thus, the transient efferent innervation to the cochlea is necessary for the correct establishment of the central auditory circuitry.",

However, the mechanisms underlying different infiltration-levels are largely unknown. Here, we have characterized the spatial profile of CD8+ T cells around tumorcell clusters in the core and margin regions in TNBC. Combining mathematical modeling and data analysis, we propose that there exists a possible chemo-repellent inside tumor-cell clusters, which prevents CD8+ T cells from infiltrating into tumor-cell clusters. Furthermore, investigation into the properties of collagen fibers suggests that variations in desmoplastic elements does not limit infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into tumor-cell clusters. This is consistent with the prediction of our mathematical modeling analysis whereby CD8+ T cells are predicted to infiltrate the fibrotic barrier and their infiltration into tumor clusters is governed by other mechanisms involving a local repellent.",

    "abstract": "The biochemical activities underlying cell-fate decisions vary profoundly even in genetically identical cells. But such non-genetic heterogeneity remains refractory to current imaging methods, because their capacity to monitor multiple biochemical activities in single living cells over time remains limited1. Here, we deploy a family of newly designed GFP-like sensors (NyxBits) with fast photon-counting electronics and bespoke analytics (NyxSense) in multiplexed biochemical imaging, to define a network determining the fate of single cells exposed to the DNA-damaging drug cisplatin. By simultaneously imaging a tri-nodal network comprising the cell-death proteases Caspase-2, -3 and -92, we reveal unrecognized single-cell heterogeneities in the dynamics and amplitude of caspase activation that signify survival versus cell death via necrosis or apoptosis. Non-genetic heterogeneity in the pattern of caspase activation recapitulates traits of therapy resistance previously ascribed solely to genetic causes3,4. Chemical inhibitors that alter these patterns can modulate in a predictable manner the phenotypic landscape of the cellular response to cisplatin. Thus, multiplexed biochemical imaging reveals cellular populations and biochemical states, invisible to other methods, underlying therapeutic responses to an anticancer drug. Our work develops widely applicable tools to monitor the dynamic activation of biochemical networks at single-cell resolution. It highlights the necessity to resolve patterns of network activation in single cells, rather than the average state of individual nodes, to define, and potentially control, mechanisms underlying cellular decisions in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In a cryo-EM experiment, the microscope produces images called micrographs. Projections of the molecule of interest are embedded in the micrographs at unknown locations, and under unknown viewing directions. Standard imaging techniques first locate these projections (detection) and then reconstruct the 3-D structure from them. Unfortunately, high noise levels hinder detection. When reliable detection is rendered impossible, the standard techniques fail. This is a problem especially for small molecules, which can be particularly hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a radically different approach: we contend that the structure could, in principle, be reconstructed directly from the micrographs, without intermediate detection. As a result, even small molecules should be within reach for cryo-EM. To support this claim, we setup a simplified mathematical model and demonstrate how our autocorrelation analysis technique allows to go directly from the micrographs to the sought signals. This involves only one pass over the micrographs, which is desirable for large experiments. We show numerical results and discuss challenges that lay ahead to turn this proof-of-concept into a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Two decades of high-paced innovation have improved the spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy to enable molecular resolution combined with the low-invasiveness and specificity characteristic of optical microscopy. However, fluorescence microscopy also enables scientists and clinicians to map and quantitate the physico-chemical properties (e.g., analyte concentration, enzymatic activities and protein-protein interactions) of biological samples. But the optimization of the biochemical resolving power in fluorescence microscopy is not as well-developed compared to its spatial resolution. Typical techniques rely on the observation of individual properties of fluorescence thus limiting the opportunities for sensing and multiplexing. Aiming to overcome existing limitations, we demonstrate a new imaging paradigm -- Hyper Dimensional Imaging Microscopy (HDIM) -- that enables the orthogonal properties of fluorescence emission (excited state lifetime, polarization and spectra) in biological samples to be quantified simultaneously and efficiently. Therefore, akin to how multi-dimensional separation in mass-spectroscopy and multi-dimensional spectra in NMR impacted proteomics and structural biology, we envisage that HDIM spectra of unprecedented dimensionality will impact the fields of systems biology and medical diagnostics by maximizing the biochemical resolving power of fluorescence microscopy.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage in proliferating mammalian cells causes death1, senescence2 or continued survival, via checkpoints that monitor damage and regulate cell cycle progression, DNA repair and fate determination3. Cell cycle checkpoints facilitate tumour suppression by preventing the generation of proliferating mutated cells4, particularly by blocking passage of DNA lesions into replication and mitosis5. While checkpoint non-fidelity permits cells to carry genomic aberrations into subsequent cell cycle phases6, its long-term consequences on lineages descendant from damaged cells remains poorly characterised. Devising methods for microscopy-based lineage tracing, we unexpectedly demonstrate that transient DNA damage to single living cells bearing a negligent checkpoint induces heterogenous cell-fate outcomes in their descendant generations removed from the initial insult. After transiently damaged cells undergo an initial arrest, pairs of descendant cells without obvious cell-cycle abnormalities either divide or die in a seemingly stochastic way. Progeny of transiently damaged cells may die generations afterwards, creating considerable variability of lineage fitness that promotes overall persistence in a mutagenic environment. Descendants of damaged cells frequently form micronuclei, activating immunogenic signalling. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized, heterogenous effects of cellular DNA damage that manifest long afterwards in descendant cells. We suggest that these heterogenous descendant cell-fate responses may function physiologically to ensure the elimination and immune clearance of damaged cell lineages, but pathologically, may enable the prolonged survival of cells bearing mutagenic damage.",

Growing experimental evidence also suggests, however, that cooperation between cancer clones is important as well for the maintenance of tumour heterogeneity and tumour progression. However, a role for cell communication during the earliest steps in oncogenesis is not well characterised despite its vital importance in normal tissue and clinically manifest tumours. By modelling the interaction between the mutational process and cell-to-cell communication in three-dimensional tissue architecture, we show that non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of carcinogenesis could support and accelerate pre-cancerous clonal expansion through the cooperation of different, non- or partially- transformed mutants. We predict the existence of a  cell-autonomous time-horizon, a time before which cooperation between cell-to-cell communication and DNA mutations might be one of the most fundamental forces shaping the early stages of oncogenesis. The understanding of this process could shed new light on the mechanisms leading to clinically manifest cancers.",

A single RTK, for example the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), is used repeatedly for a multitude of developmental programs. Quantitative differences in magnitude and duration of RTK signaling can bring about different signaling outcomes. Understanding this complex RTK signals requires real time visualization of the signal. To visualize spatio-temporal signaling dynamics, a biosensor called SEnsitive Detection of Activated Ras (SEDAR) was developed. It is a localization-based sensor that binds to activated Ras directly downstream of the endogenous activated RTKs. This binding was reversible and SEDAR expression did not cause any detectable perturbation of the endogenous signal. Using SEDAR, endogenous guidance signaling was visualized during RTK mediated chemotaxis of border cells in Drosophila ovary. SEDAR localized to both the leading and rear end of the cluster but polarized at the leading edge of the cluster. Perturbation of RTKs that led to delays in forward migration of the cluster correlated with loss of SEDAR polarization in the cluster. Gliding or tumbling behavior of border cells was a directly related to the high or low magnitude of SEDAR polarization respectively, in the leading cell showing that signal polarization at the plasma membrane provided information for the migratory behavior. Further, SEDAR localization to the plasma membrane detected EGFR mediated signaling in five distinct developmental contexts. Hence SEDAR, a novel biosensor could be used as a valuable tool to study the dynamics of endogenous Ras activation in real time downstream of RTKs, in three-dimensional tissues, at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.",
