    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that are influenced by genetic factors and encompass a wide-range and severity of symptoms. The details of how genetic variation contributes to variable symptomatology are unclear, creating a major challenge for translating vast amounts of data into clinically-useful information. To determine if variation in ASD risk genes correlates with symptomatology differences among individuals with ASD, thus informing treatment, we developed an approach to calculate the likelihood of genetic dysfunction in Gene Ontology-defined biological processes that have significant overrepresentation of known risk genes. Using whole-exome sequence data from 2,381 individuals with ASD included in the Simons Simplex Collection, we identified likely damaging variants and conducted a clustering analysis to define subgroups based on scores reflecting genetic dysfunction in each process of interest to ASD etiology. Dysfunction in cognition-related genes distinguished a distinct subset of individuals with increased social deficits, lower IQs, and reduced adaptive behaviors when compared to individuals with no evidence of cognition-related gene dysfunction. In particular, a stop-gain variant in the pharmacogene encoding cycloxygenase-2 was associated with having an IQ<70 (i.e. intellectual disability), a key comorbidity in ASD. We expect that screening genes involved in cognition for deleterious variants in ASD cases may be useful for identifying clinically-informative factors that should be prioritized for functional follow-up. This has implications in designing more comprehensive genetic testing panels and may help provide the basis for more informed treatment in ASD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to understand the role of infection in the origin of chromosomal anomalies linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In children with disorders in the development of their nervous systems, chromosome anomalies known to cause these disorders were compared to viruses and bacteria including known teratogens. Results support the explanation that parental infections disrupt elaborate multi-system gene coordination needed for neurodevelopment. Genes essential for neurons, lymphatic drainage, immunity, circulation, angiogenesis, cell barriers, structure, and chromatin activity were all found close together in polyfunctional clusters that were deleted in neurodevelopmental disorders. These deletions account for immune, circulatory, and structural deficits that accompany neurologic deficits. In deleted gene clusters, specific and repetitive human DNA matched infections and passed rigorous artifact tests. In some patients, epigenetic driver mutations were found and may be functionally equivalent to deleting a cluster or changing topologic chromatin interactions because they change access to large chromosome segments. In three families, deleted DNA sequences were associated with intellectual deficits and were not included in any database of genomic variants. These sequences were thousands of bp and unequivocally matched foreign DNAs. Analogous homologies were also found in chromosome anomalies of a recurrent neurodevelopmental disorder. Viral and bacterial DNAs that match repetitive or specific human DNA segments are thus proposed to interfere with highly active break repair during meiosis; sometimes delete polyfunctional clusters, and disable epigenetic drivers. Mis-repaired gametes produce zygotes containing rare chromosome anomalies which cause neurologic disorders and accompanying non-neurologic signs. Neurodevelopmental disorders may be examples of assault on the human genome by foreign DNA with some infections more likely tolerated because they resemble human DNA segments. Further tests of this model await new technology.\\n\\nGraphic Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/448845_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (55K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c1bf87org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1056721org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5ae34org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c007fc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To identify RNA cis-regulatory elements, we developed GCLiPP, a biochemical technique for detecting RBP occupancy transcriptome-wide. GCLiPP sequence tags corresponded with known RBP binding sites, specifically correlating to abundant cytosolic RBPs. To demonstrate the utility of our occupancy profiles, we performed functional dissection of 3' UTRs with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Two RBP occupied sites in the CD69 3' UTR destabilized the transcript of this key regulator of lymphocyte tissue egress. Comparing human Jurkat T cells and mouse primary T cells uncovered hundreds of biochemically shared peaks of GCLiPP signal across homologous regions of human and mouse 3' UTRs, including a cis-regulatory element that governs the stability of the mRNA that encodes the proto-oncogene PIM3 in both species. Our GCLiPP datasets provide a rich resource for investigation of post-transcriptional regulation in the immune system.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPHThe regulation of signalling capacity plays a pivotal role in setting developmental patterns in both plants and animals (1). The hormone auxin is a key signal for plant growth and development that acts through the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors (2). A subset of these ARFs comprises transcriptional activators of target genes in response to auxin, and are essential for regulating auxin signalling throughout the plant lifecycle (3). While ARF activators show tissue-specific expression patterns, it is unknown how their expression patterns are established. Chromatin modifications and accessibility studies revealed the chromatin of loci encoding ARF activators is constitutively open for transcription. Using a high-throughput yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) approach, we discovered a network of transcriptional regulators of ARF activator genes from Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression analyses demonstrated that the majority of these regulators act as repressors of ARF transcription in planta. Our observations support a scenario where the default configuration of open chromatin enables a network of transcriptional repressors to shape the expression pattern of ARF activators and provide specificity in auxin signalling output throughout development.",

    "abstract": "Timing mechanisms in the brain are still an open issue. Several existing computational models for timing can reproduce properties of experimental psychophysical responses. Still, only a few consider the underlying biological mechanisms, such as the synchronized neural activity that occurs in several brain areas. In this paper, we introduce a model for the peak-interval task based on neuronal network properties. We consider that Local Field Potential (LFP) oscillation cycles specify a sequence of states, represented as neuronal ensembles. Repeated presentation of time intervals during training reinforces the connections of specific ensembles to downstream networks. Later, during the peak-interval procedure, these downstream networks are reactivated by previously experienced neuronal ensembles, triggering actions at the learned time intervals. The model reproduces experimental response patterns from individual rats in the peak-interval procedure, satisfying relevant properties such as the Weber law. Finally, the model provides a biological interpretation of its parameters.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFaltered growth has been shown to affect 161 million children worldwide and derail cognitive development from early childhood. The neural pathways by which growth faltering in early childhood affects future cognitive outcomes remain unclear, which is partially due to the scarcity of research using both neuroimaging and sensitive behavioral techniques in low-income settings. We employed EEG to examine the association between growth faltering and brain functional connectivity and whether brain functional connectivity mediates the effect of early adversity on cognitive development.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited participants from an urban impoverished neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh. One sample consisted of 85 children whose EEG and growth measures (height for age, weight for age, and weight to height) were collected at 6 months and cognitive outcomes were assessed at 27 months. Another sample consisted of 115 children whose EEG and growth measures were collected at 36 months and IQ scores were assessed at 48 months. Path analysis was used to test the effect of growth measures on cognitive outcomes through brain functional connectivity.\\n\\nFindingsFaltered growth was found to be accompanied by overall increased functional connectivity in the theta and low-beta frequency bands for the 36-month-old cohort. For both cohorts, brain functional connectivity was negatively predictive of later cognitive outcomes at 27 and 48 months, respectively. Faltered growth was found to have a negative impact on childrens IQ scores in the older cohort, and this effect was found to be mediated by brain functional connectivity in the low-beta band.\\n\\nInterpretationThe association found between growth measures and brain functional connectivity may reflect a broad deleterious effect of malnutrition on childrens brain development. The mediation effect of functional connectivity on the relation between physical growth and later IQ scores provides the first experimental evidence that brain functional connectivity may mediate the effect of biological adversity on cognitive development.\\n\\nFundingBill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1111625)",

    "abstract": "In many species, territory defense is thought to be one of the primary functions of acoustic communication. North American red squirrels are a territorial species in which  rattles have long been thought to be the principal signal communicating territory ownership. These vocalizations have been assumed to deter intruders, thus reducing energy costs and the risk of injury associated with direct aggressive interactions. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Here we used a speaker occupation experiment to test whether red squirrel rattles function to deter conspecific rivals. We studied 29 male squirrels and removed each individual from his territory twice in a paired design. During the experimental treatment we simulated the owners presence after its removal by broadcasting the owners rattle from a loudspeaker at the center of the territory once every seven minutes. During the control treatment the territory was left in silence after the temporary removal of the owner. We found that the presence of a speaker replacement reduced the probability of intrusion by 34% and increased the latency to first intrusion by 7%, providing support for the hypothesis that rattles play an active role in reducing intrusion risk. However, intrusions were not completely averted by the speaker replacement, indicating that vocalizations alone are not sufficient without other cues of the territory owner.",

However, the available tools are not very sensitive to known elements and perform inconsistently on different genomes. Some are hard to install or obsolete.

While molecular evolution in these lineages has been investigated, very little is known about their mt function. Here, we develop a new protocol to characterize respiration in isolated plant mitochondria and apply it to species of Silene with mt genomes that are rapidly evolving, highly fragmented, and exceptionally large ([~]11 Mbp). This protocol, complemented with traditional measures of plant fitness, cytochrome c oxidase activity assays, and fluorescence microscopy, was used to characterize inter-and intraspecific variation in mt function. Contributions of the individual \\\"classic\\\" OXPHOS complexes, the alternative oxidase, and external NADH dehydrogenases to overall mt respiratory flux were found to be similar to previously studied angiosperms with more typical mt genomes. Some differences in mt function could be explained by inter-and intraspecific variation, possibly due to local adaptation or environmental effects. Although this study suggests that these Silene species with peculiar mt genomes still show relatively normal mt function, future experiments utilizing the protocol developed here can explore such questions in a more detailed and comparative framework.",

    "abstract": "Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new strain designs. However, integrating these data sources to generate predictions of steady-state metabolism typically requires a kinetic description of the enzymatic reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing these kinetic models from biological data can be computationally difficult, especially as the amount of data increases. Robust methods must also be able to quantify the uncertainty in model parameters as a function of the available data, which can be particularly computationally intensive. The field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty. However, these techniques are poorly suited to kinetic metabolic modeling due to the complex kinetic rate laws typically employed and the resulting dynamic system that must be solved. In this paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable efficient sampling and variational inference methods. We demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior distribution of kinetic model parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety of different problem scales, including large-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be leveraged in understanding biological data and developing new, efficient strain designs.",

Many social animals enjoy reduced predation risk as a result of grouping, and individuals within groups can benefit from information transferred by their group-mates about a potential predator. We present evidence that a tactile interaction behavior we term  nudging substantially modified group responses to a potential threat in a highly social catfish species, Corydoras aeneus. These catfish deployed nudges during flight responses, and these nudges were associated with a greater likelihood of group cohesion following a threat event. Increased nudging behavior resulted in longer flight responses. In addition, individuals that perceived the threat first were more likely to initiate nudges, implying that nudges could be used to alert group-mates to the presence of a threat.

Using an unbiased approach, we mapped the lineage hierarchy of the developing human brain and compared the transcriptome of each cancer cell to this roadmap. We discovered a conserved neural trilineage cancer hierarchy with glial progenitor-like cells at the apex. We also found that this progenitor population contains the majority of cancers cycling cells and is the origin of heterogeneity. Finally, we show that this hierarchal map can be used to identify therapeutic targets specific to progenitor cancer stem cells. Our analyses show that normal brain development reconciles glioblastoma development, unravels the origin of glioblastoma heterogeneity, and helps to identify cancer stem cell-specific targets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLithium is a first-line medication for bipolar disorder (BD), but only [~]30% of patients respond optimally to the drug. Since genetic factors are known to mediate lithium treatment response, we hypothesized whether polygenic susceptibility to the spectrum of depression traits is associated with treatment outcomes in patients with BD. In addition, we explored the potential molecular underpinnings of this relationship.\\n\\nMethodsWeighted polygenic scores (PGSs) were computed for major depressive disorder (MDD) and depressive symptoms (DS) in BD patients from the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen; n=2,586) who received lithium treatment. Lithium treatment outcome was assessed using the ALDA scale. Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in MDD (130,664 cases and 330,470 controls) and DS (n=161,460) were used for PGS weighting. Associations between PGSs of depression traits and lithium treatment response were assessed by binary logistic regression. We also performed a cross-trait meta-GWAS, followed by Ingenuity(R) Pathway Analysis.\\n\\nOutcomesBD patients with a low polygenic load for depressive traits were more likely to respond well to lithium, compared to patients with high polygenic load (MDD: OR =1.64 [95%CI: 1.26-2.15], lowest vs highest PGS quartiles; DS: OR=1.53 [95%CI: 1.18-2.00]). Associations were significant for type 1, but not type 2 BD. Cross-trait GWAS and functional characterization implicated voltage-gated potassium channels, insulin-related pathways, mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAPK) signaling, and miRNA expression. Interpretation: Genetic loading to depression traits in BD patients lower their odds of responding optimally to lithium. Our findings support the emerging concept of a lithium-responsive biotype in BD.\\n\\nFundingsee attached details",

Women have a significantly greater incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) than men, yet, conversely, male UTI is more persistent with greater associated morbidity. Mechanisms underlying these sex-based differences are unknown, in part due to a lack of experimental models. We optimized a model to transurethrally infect male mice and directly compared UTI in both sexes. Although both sexes were initially equally colonized by uropathogenic E. coli, only male and testosterone-treated female mice remained chronically infected for up to 4 weeks. Female mice had more robust innate responses, including higher IL-17 expression, and increased {gamma}{delta} T and LTi-like cells in the bladder following infection. Accordingly, neutralizing IL-17 abolished resolution in female mice, identifying the cytokine pathway necessary for bacterial clearance. Our findings support the concept that sex-based responses to UTI contribute to impaired innate immunity in males and provide a rationale for non-antibiotic-based immune targeting to improve the response to UTI.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe investigated mechanisms underlying the clinical observation that while urinary tract infection is more prevalent in women, it is more severe in men, observing that in contrast to robust immune responses characterized by IL-17 in female animals, male mice develop chronic infection, following a failure to initiate innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) comprises a huge group of bacteria that have small genomes that rarely encode CRISPR-Cas systems for phage defense. Consequently, questions remain about their mechanisms of phage resistance and the nature of phage that infect them. The compact CRISPR-CasY system (Cas12d) with potential value in genome editing was first discovered in these organisms. Relatively few CasY sequences have been reported to date, and little is known about the function and activity of these systems in the natural environment. Here, we conducted a genome-resolved metagenomic investigation of hot spring microbiomes and recovered CRISPR systems mostly from Roizmanbacteria that involve CasY proteins that are divergent from published sequences. Within population diversity in the spacer set indicates current in situ diversification of most of the loci. In addition to CasY, some Roizmanbacteria genomes also encode large type I-B and/or III-A systems that, based on spacer targeting, are used in phage defense. CRISPR targeting identified three phage represented by complete genomes and a prophage, which are the first reported for bacteria of the Microgenomates superphylum. Interestingly, one phage encodes a Cas4-like protein, a scenario that has been suggested to drive acquisition of self-targeting spacers. Consistent with this, the Roizmanbacteria population that it infects has a CRISPR locus that includes self-targeting spacers and a fragmented CasY gene (fCasY). Despite gene fragmentation, the PAM sequence is the same as that of other CasY reported in this study. Fragmentation of CasY may avoid the lethality of self-targeting spacers. However, the spacers may still have some biological role, possibly in genome regulation. The findings expand our understanding of CasY diversity, and more broadly, CRISPR-Cas systems and phage of CPR bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Our visual input is constantly changing, but not all moments are equally relevant. Temporal attention, the prioritization of visual information at specific points in time, increases perceptual sensitivity at behaviorally relevant times. The dynamic processes underlying this increase are unclear. During fixation, humans make small eye movements called microsaccades, and inhibiting microsaccades improves perception of brief stimuli. Here we asked whether temporal attention changes the pattern of microsaccades in anticipation of brief stimuli. Human observers (female and male) judged brief stimuli presented within a short sequence. They were given either an informative precue to attend to one of the stimuli, which was likely to be probed, or an uninformative (neutral) precue. We found strong microsaccadic inhibition before the stimulus sequence, likely due to its predictable onset. Critically, this anticipatory inhibition was stronger when the first target in the sequence (T1) was precued (task-relevant) than when the precue was uninformative. Moreover, the timing of the last microsaccade before T1 and the first microsaccade after T1 shifted, such that both occurred earlier when T1 was precued than when the precue was uninformative. Finally, the timing of the nearest pre- and post-T1 microsaccades affected task performance. Directing voluntary temporal attention therefore impacts microsaccades, helping to stabilize fixation at the most relevant moments, over and above the effect of predictability. Just as saccading to a relevant stimulus can be an overt correlate of the allocation of spatial attention, precisely timed gaze stabilization can be an overt correlate of the allocation of temporal attention.\\n\\nSignificance statementWe pay attention at moments in time when a relevant event is likely to occur. Such temporal attention improves our visual perception, but how it does so is not well understood. Here we discovered a new behavioral correlate of voluntary, or goal-directed, temporal attention. We found that the pattern of small fixational eye movements called microsaccades changes around behaviorally relevant moments in a way that stabilizes the position of the eyes. Microsaccades during a brief visual stimulus can impair perception of that stimulus. Therefore, such fixation stabilization may contribute to the improvement of visual perception at attended times. This link suggests that in addition to cortical areas, subcortical areas mediating eye movements may be recruited with temporal attention.",

Using a collection of 465 GWAS, we generated genetic correlations, pathways, gene-wise and tissue-wise associations using MAGMA and S-PrediXcan for 465 human traits. Testing 7267 biological pathways, we found that only 898 were significantly associated with any trait. Similarly, out of ~20,000 tested protein-coding genes, 12,311 genes exhibited an association. Based on the genetic correlations between all traits, we constructed a phenome map using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), where each of the 465 traits can be visualized as an individual point. This map reveals well-defined clusters of traits such as education/high longevity, lower longevity, height, body composition, and depression/anxiety/neuroticism. These clusters are enriched in specific groups of pathways, such as lipid pathways in the lower longevity cluster, and neuronal pathways for body composition or education clusters.

    "abstract": "The picture emerging from the rapidly growing literature on host-associated micro-biota is that host traits and fitness often depend on complex and interactive effects of host genotype, microbial interactions, and abiotic environment. However, testing these main and interactive effects typically requires large, multi-factorial experiments and thus remains challenging in many systems. Furthermore, most studies of plant microbiomes focus on terrestrial hosts and microbes. Aquatic habitats may confer unique properties to plant micriobiomes. We grew different populations of duck-weed (Lemna minor), a floating aquatic plant of increasing popularity in freshwater phytoremediation, in three microbial treatments (adding no, \\\"home\\\", or \\\"away\\\" microbes) at two levels of zinc, a common water contaminant in urban areas. Thus, we simultaneously manipulated plant source population, microbial community, and the abiotic environment, and measured both plant and microbial performance as well as plant traits. Although we found little evidence of interactive effects, we found strong main effects of plant source, microbial treatment, and zinc on both duckweed and microbial growth, with significant variation among both duckweed and microbial communities. Despite strong growth alignment between duckweed and microbes, zinc consistently decreased plant growth, but increased microbial growth. Furthermore, as in recent studies of terrestrial plants, microbial interactions altered a duckweed phenotype (frond aggregation). Our results suggest that the duckweed source population, its associated microbiome, and the contaminant environment may all need to be considered in real-world phytoremediation efforts. Lastly, we propose that duckweed microbes offer a robust experimental system for study of host-microbiota interactions under a range of environmental stresses.",

We also identified gene family expansions of Wnt and posterior Hox genes, and discovered the important role of retinoic acid signaling in this ancient lineage of metazoans, which together may be related to the unique jellyfish body plan (medusa formation).\\n\\nConclusionsTaken together, the jellyfish genome and transcriptomes genetically confirm their unique morphological and physiological traits that have combined to make these animals one of the worlds earliest and most successful multi-cellular predators.",

    "abstract": "Humans understand words faster when they are preceded by semantically related words. This facilitation is thought to result from spreading activation between words with similar meanings. Interestingly, in language production, semantic relatedness often has the opposite effect: in object naming for example, a related prior word delays the naming time of the current object. This could be due to competition during conceptual search or later interference at the motor preparation stage. However, no study has systematically compared the facilitory and inhibitory effects and thus their neurobiological relationship is unknown. We contrasted maximally parallel production and comprehension tasks during magnetoencephalography and found that in comprehension (specifically word reading), semantic relatedness modulated activity in the left middle STG at 180-335ms, consistent with prior findings on the spatiotemporal localization of lexical access. In contrast, a semantic interference pattern for the production task (object naming) occurred in a post-lexical time-window at 395-485ms in left posterior insular cortex, consistent with post-lexical motor preparation. Thus, our data show that semantic priming during comprehension and interference during production are not two sides of the same coin but rather they clearly dissociate in space and time, consistent with a lexical account for comprehension and a post-lexical one for production.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe processing of semantically related words has been a central tool for understanding the organization of the mental lexicon. One striking observation is that semantic relatedness tends to be facilitory in comprehension but inhibitory in language production, perhaps because only production involves a conceptual search through semantically related candidates. The neurobiology of this contrast is not understood. Our magnetoencephalography results demonstrate that the facilitory pattern is first observed in classic left temporal lexical access regions at ~200ms, whereas the inhibitory pattern occurs later and in the insular cortex. These findings show that the two effects do not co-localize in space or time and suggest that the inhibitory effects in production stem from a late motor preparation stage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene networks in living cells can change depending on various conditions such as caused by different environments, tissue types, disease states, and development stages. Identifying the differential changes in gene networks is very important to understand molecular basis of various biological process. While existing algorithms can be used to infer two gene networks separately from gene expression data under two different conditions, and then to identify network changes, such an approach does not exploit the data jointly, and it is thus suboptimal. A desirable approach would be clearly to infer two gene networks jointly, which can yield improved estimates of network changes.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we developed a proximal gradient algorithm for differential network (ProGAdNet) inference, that jointly infers two gene networks under different conditions and then identifies changes in the network structure. Computer simulations demonstrated that our ProGAdNet outperformed existing algorithms in terms of inference accuracy, and was much faster than a similar approach for joint inference of gene networks. Gene expression data of breast tumors and normal tissues in the TCGA database were analyzed with our ProGAdNet, and revealed that 268 genes were involved in the changed network edges. Gene set enrichment analysis of this set of 268 genes identified a number of gene sets related to breast cancer or other types of cancer, which corroborated the gene set identified by ProGAdNet was very informative about the cancer disease status. A software package implementing the ProGAdNet and computer simulations is available upon request.\\n\\nConclusionWith its superior performance over existing algorithms, ProGAdNet provides a valuable tool for finding changes in gene networks, which may aid the discovery of gene-gene interactions changed under different conditions.",

    "abstract": "Acquisition of chromatin modifications during embryogenesis distinguishes different regions of an initially naive genome. In many organisms, repetitive DNA is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin that is marked by di/tri methylation of histone H3K9 and the associated protein HP1a. These modifications enforce the unique epigenetic properties of heterochromatin. However, in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo the heterochromatin lacks these modifications which only appear later when rapid embryonic cell cycles slow down at the Mid-Blastula Transition or MBT. Here we focus on the initial steps restoring heterochromatic modifications in the embryo. We describe the JabbaTrap, a technique for inactivating maternally provided proteins in embryos. Using the JabbaTrap we reveal a major requirement for the methyltransferase Eggless/SetDB1 in the establishment of heterochromatin. In contrast, other methyltransferases contribute minimally. Live-imaging reveals that endogenous Eggless gradually accumulates on chromatin in interphase, but then dissociates in mitosis and its accumulation must restart in the next cell cycle. Cell cycle slowing as the embryo approaches the MBT permits increasing accumulation and action of Eggless at its targets. Experimental manipulation of interphase duration shows that cell cycle speed regulates Eggless. We propose that developmental slowing of the cell cycle times embryonic heterochromatin formation.",

Previous studies, however, have only provided evidence that vertebrates can be detected using iDNA, but have not taken the next step of placing these detection events within a statistical framework that allows for robust biodiversity assessments.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we compare concurrent iDNA and camera-trap surveys. Leeches were repeatedly collected in close vicinity to 64 camera-trap stations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We analyze iDNA-derived mammalian detection events in a modern occupancy model that accounts for imperfect detection and compare the results with those from occupancy models parameterized with camera-trap-derived detection events. We also combine leech-iDNA and camera-trap data in a single occupancy model.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found consistent estimates of occupancy probabilities produced by our camera-trap and leech datasets. This indicates that the metabarcoding of leech-iDNA method provides reasonable estimates of occupancy and can be a suitable method for studying and monitoring mammal species in tropical rainforests. However, we also show that a more extensive collection of leeches would be needed to assess mammal biodiversity with a similar robustness as with camera traps. As certain taxa were only detected in leeches, we see great potential in complementing camera-trap studies with the iDNA approach, as long as the collection of leeches follows a similar robust and standardized sampling scheme.\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications.

    "abstract": "In our quest to develop more intelligent machines, knowledge of the visual features used by machines to classify objects shall be helpful. The current state of the art in training machines to classify wildlife species from camera-trap data is to employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) encoded within deep learning algorithms. Here we report on results obtained in training a CNN to classify 20 African wildlife species with an overall accuracy of 87.5% from a dataset containing 111,467 images. We then used a gradient-weighted class-activation-mapping (Grad-CAM) procedure to extract the most salient pixels in the final convolution layer. We show that these pixels highlight features in particular images that are in most, but not all, cases similar to those used to train humans to identify these species. Further, we used mutual information methods to identify the neurons in the final convolution layer that consistently respond most strongly across a set of images of one particular species, and we then interpret the features in the image where the strongest responses occur. We also used hierarchical clustering of feature vectors (i.e., the state of the final fully-connected layer in the CNN) associated with each image to produce a visual similarity dendrogram of identified species. Finally, we evaluated how images that were not part of the training set fell within our dendrogram when these images were one of the 20 species \\\"known\\\" to our CNN in contrast to where they fell when these images were \\\"unknown\\\" to our CNN.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutations arise in the human genome in two major settings: the germline and soma. These settings involve different inheritance patterns, chromatin structures, and environmental exposures, all of which might be predicted to differentially affect the distribution of substitutions found in these settings. Nonetheless, recent studies have found that somatic and germline mutation rates are similarly affected by endogenous mutational processes and epigenetic factors.\\n\\nResultsHere, we quantified the number of single nucleotide variants that co-occur between somatic and germline call-sets (cSNVs), compared this quantity with expectations, and explained noted departures. We found that three times as many variants are shared between the soma and germline than is expected by independence. We developed a new, general-purpose statistical framework to explain the observed excess of cSNVs in terms of the varying mutation rates of different kinds substitution types and of genomic regions. Using this metric, we find that more than 90% of this excess can be explained by our observation that the basic substitution types (such as N[C->T]G, C->A, etc.) have correlated mutation rates in the germline and soma. Matched-normal read depth analysis suggests that an appreciable fraction of this excess may also derive from germline contamination of somatic samples.\\n\\nConclusionOverall, our results highlight the commonalities in substitution patterns between the germline and soma. The universality of some aspects of human mutation rates offers insight into the potential molecular mechanisms of human mutation. The highlighted similarities between somatic and germline mutation rates also lay the groundwork for future studies that distinguish disease-causing variants from a genomic background informed by both somatic and germline variant data. Moreover, our results also indicate that the depth of matched normal sequencing necessary to ensure genomic privacy of donors of somatic samples may be higher than previously appreciated. Furthermore, the fact that we were able to explain such a high portion of recurrent variants using known determinants of mutation rates is evidence that the genomics community has already discovered the most important predictors of mutation rates for single nucleotide variants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrought is a severe environmental stress. It is estimated that about 50% of the world rice production is affected mainly by drought. Apart from conventional breeding strategies to develop drought-tolerant crops, innovative computational approaches may provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of stress response and identify drought-responsive markers. Here we propose a network-based computational approach involving a meta-analytic study of seven drought-tolerant rice genotypes under drought stress.\\n\\nResultsCo-expression networks enable large-scale analysis of gene-pair associations and tightly coupled clusters that may represent coordinated biological processes. Considering differentially expressed genes in the co-expressed modules and supplementing external information such as, resistance/tolerance QTLs, transcription factors, network-based topological measures, we identify and prioritize drought-adaptive co-expressed gene modules and potential candidate genes. Using the candidate genes that are well-represented across the datasets as  seed genes, two drought-specific protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) are constructed with up-and down-regulated genes. Cluster analysis of the up-regulated PPIN revealed ABA signaling pathway as a central process in drought response with a probable crosstalk with energy metabolic processes. Tightly coupled gene clusters representing up-regulation of core cellular respiratory processes and enhanced degradation of branched chain amino acids and cell wall metabolism are identified. Cluster analysis of down-regulated PPIN provides a snapshot of major processes associated with photosynthesis, growth, development and protein synthesis, most of which are shut down during drought. Differential regulation of phytohormones, e.g., jasmonic acid, cell wall metabolism, signaling and posttranslational modifications associated with biotic stress are elucidated. Functional characterization of topologically important, drought-responsive uncharacterized genes that may play a role in important processes such as ABA signaling, calcium signaling, photosynthesis and cell wall metabolism is discussed. Further transgenic studies on these genes may help in elucidating their biological role under stress conditions.\\n\\nConclusionCurrently, a large number of resources for rice functional genomics exist which are mostly underutilized by the scientific community. In this study, a computational approach integrating information from various resources such as gene co-expression networks, protein-protein interactions and pathway-level information is proposed to provide a systems-level view of complex drought-responsive processes across the drought-tolerant genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Autoinhibition is a prevalent allosteric regulatory mechanism in signaling proteins as it prevents spurious pathway activation and primes for signal propagation only under appropriate inputs. Altered functioning of inhibitory allosteric switches underlies the tumorigenic potential of numerous cancer drivers. However, whether protein autoinhibition is altered generically in cancer cells remains elusive. Here, we reveal that cancer-associated missense mutations and fusion breakpoints are found with significant enrichment within inhibitory allosteric switches across all cancer types, which in the case of the fusion breakpoints is specific to cancer and not present in other diseases. Recurrently disrupted or mutated allosteric switches identify established and new cancer drivers. Cancer-specific mutations in allosteric switches are associated with distinct changes in signaling, and suggest molecular mechanisms for altered protein regulation, which in the case of ASK1, DAPK2 and EIF4G1 were supported by biophysical simulations. Our results demonstrate that autoinhibition-modulating genetic alterations are positively selected for by cancer cells, and that their study provides valuable insights into molecular mechanisms of cancer misregulation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHox genes encode a family of homeodomain containing transcription factors that are clustered together on chromosomes of many Bilateria. Some bilaterian lineages express these genes during embryogenesis in spatial and/or temporal order according to their arrangement in the cluster, a phenomenon referred to as collinearity. Expression of Hox genes is well studied during embryonic and larval development of numerous species; however, relatively few studies focus on the comparison of pre- and postmetamorphic expression of Hox genes in animals with biphasic life cycle. Recently, the expression of Hox genes was described for embryos and larvae of Terebratalia transversa, a rhynchonelliformean brachiopod, which possesses distinct metamorphosis from planktonic larvae to sessile juvenile. During premetamorphic development, T. transversa does not exhibit spatial collinearity and several of its Hox genes are recruited for the morphogenesis of novel structures. In our study we determined expression of Hox genes in post-metamorphic juveniles of T. transversa in order to examine metamorphosis-related changes of expression patterns and to test if Hox genes are expressed in the spatially collinear way in the postmetamorphic juveniles.\\n\\nResultsHox genes are expressed in a spatially non-collinear manner in juveniles, generally showing similar patterns as ones observed in competent larvae: genes labial and Post1 are expressed in chaetae-related structures, sex comb reduced in the shell forming epithelium, whereas Lox5 and Lox4 in dorso-posterior epidermis. After metamorphosis expression of genes proboscipedia, Hox3, Deformed and Antennapedia becomes restricted to, respectively, shell musculature, prospective hinge rudiments, and pedicle musculature and epidermis.\\n\\nConclusionsAll developmental stages of T. transversa, including postmetamorphic juveniles, exhibit a spatial non-collinear Hox genes expression with only minor changes observed between pre- and postmetamorphic stages. Our results are concordant with morphological observation that metamorphosis in rhynchonelliformean brachiopods, despite being rapid, is rather gradual. The most drastic changes in Hox genes expression patterns observed during metamorphosis could be explained by the inversion of the mantle lobe, which relocates some of the more posterior larval structures into the anterior edge of the juveniles. Cooption of Hox genes for the morphogenesis of novel structures is even more pronounced in post-metamorphic brachiopods when compared to larvae.",

Non-targeted HPLC-MS metabolomics using a diverse panel of 264 maize inbred lines identified a bimodal distribution in the prevalence of foliar metabolites. Although 15% of the detected mass features were present in >90% of the inbred lines, the majority were found in <50% of the samples. Whereas leaf bases and tips were differentiated primarily by flavonoid abundance, maize varieties (stiff-stalk, non-stiff-stalk, tropical, sweet corn, and popcorn) were differentiated predominantly by benzoxazinoid metabolites. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), performed for 3,991 mass features from the leaf tips and leaf bases, showed that 90% have multiple significantly associated loci scattered across the genome. Several quantitative trait locus hotspots in the maize genome regulate the abundance of multiple, often metabolically related mass features. The utility of maize metabolite GWAS was demonstrated by confirming known benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes, as well as by mapping isomeric variation in the accumulation of phenylpropanoid hydroxycitric acid esters to a single linkage block in a citrate synthase-like gene. Similar to gene expression databases, this metabolomic GWAS dataset constitutes an important public resource for linking maize metabolites with biosynthetic and regulatory genes.",

In addition to causing direct damage due to the removal of photoassimilates, R. maidis transmits several destructive maize viruses, including Maize yellow dwarf virus, Barley yellow dwarf virus, Sugarcane mosaic virus, and Cucumber mosaic virus.\\n\\nFindingsA 326-Mb genome assembly of BTI-1, a parthenogenetically reproducing R. maidis clone, was generated with a combination of PacBio (208-fold coverage) and Illumina sequencing (80-fold coverage), which contains a total of 689 contigs with an N50 size of 9.0 Mb. The contigs were further clustered into four scaffolds using the Phase Genomics Hi-C interaction maps, consistent with the commonly observed 2n = 8 karyotype of R. maidis. Most of the assembled contigs (473 spanning 321 Mb) were successfully orientated in the four scaffolds. The R. maidis genome assembly captured the full length of 95.8% of the core eukaryotic genes, suggesting that it is highly complete. Repetitive sequences accounted for 21.2% of the assembly, and a total of 17,647 protein-coding genes were predicted in the R. maidis genome with integrated evidence from ab initio and homology-based gene predictions and transcriptome sequences generated with both PacBio and Illumina. An analysis of likely horizontally transferred genes identified two from bacteria, seven from fungi, two from protozoa, and nine from algae.\\n\\nConclusionsA high-quality R. maidis genome was assembled at the chromosome level. This genome sequence will enable further research related to ecological interactions, virus transmission, pesticide resistance, and other aspects of R. maidis biology.

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudies testing the relationship between cortisol levels, depression, and antidepressant treatment response have yielded divergent results suggesting the possibility of moderators of a cortisol effect. Several studies indicate that age may moderate the relationship between cortisol and psychopathology. In patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), we studied the interactive effects of age and cortisol on predicting diagnostic status, improvement in mood and memory function with antidepressant treatment, and brain response to negative emotional stimuli.\\n\\nMethods66 unmedicated patients with MDD and 75 matched healthy controls had serum assayed at pre-treatment baseline for cortisol. Logistic regression was used to determine an association of age, cortisol and their interaction with MDD diagnosis. Thirty-four of the MDD participants (age range: 19-65 years; median: 36) underwent treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRl) for 8 weeks. Clinician and self-ratings of depression symptoms, as well as tests of verbal and visual delayed recall were obtained at baseline and post treatment. Moderation analyses determined the effect of age on the relationship between baseline cortisol and treatment outcome. A separate sample of 8 MDD participants prospectively underwent fMRI neuroimaging and cortisol collection while viewing negative emotional faces.\\n\\nResultsAge moderated the effects of cortisol on predicting MDD diagnosis (p<.05), treatment-associated reduction of depression symptoms (p<.001), improvement of delayed recall (p<.001), and baseline brain response to negative emotions (p<.05, whole brain corrected). Modeling the Age X Cortisol interaction suggested that for the participants below the median age of our sample, lower cortisol levels predicted a lower rate of MDD diagnosis, higher antidepressant effects and decreased brain reactivity in emotion regulation regions such as the anterior cingulate gyrus. On the contrary, in those above the median sample age, lower cortisol predicted a higher rate of MDD, less improvement in depression symptoms and memory performance, and more brain reactivity in the anterior cingulate.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results indicate that age moderates the relationship between peripheral cortisol levels and (1) MDD diagnosis, (2) brain reactivity to emotional stimuli, and (3) antidepressant-associated improvement in depression and memory symptoms. These results indicate that previous disparities in the literature linking peripheral cortisol levels with depression characteristics and treatment response may critically relate, at least in part, to the age of the patients studied.",

    "abstract": "1Epigenetic DNA modification is partly under genetic control, and occurs in response to a wide range of environmental exposures. Linking epigenetic marks to clinical outcomes may provide greater insight into underlying molecular processes of disease, assist in the identification of therapeutic targets, and improve risk prediction. Here, we present a statistical approach, based on Bayesian inference, that estimates associations between disease risk and all measured epigenetic probes jointly, automatically controlling for both data structure (including cell-count effects, relatedness, and experimental batch effects) and correlations among probes. We benchmark our approach in simulation study, finding improved estimation of probe associations across a wide range of scenarios over existing approaches. Our method estimates the total proportion of disease risk captured by epigenetic probe variation, and when we applied it to measures of body mass index (BMI) and cigarette consumption behaviour in 5,101 individuals, we find that 66.7% (95% CI 60.0-72.8) of the variation in BMI and 67.7% (95% CI 58.4-76.9) of the variation in cigarette consumption can be captured by methylation array data from whole blood, independent of the variation explained by single nucleotide polymorphism markers. We find novel associations, with smoking behaviour associated with a methylation probe at the MNDA gene with >95% posterior inclusion probability, which is a myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen gene previously implicated as a biomarker for inflammation and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. We conduct unique genome-wide enrichment analyses, identifying blood cholesterol, lipid transport and sterol metabolism pathways for BMI, and response to xenobiotic stimulus and negative regulation of RNA polymerase II promoter transcription for smoking, all with >95% posterior inclusion probability of having methylation probes with associations >1.5 times larger than the average. Finally, we improve phenotypic prediction in two independent cohorts by 28.7% and 10.2% for BMI and smoking respectively over a LASSO model. These results imply that probe measures may capture large amounts of variance because they are likely a consequence of the phenotype rather than a cause. As a result, 'omics' data may enable accurate characterization of disease progression and identification of individuals who are on a path to disease. Our approach facilitates better understanding of the underlying epigenetic architecture of complex common disease and is applicable to any kind of genomics data.",

    "abstract": "The lysine metabolism of Pseudomonas putida can produce multiple important commodity chemicals and is implicated in rhizosphere colonization. However, despite intensive study, the biochemical and genetic links between lysine metabolism and central metabolism remain unresolved in P. putida. Here, we leverage Random Barcode Transposon Sequencing (RB-TnSeq), a genome-wide assay measuring the fitness of thousands of genes in parallel, to identify multiple novel enzymes in both L- and D-lysine metabolism. We first describe three pathway enzymes that catabolize 2-aminoadipate (2AA) to 2-ketoglutarate (2KG) connecting D-lysine to the TCA cycle. One of these enzymes, PP_5260, contains a DUF1338 domain, a family without a previously described biological function. We demonstrate PP_5260 converts 2-oxoadipate (2OA) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a novel biochemical reaction. We expand on recent work showing that the glutarate hydroxylase, CsiD, can co-utilize both 2OA and 2KG as a co-substrate in the hydroxylation of glutarate. Finally we demonstrate that the cellular abundance of D- and L-lysine pathway proteins are highly sensitive to pathway specific substrates. This work demonstrates the utility of RB-TnSeq for discovering novel metabolic pathways in even well-studied bacteria.\\n\\nImportanceO_LIP. putida is an attractive host for metabolic engineering as its lysine metabolism can be utilized for the production of multiple important commodity chemicals.\\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the first biochemical evidence of a bacterial 2OA catabolic pathway to central metabolites.\\nC_LIO_LIDUF1338 proteins are widely dispersed across many kingdoms of life.

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A is the dominant antibody isotype found in mucosal secretions and enforces host-microbiota symbiosis in mice, yet selective IgA-deficiency (sIgAd) is the most common primary immunodeficiency in humans and is often described as asymptomatic. Here, we determined the effects of IgA deficiency on human gut microbiota composition and evaluated the possibility that secretion of IgM can compensate for a lack of secretory IgA. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial cell sorting to evaluate gut microbiota composition and IgA or IgM coating of the gut microbiota in 15 sIgAd subjects and 15 matched controls. Although sIgAd subjects secreted a significant amount of IgM into the intestinal lumen, this was insufficient to fully compensate for the lack of secretory IgA. Indeed, sIgAd subjects displayed an altered gut microbiota composition as compared to healthy controls, which was characterized by a trend towards decreased overall microbial diversity and significant shifts in the relative abundances of specific microbial taxa. While IgA targets a defined subset of the microbiota via high-level coating, compensatory IgM binds a broader subset of the microbiota in a less targeted manner. We conclude that IgA plays a critical and non-redundant role in controlling gut microbiota composition in humans and that secretory IgA has evolved to maintain a diverse and stable gut microbial community that promotes human health, enhances resistance to infection, and is resilient to perturbation.",
