    "abstract": "Owning to excellent optical properties and high biocompatibility carbon dots (CDs) have drawn increasing attention and have been widely applied as imaging agents for various bio-applications. Here we report a strategy for live-cell fluorescent bioimaging based on in situ synthesis of CDs within cells by tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses. Laser-produced carbon dots exhibit bright excitation-dependent fluorescence and are highly two-photon active under near infrared femtosecond excitation, thus demonstrating a potential for two-photon fluorescence imaging. The Raman spectra of fluorescent centers show strong D (1350 cm-1) and G (1590 cm-1) bands, thus suggesting that they are composed of carbon dots with sp2-hybridyzed core. Using Mouse GV oocytes as a model system we examine cytotoxicity and demonstrate the possibility of long-term fluorescent intracellular tracking of the laser-produced CDs. Created virtually in any point of the live cell, CD-based fluorescent {micro}m-sized markers demonstrate high structural stability and retain bright fluorescence many hours after formation. Our results point to laser-produced fluorescent CDs as a highly-potent tool for cell cycle tracking, culture cell marking and probing intracellular movements.",

    "abstract": "Species delimitation is at the core of biological sciences. During the last decade, molecular-based approaches have advanced the field by providing additional sources of evidence to classical, morphology-based taxonomy. However, taxonomy has not yet fully embraced molecular species delimitation beyond threshold-based, single-gene approaches, and taxonomic knowledge is not commonly integrated to multi-locus species delimitation models. Here we aim to bridge empirical data (taxonomic and genetic) with recently developed coalescent-based species delimitation approaches. We use the multispecies coalescent model as implemented in two Bayesian methods (DISSECT/STACEY and BP&P) to infer species hypotheses. In both cases, we account for phylogenetic uncertainty (by not using any guide tree) and taxonomic uncertainty (by measuring the impact of using or not a priori taxonomic assignment to specimens). We focus on an entire Neotropical tribe of butterflies, the Haeterini (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae). We contrast divergent taxonomic opinion--splitting, lumping and misclassifying species--in the light of different phenotypic classifications proposed to date. Our results provide a solid background for the recognition of 22 species. The synergistic approach presented here overcomes limitations in both traditional taxonomy (e.g. by recognizing cryptic species) and molecular-based methods (e.g. by recognizing structured populations, and not raise them to species). Our framework provides a step forward towards standardization and increasing reproducibility of species delimitations.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-specific antigens expressed in the cell membrane have been used as targets for several molecular targeted strategies in recent years with remarkable success. To develop more effective cancer treatments, novel targets and strategies for targeted therapies are needed. Here, we examined the cancer cell membrane-resident \\\"cis-bimolecular complex\\\" as a possible cancer target (cis-bimolecular cancer target: BiCAT) using proximity proteomics, a technique that has attracted attention in recent years. BiCATs were detected using a previously developed method, termed the enzyme-mediated activation of radical source (EMARS), to label the components proximal to a given cell membrane molecule. EMARS analysis identified some BiCATs, such as close homolog of L1 (CHL1), fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGFR3) and 2 integrin, which are commonly expressed in mouse primary lung cancer cells and human lung squamous cell carcinoma cells. Analysis of cancer specimens from 55 lung cancer patients revealed that approximately half of patients were positive for these BiCATs. In vitro simulation of effective drug combinations used for multiple drug treatment strategy was performed using reagents targeted to BiCAT molecules. The combination treatment based on BiCAT information moderately suppressed cancer cell proliferation compared with single administration, suggesting that the information about BiCATs in cancer cells is profitable for the appropriate selection of the combination among molecular targeted reagents. Thus, BiCAT has the possibility to make a contribution to several molecular targeted strategies in future.",

    "abstract": "Causing a large diameter blood vessel to sprout branches and a capillary network on demand to create a new angiosome is key to harnessing to potential of regenerative medicine and advancing reconstructive surgery. Currently this can only be achieved by connecting a vein graft to an artery by microsurgery, the arteriovenous loop technique (AVL). The arterial blood pressure in the thin-walled vein is thought to drive remodelling to create branches, however the surgical complexity limits the application of the technique. In this study we demonstrate that unexpectedly, a vessel density of luminal branches in excess of that achieved by the surgical AVL approach can be induced simply by placing a vein in contact with a microporous calcium phosphate. Only osteoinductive biomaterials have been reported previously, this is thought to be the first report of an angio-inductive material. Pilot studies indicated that the material type greatly affected the degree of luminal vascularization. Material contact with the vein is not a requirement for luminal angiogenesis of the vein and together these findings point to a bioinorganic effect, wherein the degradation of the material both releases a stimulatory ionic milieu and creates space for the developing angiosome.",

    "abstract": "In plant chloroplast membranes, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is activated as a response to a low luminal pH and controlled by the pH-sensing protein PsbS. It has been proposed that PsbS directly interacts with the light-harvesting complexes (LHCII) of Photosystem II, inducing quenching of LHCII Chl excitations, whilst others proposed that PsbS has an indirect role in controlling the organization of the membrane. In this study, we systematically test the influence of low pH and PsbS on the fluorescence lifetimes of membrane-embedded spinach LHCII. The proteoliposome preparations contain LHCII in mild quenched states, aimed to mimic fluorescence conditions of dark-adapted leaves. We find that under those conditions, acidification and the presence of PsbS do not have significant effect on the LHCII Chl fluorescence lifetimes. This supports a view in which the functional role of PsbS consists of re-organizing the thylakoid membrane under light stress, rather than creating direct quencher states. The dimeric form of PsbS appears to be destabilized in lipid membranes compared to detergent micelles, which might explain why the low-pH PsbS crystal structure is dimeric, while in vivo activation of PsbS has been correlated with its monomerization at low pH.\\n\\nHighlights O_LIPsbS does not affect LHCII Chl excited-state lifetimes\\nC_LIO_LIPsbS dimers have lower stability in lipid membranes than in detergent micelles\\nC_LIO_LILHCII proteoliposomes with protein-to-lipid molar ratios in the range 0.5.10-3 to 1.10-3 form suitable membrane models for mimicking dark-adapted fluorescence states\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In bone, sclerostin is mainly osteocyte-derived and plays an important local role in adaptive responses to mechanical loading. Whether circulating levels of sclerostin also play a functional role is currently unclear, which we aimed to examine by two sample Mendelian Randomisation (MR). A genetic instrument for circulating sclerostin, derived from a genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of serum sclerostin in 10,584 European-descent individuals, was examined in relation to femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD; n= 32,744) in GEFOS, and estimated BMD by heel ultrasound (eBMD; n=426,824), and fracture risk (n=426,795), in UK Biobank. Our GWAS identified two novel serum sclerostin loci, B4GALNT3 (standard deviation (SD)) change in sclerostin per A allele ({beta}=0.20, P=4.6x10-49), and GALNT1 ({beta}=0.11 per G allele, P=4.4x10-11). B4GALNT3 is an N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase, adding a terminal LacdiNAc disaccharide to target glycocoproteins, found to be predominantly expressed in kidney, whereas GALNT1 is an enzyme causing mucin-type O-linked glycosylation. Using these two SNPs as genetic instruments, MR revealed an inverse causal relationship between serum sclerostin and femoral neck BMD ({beta}= -0.12, 95%CI= -0.20 to -0.05) and eBMD ({beta}= -0.12, 95%CI= -0.14 to -0.10), and a positive relationship with fracture risk ({beta}= 0.11, 95%CI= 0.01 to 0.21). Colocalization analysis demonstrated common genetic signals within the B4GALNT3 locus for higher sclerostin, lower eBMD, and greater B4GALNT3 expression in arterial tissue (Probability>99%). Our findings suggest that higher sclerostin levels are causally related to lower BMD and greater fracture risk. Hence, strategies for reducing circulating sclerostin, for example by targeting glycosylation enzymes as suggested by our GWAS results, may prove valuable in treating osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Oviparous vertebrates produce multiple forms of vitellogenin (Vtg), the major source of yolk nutrients, but little is known about their individual contributions to reproduction and development. This study employed a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to assess essentiality and functionality of zebrafish (Danio rerio) type-I and -III Vtgs. The multiple CRISPR approach employed to knock out (KO) all genes encoding type-I vtgs (vtg1, 4, 5, 6, and 7) simultaneously (vtg1-KO), and the type-III vtg (vtg3) individually (vtg3-KO). Results of PCR genotyping and sequencing, qPCR, LC-MS/MS and Western blotting showed that only vtg6 and vtg7 escaped Cas9 editing. In fish whose remaining type-I vtgs were incapacitated (vtg1-KO), and in vtg3-KO fish, significant increases in Vtg7 transcript and protein levels occurred in liver and eggs, a heretofore-unknown mechanism of genetic compensation to regulate Vtg homeostasis. Fecundity was more than doubled in vtg1-KO females, and fertility was ~halved in vtg3-KO females. Substantial mortality was evident in vtg3-KO eggs/embryos after only 8 h of incubation and in vtg1-KO embryos after 5 d. Hatching rate and timing were markedly impaired in vtg mutant embryos and pericardial and yolk sac/abdominal edema and spinal lordosis were evident in the larvae, with feeding and motor activities also being absent in vtg1-KO larvae. By late larval stages, vtg mutations were either completely lethal (vtg1-KO) or nearly so (vtg3-KO). These novel findings offer the first experimental evidence that different types of vertebrate Vtg are essential and have disparate requisite functions at different times during both reproduction and development.",

    "abstract": "For proper chromosome segregation, sister kinetochores must interact with microtubules from opposite spindle poles; this is called bi-orientation. To establish bi-orientation prior to chromosome segregation, any aberrant kinetochore-microtubule interaction must be resolved (error correction) by Aurora B kinase that phosphorylates outer kinetochore components. Aurora B differentially regulates kinetochore attachment to the microtubule plus end and its lateral side (end-on and lateral attachment, respectively). However, it is still not fully understood how kinetochore-microtubule interactions are exchanged during error correction. Here we reconstituted the kinetochore-microtubule interface of budding yeast in vitro by attaching the Ndc80 complexes (Ndc80C) to nanobeads. These Ndc80C-nanobeads recapitulated in vitro the lateral and end-on attachments of authentic kinetochores, on dynamic microtubules loaded with the Dam1 complex. This in vitro assay enabled the direct comparison of lateral and end-on attachment strength and showed that Dam1 phosphorylation by Aurora B makes the end-on attachment weaker than the lateral attachment. We suggest that the Dam1 phosphorylation weakens interaction with the Ndc80 complex, disrupts the end-on attachment and promotes the exchange to a new lateral attachment, leading to error correction. Our study reveals a fundamental mechanism of error correction for establishment of bi-orientation.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the balance between glutamate (Glu) release and uptake may stimulate synaptic reorganization and even synapse loss. In the case of neurodegeneration, a mismatch between astroglial Glu uptake and presynaptic Glu release could be detected if both parameters were assessed independently and at a single synapse level. This has now become possible due to a new imaging assay with the genetically encoded ultrafast Glu sensor iGluu. We report findings from individual corticostriatal synapses in acute slices prepared from mice aged >1 year. Contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity and a size criterion identified 2 classes of terminals, presumably corresponding to the previously defined IT and PT synapses. The latter exhibited a higher degree of frequency potentiation/residual Glu accumulation and were selected for our first iGluu single synapse study in Q175 mice, a model of Huntingtons disease (HD). It was found that in HD the time constant of perisynaptic [Glu] decay (TauD, as indicator of uptake) and the peak iGluu amplitude (as indicator of release) were prolonged and reduced, respectively. Treatment of WT preparations with the astrocytic Glu uptake blocker TFB-TBOA (100 nM) mimicked the TauD changes in homozygotes (HOM). Considering the largest TauD values encountered in WT, about 40% of PT terminals tested in Q175 heterozygotes (HET) can be classified as dysfunctional. Moreover, HD but not WT synapses exhibited a positive correlation between TauD and the peak amplitude of iGluu. Finally, EAAT2 immunoreactivity was reduced next to corticostriatal terminals. Thus, astrocytic Glu transport remains a promising target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAlterations in astrocytic Glu uptake can play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Until now, sensitivity of synaptic responses to pharmacological transport block and the resulting activation of NMDA receptors were regarded as reliable evidence for a mismatch between synaptic uptake and release. But the latter parameters are interdependent. Using a new genetically encoded sensor to monitor [Glu] at individual corticostriatal synapses we can now quantify the time constant of perisynaptic [Glu] decay (as indicator of uptake) and the maximal [Glu] elevation next to the active zone (as indicator of Glu release). The results provide a positive answer to the hitherto unresolved question whether neurodegeneration (e.g. Huntingtons disease) associates with a glutamate uptake deficit at tripartite excitatory synapses.",

Identification of TF physical binding that is biologically  neutral is a current challenge. We studied cell identity in the context of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a cell programme fundamental for normal embryonic development that contributes to tumour progression and fibrosis.\\n\\nResultsWe developed the NetNC software for discovery of functionally coherent TF targets. NetNC was applied to analyse gene regulation by the EMT TFs Snail, Twist in early embryogenesis and also to modENCODE  HOT regions. Predicted neutral binding accounted for 50% to [&ge;]80% of candidate target genes assigned from significant binding peaks. Novel gene functions and network modules were identified, including regulation of chromatin organisation and crosstalk with notch signalling. Orthologues of predicted TF targets discriminated breast cancer molecular subtypes and NetNC analysis predicted new gene functions; for example, evidencing networks that reshape Waddingtons landscape during EMT-like phenotype switching. Predicted invasion roles for SNX29, ATG3, UNK and IRX4 were validated using a tractable cell model.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found extensive neutral TF binding across the nine datasets examined and showed that NetNC performs well in identifying functionally coherent targets. HOT regions had comparatively high functional coherence. Our results illuminate conserved molecular networks that regulate epithelial remodelling in development and disease, with potential implications for precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Haplotype-based variant callers, which consider physical linkage between variant sites, are currently among the best tools for germline variation discovery and genotyping from short-read sequencing data. However, almost all such tools were designed specifically for detecting common germline variation in diploid populations, and give sub-optimal results in other scenarios. Here we present Octopus, a versatile haplotype-based variant caller that uses a polymorphic Bayesian genotyping model capable of modeling sequencing data from a range of experimental designs within a unified haplotype-aware framework. We show that Octopus accurately calls de novo mutations in parent-offspring trios and germline variants in individuals, including SNVs, indels, and small complex replacements such as microinversions. In addition, using a carefully designed synthetic-tumour data set derived from clean sequencing data from a sample with known germline haplotypes, and observed mutations in large cohort of tumour samples, we show that Octopus accurately characterizes germline and somatic variation in tumours, both with and without a paired normal sample. Sequencing reads and prior information are combined to phase called genotypes of arbitrary ploidy, including those with somatic mutations. Octopus also outputs realigned evidence BAMs to aid validation and interpretation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBreeding for disease resistance has become a highly desirable strategy for mitigating infectious disease problems in aquaculture. However, knowledge of the genetic relationship between resistance and other economically important traits, such as growth, is important to assess prior to including disease resistance into the breeding goal. Our study assessed the genetic correlations between growth and survival traits in a large bacterial infection challenge experiment. A population of 2,606 coho salmon individuals from 107 full-sibling families were challenged with the bacteria Piscirickettsia salmonis. Growth was measured as average daily gain prior (ADG0) and during (ADGi) the experimental infection and as harvest weight (HW). Resistance was measured as Survival time (ST) and binary survival (BS). Furthermore, individual measures of bacterial load (BL) were assessed as new resistance phenotypes and to provide an indication of genetic variation in tolerance in salmonid species.\\n\\nResultsSignificant moderate heritabilities were estimated for ADG0 (0.30 {+/-} 0.05), HW (0.38 {+/-} 0.03), and for the survival traits ST (0.16 {+/-} 0.03) and BS (0.18 {+/-} 0.03). In contrast, heritabilities for ADGi and log-transformed BL were low (0.07 {+/-} 0.02 (significant) and 0.04 {+/-} 0.03, respectively), although these increased to moderate significant levels (0.20 {+/-} 0.09 and 0.12 {+/-} 0.05, respectively) when traits were assessed in survivors only. Significant and favorable genetic correlations were found between ADG0 and the growth traits ADGi (0.40 {+/-} 0.16) and HW (0.64 {+/-} 0.09), as well as with resistance as ST (0.43 {+/-} 0.18), indicating that fish with higher genetic growth rate early on and prior to infection not only tend to maintain their genetic growth advantage until harvest, but also tend to grow faster and survive longer during infection. Furthermore, no robust unfavorable genetic correlations between ADG0 and any of the other traits considered in this study, in particular BL, was identified. Adding log BL as covariates into the models for growth under infection and survival provided an indication for genetic variation in tolerance.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that selective breeding for early growth would be expected to simultaneously increase survival time and growth performance during an infection with Piscirickettsia salmonis after accounting for variation in bacterial load, and harvest weight in this coho salmon population, without negatively impacting on pathogen burden.",

These pre-60S particles mature by transiently interacting with various assembly factors. The ~5000 amino-acid AAA+ ATPase Rea1 (or Midasin) generates force to mechanically remove assembly factors from pre-60S particles, which promotes their export to the cytosol. Here we present three Rea1 cryoEM structures. We visualize the Rea1 engine, a hexameric ring of AAA+ domains, and identify an -helical bundle of AAA2 as a major ATPase activity regulator. The -helical bundle interferes with nucleotide induced conformational changes that create a docking site for the substrate binding MIDAS domain of Rea1 on the AAA+ ring. Furthermore, we reveal the architecture of the Rea1 linker, which is involved in force generation and extends from the AAA+ ring.

The resulting technique, identification of RNA-associated peptides (iRAP), was used to locate 1331 unique RNA-interaction sites at single amino acid residue resolution in 324 S. cerevisiae proteins. Our identified RNA-interaction sites in characterized RNA-protein complex agree well with available high-resolution structures. In known RNA-interacting protiens, 317 sites fall into known and suspected RNA-interaction domains while only 21 sites fall into other annotated sequence features. Strikingly, 993 of the sites identified fall into protein regions that lack any recognizable protein domain structure or annotated sequence features.

Since cardiovascular pulsations are a main driving force of the clearance, this research investigates if commonly available blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals at 1.5 and 3 T could detect abnormal physiological pulsations in neurodegenerative diseases. Coefficient of variation in BOLD signal (CVBOLD) was used to estimate contribution of physiological signals in Alzheimers disease (AD) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). 17 AD patients and 18 bvFTD patients were compared to 24 control subjects imaged with a 1.5 T setup from a local institute. AD results were further verified with 3 T data from the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) repository with 30 AD patients and 40 matched controls. Effect of motion and gray matter atrophy was evaluated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses was performed.\\n\\nThe CVBOLD was higher in both AD and bvFTD groups compared to controls (p < 0.0005). The difference was not explained by head motion or gray matter atrophy. In AD patients, the CVBOLD alterations were localized in overlapping structures in both 1.5 T and 3 T data. Localization of the CVBOLD alterations was different in AD than in bvFTD. Areas where CVBOLD is higher in patient groups than in control group involved periventricular white matter, basal ganglia and multiple cortical structures. Notably, a robust difference between AD and bvFTD groups was found in the CVBOLD of frontal poles. In the analysis of diagnostic accuracy, the CVBOLD metrics area under the ROC for detecting disease ranged 0.85 - 0.96.\\n\\nConclusionsThe analysis of brain physiological pulsations measured using CVBOLD reveals disease-specific alterations in both AD and bvFTD.",

    "abstract": "Living in groups comes with many potential benefits, especially for juveniles. Naive individuals may learn how to forage, or avoid predators through group vigilance. Understanding these benefits, however, requires an appreciation of the opportunities juveniles have to associate with (and learn from) others. Here we describe social groups in terms of residency, movement, relatedness, and social associations from the perspective of juvenile hihi, a threatened New Zealand passerine bird. Over three years, we identified individuals in groups, their relatedness, and behavioural interactions. Using multistate analysis, we compared movement and residency of adults and juveniles and found that groups were composed predominately of juveniles which remained at group sites for longer than more transient adults. Movement of juveniles between groups did occur but was generally low. There was no evidence that siblings and parents were likely to be seen in groups together. With an initial understanding of group structure, we next asked what characteristics predicted assortment in social network associations. By identifying groups of co-occurring juveniles from time-stamped observations of individual hihi and building a social network, we found that juveniles were most likely to associate with other juveniles. Associations were also predominantly based on locations where hihi spent the most time, reflecting limited movement among separate groups. We suggest groups are best described as \\\"gangs\\\" where young hihi have little interaction with adults. These spatially-separated groups of juveniles may have consequences for social information use during the first few months of independence in young birds.",

    "abstract": "In Trypanosoma brucei, most mitochondrial mRNAs undergo U-insertion/deletion editing, and 3' adenylation and uridylation. The internal sequence changes and terminal extensions are coordinated: Pre-editing addition of the short (A) tail protects the edited transcript against 3'-5' degradation, while post-editing A/U-tailing renders mRNA competent for ribosome recruitment. Participation of a poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in coupling of editing and 3' modification processes has been inferred, but its identity and mechanism of action remained elusive. We report identification of KPAF4, a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing PABP which sequesters the A-tail and impedes exonucleolytic degradation. Conversely, KPAF4 inhibits uridylation of A-tailed transcripts and, therefore, premature A/U-tailing of partially-edited mRNAs. This quality check point prevents translation of incompletely edited mRNAs. Our findings also implicate the RNA editing substrate binding complex (RESC) in mediating the interaction between the 5' end bound pyrophosphohydrolase MERS1 and 3' end associated KPAF4 to enable mRNA circularization. This event is critical for transcript stability during the editing process.",

    "abstract": "The identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins is crucial in pharmaceutical sciences. The experimental validation of interactions in genomic drug discovery is laborious and expensive; hence, there is a need for efficient and accurate in-silico techniques which can predict potential drug-target interactions to narrow down the search space for experimental verification.\\n\\nIn this work, we propose a new framework, namely, Multi Graph Regularized Nuclear Norm Minimization, which predicts the interactions between drugs and proteins from three inputs: known drug-target interaction network, similarities over drugs and those over targets. The proposed method focuses on finding a low-rank interaction matrix that is structured by the proximities of drugs and targets encoded by graphs. Previous works on Drug Target Interaction (DTI) prediction have shown that incorporating drug and target similarities helps in learning the data manifold better by preserving the local geometries of the original data. But, there is no clear consensus on which kind and what combination of similarities would best assist the prediction task. Hence, we propose to use various multiple drug-drug similarities and target-target similarities as multiple graph Laplacian (over drugs/targets) regularization terms to capture the proximities exhaustively.\\n\\nExtensive cross-validation experiments on four benchmark datasets using standard evaluation metrics (AUPR and AUC) show that the proposed algorithm improves the predictive performance and outperforms recent state-of-the-art computational methods by a large margin.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThis work introduces a computational approach, namely Multi-Graph Regularized Nuclear Norm Minimization (MGRNNM), to predict potential interactions between drugs and targets. The novelty of MGRNNM lies in structuring drug-target interactions by multiple proximities of drugs and targets. There have been previous works which have graph regularized Matrix factorization and Matrix completion algorithms to incorporate the standard chemical structure drug similarity and genomic sequence target protein similarity, respectively. We introduce multiple drug-graph laplacian and target-graph laplacian regularization terms to the standard matrix completion framework to predict the missing values in the interaction matrix. The graph Laplacian terms are constructed from various kinds and combinations of similarities over drugs and targets (computed from the interaction matrix itself). In addition to this, we further improve the prediction accuracy by sparsifying the drug and target similarity matrices, respectively. For performance evaluation, we conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that MGRNNM clearly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods under three different cross-validation settings, in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR).",

The population size of parrots--one of the most threatened bird families--is often assessed using roost counts, which suffer from multiple sources of uncertainty that need to be addressed in monitoring efforts. To improve estimates of abundance for endangered Vinaceous-breasted Parrot (Amazona vinacea), we compared extensive roost counts over the whole range of the species (Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil) with an intensive regional survey designed to address five sources of uncertainty about parrot abundance in western Santa Catarina state (WSC), Brazil, in 2016 and 2017. We estimated regional-scale abundance using a sampling design that minimizes double counting and an N-mixture model of replicated count data, which accounts for imperfect detection, implemented in a Bayesian framework. The whole-range counts amounted to 3,888 and 4,084 individuals in 2016 and 2017, respectively; regional estimates were 945 {+/-} 50 and 1,393 {+/-} 40 individuals, for the same two years. We found no evidence of population growth because the increase in numbers matched an increase in observation effort on both spatial scales. When extrapolating the WSC abundance estimate to three hypothetical geographical range areas of the species, under the simplifying assumption of homogenous density, we obtained values above the whole-range counts, but within the same order of magnitude, putting the global population size of Vinaceous-breasted Parrot in the thousands of individuals. Although our estimates of abundance and geographic range are larger than those currently reported by the IUCN, we suggest that Vinaceous-breasted Parrot remain in the  Endangered IUCN threat category pending further investigation of population trends. We recommend that roost-monitoring programs for parrots consider and address sources of uncertainty through field protocols and statistical analysis, to better inform assessments of population size, trends, and threat status.",

In parallel, phylogenetic tools are constantly being improved, offering more rigorous approaches for reconstruction of deep evolutionary history of viruses and their hosts. Here we present robust phylogenetic trees of NCLDVs, based on the 8 most conserved proteins responsible for virion morphogenesis and informational processes. Our results uncover the evolutionary relationships between different NCLDV families and support the existence of two superclades of NCLDVs, each encompassing several families. We present evidence strongly suggesting that the NCLDV core genes, which are involved in both informational processes and virion formation, were acquired vertically from a common ancestor. Among them, the largest subunits of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase were seemingly transferred from two clades of NCLDVs to proto-eukaryotes, giving rise to two of the three eukaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Our results strongly suggest that these transfers and the diversification of NCLDVs predated the emergence of modern eukaryotes, emphasizing the major role of viruses in the evolution of cellular domains.",

    "abstract": "Tens of thousands of reproducibly identified GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) variants, with the vast majority falling in non-coding regions resulting in no eventual protein products, call urgently for mechanistic interpretations. Although numerous methods exist, there are few, if any methods, for simultaneously testing the mediation effects of multiple correlated SNPs via some mediator (for example, the expression of a gene in the neighborhood) on phenotypic outcome. We propose SMUT, multi-SNP Mediation intersection-Union Test to fill in this methodological gap. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the validity of SMUT as well as substantial, up to 92%, power gains over alternative methods. In addition, SMUT confirmed known mediators in a real dataset of Finns for plasma adiponectin level, which were missed by many alternative methods. We believe SMUT will become a useful tool to generate mechanistic hypotheses underlying GWAS variants, facilitating functional follow-up.

    "abstract": "Sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi) are ectoparasitic copepods which have a large negative economic and welfare impact in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, particularly in Chile. A multi-faceted prevention and control strategy is required to tackle lice, and selective breeding contributes via cumulative improvement of host resistance to the parasite. While host resistance has been shown to be heritable, little is yet known about the individual loci that contribute to this resistance, the potential underlying genes, and their mechanisms of action. In this study we took a multifaceted approach to identify and characterise quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting hose resistance in a population of 2,688 Caligus-challenged Atlantic salmon post-smolts from a commercial breeding programme. We used low and medium density genotyping to collect genome-wide SNP marker data for all animals. Moderate heritablility estimates of 0.28 and 0.24 were obtained for lice density (as a measure of host resistance) and growth during infestation respectively. Three QTL explaining between 7 and 13 % of the genetic variation in resistance to sea lice (as represented by the traits of lice density) were detected on chromosomes 3, 18 and 21. Characterisation of these QTL regions was undertaken using RNA sequencing and pooled whole genome sequencing data. This resulted in the identification of a shortlist of potential underlying causative genes, and candidate functional mutations for further study. For example, candidates within the chromosome 3 QTL include a putative premature stop mutation in TOB1 (an anti-proliferative transcription factor involved in T cell regulation) and an uncharacterized protein which showed significant differential allelic expression (implying the existence of a cis-acting regulatory mutation). While host resistance to sea lice is polygenic in nature, the results of this study highlight significant QTL regions together explaining a moderate proportion of the heritability of the trait. Future investigation of these QTL may enable improved knowledge of the functional mechanisms of host resistance to sea lice, and incorporation of functional variants to improve genomic selection accuracy.",

Recently, Chen and Chen (2013) developed a method for analytically deriving the AFS for populations with temporally varying size through the coalescence time-scaling function. However, their approach is only applicable for population history scenarios in which the analytical form of the time-scaling function is tractable. In this paper, we propose a computational approach to extend the method to populations with arbitrary complex history by numerically approximating the time-scaling function. We demonstrate the performance of the approach by constructing the AFS for two population history scenarios: the logistic growth model and the Gompertz growth model, for which the AFS are unavailable with existing approaches.",

Our understanding of the basal ganglia in particular has been greatly assisted by BAC mutants with selective transgene expression in striatal neurons forming the direct or indirect pathways. However, for more sophisticated behavioral tasks and larger intracranial implants, rat models are preferred. Furthermore, BAC lines can show variable expression patterns depending upon genomic insertion site. We therefore used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate two novel knock-in rat lines specifically encoding Cre recombinase immediately after the dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1a) or adenosine 2a receptor (Adora2a) loci. Here we validate these lines using in situ hybridization and viral vector mediated transfection to demonstrate selective, functional Cre expression in the striatal direct and indirect pathways respectively. We used whole-genome sequencing to confirm the lack of off-target effects, and established that both rat lines have normal locomotor activity and learning in simple instrumental and Pavlovian tasks. We expect these new D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rat lines will be widely used to study both normal brain functions and neurological and psychiatric pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by rapidly shifting symptoms, including intense anger and aggressive behavior. Understanding how fluctuations in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle may contribute to symptom instability is key for accurate assessment of BPD symptoms and effective interventions. Reactive and proactive aggression, as well as anger in and out, were assessed daily in 15 physically healthy, unmedicated naturally cycling female individuals without dysmenorrhea meeting criteria for BPD across 35 days. Urine LH surge and salivary progesterone were used to confirm ovulation and verify cycle phase. Cyclical worsening of symptoms was evaluated using multilevel models to evaluate symptom differences between cycle phases. Both forms of aggressive behavior demonstrated marked cycle effects, with reactive aggression highest during perimenstrual cycle phases, co-occurring with increases in anger in and out. In contrast, highest levels of proactive aggression were observed during the follicular and ovulatory phases, when emotional symptoms and anger were otherwise at lowest levels. These findings highlight the importance of identifying the function of aggression when considering potential psychological and biological influences. Naturally cycling individuals with BPD may be at elevated risk for perimenstrual worsening of a range of interpersonally reactive symptoms, including reactive aggression, whereas proactive aggression may occur more in phases characterized by less emotional and cognitive vulnerability and greater reward sensitivity. Research on aggression in this population should consider cycle effects. Cycling individuals with BPD attempting to reduce aggressive behavior may benefit from cycle-tracking to increase awareness of these effects and to develop appropriate strategies.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are ubiquitous throughout the cortex, but the frequency of oscillations differs from area to area. To elucidate the mechanistic architectures establishing various rhythmic activities, we tested whether spontaneous neural oscillations in different cortical modules can be entrained by direct perturbation with distinct frequencies of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). While recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), we applied single-pulse TMS (sTMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) at 5, 11, and 23 Hz to motor or visual cortex. To assess entrainment, defined as phase locking of intrinsic oscillations to periodic external force , we examined local and global modulation of the phase-locking factor (PLF). sTMS triggered transient phase locking in a wide frequency band with distinct PLF peaks at 21 Hz in the motor cortex and 8 Hz in the visual cortex. With TMS pulse trains of 11 Hz over visual cortex and 23 Hz over motor cortex, phase locking was progressively enhanced at the stimulation frequency and lasted for a few cycles after the stimulation terminated. Moreover, such local entrainment propagated to other cortical regions, suggesting that rTMS entrained intrinsic neural oscillations locally and globally via network nodes. Because the entrainment was frequency-specific for each target site, these frequencies may correspond to the natural frequency of each cortical module and of the global networks. rTMS enables direct manipulation of the brain and is thus useful for investigating the causal roles of synchronous neural oscillations and synchrony in brain functions, and for the treatment of clinical symptoms associated with impaired oscillations and synchrony.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe provide the first evidence for area- and frequency-specific entrainment by frequency-tuned repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and the propagation of this entrainment to other areas. Our results indicate that rTMS at the natural frequency of each cortical system is particularly effective for entraining oscillatory phase. Moreover, local entrainment led to global entrainment in functionally coupled areas. The ability to control brain rhythms in the intact human brain is highly beneficial for studying the causal roles of rhythmic activity in brain function. Moreover, this modulatory technique has the potential to treat patients with impaired rhythmic networks in disorders such as schizophrenia and stroke.",

    "abstract": "Techniques to monitor functional fluorescence signal from the brain are increasingly popular in the neuroscience community. However, most implementations are based on flat cleaved optical fibers (FFs) that can only interface with shallow tissue volumes adjacent to the fiber opening. To circumvent this limitation, we exploit modal properties of tapered optical fibers (TFs) to structure light collection over the wide optically active area of the fiber taper, providing an approach to efficiently and selectively collect light from the region(s) of interest. While being less invasive than FFs, TF probes can uniformly collect light over up to 2 mm of tissue and allow for multisite photometry along the taper. Furthermore, by micro-structuring the non-planar surface of the fiber taper, collection volumes from TFs can also be engineered arbitrarily in both shape and size. Owing to the abilities offered by these probes, we envision that TFs can set a novel, powerful paradigm in optically targeting not only the deep brain, but, more in general, any biological system or organ where light collection from the deep tissues is beneficial but challenging because of tissue scattering and absorption.",

    "abstract": "There is increased appreciation that dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain respond not only to reward 1,2 and reward-predicting cues 1,3,4, but also to other variables such as distance to reward 5, movements 6-11 and behavioral choices 12-15. Based on these findings, a major open question is how the responses to these diverse variables are organized across the population of DA neurons. In other words, do individual DA neurons multiplex multiple variables, or are subsets of neurons specialized in encoding specific behavioral variables? The reason that this fundamental question has been difficult to resolve is that recordings from large populations of individual DA neurons have not been performed in a behavioral task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we used 2-photon calcium imaging through an implanted lens to record activity of >300 midbrain DA neurons in the VTA during a complex decision-making task. As mice navigated in a virtual reality (VR) environment, DA neurons encoded an array of sensory, motor, and cognitive variables. These responses were functionally clustered, such that subpopulations of neurons transmitted information about a subset of behavioral variables, in addition to encoding reward. These functional clusters were spatially organized, such that neighboring neurons were more likely to be part of the same cluster. Taken together with the topography between DA neurons and their projections, this specialization and anatomical organization may aid downstream circuits in correctly interpreting the wide range of signals transmitted by DA neurons.",

    "abstract": "Organismal physiology emerges from metabolic pathways and structures that can vary across development and among individuals. Here we tested whether genetic variation at one level of physiology can be buffered at higher levels during development by the inherent capacity for homeostasis in physiological systems. We found that the fundamental scaling relationship between mass and metabolic rate, as well as the oxidative capacity per mitochondria, differed significantly across development in the fruit fly Drosophila. However, mitochondrial respiration rate was maintained across development at similar levels. Furthermore, genotypes clustered into two types--those that switched to aerobic, mitochondrial ATP production before the second instar and those that relied on anaerobic production of ATP via glycolysis through the second instar. Despite genetic variation for the timing of this metabolic shift, second-instar metabolic rate was more robust to genetic variation than was the metabolic rate of other instars. We also found that a mitochondrial-nuclear genotype with disrupted mitochondrial function both increased aerobic capacity more through development and relied more heavily on anaerobic ATP production relative to wildtype genotypes. By taking advantage of both ways of making ATP, this genotype maintained mitochondrial respiratory capacity, but also generated more free radicals and had decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, potentially as a physiological-defense mechanism. Taken together, the data revealed that genetic defects in core physiology can be buffered at the organismal level via physiological compensation and that natural populations likely harbor genetic variation for distinct metabolic strategies in development that generate similar organismal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Crop residues are a crucial ecological niche with a major biological impact on agricultural ecosystems. In this study we used a combined diachronic and synchronic field experiment based on wheat-oilseed rape rotations to test the hypothesis that plant is a structuring factor of microbial communities in crop residues, and that this effect decreases over time with their likely progressive degradation and colonization by other microorganisms. We characterized an entire fungal and bacterial community associated with 150 wheat and oilseed rape residue samples at a plurennial scale by metabarcoding. The impact of plant species on the residue microbiota decreased over time and our data revealed turnover, with the replacement of oligotrophs, often plant-specific genera (such as pathogens) by copiotrophs, belonging to more generalist genera. Within a single cropping season, the plant-specific genera and species were gradually replaced by taxa that are likely to originate from the soil. These changes occurred more rapidly for bacteria than for fungi, known to degrade complex compounds. Overall, our findings suggest that crop residues constitute a key fully-fledged microbial ecosystem. Taking into account this ecosystem, that has been neglected for too long, is essential, not only to improve the quantitative management of residues, the presence of which can be detrimental to crop health, but also to identify groups of beneficial micro-organisms. Our findings are of particular importance, because the wheat-oilseed rape rotation, in which no-till practices are frequent, is particularly widespread in the European arable cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Absolute pitch, the ability to name or produce a musical tone without a reference, is a rare ability which is often related to early musical training and genetic components. However, it remains a matter of debate why absolute pitch is relatively common in autism spectrum disorders and why absolute pitch possessors exhibit higher autistic traits. By definition absolute pitch (which involves the analysis of single tones) is characterized by a focus on a local scale than relative pitch (involving relations between tones, intervals, melodies).\\n\\nThis study investigated whether a detail-oriented cognitive style, a concept borrowed from the autism literature (weak central coherence theory), might provide a framework to explain this joint occurrence. Two local-to-global experiments in vision (hierarchically constructed letters) and audition (hierarchically constructed melodies) as well as a pitch adjustment test measuring absolute pitch proficiency were conducted in 31 absolute pitch and 33 relative pitch professional musicians. Analyses revealed inconsistent group differences among reaction time, accuracy and speed-accuracy-composite-scores of experimental conditions (local vs. global, and congruent vs. incongruent stimuli). Furthermore, amounts of interference of global form on judgements of local elements and vice versa were calculated. Interestingly, reduced global-to-local interference in audition was associated with greater absolute pitch ability and in vision with higher autistic traits. Results are partially in line with the idea of a detail-oriented cognitive style in absolute pitch musicians. The inconsistency of the results might be due to limitations of global-to-local paradigms in measuring cognitive style and due to heterogeneity of absolute pitch possessors. In summary, this study provides further evidence for a multifaceted pattern of various and potentially interacting factors on the acquisition of absolute pitch.",

    "abstract": "Domoic Acid (DA) is a naturally-occurring marine neurotoxin that is increasingly recognized as an important public health issue. Prenatal DA exposure occurs through the maternal consumption of contaminated shellfish/finfish. To better understand the fetal risks associated with DA, we initiated a longitudinal, preclinical study focused on the reproductive and developmental effects of chronic, low-dose oral DA exposure. To this end, 32 adult female Macaca fascicularis monkeys were orally dosed with 0, 0.075 or 0.15 mg/kg/day DA on a daily basis prior to breeding and throughout breeding and pregnancy. The doses included the proposed human Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) (0.075 mg/kg/day) for DA. Adult females were bred to nonexposed males. To evaluate development during early infancy, offspring were administered a Neonatal Assessment modeled after the human Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale and a series of Visual Recognition Memory problems using the novelty paradigm. Results indicated that prenatal DA exposure did not impact early survival reflexes or responsivity to the environment. Findings from the recognition memory assessment, given between 1-2 months of age, showed that exposed and control infants demonstrated robust novelty scores when test problems were relatively easy to solve. Performance was not diminished by the introduction of delay periods. However, when more difficult recognition problems were introduced, the looking behavior of the 0.15 mg/kg DA group was random and infants failed to show differential visual attention to novel test stimuli. This finding suggests subtle but significant impairment in recognition memory and demonstrates that chronic fetal exposure to DA may impact developing cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomics perturbation signatures are valuable data sources for functional genomic studies. They can be effectively used to identify mechanism of action for new compounds and to infer functional activity of different cellular processes. Linking perturbation signatures to phenotypic studies opens up the possibility to model selected cellular phenotypes from gene expression data and to predict drugs interfering with the phenotype. At the same time, close association of transcriptomics changes with phenotypes can potentially mask the compound specific signatures. By linking perturbation transcriptomics data from the LINCS-L1000 project with cell viability phenotypic information upon genetic (from Achilles project) and chemical (from CTRP screen) perturbations for more than 90,000 signature - cell viability pairs, we show here that a cell death signature is a major factor behind perturbation signatures. We use this relationship to effectively predict cell viability from transcriptomics signatures, and identify and experimentally validate compounds that induce either cell death or proliferation. We also show that cellular toxicity can lead to an unexpected similarity of toxic compound signatures confounding the mechanism of action discovery. Consensus compound signatures predict cell-specific anti-cancer drug sensitivity, even if the drug signature is not measured in the same cell line. These signatures outperform conventional drug-specific features like nominal target and chemical fingerprints. Our results can help removing confounding factors of large scale transcriptomics perturbation screens and show that expression signatures boost prediction of drug sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Bone mineral density (BMD) is a strong predictor of osteoporotic fracture. It is also one of the most heritable disease-associated quantitative traits. As a result, there has been considerable effort focused on dissecting its genetic basis. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a panel of inbred strains to identify associations influencing BMD. This analysis identified a significant (P=3.1 x 10-12) BMD locus on Chromosome 3@52.5 Mbp that replicated in two seperate inbred strain panels and overlapped a BMD quantitative trait locus (QTL) previously identified in a F2 intercross. The association mapped to a 300 Kbp region containing four genes; Gm2447, Gm20750, Cog6, and Lhfp. Further analysis found that Lipoma HMGIC Fusion Partner (Lhfp) was highly expressed in bone and osteoblasts and its expression was regulated by local expression QTL (eQTL) in multiple tissues. A co-expression network analysis revealed that Lhfp was strongly connected to genes involved in osteoblast differentiation. To directly evaluate its role in bone, Lhfp deficient mice (Lhfp-/-) were created using CRISPR/Cas9. Consistent with genetic and network predictions, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from Lhfp-/- displayed increased osteogenic differentiation. Lfhp-/- mice also had elevated BMD due to increased cortical bone mass. In conclusion, we used GWAS and systems genetics in mice to identify Lhfp as a regulator of osteoblast activity and bone mass.",

    "abstract": "In challenging listening conditions, closing the eyes is a strategy with intuitive appeal to improve auditory attention and perception. On the neural level, closing the eyes increases the power of alpha oscillations ([~]10 Hz), which are a prime signature of auditory attention. Here, we test whether eye closure benefits neural and behavioural signatures of auditory attention and perception. Participants (N = 22) attended to one of two alternating streams of spoken numbers with open or closed eyes in a darkened chamber. After each trial, participants indicated whether probes had been among the to-be-attended or to-be-ignored numbers. In the electroencephalogram, states of relative high versus low alpha power accompanied the presentation of attended versus ignored numbers. Importantly, eye closure did not only increase the overall level of absolute alpha power but also the attentional modulation thereof. Behaviourally, however, neither perceptual sensitivity nor response criterion was affected by eye closure. To further examine whether this behavioural null-result would conceptually replicate in a simple auditory detection task, a follow-up experiment was conducted that required participants (N = 19) to detect a near-threshold target tone in noise. As in the main experiment, our results provide evidence for the absence of any difference in perceptual sensitivity and criterion for open versus closed eyes. In sum, we demonstrate here that the modulation of the human alpha rhythm by auditory attention is increased when participants close their eyes. However, our results speak against the widely held belief that eye closure per se improves listening behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that many genes and proteins in plants are involved in the regulation of plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. The researches on the stress tolerance of crops are also the focus of many researchers. To provides a reliable platform for collecting and retrieving genetic and protein information related to stress tolerance found in crops, we constructed CSTDB(Crops Stress-tolerance Database), an integrated database that includes stress-tolerance genes and proteins for many crop species. The database was developed based on convolutional neural network technology. It is a web-accessible database that contains detailed information on the stress-tolerance genes and proteins of major crop species. Currently, the database records four major crops containing 1,371 abiotic stress-tolerance genes or proteins, and 207 genes or proteins associated with biotic stress. Each gene and protein has detailed functional information and sequence information, such as stress types, Genbank ID, Pubmed ID, Protein ID, 3D model picture and FASTA files. As a user-friendly browsing tool, this database provides search functions, BALST functions and file download functions. CSTDB can be a valuable resource, which is designed to meet the broad needs of researchers working on crops stress-tolerance experiments. Database URL: http://pcsb.ahau.edu.cn:8080/CSTDB",

The etiology is poorly understood; however, there is evidence to support an immune-mediated pathogenesis. No literature exists investigating the efficacy of cyclosporine (CsA) therapy for CH in dogs.\\n\\nObjectivesTo retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and adverse side effects of CsA in the treatment of CH in dogs, and to identify factors that impact response to CsA therapy.\\n\\nAnimals48 client-owned dogs diagnosed with CH treated with CsA for at least 2 weeks.\\n\\nMethodsRetrospective review of medical records between the years 2010-2017.\\n\\nResultsTwenty-two breeds of dogs were included of which 54% were spayed females, 42% neutered males and 4% intact males. Median age was 8.5 years (range, 0.7-14 years). Complete remission (normalization of alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in response to CsA was attained in 79% of dogs (38/48). Median dose of CsA at the time of remission was 7.9 mg/kg/day (range, 2.5-12.7mg/kg/day) and median time to remission was 2.5 months (range, 0.75-18 months). None of the factors evaluated including clinical score, presence of ascites, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, prolonged coagulation times, dose, or duration of therapy influenced remission. Common side effects were gastrointestinal signs in 38% (18/48) and gingival hyperplasia in 25% (12/48) of dogs.\\n\\nConclusion and Clinical ImportanceCsA proved to be a tolerated and effective medication in attaining remission in dogs with idiopathic CH based on normalization of serum ALT.

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that all insects have six legs, they display considerable differences in their legged locomotion. Are these differences irreconcilable, or simply different domains of the same system? In this study, we investigate walking in Drosophila. We find that despite the fact that flies walk extremely slowly relative to their size, they predominantly employ an alternating tripod gait, a gait typically associated with high-speed locomotion. The kinematics of their center of mass (CoM) is diametrically opposite to the CoM kinematics observed in insect runners such as cockroach. We resolve this tension between similar gaits, and differing kinematics in slow and high-speed locomotion by showing that the mechanics of a tripod gait naturally reduces to a simple biomechanical model which can support a range of kinematic patterns including both fly-like and cockroach-like patterns. These findings suggest that legged locomotion in different insects might represent different domains of the same system.",

Here, we developed a clearing-imaging-analysis pipeline to visualize innervation of intact hearts in 3D and employed a multi-technique approach to map parasympathetic and sympathetic neural circuits that control heart rate in mice. We anatomically and functionally identify cholinergic neurons and noradrenergic neurons in an intrinsic cardiac ganglion and the stellate ganglia, respectively, that project to the sinoatrial node. We also report that the heart rate response to optogenetic versus electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve displays different temporal characteristics and that vagal afferents enhance parasympathetic and reduce sympathetic tone to the heart via central mechanisms. Our findings provide new insights into neural regulation of heart rate, and our methodology to study cardiac circuits can be readily used to interrogate neural control of other visceral organs.",
