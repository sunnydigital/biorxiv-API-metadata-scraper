    "abstract": "GABAergic interneurons are chiefly responsible for controlling the activity of local circuits in the cortex1,2. However, the rules that govern the wiring of interneurons are not well understood3. Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a type of GABAergic interneuron that control the output of hundreds of neighbouring pyramidal cells through axo-axonic synapses which target the axon initial segment (AIS)4. Despite their importance in modulating circuit activity, our knowledge of the development and function of axo-axonic synapses remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of activity in the formation and plasticity of ChC synapses. In vivo imaging of ChCs during development uncovered a narrow window (P12-P18) over which axons arborized and formed connections. We found that increases in the activity of either pyramidal cells or individual ChCs during this temporal window resulted in a reversible decrease in axo-axonic connections. Voltage imaging of GABAergic transmission at the AIS showed that axo-axonic synapses were depolarising during this period. Identical manipulations of network activity in older mice (P40-P46), when ChC synapses are inhibitory, resulted in an increase in axo-axonic synapses. We propose that the direction of ChC plasticity follows homeostatic rules that depend on the polarity of axo-axonic synapses.",

    "abstract": "Numerous neuroimaging studies have shown that older adults tend to activate the brain to a greater extent than younger adults during the performance of a task. This is typically interpreted as evidence for cognitive compensation. The Compensation-Related Utilisation of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) model is a highly influential model of compensation, and states that increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in older adults compared to younger adults should reverse at higher levels of task difficulty. We tested the CRUNCH model using a visuospatial working memory paradigm, and found that fMRI activity in older vs. younger adults was in the opposite direction to that predicted by the model. Given that the CRUNCH model is the predominant model of compensation, this result was surprising. We followed up our results with a systematic review of the CRUNCH in healthy ageing literature using p-curve analysis. We find evidence for selective reporting, or the  file-drawer problem, in the cognitive compensation literature. Further experimental work is required to validate the CRUNCH model in cognitive ageing.\\n\\nAbbreviationsCRUNCH: compensation-related utilisation of neural circuits hypothesis; fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging\\n\\nHighlights- CRUNCH is the leading model of cognitive compensation in ageing\\n- We find fMRI activity in old vs. young adults in opposite direction predicted by CRUNCH\\n- We report quantitative evidence of selective reporting in CRUNCH literature",

    "abstract": "While the function of dopamine in subcortical structures is largely limited to reward and movement, dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical to a multitude of temporally and functionally diverse processes such as attention, working memory, behavioral flexibility, action selection, and stress adaptation. How does dopamine influence PFC computation of multiple temporally diverse functions? Here we find causation between sustained and burst patterns of phasic dopamine neuron activation and contemporaneous modulation of PFC neuronal activity at multiple spatio-temporal scales. These include a multidirectional and weak impact on individual PFC neuron rate activity and a robust influence on coordinated ensemble activity, gamma oscillations, and gamma-theta coupling that persisted for minutes. In addition, PFC network responses to burst pattern of dopamine firing were selectively strengthened in behaviorally active states. Thus, dopamine modulation of PFC is spatiotemporally diverse and is dictated by the pattern of dopamine neuron activation and behavioral state. These findings provide insight on the multiplex pattern of modulation by dopamine that may influence PFC computation of temporally diverse functions.",

    "abstract": "Activation of most primary sensory neurons results in transduction currents that are carried by cations. One notable exception is the vertebrate olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), where the transduction current is carried largely by the anion Cl-. However, it remains unclear why ORNs use an anionic current for signal amplification. We have sought to provide clarification on this topic by studying the so far neglected dynamics of Na+, Ca2+, K+ and Cl- in the small space of olfactory cilia during an odorant response. Using computational modeling and simulations we compared the outcomes of signal amplification based on either Cl- or Na+ currents. We found that amplification produced by Na+ influx instead of a Cl- efflux is problematic due to several reasons: First, the Na+ current amplitude varies greatly depending on mucosal ion concentration changes. Second, a Na+ current leads to a large increase in the ciliary Na+ concentration during an odorant response. This increase inhibits and even reverses Ca2+ clearance by Na+/Ca2+/K+ exchange, which is essential for response termination. Finally, a Na+ current increases the ciliary osmotic pressure, which could cause swelling to damage the cilia. By contrast, a transduction pathway based on Cl- efflux circumvents these problems and renders the odorant response robust and reliable.",

    "abstract": "Alcoholism and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity individually promote insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in clinical populations, increasing risk for metabolic diseases. Conversely, animal studies, typically utilizing forced/continuous alcohol (EtOH) access, tend to show that EtOH intake mitigates HFD-induced effects on insulin and glucose function, while HFD decreases voluntary EtOH intake in continuous access models. However, the impact of HFD on intermittent EtOH intake and resultant changes to metabolic function are not well characterized. The present studies sought to determine if HFD alters EtOH intake in male C57Bl/6J mice given differing two-bottle choice EtOH access schedules, and to assess resultant impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. In the first experiment, mice had Unlimited Access EtOH (UAE)+HFD (n=15; HFD=60% calories from fat, 10% EtOH v/v, ad libitum) or UAE+Chow (n=15; control diet=16% calories from fat, ad libitum) for 6 weeks. UAE+HFD mice had lower EtOH preference, consumed significantly less EtOH, and were insulin resistant and hyperglycemic compared with UAE+Chow mice. In the second experiment, mice had Limited Access EtOH (LAE, 4 hrs/d; 3 d/wk)+HFD (n=15) or LAE+Chow (n=15) with increasing EtOH concentrations (10%, 15%, 20%). LAE+HFD mice had no difference in total EtOH consumption compared to LAE+Chow mice, but exhibited hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. In the third experiment, mice had intermittent HFD access (single 24 hr session/week) with limited access to EtOH (iHFD-E, 4hrs/d; 4 d/wk) (n=10). iHFD-E mice displayed binge eating behaviors and consumed significantly more EtOH than mice given ad libitum chow or HFD, suggesting transfer of binge eating to binge drinking behaviors. Although iHFD-E mice did not have significantly altered body composition, they developed insulin insensitivity and glucose intolerance. These results suggest that access schedules determine the impact of HFD on EtOH consumption and resultant metabolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The postnatal period is critical for broiler chicks as they are exposed to, possibly stressful, environmental changes in the hatchery and during transportation to the rearing houses. The ability of broiler chicks to spontaneously drink essential oils (EO) to mitigate the effects of a negative postnatal experience was tested. Chicks were either immediately placed in the rearing facility (C group), or subjected to a 24h-delay period before their placement (D group), mimicking the possible transportation delay in commercial conditions.\\n\\nIn experiment 1, each group had access to either water only or to water and one EO (cardamom, marjoram or verbena) from D1 to D13. The verbena EO intake was higher in the D group than in the C group from D1 to D6 and the cardamom EO intake was lower in the D group than in the C group from D6 to D13.\\n\\nIn experiment 2, half of the groups had access to water only and the other half was offered water and the 3 EO simultaneously. The EO were not differently chosen by chicks between D and C groups except a lower cardamom EO intake was observed in the D group than in the C group from D6 to D12. The delayed placement of the D group reduced chicken growth until 34 days of age and temporarily increased the feed conversion ratio, but did not affect their welfare or the prevalence of health disorders. The EO intake did not allow the chicks in the D group to overcome the growth reduction, but did overcome the reduction in Pectoralis major muscle yield. In conclusion, chicks are able to make spontaneous choices regarding EO intake according to their postnatal experience when EO are presented individually, but in our experimental design, they were not when EO were simultaneously presented. The EO intake only partially mitigated the decrease in chicken performance after the negative postnatal experience.",

    "abstract": "Animals, including humans, are risk-averse in most contexts. A major exception is the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), which is robustly risk-seeking. Macaques  unique preferences may reflect their unique evolutionary history. Alternatively, they may derive from elements of task design associated with the demands of physiological recording, the source of nearly all macaque risk preference data. To disambiguate these possibilities we assessed macaques risk attitudes in a somewhat more naturalistic environment: subjects foraged at four feeding stations in a large enclosure. Stations (i.e. patches) provided either stochastically or non-stochastically depleting rewards. Subjects patch residence times were longer at safe than at risky stations, indicating a preference for safe options. This preference was not attributable to a win-stay-lose-shift heuristic. These findings highlight the lability of risk attitudes in macaques and support the hypothesis that observed differences between macaques and other species are ephemeral, not evolved.",

    "abstract": "During the history of range expansion, the populations encounter with variety of environments. They respond to the local environments by modifying the mutually interacting traits. Therefore, to understand the whole life history of the populations, it is ideal to capture the history of their range expansion with reference to the series of surrounding environments and to infer the coadaptation of the multiple traits. Toward this end, we provide an exploratory analysis based on the features of populations: site frequency spectra of populations, population-specific FST, association between genes and environments, positive selections on traits mapped on the admixture graph, and GWAS results. Correspondence analysis of genes, environments, and traits provides a birds-eye view of the history of population differentiation and range expansion and various types of environmental selections at the times. Principal component analysis of the estimated trait-specific polygenic adaptations mapped on the admixture graph enables to understand the coadaptation of multiple traits. The potential usefulness was confirmed by analyzing a public dataset of wild poplar in northwestern America. In response to the northern cold temperature and longer daylength, the populations increased the photosynthetic activity and nutrient use efficiency at the expense of the risk of pathogen invasion, and in response to warm temperature, they increased the growth. At higher altitude, they shifted the maximum activity to earlier period in spring to reduce the activity in dry summer.

Yet, dispersal via larval propagules could aid reef recovery by supplying new settlers and enabling the spread of adaptive variation among regions. Documenting and predicting spatial connections arising from planktonic larval dispersal in marine species, however, remains a formidable challenge.\\n\\nLocationThe Great Barrier Reef, Australia\\n\\nMethodsContemporary biophysical larval dispersal models were used to predict longdistance multigenerational connections for two common and foundational coral species (Acropora tenuis and Acropora millepora). Spatially extensive genetic surveys allowed us to infer signatures of asymmetric dispersal for these species and evaluate concordance against expectations from biophysical models using coalescent genetic simulations, directions of inferred gene flow, and spatial eigenvector modelling.\\n\\nResultsAt long distances, biophysical models predicted a preponderance of north to south connections and genetic results matched these expectations: coalescent genetic simulations rejected an alternative scenario of historical isolation; the strongest signals of inferred gene flow were from north to south; and asymmetric eigenvectors derived from north to south connections in the biophysical models were significantly better predictors of spatial genetic patterns than eigenvectors derived from symmetric null spatial models.\\n\\nMain conclusionsResults are consistent with biophysical dispersal models yielding approximate summaries of past multigenerational gene flow conditioned upon directionality of connections. For A. tenuis and A. millepora, northern and central reefs have been important sources to downstream southern reefs over the recent evolutionary past and should continue to provide southward gene flow. Endemic genetic diversity of southern reefs suggests substantial local recruitment and lack of long distance gene flow from south to north.",

    "abstract": "To better predict how populations and communities respond to climatic temperature variation, it is necessary to understand how the shape of the response of fitness-related traits to temperature evolves (the thermal performance curve). Currently, there is disagreement about the extent to which the evolution of thermal performance curves is constrained. One school of thought has argued for the prevalence of thermodynamic constraints through enzyme kinetics, whereas another argues that adaptation can--at least partly--overcome such constraints. To shed further light on this debate, we perform a phylogenetic meta-analysis of the thermal performance curves of growth rate of phytoplankton--a globally important functional group--, controlling for environmental effects (habitat type and thermal regime). We find that thermodynamic constraints have a minor influence on the shape of the curve. In particular, we detect a very weak increase of maximum performance with the temperature at which the curve peaks, suggesting a weak \"hotter-is-better\" constraint. Also, instead of a constant thermal sensitivity of growth across species, as might be expected from strong constraints, we find that all aspects of the thermal performance curve evolve along the phylogeny. Our results suggest that phytoplankton thermal performance curves adapt to thermal environments largely in the absence of hard thermodynamic constraints.",

    "abstract": "DNA diversity varies across the genome of many species. Variation in diversity across a genome might arise for one of three reasons; regional variation in the mutation rate, selection and biased gene conversion. We show that both non-coding and non-synonymous diversity are correlated to a measure of the mutation rate, the recombination rate and the density of conserved sequences in 50KB windows across the genomes of humans and non-human homininae. We show these patterns persist even when we restrict our analysis to GC-conservative mutations, demonstrating that the patterns are not driven by biased gene conversion. The positive correlation between diversity and our measure of the mutation rate seems to be largely a direct consequence of regions with higher mutation rates having more diversity. However, the positive correlation with recombination rate and the negative correlation with the density of conserved sequences suggests that selection at linked sites affect levels of diversity. This is supported by the observation that the ratio of the number of non-synonymous to non-coding polymorphisms is negatively correlated to a measure of the effective population size across the genome. Furthermore, we find evidence that these genomic variables are better predictors of non-coding diversity in large homininae populations than in small populations, after accounting for statistical power. This is consistent with genetic drift decreasing the impact of selection at linked sites in small populations. In conclusion, our comparative analyses describe for the first time how recombination rate, gene density, mutation rate and genetic drift interact to produce the patterns of DNA diversity that we observe along and between homininae genomes.",

Suicidality describes a broad clinical spectrum of thoughts and behaviours, some of which are common in the general population.\\n\\nMethods: UK Biobank recruited [~]0{middle dot}5 million middle age individuals from the UK, of whom 157,000 completed an assessment of suicidality. Mutually exclusive groups were assessed in an ordinal genome-wide association study of suicidality:  no suicidality controls (N=83,557);  thoughts that life was not worth living (N=21,063);  ever contemplated self-harm (N=13,038);  an act of deliberate self-harm in the past (N=2,498); and  a previous suicide attempt (N=2,666). Linkage of UK Biobank to death certification records identified a small sub-group of  completed suicide (N=137).\\n\\nOutcomes: We identified three novel genome-wide significant loci for suicidality (on Chromosomes 9, 11 and 13) and moderate-to-strong genetic correlations between suicidality and a range of psychiatric disorders, most notably depression (rg 0{middle dot}81). Higher polygenic risk scores for suicidality were associated with increased risk of completed suicide relative to controls in an independent sub-group (N=137 vs N=5,330, OR 1{middle dot}23, 95%CI 1{middle dot}06 to 1{middle dot}41, p=0.03).

    "abstract": "Hierarchical predictive coding is an influential model of cortical organization, in which sequential hierarchical layers are connected by feedback connections carrying predictions, as well as feedforward connections carrying prediction errors. To date, however, predictive coding models have neglected to take into account that neural transmission itself takes time. For a time-varying stimulus, such as a moving object, this means that feedback predictions become misaligned with new sensory input. We present an extended model implementing both feed-forward and feedback extrapolation mechanisms that realigns feedback predictions to minimize prediction error. This realignment has the consequence that neural representations across all hierarchical stages become aligned in real-time. Using visual motion as an example, we show that the model is neurally plausible, that it is consistent with evidence of extrapolation mechanisms throughout the visual hierarchy, that it predicts several known motion-position illusions, and that it provides a solution to the temporal binding problem.",

    "abstract": "While it is well established that cortical morphology differs in relation to a variety of inter-individual factors, it is often characterized using estimates of volume, thickness, surface area, or gyrification. Here we developed a computational approach for estimating sulcal width and depth that relies on cortical surface reconstructions output by FreeSurfer. While other approaches for estimating sulcal morphology exist, studies often require the use of multiple brain morphology programs that have been shown to differ in their approaches to localize sulcal landmarks, yielding morphological estimates based on inconsistent boundaries. To demonstrate the approach, sulcal morphology was estimated in three large sample of adults across the lifespan, in relation to aging. A fourth sample is additionally used to estimate test-retest reliability of the approach.

    "abstract": "Social transmission of distress has been conceived of as a one-way phenomenon in which an observer catches the emotions of another. Here we use a paradigm in which an observer rat witnesses another receive electro-shocks. Bayesian model comparison and Granger causality argue against this one-way vision in favor of bidirectional information transfer: how the observer reacts to the demonstrators distress influences the behavior of the demonstrator. Intriguingly, this was true to a similar extent across highly familiar and entirely unfamiliar rats. Injecting muscimol in the anterior cingulate of observers reduced freezing in the observers and in the demonstrators receiving the shocks. That rats share the distress of unfamiliar strains is at odds with evolutionary thinking that empathy should be biased towards close individuals.

    "abstract": "Exposure to damaging levels of noise is the most common cause of hearing loss and impairs high frequency hearing in more than 15 % of adult Americans. Using mice exposed to increasing levels of noise in combination with quantitative proteomics, we tested how noise insults remodel the cochlear proteome both acutely and after a two-week recovery period. We used ABR & DPOAE recordings to define the intensity of noise exposure necessary to produce temporary or permanent threshold shifts (TTS, PTS) in young adult mice and found noise at 94 and 105 dB SPL levels for 30 minutes elicits TTS and PTS, respectively. We quantified thousands of proteins and found that noise insults cause a rapid increase rather than a decrease in the levels of many proteins involved with protein homeostasis, myelin, cytoskeletal structures, and cell junctions such as the synapse. The vast majority of proteins with increased levels immediately after noise exposure showed normal levels after two weeks of recovery. However, several proteins involved in oxidative stress and neuroprotection had significantly increased levels only after the recovery period suggesting they play in important role in regeneration. Interestingly, a small panel of mitochondrial proteins were significantly altered only in PTS conditions suggesting potential discrete protein mechanisms. Our discovery-based proteomic analysis extends the recent description of noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy and shows that noise insults drive a robust proteostasis response. These data provide a new understanding of noise sensitive proteins and may inform the development of effective preventiative strategies or therapies for NIHL.",

    "abstract": "Multistep cell fate transitions with stepwise changes of transcriptional profiles are common to many developmental, regenerative and pathological processes. The multiple intermediate cell lineage states can serve as differentiation checkpoints or branching points for channeling cells to more than one lineages. However, mechanisms underlying these transitions remain elusive. Here, we explored gene regulatory circuits that can generate multiple intermediate cellular states with stepwise modulations of transcription factors. With unbiased searching in the network topology space, we found a motif family containing a large set of networks can give rise to four attractors with the stepwise regulations of transcription factors, which limit the reversibility of three consecutive steps of the lineage transition. We found that there is an enrichment of these motifs in a transcriptional network controlling the early T cell development, and a mathematical model based on this network recapitulates multistep transitions in the early T cell lineage commitment. By calculating the energy landscape and minimum action paths for the T cell model, we quantified the stochastic dynamics of the critical factors in response to the differentiation signal with fluctuations. These results are in good agreement with experimental observations and they suggest the stable characteristics of the intermediate states in the T cell differentiation. These dynamical features may help to direct the cells to correct lineages during development. Our findings provide general design principles for multistep cell linage transitions and new insights into the early T cell development. The network motifs containing a large family of topologies can be useful for analyzing diverse biological systems with multistep transitions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe functions of cells are dynamically controlled in many biological processes including development, regeneration and disease progression. Cell fate transition, or the switch of cellular functions, often involves multiple steps. The intermediate stages of the transition provide the biological systems with the opportunities to regulate the transitions in a precise manner. These transitions are controlled by key regulatory genes of which the expression shows stepwise patterns, but how the interactions of these genes can determine the multistep processes were unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis on the design principles of gene circuits that govern multistep cell fate transition. We found a large network family with common structural features that can generate systems with the ability to control three consecutive steps of the transition. We found that this type of networks is enriched in a gene circuit controlling the development of T lymphocyte, a crucial type of immune cells. We performed mathematical modeling using this gene circuit and we recapitulated the stepwise and irreversible loss of stem cell properties of the developing T lymphocytes. Our findings can be useful to analyze a wide range of gene regulatory networks controlling multistep cell fate transitions.",

Scientific reproduction of published findings requires running computational tools on data generated by such studies, yet little attention is presently allocated to the installability and archival stability of computational software tools. Scientific journals require data and code sharing, but none currently require authors to guarantee the continuing functionality of newly published tools. We have estimated the archival stability of computational biology software tools by performing an empirical analysis of the internet presence for 36,702 omics software resources published from 2005 to 2017. We found that almost 28% of all resources are currently not accessible through URLs published in the paper they first appeared in. Among the 98 software tools selected for our installability test, 51% were deemed \\\"easy to install,\\\" and 28% of the tools failed to be installed at all due to problems in the implementation. Moreover, for papers introducing new software, we found that the number of citations significantly increased when authors provided an easy installation process. We propose for incorporation into journal policy several practical solutions for increasing the widespread installability and archival stability of published bioinformatics software.",

Regional differences in biodiversity may stem from differences in rates of speciation and dispersal and colonization times, but these hypotheses have rarely been tested simultaneously at a global scale. Here we uncovered the routes that generated hotpots of mammal and bird biodiversity by analyzing the tempo and mode of diversification and dispersal within major biogeographic realms. Hotspots in tropical realms had higher rates of speciation whereas those in temperate realms received more immigrant species from their surrounding regions. We also found that hotspots had higher spatial complexity and energy availability, providing a link between the environment and macroevolutionary history.

    "abstract": "BackgroundVirulence plasmids are critically exposed to genetic decay and loss, particularly in Pseudomonas syringae strains because of their high content of mobile genetic elements and their exploitation of environmental niches outside of the plant host. The demonstrated high plasticity and adaptability of P. syringae plasmids, involving the acquisition and loss of large DNA regions, contrasts with their usual high stability and the maintenance of key virulence genes in free living conditions. The identification of plasmid stability determinants and mechanisms will help to understand their evolution and adaptability to agroecosystems as well as to develop more efficient control measures.\\n\\nResultsWe show that the three virulence plasmids of P. syringae pv. savastanoi NCPPB 3335 contain diverse functional stability determinants, including three toxin-antitoxin systems (TA) in both pPsv48A and pPsv48C, whereas one of the two replicons of pPsv48C can confer stable inheritance by itself. Loss of pPsv48A increased by two orders of magnitude upon functional inactivation of its TA systems. However, inactivation of the TA systems from pPsv48C did not result in its curing but led to the recovery of diverse deletion derivatives. One type consisted in the deletion of an 8.3 kb fragment, with a frequency of 3.8 {+/-} 0.3 x 10-3, by recombination between two copies of MITEPsy2. Likewise, IS801 promoted the occurrence of deletions of variable size by one-ended transposition with a frequency of 5.5 {+/-} 2.1 x 10-4, 80 % of which resulted in the loss of virulence gene idi. These deletion derivatives were stably maintained in the population by replication mediated by repJ, which is adjacent to IS801. IS801 also promoted deletions in plasmid pPsv48A, either by recombination or one-ended transposition. In all cases, functional TA systems contributed significantly to reduce the occurrence of plasmid deletions in vivo.\\n\\nConclusionsVirulence plasmids from P. syringae harbour a diverse array of stability determinants with a variable contribution to plasmid persistence. Additionally, multiple TA systems favour the long-term survival and integrity of virulence plasmids, as well as the maintenance of pathogenicity genes in free-living conditions. This strategy is likely widespread amongst native plasmids of P. syringae and other bacteria.",

In the stick insect, in particular, intra- and intersegmental coordination is conveyed by these sensory signals. The rhythmic activity of the CPGs, hence of the legs, can be modified by the aforementioned sensory signals. However, the precise nature of the interaction between the CPGs and these sensory signals has remained largely unknown. Experimental methods aiming at finding out details of these interactions, often apply the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, pilocarpine in order to induce rhythmic activity in the CPGs, hence in the motoneurons of the segmental ganglia. Using this general approach, we removed the influence of sensory signals and investigated the putative connections between CPGs associated with the coxa-trochanter (CTr)-joint in the different segments (legs) in more detail. The experimental data underwent phase-difference analysis and Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). These methods can uncover the underlying coupling structure and strength between pairs of segmental ganglia (CPGs). We set up different coupling schemes (models) for DCM and compared them using Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Models with contralateral connections in each segment and ipsilateral connections on both sides, as well as the coupling from the meta- to the ipsilateral prothoracic ganglion were preferred by BMS to all other types of models tested. Moreover, the intrasegmental coupling strength in the mesothoracic ganglion was the strongest and most stable in all three ganglia.",

Using synaesthesia as a model condition, we show that even in healthy populations irrelevant non-veridical precepts exert an effect on action. By non-veridical we refer to stimulus dimensions that are only subjectively perceived to be there. Applying electrophysiological (EEG) methods, we show that although these examined peculiarities are perceptual in nature, not primarily perceptual processes underlie the effects of irrelevant non-veridical perceptions on actions. Rather, high-order processes linking perceptions and motor control in medial frontal cortices reflect the underlying mechanism how irrelevant non-veridical perceptions modulate behaviour.

We have ample knowledge which evolutionary forces may cause genomic differentiation, and several speciation models have been proposed to explain the transition from genetic to genomic differentiation. However, it is still unclear what are critical conditions enabling genomic differentiation in nature. The Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is observed as two sympatric strains that have different host-plant ranges, suggesting the possibility of ecological divergent selection. In our previous study, we observed that these two strains show genetic differentiation across the whole genome with an unprecedentedly low extent, suggesting the possibility that whole genome sequences started to be differentiated between the strains. In this study, we analyzed whole genome sequences from these two strains from Mississippi to identify critical evolutionary factors for genomic differentiation. The genomic Fst is low (0.017) while 91.3% of 10kb windows have Fst greater than 0, suggesting genome-wide differentiation with a low extent. We identified nearly 400 outliers of genetic differentiation between strains, and found that physical linkage among these outliers is not a primary cause of genomic differentiation. Fst is not significantly correlated with gene density, a proxy for the strength of selection, suggesting that a genomic reduction in migration rate dominates the extent of local genetic differentiation. Our analyses reveal that divergent selection alone is sufficient to generate genomic differentiation, and any following diversifying factors may increase the level of genetic differentiation between diverging strains in the process of speciation.",

    "abstract": "Organismal variation in dispersal ability can directly affect levels of gene flow amongst populations, therefore importantly shaping species distributions and species richness patterns. The intermediate dispersal model of biogeography (IDM) predicts that in island systems, species diversity of those lineages with an intermediate dispersal potential is the highest. We broadly test this prediction, focusing on  four-jawed spiders (genus Tetragnatha) of the Caribbean archipelago. First, we report on original sampling of this globally distributed genus with numerous widespread as well as endemic species. We then reconstruct multiple Tetragnatha phylogenies from roughly 300 individuals delineated into 54 putative species. Our results support the monophyly of the four-jawed spiders but reject the monophyly of those lineages that reach the Caribbean, where we find low levels of endemism yet high diversity within Tetragnatha. The chronogram detects a potential early overwater colonization of the Caribbean, and in combination with reconstructed biogeographic history, refutes the possibility of ancient vicariant origins of Caribbean Tetragnatha as well as the GAARlandia land-bridge scenario. Instead, biogeographic results hypothesize multiple colonization events to, and from the Caribbean since mid-Eocene to late-Miocene. Tetragnatha seems unique among the arachnids explored so far in comprising some species that are excellent dispersers, and others that are not, perhaps having secondarily lost this dispersal propensity. A direct test of the IDM would require consideration of three categories of dispersers. However, four-jawed spiders do not fit one of these three a priori definitions, but rather represent a more complex combination of attributes of a  dynamic disperser.",

Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (rg=0.57, p=4.6x10-8), breast and ovarian cancer (rg=0.24, p=7x10-5), breast and lung cancer (rg=0.18, p=1.5x10-6) and breast and colorectal cancer (rg=0.15, p=1.1x10-4). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of the predictable breakdown of proteins and amino acids in ancient biominerals enables age estimation over the Quaternary. We postulate that enamel is a suitable biomineral for the long-term survival of endogenous amino acids. Analysis of multiple amino acids for geochronological studies is typically achieved using a RP-HPLC method. However, the low concentrations of amino acids coupled with high concentrations of inorganic species make accurate determination of amino concentrations challenging. We have developed a method for the routine preparation of multiple enamel samples using biphasic separation. Furthermore, we have shown that amino acids that exhibit effectively closed system behaviour can be isolated from enamel through an exposure time of 72 h to bleach. Elevated temperature experiments investigating the processes of intra-crystalline protein degradation (IcPD) do not appear to match the patterns from fossil samples, reinforcing the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of protein degradation. This novel preparative method isolates intra-crystalline amino acids suitable for the development of mammalian geochronologies based on enamel protein degradation. The lower rates of racemisation in enamel (cf. Bithynia opercula) suggest that the enamel AAR may be able to be used as a relative dating technique over time scales > 2.8 Ma. Enamel AAR has the potential to estimate the age of mammalian remains past the limit of all other current direct dating methods, providing an invaluable tool for geochronological studies.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing is revolutionising infectious disease epidemiology, providing a huge step forward in sensitivity and specificity over more traditional molecular typing techniques. However, the complexity of genome data often means that its analysis and interpretation requires high-performance compute infrastructure and dedicated bioinformatics support. Furthermore, current methods have limitations that can differ between analyses and are often opaque to the user, and their reliance on multiple external dependencies makes reproducibility difficult. Here I introduce SKA, a toolkit for analysis of genome sequence data from closely-related, small, haploid genomes. SKA uses split kmers to rapidly identify variation between genome sequences, making it possible to analyse hundreds of genomes on a standard home computer. Tests on publicly available simulated and real-life data show that SKA is both faster and more efficient than the gold standard methods used today while retaining similar levels of accuracy for epidemiological purposes. SKA can take raw read data or genome assemblies as input and calculate pairwise distances, create single linkage clusters and align genomes to a reference genome or using a reference-free approach. SKA requires few decisions to be made by the user, which, along with its computational efficiency, allows genome analysis to become accessible to those with only basic bioinformatics training. The limitations of SKA are also far more transparent than for current approaches, and future improvements to mitigate these limitations are possible. Overall, SKA is a powerful addition to the armoury of the genomic epidemiologist. SKA source code is available from Github (https://github.com/simonrharris/SKA).",

We hypothesize that inhibition commands originate, in part, from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We recorded activity of OFC neurons in macaques performing a stop signal task. Decoding analyses revealed a clear difference in ensemble responses that distinguish successful from failed inhibition that begins after the stop signal and before the stop signal reaction time. We also found a different and unrelated ensemble pattern that distinguishes successful from failed stopping before the beginning of the trial. These signals were distinct from, and orthogonal to, value encoding, which was also observed in these neurons. The timing of the early and late signals was, respectively, consistent with the idea that OFC contributes both proactively and reactively to inhibition. These results support the view, inspired by anatomy, that OFC gathers diverse sensory inputs to compute early-stage executive signals.",

But these complex elements in which outermost LTRs had not the most highly homologous cant be explained. We propose a new model that the homologous recombination of two new different normal LTR retrotransposon elements in the same family can occur before their integration to the rice genome. The model can explain at least fourteen complex retrotransposons formations. We also find that normal LTR retrotransposons can swap their LTRs to generate abnormal LTR retrotransposons in which LTRs are different because of homologous recombination before their integration to the genome.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian embryos, cortical interneurons travel long distances among complex three-dimensional tissues before integrating into cortical circuits. Several molecular guiding cues involved in this migration process have been identified, but the influence of physical parameters remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have investigated in vitro the influence of the topography of the microenvironment on the migration of primary cortical interneurons released from mouse embryonic explants.\\n\\nWe found that arrays of 10 m-sized PDMS micro-pillars, either round or square, influenced both the morphology and the migratory behavior of interneurons. Strikingly, most interneurons exhibited a single and long leading process oriented along the diagonals of the square pillared array, whereas leading processes of interneurons migrating in-between round pillars were shorter, often branched and oriented in all available directions. Accordingly, dynamic studies revealed that growth cone divisions were twice more frequent in round than in square pillars. Both soma and leading process tips presented forward directed movements within square pillars, contrasting with the erratic trajectories and more dynamic movements observed among round pillars. In support of these observations, long interneurons migrating in square pillars displayed tight bundles of stable microtubules aligned in the direction of migration.\\n\\nOverall, our results show that micron-sized topography provides global spatial constraints promoting the establishment of two different morphological and migratory states. Remarkably, both states belong to the natural range of migratory behaviors of cortical interneurons, highlighting the potential importance of topographical cues in the guidance of these embryonic neurons, and more generally in brain development.",

We have applied the RED scheme to weighted ensemble simulations of a variety of rare-event processes that range in complexity: residue-level simulations of protein conformational switching, atomistic simulations of Na+/Cl- association in explicit solvent, and atomistic simulations of protein-protein association in explicit solvent. Rate constants were estimated with up to 50% greater efficiency than the original weighted ensemble scheme. Importantly, our method accounts for systematic error when using data from the entire simulation. The RED scheme is relevant to any simulation strategy that involves unbiased trajectories of similar length to the most probable event duration, including weighted ensemble, milestoning, and standard simulations as well as the construction of Markov state models.",

It requires the kinetochores on duplicated chromosomes to biorient, attaching to microtubules from opposite poles of the cell. Bioriented attachments come under tension, while incorrect attachments lack tension and must be destabilized. A well-studied error correction pathway is mediated by the Aurora B kinase, which destabilizes low tension-bearing attachments. We recently discovered that in vitro, kinetochores display an additional intrinsic tension-sensing pathway that utilizes Stu2. This pathways contribution to error correction in cells, however, was unknown. Here, we identify a Stu2 mutant that abolishes its kinetochore function and show that it causes error correction defects in vivo. We also show that this intrinsic tension-sensing pathway functions in concert with the Aurora B-mediated pathway.

We show that APEX-Seq can resolve the localization of RNAs within the cell and determine their enrichment or depletion near key RNA-binding proteins. Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by APEX-Seq, with the spatial proteome determined by APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS) provides new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active mRNAs, as well as exposing unanticipated complexity in stress granule composition, and provides a powerful and general approach to explore the spatial environment of macromolecules.",

Cue cells accounted for a large fraction of unidentified MEC cells. They exhibited firing fields only near visual cues during virtual navigation and spatially stable activity during navigation in a real arena. Cue cells responses occurred in sequences repeated at each cue and were likely driven by visual inputs. In layers 2/3 of the MEC, cue cells formed clusters.
