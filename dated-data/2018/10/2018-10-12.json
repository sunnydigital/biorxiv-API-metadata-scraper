    "abstract": "We present a model-based method for inferring full-brain neural activity at millimeter-scale spatial resolutions and millisecond-scale temporal resolutions using standard human intracranial recordings. Our approach makes the simplifying assumptions that different peoples brains exhibit similar correlational structure, and that activity and correlation patterns vary smoothly over space. One can then ask, for an arbitrary individuals brain: given recordings from a limited set of locations in that individuals brain, along with the observed spatial correlations learned from other peoples recordings, how much can be inferred about ongoing activity at other locations throughout that individuals brain? We show that our approach generalizes across people and tasks, thereby providing a person- and task-general means of inferring high spatiotemporal resolution full-brain neural dynamics from standard low-density intracranial recordings.",

    "abstract": "Whether humans are optimal decision makers is still a debated issue in the realm of perceptual decisions. Taking advantage of the direct link between an optimal decision-making and the confidence in that decision, we offer a new dual-decisions method of inferring such confidence without asking for its explicit valuation. Our method circumvents the well-known miscalibration issue with explicit confidence reports as well as the specification of the cost-function required by  opt-out or post-decision wagering methods. We show that observers inferred confidence in their first decision and its use in a subsequent decision (conditioned upon the correctness of the first) fall short of both the ideal Bayesian strategy, as well as of an under-sampling approximation or a modified Bayesian strategy augmented with an additional bias term to accommodate global miscalibration of confidence. The observed data are instead significantly better fitted by a model positing that observers use only few confidence levels or states, at odds with the continuous confidence function of stimulus level prescribed by a normative behavior. These findings question the validity of normative-Bayesian accounts of subjective confidence and metaperceptual judgments.",

    "abstract": "The Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform offers near real time analysis of DNA reads as they are generated, which makes the device attractive for in-field or clinical deployment, e.g. rapid diagnostics. We used the MinION platform for shotgun metagenomic sequencing and analysis of gut-associated microbial communities; firstly, we used a 20-species human microbiota mock community to demonstrate how Nanopore metagenomic sequence data can be reliably and rapidly classified. Secondly, we profiled faecal microbiomes from preterm infants at increased risk of necrotising enterocolitis and sepsis. In single patient time course, we captured the diversity of the immature gut microbiota and observed how its complexity changes over time in response to interventions, i.e. probiotic, antibiotics and episodes of suspected sepsis. Finally, we performed  real-time runs from sample to analysis using faecal samples of critically ill infants and of healthy infants receiving probiotic supplementation. Real-time analysis was facilitated by our new NanoOK RT software package which analysed sequences as they were generated. We reliably identified potentially pathogenic taxa (i.e. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and their corresponding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene profiles within as little as one hour of sequencing. Antibiotic treatment decisions may be rapidly modified in response to these AMR profiles, which we validated using pathogen isolation, whole genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline can process clinical samples to a rich dataset able to inform tailored patient antimicrobial treatment in less than 5 hours.",

    "abstract": "Lens-free digital in-line holography (LDIH) is a promising microscopic tool that overcomes several drawbacks (e.g., limited field of view) of traditional lens-based microcopy. However, extensive computation is required to reconstruct object images from the complex diffraction patterns produced by LDIH, which limits LDIH utility for point-of-care applications, particularly in resource limited settings. Here, we describe a deep transfer learning (DTL) based approach to process LDIH images in the context of cellular analyses. Specifically, we captured holograms of cells labeled with molecular-specific microbeads and trained neural networks to classify these holograms without reconstruction. Using raw holograms as input, the trained networks were able to classify individual cells according to the number of cell-bound microbeads. The DTL-based approach including a VGG19 pretrained network showed robust performance even with noisy experimental data. Combined with the developed DTL approach, LDIH could be realized as a low-cost, portable tool for point-of-care diagnostics.",

In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes, using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, LDL cholesterol and Crohns disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene, as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some of which are unlikely to be causal, because they share the same variants as eQTLs. We illustrate that TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization when using expression data from tissues or cell types that are less related to the trait, due to substantial variation in both expression levels and eQTL strengths across cell types. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes at GWAS loci more accurately than simple baselines based on proximity to lead GWAS variant and expression in trait-related tissue. We discuss current strategies and future opportunities for improving the performance of TWAS for causal gene prioritization. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using expression variation across individuals to determine causal genes at GWAS loci and provide guidelines and best practices when using TWAS to prioritize candidate causal genes.",

    "abstract": "Specialized epithelia produce apical matrices with distinctive topographies by enigmatic mechanisms. Here, we describe a holistic mechanism that integrates cortical actomyosin dynamics with apical matrix remodeling to pattern C. elegans cuticles. Therein, axial AFBs appear near the surface of lateral epidermal syncytia during an interval of transverse apical constriction (AC). AC gives rise to three temporary semi-circular cellular protrusions beneath a provisional matrix (sheath). In turn, sheath components pattern durable ridges along the midline of adult cuticles (alae). We propose that forces generated by AC are relayed via the sheath to sculpt the the acellular adult cuticle manifest several hours later. Furthermore, we provide evidence that circumferential actin filament bundles (CFBs) near the surface of the adjacent syncytia (hyp7) are largely dispensable for the propagation of annular cuticle structures from one larval stage to the next. Rather, the temporary CFBs extend from actin bundles overlying body wall muscles, which are situated between Ce. hemidesmosomes. Similar mechanisms may contribute to the morphogenesis of integumentary organs in higher metazoans.",

    "abstract": "Chirality is a property of asymmetry between an object and its mirror image. Most biomolecules and cells are intrinsically chiral. Whether cellular chirality can be transferred to asymmetry at the tissue scale remains an unresolved issue. This question is particularly relevant in the left-right organizer (LRO), where cilia motility and chiral flow are thought to be the main drivers of left-right axis symmetry breaking. Here, we built a quantitative approach based on live imaging to set apart the contributions of various pathways to the spatial orientation of cilia in the Kupffers vesicle (KV, zebrafish LRO). We found that cilia populating the zebrafish LRO display an asymmetric orientation between the right and left side of the LRO. Cilia orientations, therefore, give the KV cells a sense of chirality which is different from the chirality of cilia rotation. Surprisingly, we found this asymmetry does not depend on the left-right signalling pathway or flow. Furthermore, we show the establishment of the chirality is dynamic and depends on planar cell polarity. Together, this work identifies a different type of asymmetry in the LRO and sheds light on the complexity of chirality genesis in developing tissues.",

    "abstract": "Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is an autoinflammatory bone disease. While some patients exhibit bone lesions at single sites, most patients develop chronically active or recurrent bone inflammation at multiple sites, and are then diagnosed with recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Chronic multifocal osteomyelitis (CMO) mice develop IL-1{beta}-driven sterile bone lesions reminscent of severe CRMO. Mechanistically, CMO disease arises due to loss of PSTPIP2, a negative regulator of macrophages, osteoclasts and neutrophils. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential involvement of mast cells in CMO/CRMO disease pathophysiology. Here, we show that mast cells accumulate in the inflamed tissues from CMO mice, and mast cell protease Mcpt1 was detected in the peripheral blood. The role of mast cells in CMO disease was investigated using a transgenic model of connective tissue mast cell depletion (Mcpt5-Cre:Rosa26-Stopfl/fl-DTa) that was crossed with CMO mice. The resulting CMO/MC-mice showed a significant delay in disease onset compared to age-matched CMO mice. At 5-6 months of age, CMO/MC- mice had fewer bone lesions and immune infiltration in the popliteal lymph nodes that drain the affected tail and paw tissues. To test the relevance of mast cells to human CRMO, we tested serum samples from a cohort of healthy controls or CRMO patients at diagnosis. Interestingly, mast cell chymase was elevated in CRMO patients as well as patients with oligoclonal juvenile arthritis. Tryptase-positive mast cells were also detected in bone lesions from CRMO patients as well as patients with bacterial osteomyelitis. Taken together, our results identify mast cells as cellular contributors to bone inflammation in CMO/CRMO. Observations of this study promise potential for mast cells and derived mediators as future biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Amphipyrinae have long been a catchall taxon for Noctuidae, with most members lacking discernible morphological synapomorphies that would allow their assignment to one of the many readily diagnosable noctuid subfamilies. Here data from seven gene regions (>5,500 base pairs) for more than 120 noctuid genera are used to infer a phylogeny for Amphipyrinae and related subfamilies. Sequence data for 57 amphipyrine genera--most represented by the type species of the genus--are examined. Presented here are: the first large-scale molecular phylogenetic study of Amphipyrinae and largest molecular phylogeny of Noctuidae to date; several proposed nomenclatural changes for well supported results; and the identification of areas of noctuid phylogeny where greater taxon sampling and/or genomic-scale data are needed. Adult and larval morphology, along with life history traits, for taxonomic groupings most relevant to the results are discussed. Amphipyrinae are significantly redefined; many former amphipyrines, excluded as a result of these analyses, are reassigned to other noctuid subfamily-level taxa. Four genera, Chamaeclea Grote, Heminocloa Barnes & Benjamin, Hemioslaria Barnes & Benjamin, and Thurberiphaga Dyar are transferred to the tribe Chamaecleini Keegan & Wagner New Tribe in Acontiinae. Stiriina is elevated to Stiriinae Revised Status, Grotellina is elevated to Grotellinae Revised Status, and Annaphilina is elevated to Annaphilini Revised Status.

While much is known about how Piezo1 responds to external forces, its response to internal, cell-generated forces remains poorly understood. Here, using measurements of endogenous Piezo1 activity and traction forces in native cellular conditions, we show that actomyosin-based cellular traction forces generate spatially-restricted Ca2+ flickers in the absence of externally-applied mechanical forces. Although Piezo1 channels diffuse readily in the plasma membrane and are widely distributed across the cell, their flicker activity is enriched in regions proximal to force-producing adhesions. The mechanical force that activates Piezo1 arises from Myosin II phosphorylation by Myosin Light Chain Kinase. We propose that Piezo1 Ca2+ flickers allow spatial segregation of mechanotransduction events, and that diffusion allows channel molecules to efficiently respond to transient, local mechanical stimuli.",

However, few studies attempted to investigate the dynamics of inferred models in neuroscience, and none, to our knowledge, at the network level. We introduce a principled modification of a widely used generalized linear model (GLM), and learn its structural and dynamic parameters from in-vitro spike data. The spontaneous activity of the new model captures prominent features of the non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network, where the reference GLM largely fails, and also reflects fine-grained spatio-temporal dynamical features. Two ingredients were key for success. The first is a saturating transfer function: beyond its biological plausibility, it limits the neurons information transfer, improving robustness against endogenous and external noise. The second is a super-Poisson spikes generative mechanism; it accounts for the undersampling of the network, and allows the model neuron to flexibly incorporate the observed activity fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Spinal motor axons traverse large distances to innervate target muscles, thus requiring local control of cellular events for proper functioning. To interrogate axon-specific processes we developed Axon-seq, a refined method incorporating microfluidics, RNA-seq and bioinformatic-QC. We show that the axonal transcriptome is distinct from somas and contains fewer genes. We identified 3,500-5,000 transcripts in mouse and human stem cell-derived spinal motor axons, most of which are required for oxidative energy production and ribogenesis. Axons contained transcription factor mRNAs, e.g. Ybx1, with implications for local functions. As motor axons degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we investigated their response to the SOD1G93A mutation, identifying 121 ALS-dysregulated transcripts. Several of these are implicated in axonal function, including Nrp1, Dbn1 and Nek1, a known ALS-causing gene. In conclusion, Axon-seq provides an improved method for RNA-seq of axons, increasing our understanding of peripheral axon biology and identifying novel therapeutic targets in motor neuron disease.",

Here, we focus on the CRISPR immune strategy and develop a phylogenetically-corrected machine learning approach to build a predictive model of CRISPR incidence using data on over 100 traits across over 2600 species. We discover a strong but hitherto-unknown negative interaction between CRISPR and aerobicity, which we hypothesize may result from interference between CRISPR associated proteins and non-homologous end-joining DNA repair due to oxidative stress. Our predictive model also quantitatively confirms previous observations of an association between CRISPR and temperature.

    "abstract": "Despite continual renewal and damages, a multicellular organism is able to maintain its complex morphology. How is this stability compatible with the complexity and diversity of living forms? Looking for answers at protein level may be limiting as diverging protein sequences can result in similar morphologies. Inspired by the progressive role of apical-basal and planar cell polarity in development, we propose that stability, complexity, and diversity are emergent properties in populations of proliferating polarized cells. We support our hypothesis by a theoretical approach, developed to effectively capture both types of polar cell adhesions. When applied to specific cases of development gastrulation and the origins of folds and tubes our theoretical tool suggests experimentally testable predictions pointing to the strength of polar adhesion, restricted directions of cell polarities, and the rate of cell proliferation to be major determinants of morphological diversity and stability.",

    "abstract": "Organisms can affect one anothers phenotypes when they socially interact. Indirect genetic effects occur when an individuals phenotype is affected by genes expressed in another individual. These heritable effects can enhance or reduce adaptive potential, thereby accelerating or reversing evolutionary change. Quantifying these social effects is therefore crucial for our understanding of evolution, yet estimates of indirect genetic effects in wild animals are limited to dyadic interactions. We estimated indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and their covariance with direct effects, for the date of spring breeding in North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) living in an array of territories of varying spatial proximity. Additionally, we estimated variance parameters and the strength of selection at low and high population densities. Social effects of neighbours on the date of spring breeding were weak at low, but stronger at high population densities. Indirect phenotypic effects accounted for a larger amount of variation in the date of breeding than direct differences among-individuals, although the genetic component to these indirect effects was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the estimated effect size was large enough to suggest that indirect genetic effects could alter evolutionary change, resulting in less change at high densities despite stronger selection. Despite the difficulty in estimating them precisely, indirect genetic effects have clear potential to alter evolutionary trajectories in any natural systems where organisms interact.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal confirmation of NGS-detected germline variants has been standard practice, although published studies have suggested that confirmation of the highest quality calls may not always be necessary. The key question is how laboratories can establish criteria that consistently identify those NGS calls that require confirmation. Most prior studies addressing this question have limitations: These studies are generally small, omit statistical justification, and explore limited aspects of the underlying data. The rigorous definition of criteria that separate high-accuracy NGS calls from those that may or may not be true remains a critical issue.\\n\\nWe analyzed five reference samples and over 80,000 patient specimens from two laboratories. We examined quality metrics for approximately 200,000 NGS calls with orthogonal data, including 1662 false positives. A classification algorithm used these data to identify a battery of criteria that flag 100% of false positives as requiring confirmation (CI lower bound: 98.5-99.8% depending on variant type) while minimizing the number of flagged true positives. These criteria identify false positives that the previously published criteria miss. Sampling analysis showed that smaller datasets resulted in less effective criteria.\\n\\nOur methodology for determining test and laboratory-specific criteria can be generalized into a practical approach that can be used by many laboratories to help reduce the cost and time burden of confirmation without impacting clinical accuracy.",

We developed a sensory-driven adaptation protocol for reflexive whisker protraction and recorded Purkinje cell activity from crus 1 and 2 of awake mice. Before training, simple spikes of individual Purkinje cells correlated during reflexive protraction with the whisker position without lead or lag. After training, simple spikes and whisker protractions were both enhanced with the spiking activity now leading the behavioral response. Neuronal and behavior changes did not occur in two cell-specific mouse models with impaired long-term potentiation at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses. Consistent with cerebellar plasticity rules, increased simple spike activity was prominent in cells with low complex spike response probability. Thus, potentiation at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses may contribute to reflex adaptation and enable expression of cerebellar learning through increases in simple spike activity.\\n\\nImpact statementRomano et al. show that expression of cerebellar whisker learning can be mediated by increases in simple spike activity, depending on LTP induction at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses.",

Likelihood based test statistics applied to pooled population sequencing data suggest parallel evolution of 138 polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. This number is reduced by orders of magnitude from previous studies (thousands or tens of thousands), owing to differences in both experimental design and statistical analysis. Whole genome simulations calibrated from several Drosophila genetic datasets support the contention that the observed genome-wide response could be generated by as few as 30 loci under strong directional selection, with a corresponding hitch-hiking effect. Finally, the SNPs that showed strong parallel evolution in the novel laboratory environment exhibit an (initial) allele frequency spectrum indicative of balancing in nature.

This predicts greater similarity of mutation rates and the tempo of molecular evolution between direct ancestors and descendants, resulting in autocorrelation of evolutionary rates within lineages in the tree of life. Surprisingly, molecular sequence data have not confirmed this expectation, possibly because available methods lack power to detect autocorrelated rates. Here we present a machine learning method to detect the presence evolutionary rate autocorrelation in large phylogenies. The new method is computationally efficient and performs better than the available state-of-the-art methods. Application of the new method reveals extensive rate autocorrelation in DNA and amino acid sequence evolution of mammals, birds, insects, metazoans, plants, fungi, and prokaryotes. Therefore, rate autocorrelation is a common phenomenon throughout the tree of life. These findings suggest concordance between molecular and non-molecular evolutionary patterns and will foster unbiased and precise dating of the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Genetic covariances represent a combination of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium, shaped by the populations history. Observed genetic covariance is most often interpreted in pleiotropic terms. In particular, functional constraints restricting which phenotypes are physically possible can lead to a stable G matrix with high genetic variance in fitness-associated traits and high pleiotropic negative covariance along the phenotypic curve of constraint. In contrast, population genetic models of relative fitness assume endless adaptation without constraint, through a series of selective sweeps that are well described by recent traveling wave models. We describe the implications of such population genetic models for the G matrix when pleiotropy is excluded by design, such that all covariance comes from linkage disequilibrium. The G matrix is far less stable than has previously been found, fluctuating over the timescale of selective sweeps. However, its orientation is relatively stable, corresponding to high genetic variance in fitness-associated traits and strong negative covariance - the same pattern often interpreted in terms of pleiotropic constraints but caused instead by linkage disequilibrium. We find that different mechanisms drive the instabilities along versus perpendicular to the fitness gradient. The origin of linkage disequilibrium is not drift, but small amounts of linkage disequilibrium are instead introduced by mutation and then amplified during competing selective sweeps. This illustrates the need to integrate a broader range of population genetic phenomena into quantitative genetics.",

    "abstract": "Asexual reproduction has evolved repeatedly from sexual ancestors across a wide range of taxa. While the costs and benefits associated with asexuality have received considerable attention, the molecular changes underpinning the evolution of asexual reproduction remain relatively unexplored. In particular, it is completely unknown whether the repeated evolution of asexual phenotypes involves similar molecular changes, as previous studies have focused on changes occurring in single lineages. Here we investigate the extent of convergent gene expression changes across five independent transitions to asexuality in stick insects. We compared gene expression of asexual females to females of close sexual relatives in whole-bodies, reproductive tracts, and legs. We identified a striking amount of convergent gene expression change (up to 8% of genes), greatly exceeding that expected by chance. Convergent changes were also tissue-specific, and most likely driven by selection for functional changes. Genes showing convergent changes in the reproductive tract were associated with meiotic spindle formation and centrosome organization. These genes are particularly interesting as they can influence the production of unreduced eggs, a key barrier to asexual reproduction. Changes in legs and whole-bodies were likely involved in female sexual trait decay, with enrichment in terms such as sperm-storage and pigmentation. By identifying changes occurring across multiple independent transitions to asexuality, our results provide a rare insight into the molecular basis of asexual phenotypes and suggest that the evolutionary path to asexuality is highly constrained, requiring repeated changes to the same key genes.",

This modulation also extends to the corresponding theta-gamma modulation of the firing rate, the slope of whose excitation mediated increase is steeper in the presence of HCN channels. We also show that in the cells devoid of HCN channels, inhibition can emulate their role. Considering the dorso-ventral gradients of HCN and inhibition, which are present aligned to the grid spacing gradient in the medial entorhinal cortex, these findings should be noteworthy.",

    "abstract": "Root systems are branched networks that develop from simple growth properties of their individual roots. Yet a mature maize root system has many thousands of roots that each interact with soil structures, water and nutrient patches, and microbial ecologies in the micro-environments surrounding each root tip. Although the plasticity of root growth to these and other environmental factors is well known, how the many local processes contribute over time to global features of root system architecture is hardly understood. We employ an automated 3D root imaging pipeline to capture the growth of maize roots every four hours throughout seven days of seedling development. We model the contrasting architectures of two maize inbred genotypes and their hybrid to derive key parameters that distinguish complex growth patterns as a function of time. The statistical characteristics of local root growth defined the global system properties despite a large range of trait values. \\\"Computational dissection\\\" of a single root from each root system identified differences in the size of the root branching zone and lateral branching densities, but not radial patterns, that drove the contrasting root architectures from seedling to maturity. X-ray imaging of mature field-grown root crowns showed that seedling growth trajectories persisted throughout development and could predict eventual architectures, suggesting a strong genetic basis. The work connects individual and systemwide scales of root growth dynamics, providing the means for a function-valued approach to understanding the genetic and genetic x environment conditioning of root growth that will enable breeding for enhanced root traits.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen and where roots grow determines their ability to capture short-lived and patchy water and nutrient resources to support the aboveground organs of the plant. Roots have no known long-distance external sensing mechanisms, but form branched networks that blindly explore the soil and respond to encountered local stimuli. How global architectures form from the many thousands of these local responses, and how they are controlled genetically are major open questions. Here we quantify differences in local root growth patterns of two inbred genotypes of maize that control contrasting systemwide properties. Measurements at the seedling stage were highly correlated with the complex architectures of mature root systems, paving the way for the development of crops with greater resource uptake capacity.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks towards this goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, which we call Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models, and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on ChIP-seq data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity and predicts the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose the accurate prediction of cell type-specific gene expression based solely on primary sequence as a grand challenge for the field.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide outbreaks of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in 2014 and 2016 have caused widespread serious respiratory and neurological disease. To investigate diversity, spread, and evolution of EV-D68 we performed near full-length deep sequencing in 54 samples obtained in Sweden during the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks. In most samples, intrapatient variability was low and dominated by rare synonymous variants, but three patients showed evidence of dual infections with distinct EV-D68 variants from the same subclade. Interpatient evolution showed a very strong temporal signal, with an evolutionary rate of 0.0038{+/-}0.0001 substitutions per site and year. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from the sequences suggest that EV-D68 was introduced into Stockholm several times during the 2016 outbreak and then spread locally. Putative neutralization targets in the BC- and DE-loops of the VP1 protein are slightly more diverse within-host and tend to undergo more frequent substitution than other genomic regions. However, evolution in these loops does not appear to have driven the emergence of the 2016 B3-subclade directly from the 2014 B1-subclade. Instead, the most recent ancestor of both clades was dated to 2009. The study provides a comprehensive description of the intra- and interpatient evolution of EV-D68, including the first report of intrapatient diversity and dual infections. The new data along with publicly available EV-D68 sequences are included in an interactive phylodynamic analysis on nextstrain.org/enterovirus/d68 to facilitate timely EV-D68 tracking in the future.xs",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory shows that social interactions involving coordination between individuals are subject to an \\\"evolutionary trap.\\\" Once a suboptimal strategy has evolved, mutants playing an alternative strategy are counterselected because they fail to coordinate with the majority. This creates a detrimental situation from which evolution cannot escape. To determine how this problem materializes in a model with a greater degree of realism than conventional game-theoretical models, we simulate the life and the long-term evolution of a population of individuals playing a two-player coordination game, using the framework of evolutionary robotics. We first confirm the existence of an evolutionary trap in a simple setting. We then, however, reveal that this problem disappears in a more realistic setting where individuals need to coordinate with one another. In this setting, robots evolve an ability to adapt plastically their behavior to one another, as this improves the efficiency of their interaction. This ability has an unintended evolutionary consequence: a genetic mutation affecting one individuals behavior also indirectly alters their partners behavior because the two individuals influence one another, which is called an \\\"indirect genetic effect\\\". Consequently, pairs of partners can virtually change strategy together with a single mutation, and the evolutionary barrier between alternative strategies disappears. This finding reveals a general principle that could play a role in nature to smoothen the transition to efficient collective behaviors in all games with multiple equilibriums.",

    "abstract": "A majority of adults in Finland are seropositive carriers of herpes simplex viruses (HSV). Infection occurs at epithelial or mucosal surfaces, after which virions enter innervating nerve endings, eventually establishing lifelong infection in neurons of the sensory or autonomic nervous system. Recent data have highlighted the genetic diversity of HSV-1 strains, and demonstrated apparent geographic patterns in strain similarity. Though multiple HSV-1 genomes have been sequenced from Europe to date, there is a lack of sequenced genomes from Nordic countries. Finlands history includes at least two major waves of human migration, suggesting the potential for diverse viruses to persist in the population. Here we used HSV-1 clinical isolates from Finland to test the relationship between viral phylogeny, genetic variation, and phenotypic characteristics. We found that Finnish HSV-1 isolates separated into two distinct phylogenetic groups, potentially reflecting historical waves of human (and viral) migration into Finland. Each HSV-1 isolate harbored a distinct set of phenotypes in cell culture, including differences in virus production, extracellular virus release, and cell-type-specific fitness. Importantly, the phylogenetic clusters were not predictive of any detectable pattern in phenotypic differences, demonstrating that whole-genome relatedness is not a proxy for overall viral phenotype. Instead, we highlight specific gene-level differences that may contribute to observed phenotypic differences, and we note that strains from different phylogenetic groups contain the same genetic variations.\\n\\nImportanceHerpes simplex viruses (HSV) infect a majority of adults.

In our quest towards the identification of molecular cues that may boost their stemness potential, we investigated the involvement of the Hippo pathway effector YAP, which we previously found to be upregulated in Muller cells following retinal injury. We report that conditional Yap deletion in Muller cells prevents the upregulation of cell cycle genes that normally accompanies reactive gliosis upon photoreceptor cell death. This occurs as a consequence of defective EGFR signaling. Consistent with a function of YAP in triggering Muller glia cell cycle re-entry, we further show that in Xenopus, a species endowed with efficient regenerative capacity, YAP is required for their injury-dependent proliferative response. Finally, and noteworthy, we reveal that YAP overactivation in mouse Muller cells is sufficient to induce their reprogramming into highly proliferative cells. Overall, we unravel a pivotal role for YAP in tuning Muller cell response to injury and highlight a novel YAP-EGFR axis by which Muller cells exit their quiescence state, a critical step towards regeneration.",

    "abstract": "T-cell receptors (TCRs) detect specifically and sensitively a small number of agonist peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) from an ocean of structurally similar self-pMHCs to trigger antigen-specific adaptive immune responses1-4. Despite intense efforts, the mechanism underlying TCR ligand discrimination remains a major unanswered question in immunology. Here we show that a TCR discriminates between closely related peptides by forming TCR-pMHC bonds with different lengths, which precisely control the accessibility of CD3{zeta} immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) for phosphorylation. Using in situ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)3,5, we measured the intermolecular length of single TCR-pMHC bonds and the intramolecular distance of individual TCR-CD3{zeta} complexes at the membrane of live primary T cells. We found that an agonist forms a short TCR-pMHC bond to pull the otherwise sequestered CD3{zeta} off the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, leading to full exposure of its ITAMs for strong phosphorylation. By contrast, a structurally similar weaker peptide forms a longer bond with the TCR, resulting in partial dissociation of CD3{zeta} from the membrane and weak phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that TCR-pMHC bond length determines 2D TCR binding kinetics and affinity, T-cell calcium signaling and T-cell proliferation, governing the entire process of signal reception, transduction and regulation. Thus, our data reveal the fundamental mechanism by which a TCR deciphers the structural differences between foreign antigens and self-peptides via TCR-pMHC bond length to initiate different TCR signaling for ligand discrimination.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies using batch-fermentation suggest that the red macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis might reduce methane (CH4) emission from beef cattle by up to ~99% when added to rhodes grass hay, a common feed in the Australian beef industry. These experiments have shown significant reductions in methane without compromising other fermentation parameters (i.e. volatile fatty acid production) with A. taxiformis organic matter (OM) inclusion rates of up to 5%. In the study presented here, A. taxiformis was evaluated for its ability to reduce methane production from dairy cattle fed a mixed ration widely utilized in California; the largest milk producer in the US.\\n\\nResultsFermentation in a semi-continuous in-vitro rumen system suggests that A. taxiformis can reduce methane production from enteric fermentation in dairy cattle by 95% when added at a 5% OM inclusion rate without any obvious negative impacts on volatile fatty acid production. High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing showed that seaweed amendment effects rumen microbiome communities consistent with the Anna Karenina hypothesis, with increased beta-diversity, over time scales of approximately three days. The relative abundance of methanogens in the fermentation vessels amended with A. taxiformis decreased significantly compared to control vessels, but this reduction in methanogen abundance was only significant when averaged over the course of the experiment. Alternatively, significant reductions of methane in the A. taxiformis amended vessels was measured in the early stages of the experiment. This suggests that A. taxiformis has an immediate effect on the metabolic functionality of rumen methanogens whereas its impact on microbiome assemblage, specifically methanogen abundance, is delayed.\\n\\nConclusionsThe methane reducing effect of A. taxiformis during rumen fermentation makes this macroalgae a promising candidate as a biotic methane mitigation strategy in the largest milk producing state in the US. But its effect in-vivo (i.e. in dairy cattle) remains to be investigated in animal trials. Furthermore, to obtain a holistic understanding of the biochemistry responsible for the significant reduction of methane, gene expression profiles of the rumen microbiome and the host animal are warranted.",

The landscapes can be decomposed into two principal topologies: the fitness effects of protein shortage and surplus.

Sensitivity to both protein shortage and surplus creates a fitness landscape in which an  epistatic ratchet uncouples the evolution of noise from mean expression, promoting noise minimization.

The animal model (AM) module of AutDB was first developed for mouse models of genes and CNVs associated with ASD (Kumar et al., 2011). Subsequently, environmentally induced rodent models were introduced to capture the full spectrum of risk-factors associated with ASD, along with idiopathic models represented by inbred strains. Using the data systematically annotated in AutDB, we depict the intricate trends in the research findings based on rodent models of ASD. We identify the top 30 most frequently studied phenotypes extracted from 911 genetic, 269 induced and 17 inbred rodent models of ASD extracted from 787 publications. As expected, many of these include animal model equivalents of the  core phenotypes associated with ASD, as well as several comorbid features of ASD including anxiety, seizures and motor-control deficits. Uniquely, AutDB curates rescue models where various treatment strategies were used in rodent ASD models to alleviate ASDrelevant phenotypes. We further examine ASD models based on 52 genes and 2 CNV loci to identify 24 pharmaceutical agents that were used in 2 or more paradigms for testing their efficacy. As a case study, we analyze various Shank3 mouse models providing a highresolution view of the in vivo role of this high-confidence ASD gene.

To address this, we evaluated cross-species and post-duplication sequence and expression conservation of intergenic transcribed regions (ITRs) in four Poaceae species. Most ITR sequences are species-specific. Those found across species tend to be more divergent in expression and have more recent duplicates compared to annotated genes. To assess if ITRs are functional (under selection), machine learning models were established in Oryza sativa (rice) that could distinguish between benchmark functional (phenotype genes) and nonfunctional (pseudogenes) sequences with high accuracy based on 44 evolutionary and biochemical features. Based on the prediction models, 584 rice ITRs (8%) are classified as likely functional that tend to have conserved expression and ancient retained duplicates. However, most ITRs do not exhibit sequence or expression conservation across species or following duplication, consistent with computational predictions that suggest 61% ITRs are not under selection. We outline key evolutionary characteristics that are tightly associated with likely-functional ITRs and provide a framework to identify novel genes to improve genome annotation and move toward connecting genotype to phenotype in crop and model systems.",

A proteomic approach combining mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis identified the estrogen-driven lactose-binding lectin Galectin-1 (GAL-1) as a putative candidate that could drive this invasion. Expression of LGALS1, the gene encoding GAL-1 showed an association with tumor grade progression in bladder cell lines. Immunohisto- and cyto-chemical experiments suggested greater extracellular levels of GAL-1 in 3D cultures of high-grade bladder cells and cancer tissues. High levels of GAL-1 associated with increased proliferation- and adhesion- of bladder cancer cells when grown on laminin-rich matrices. Pharmacological inhibition and Gal-1 knockdown in high-grade female cells decreased their adhesion to, and viability on, laminin-rich substrata. Higher GAL-1 also correlated with reduced E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin levels in consonance with a mesenchymal-like phenotype that we observed in 3D culture. The inhibition of GAL-1 reversed the stellate invasive phenotype to a more growth-restricted one in high-grade cells embedded within both basement-membrane-like and stromal collagenous matrix scaffolds. Finally, inhibition of GAL-1 specifically altered cell surface sialic acids, suggesting the mechanism by which the levels of GAL-1 may underlie the aggression and poor prognosis of invasive bladder cancer, especially in women.",

    "abstract": "Biological tubes are essential for animal survival, and their functions are critically dependent on tube shape. Analyzing the contributions of cell shape and organization to the morphogenesis of small tubes has been hampered by the limitations of existing programs in quantifying cell geometry on highly curved tubular surfaces and calculating tube-specific parameters. We therefore developed QuBiT (Quantitative Tool for Biological Tubes) and used it to analyze morphogenesis during embryonic Drosophila tracheal (airway) development. We find that there are previously unknown anterior-to-posterior (A-P) gradients of cell orientation and aspect ratio, and that there is periodicity in the organization of cells in the main tube. Furthermore, cell intercalation during development dampens an A-P gradient of the number of the number of cells per cross-section of the tube, but these intercalation events do not change the patterns of cell connectivity. These unexpected findings demonstrate the importance of a computational tool for analyzing the morphogenesis of small diameter biological tubes.",

    "abstract": "Contractility of the non-muscle and smooth muscle cells that comprise biological tubing is regulated by the Rho-ROCK and calcium signaling pathways. Although many molecular details about these signaling pathways are known, less is known about how they are coordinated spatiotemporally in biological tubes. The spermatheca of the C. elegans reproductive system enables study of the signaling pathways regulating actomyosin contractility in live adult animals. The RhoGAP SPV-1 was previously identified as a negative regulator of RHO-1/Rho and spermathecal contractility. Here, we uncover a role for SPV-1 as a key regulator of calcium signaling. spv-1 mutants expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP in the spermatheca exhibit premature calcium release, elevated calcium levels, and disrupted spatial regulation of calcium signaling during spermathecal contraction. Although RHO-1 is required for spermathecal contractility, RHO-1 does not play a significant role in regulating calcium. In contrast, activation of CDC-42 recapitulates many aspects of spv-1 mutant calcium signaling. Depletion of cdc-42 by RNAi does not suppress the premature or elevated calcium signal seen in spv-1 mutants, suggesting other targets remain to be identified. Our results suggest SPV-1 works through both the Rho-ROCK and calcium signaling pathways to coordinate cellular contractility.\\n\\nHighlight SummaryThrough in vivo imaging of the calcium sensor GCaMP, we show that the RhoGAP SPV-1 is a key regulator of calcium signaling in the C. elegans spermatheca. Our data suggests SPV-1 acts at least partially through the small GTPase CDC-42 to modulate calcium signaling, while also acting on RHO-1 to modulate Rho-ROCK signaling. This places SPV-1 as a central regulator of cellular contractility.",

    "abstract": "Cyclins associate with CDK1 to generate the M-phase-promoting factor (MPF) essential for progression through mitosis and meiosis. Previous studies concluded that CCNB2 is dispensable for cell cycle progression. Given our findings of high translation rates of CcnB2 mRNA in prophase-arrested oocytes, we have reevaluated its role during meiosis. CcnB2-/- oocytes undergo delayed germinal vesicle breakdown followed by a defective M-phase due to reduced pre-MPF activity. This disrupted maturation is associated with compromised CcnB1 and Mos mRNA translation and delayed spindle assembly. Given these defects, a significant population of oocytes fail to complete meiosis I because SAC remains activated and APC function is inhibited. In vivo, CCNB2 depletion leads to decreased oocyte developmental competence, compromised fecundity, and premature ovarian failure. These findings demonstrate that CCNB2 is required to assemble sufficient pre-MPF for timely meiosis reentry and progression. Although endogenous cyclins cannot compensate, overexpression of CCNB1 rescues the meiotic phenotypes, demonstrating similar molecular properties but divergent modes of regulation of these cyclins.",

How such interactions are orchestrated remains unknown. We developed a novel strategy to track VH-DHJH motion and interactions in live B-lymphocytes. We found that VH and DHJH segments were trapped in configurations that only allowed constrained local motion, such that spatially proximal VH and DHJH segments remained in proximity, whereas spatially remote segments explored their immediate neighborhood while remaining remote. Comparison of experimental and simulated data revealed that such a highly constrained motion was imposed by a network of cross-linked chromatin chains characteristic of a gel phase, yet it was poised near the sol phase, a solution of independent chromatin chains. We propose that epigenetically induced gel droplets and the proximity to the sol-gel phase transition constitute the mechanism that orchestrates ordered VDJ rearrangement.",

Intratumoral genetic heterogeneity and mode of tumor evolution have not been systematically addressed for this cancer.

We found that pGBM undergoes extreme evolutionary trajectories, with primary and recurrent tumors having different subclonal compositions. Analysis of variant allele frequencies supported a model of tumor growth involving slow-cycling cancer stem cells that give rise to fast-proliferating progenitor-like cells and to non-dividing cells. pGBM patients germlines had subclonal structural variants, some of which underwent dynamic frequency fluctuations during tumor evolution. By sequencing germlines of mother-father-patient trios, we found that inheritance of deleterious germline variants from healthy parents cooperate with de novo germline and somatic events to the tumorigenic process. Our studies therefore challenge the current notion that pGBM is a relatively homogeneous molecular entity.",

To mechanistically understand this process, we investigated two S. cerevisiae TFs, Reb1 and Cbf1. We show these factors bind their sites within nucleosomes with similar affinities to naked DNA, trapping a partially unwrapped nucleosome without histone eviction. Both the binding and dissociation rates of Reb1 and Cbf1 are significantly slower at the nucleosomal sites relative to DNA, demonstrating that the high affinities are achieved by increasing the dwell time on nucleosomes to compensate for reduced binding. Reb1 also shows slow migration rate in the yeast nuclei. These properties are similar to human pioneer factors (PFs), suggesting the mechanism of nucleosome targeting is conserved from yeast to human.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman tuberculosis (TB) is caused by seven phylogenetic lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), Lineage 1-7. Recent advances in rapid genotyping of MTBC based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), allow for rapid and phylogenetically robust strain classification, paving the way for defining genotype-phenotype relationships in clinical settings. Such studies have revealed that, in addition to host and environmental factors, different strains of the MTBC influence the outcome of TB infection and disease. In Tanzania, such molecular epidemiological studies of TB however are scarce in spite of a high TB burden.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsHere we used a SNP-typing method to genotype a nationwide collection of 2,039 MTBC clinical isolates obtained from new and retreatment TB cases diagnosed in 2012 and 2013. Four lineages, namely Lineage 1-4 were identified. The distribution and frequency of these lineages varied across the regions but overall, Lineage 4 was the most frequent (n=866, 42.5%), followed by Lineage 3 (n=681, 33.4%) and 1 (n=336, 16.5%), with Lineage 2 being the least frequent (n=92, 4.5%). A total of 64 (3.1%) isolates could not be assigned to any lineage. We found Lineage 2 to be associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.25; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.38 - 3.70, p<0.001) and retreatment (aOR 1.78; 95% CI 1.00 - 3.02, p=0.040). We found no associations between MTBC lineage and patient age or HIV status. Our sublineage typing based on spacer oligotyping revealed the presence of mainly EAI, CAS and LAM families. Finally, we detected low levels of multidrug resistant isolates among a subset of retreatment cases\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides novel insights into the influence of pathogen-related factors on the TB epidemic in Tanzania.",

    "abstract": "Targeted identification and purging of deleterious genetic variants has been proposed as a novel approach to animal and plant breeding. This strategy is motivated, in part, by the observation that demographic events and strong selection associated with cultivated species pose a \\\"cost of domestication.\\\" This includes an increase in the proportion of genetic variants where a mutation is likely to reduce fitness. Recent advances in DNA resequencing and sequence constraint-based approaches to predict the functional impact of a mutation permit the identification of putatively deleterious SNPs (dSNPs) on a genome-wide scale. Using exome capture resequencing of 21 barley 6-row spring breeding lines, we identify 3,855 dSNPs among 497,754 total SNPs. In order to polarize SNPs as ancestral versus derived, we generated whole genome resequencing data of Hordeum murinum ssp. glaucum as a phylogenetic outgroup. The dSNPs occur at higher density in portions of the genome with a higher recombination rate than in pericentromeric regions with lower recombination rate and gene density. Using 5,215 progeny from a genomic prediction experiment, we examine the fate of dSNPs over three breeding cycles. Average derived allele frequency is lower for dSNPs than any other class of variants. Adjusting for initial frequency, derived alleles at dSNPs reduce in frequency or are lost more often than other classes of SNPs. The highest yielding lines in the experiment, as chosen by standard genomic prediction approaches, carry fewer homozygous dSNPs than randomly sampled lines from the same progeny cycle. In the final cycle of the experiment, progeny selected by genomic prediction have a mean of 5.6% fewer homozygous dSNPs relative to randomly chosen progeny from the same cycle.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe nature of genetic variants underlying complex trait variation has been the source of debate in evolutionary biology. Here, we provide evidence that agronomically important phenotypes are influenced by rare, putatively deleterious variants. We use exome capture resequencing and a hypothesis-based test for codon conservation to predict deleterious SNPs (dSNPS) in the parents of a multi-parent barley breeding population. We also generated whole-genome resequencing data of Hordeum murinum, a phylogenetic outgroup to barley, to polarize dSNPs by ancestral versus derived state. dSNPs occur disproportionately in the gene-rich chromosome arms, rather than in the recombination-poor pericentromeric regions. They also decrease in frequency more often than other variants at the same initial frequency during recurrent selection for grain yield and disease resistance. Finally, we identify a region on chromosome 4H that strongly associated with agronomic phenotypes in which dSNPs appear to be hitchhiking with favorable variants. Our results show that targeted identification and removal of dSNPs from breeding programs is a viable strategy for crop improvement, and that standard genomic prediction approaches may already contain some information about unobserved segregating dSNPs.",

However, there is paucity of data on haematological profiles and oxidative stress in comorbidity states. This study identified novel inflammatory biomarkers associated with malaria in SCD and analyzed the levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 oxidative stress biomarker in malaria-SCD co-morbidity in Ghanaian patients.\\n\\nMethodsBlood (5ml) was collected from malaria patients into K3-EDTA tube. Malaria parasites speciation and quantification were then done according WHO guidelines. All eligible samples were assayed for haematological profile, sickle cell phenotyping, infectious markers (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and HIV 1&2) and plasma levels of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2..\\n\\nResultsPrevalence of malaria in SCD (malaria-SCD) was 13.4% (45/335). Male: female ratio was 0.8:1 (X2=1.43, p=0.231). Mean ages for malaria in normal haemoglobin type (malaria-HbAA) and malaria-SCD were 12.79{+/-}4.91 and 11.56{+/-}3.65 years respectively (p=0.048). Geometric mean of parasite density was higher in malaria-HbAA (20394 parasites/l vs. 9990 parasites/l, p=0.001) whilst mean body temperature was higher in malaria-SCD (39.0{+/-}0.87{degrees}C vs. 37.9{+/-}1.15{degrees}C, p=0.001). Mean leukocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, platelets and platelet indices values were significantly elevated in malaria-SCD. Significant reduction in RBC and RBC indices in malaria-SCD were also observed. Eosinophils-to-basophils ratio (EBR) and monocytes-to-basophils ratio (MBR) were novel cellular inflammatory biomarkers which could predict malaria in SCD. The sensitivities of cut-off values of EBR>14, MBR>22 and combined use of EBR>14 and MBR>22 were 79.55%, 84.09% and 91.11% respectively. Mean 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 was 338.1pg/ml in malaria-HbAA and 643.8pg/ml in malaria-SCD (p=0.001). 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 correlated with parasite density (r=0.787, p=0.001), temperature (r=0.566, p=0.001) and leucocytes (r=0.573, p=0.001) and negatively correlated with RBC (r=-0.476, p=0.003), haemoglobin (r=-0.851, p=0.001) and haematocrit (r=-0.735, p=0.001).\\n\\nConclusionPlasmodium falciparum parasitaemia increases oxidative damage and causes derangement haematological parameters.

    "abstract": "Cronobacter sakazakii (CS), an important pathogen, is associated with the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), infant sepsis, and meningitis. Several randomized prospective clinical trials demonstrated that oral probiotics could decrease the incidence of NEC. Previously, we isolated and characterized a novel probiotic, B. fragilis strain ZY-312. However, it remains unclear how ZY-312 protects the host from the effects of CS infection. To understand the underlying mechanisms triggering the probiotic effects, we tested the hypothesis that there was a cross-talk between probiotics/probiotics-modulated microbiota and the local immune system, governed by the permeability of the intestinal mucosa using in vitro and in vivo models for the intestinal permeability. The probiotic effects of ZY-312 on intestinal epithelial cells were first examined, which revealed that ZY-312 inhibited CS invasion, CS-induced dual cell death (pyroptosis and apoptosis), and epithelial barrier dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. ZY-312 also decreased the expression of an inflammasome (NOD-like receptor family member pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase-3, and serine protease caspase-1 in a neonatal rat model. Furthermore, ZY-312 significantly modulated the compositions of the intestinal bacterial communities, and decreased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Gamma proteobacteria, but increased the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Bacillus in neonatal rats. In conclusion, our findings have shown for the first time that the probiotic, B. fragilis ZY-312, suppresses CS-induced NEC by modulating the pro-inflammatory response and dual cell death (apoptosis and pyroptosis).\\n\\nAuthor summaryCronobacter sakazakii, a major necrotizing enterocolitis pathogen, is used as a model microorganism for the study of opportunistic bacteria in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis. Here, we have now unequivocally demonstrated that both apoptotic and pyroptotic stimuli contribute to the pathogenesis of Cronobacter sakazakii -induced necrotizing enterocolitis. Previously, we isolated and characterized a novel probiotic, B. fragilis strain ZY-312. We found that the ZY-312 defense against Cronobacter sakazakii-induced necrotizing enterocolitis by inhibiting Cronobacter sakazakii invasion, epithelial barrier dysfunction, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and dual cell death (pyroptosis and apoptosis). This study demonstrates the utility of ZY-312 as a promising probiotic agent for the prevention and treatment of various intestinal diseases, including NEC.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionChagas disease (CD) and Tuberculosis (TB) are important health problems in Bolivia. Current treatments for both infections require a long period of time, and unwanted drug-related adverse events (ADRs) are frequent.\\n\\nPurposeThis study aims to strengthen the Bolivian Pharmacovigilance system, focusing on CD and TB.\\n\\nMethodsA situational diagnosis of Pharmacovigilance in the Department of Cochabamba was performed. The use of a new Local Case Report Form (CRF) was implemented, together with the CRF established by the Unidad de Medicamentos y Tecnologia en Salud (UNIMED), in several health care centers. Training and follow-up on drug safety monitoring and ADR reporting was provided to all health professionals involved in CD and TB treatment. A comparative analysis of the reported ADRs using the CRF provided by UNIMED, the new CRF proposal, and medical records, was performed.\\n\\nResultsOut of the total patients starting treatment for CD, 35,35% suffered ADR according to the information collected in the medical records, and 25% of them were classified as moderate/severe (MS) types. Only 51,43% of MS ADRs were reported to UNIMED. Regarding TB treatment, 9,89% of the total patients suffered ADR, 44% of them were classified as MS, and 75% of MS ADRs were reported to UNIMED.\\n\\nConclusionsThe reinforcement of the Bolivian Pharmacovigilance system is an ambitious project that should take a long-term perspective and the engagement of national health workers and other stake holders at all levels. Continuity and perseverance are essential to achieve a solid ADR reporting system, improving patient safety, drug efficacy and adherence to treatment.",

    "abstract": "The native octameric structure of streptococcal enolase from Streptococcus pyogenes increasingly dissociates as amino acid residues are removed one by one from the carboxy-terminus. These truncations gradually convert native octameric enolase into monomers and oligomers. In this work, we investigated how these truncations influence the interaction between Streptococcal enolase and canine plasminogen. We used dual polarization interferometry (DPI), localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to study the interaction. The DPI was our first technique, was performed on all the truncations and used one exclusive kind of chip. The LSRP was used to show that the DPI results were not dependent on the type of chip used. The AUC was required to show that our surface results were not the result of selecting a minority population in any given sample; the majority of the protein was responsible for the binding phenomenon we observed. By comparing results from these techniques we identified one detail that is essential for streptococcal enolase to bind plasminogen: In our hands the individual monomers bind plasminogen; dimers, trimers, tetramers may or may not bind, the fully intact, native, octamer does not bind plasminogen. We also evaluated the contribution to the equilibrium constant made by surface binding as well as in solution. On a surface, the association coefficient is about twice that in solution. The difference is probably not significant. Finally, the fully octameric form of the protein that does not contain a hexahis N-terminal peptide does not bind to a silicon oxynitride surface, does not bind to a Au-nanoparticle surface, does not bind to a surface coated with Ni-NTA nor does it bind to a surface coated with DPgn. The likelihood is great that the enolase species on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes is an x-mer of the native octamer.",

    "abstract": "The bloodstream form of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei obtains iron from its mammalian host by receptor-mediated endocytosis of host transferrin through its own unique transferrin receptor (TbTfR). Expression of TbTfR rapidly increases upon iron starvation by post-transcriptional regulation through a currently undefined mechanism that is distinct from the mammalian iron response system. We have created reporter cell lines by fusing the TbTfR 3'UTR or a control Aldolase 3UTR to reporter genes encoding GFP or firefly Luciferase, and inserted the fusions into a bloodstream form cell line at a tagged ribosomal RNA locus. Fusion of the TbTfR 3UTR is sufficient to significantly repress the expression of the reporter proteins under normal growth conditions. Under iron starvation conditions we observed upregulation of the TbTfR 3UTR fusions only, with a magnitude and timing consistent with that reported for upregulation of the TbTfR. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of the T. brucei transferrin receptor in response to iron starvation is mediated via its 3UTR, and that the effect is independent of genomic location.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection provides a plausible explanation for the maintenance of deleterious alleles at moderate frequency in livestock, including lethal recessives exhibiting heterozygous advantage in carriers. In the current study, a leg weakness syndrome causing mortality of piglets in a commercial line showed monogenic recessive inheritance, and a region on chromosome 15 associated with the syndrome was identified by homozygosity mapping. Whole genome resequencing of cases and controls identified a mutation coding for a premature stop codon within exon 3 of the porcine Myostatin (MSTN) gene, similar to those causing a double-muscling phenotype observed in several mammalian species. The MSTN mutation was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the population at birth, but significantly distorted amongst animals still in the herd at 110 kg, due to an absence of homozygous mutant genotypes. In heterozygous form, the MSTN mutation was associated with a major increase in muscle depth and decrease in fat depth, suggesting that the deleterious allele was maintained at moderate frequency due to heterozygous advantage. Knockout of the porcine MSTN by gene editing has previously been linked to problems of low piglet survival and lameness. This MSTN mutation is an example of putative balancing selection in livestock, providing a plausible explanation for the lack of disrupting MSTN mutations in pigs despite many generations of selection for lean growth.",

    "abstract": "Herpesviruses usurp host cell protein synthesis machinery to convert viral mRNAs into proteins, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to ensure proper folding, post-translational modification and trafficking of secreted viral proteins. Overloading ER folding capacity activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), whereby displacement of the ER chaperone BiP activates UPR sensor proteins ATF6, PERK and IRE1 to initiate transcriptional responses to increase catabolic processes and ER folding capacity, while suppressing bulk protein synthesis. Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) can be reactivated from latency by chemical induction of ER stress, whereby the IRE1 endoribonuclease cleaves XBP1 mRNA, resulting in a ribosomal frameshift that yields the XBP1s transcription factor that transactivates the promoter of K-RTA, the viral lytic switch protein. By incorporating XBP1s responsive elements in the K-RTA promoter KSHV appears to have evolved a mechanism to respond to ER stress. Here, we report that following reactivation from latency, KSHV lytic replication causes activation of ATF6, PERK and IRE1 UPR sensor proteins. UPR sensor activation is required for efficient KSHV lytic replication; genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of each UPR sensor diminishes virion production. Despite strong UPR sensor activation during KSHV lytic replication, downstream UPR transcriptional responses were restricted; 1) ATF6 was cleaved to release the ATF6(N) transcription factor but known ATF6(N)-responsive genes were not transcribed; 2) PERK phosphorylated eIF2 but ATF4 did not accumulate as expected; 3) IRE1 caused XBP1 mRNA splicing, but XBP1s protein failed to accumulate and XBP1s-responsive genes were not transcribed. Remarkably, complementation of XBP1s deficiency during KSHV lytic replication by ectopic expression inhibited the production of infectious virions in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, while XBP1s plays an important role in reactivation from latency, it inhibits later steps in lytic replication, which the virus overcomes by preventing its synthesis. Taken together, these findings suggest that KSHV hijacks UPR sensors to promote efficient viral replication while sustaining ER stress.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman herpesvirus-8 is the most recently discovered human herpesvirus, and it is the infectious cause of Kaposis sarcoma, which is why its also known as Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Like all herpesviruses, KSHV replicates in the cell nucleus and uses host cell machinery to convert viral genes into proteins. Some of these proteins are synthesized, folded and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traverse the cellular secretory apparatus. Because the virus heavily utilizes the ER to make and process proteins, there is potential to overwhelm the system, which could impede viral replication and in extreme cases, kill the cell. Normally, when demands on the protein folding machinery are exceeded then misfolded proteins accumulate and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR resolves ER stress by putting the brakes on synthesis of many proteins, while signaling to the nucleus to turn on a program that aims to correct this imbalance. Previous work has shown that KSHV is  wired to sense ER stress, which it uses to reactivate from a largely inactive state known as latency, in order to make more viruses. Specifically, a UPR sensor protein called IRE1 senses the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER and rededicates a gene called XBP1 to the production of a transcription factor called XBP1s through an unconventional cytoplasmic mRNA splicing event. XBP1s travels to the cell nucleus and stimulates the production of a collection of proteins that mitigate ER stress. In latently infected cells, XBP1s also binds to the KSHV genome and causes the production of K-RTA, a viral transcription factor that initiates the switch from latency to productive lytic replication. This achieves stress-induced initiation of KSHV replication, but nothing is known about how ER stress and the UPR affect progress through the KSHV replication cycle. Here we show that as KSHV replication progresses, all three known UPR sensor proteins, IRE1, ATF6 and PERK, are activated, which is required for efficient viral replication. Normally, activation of each of these three sensor proteins communicates a unique signal to the cell nucleus to stimulate the production of ER stress mitigating proteins, but in KSHV lytic replication all downstream communication is stymied. The failure to resolve ER stress would normally be expected to put the virus at a disadvantage, but we demonstrate that reversal of this scenario is worse; when we add extra XBP1s to the system to artificially stimulate the production of UPR responsive genes, virus replication is blocked at a late stage and no progeny viruses are released from infected cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that KSHV requires UPR sensor protein activation to replicate but has dramatically altered the outcome to prevent the synthesis of new UPR proteins and sustain stress in the ER compartment.",

Yra1 overexpression was recently shown to promote accumulation of DNA:RNA hybrids favoring DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cell senescence and telomere shortening, via an unknown mechanism. Yra1 was also identified at an HO-induced DSB and Yra1 depletion causes defects in DSB repair. Previous work from our laboratory showed that Yra1 ubiquitination by Tom1 is important for mRNA export. Interestingly, we found that Yra1 is also ubiquitinated by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases Slx5-Slx8 implicated in the interaction of irreparable DSB with nuclear pores. Here we show that Yra1 binds an HO-induced irreparable DSB. Importantly, a Yra1 mutant lacking the evolutionarily conserved C-box is not recruited to an HO-induced irreparable DSB and becomes lethal under DSB induction in a HO-cut reparable system. Together, the data provide evidence that Yra1 plays a crucial role in DSB repair via homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, while the Yra1 C-box is essential, Yra1 sumoylation and/or ubiquitination are dispensable in this process.",

    "abstract": "This study discusses possible sources of discrepancy between findings of previous human motion studies and presents a framework that seeks to address these issues. Motion analysis systems are widely employed to identify movement deficiencies - e.g. patterns that potentially increase the risk of injury or inhibit performance. However, findings across studies are often conflicting in respect to what a movement deficiency is or the magnitude of the relationship to a specific injury. To test the information content of movement data, a framework was build to differentiate between movements performed by a control (NORM) and abnormal (IMP-L and IMP-C) cohort using solely movement data. Movement data was recorded during jumping, hopping and change of direction exercises and was mathematically decomposed into subject scores. Subjects scores were then used to identify the most appropriate machine learning technique, which was subsequently utilized to create a prediction model that classified if a movement was performed by: IMP-L, IMP-C or NORM. The Monte Carlo method was used to obtain a measure of expected accuracy for each step within the analysis. Findings demonstrate that even the worst classification model outperformed the best guess observed and that not all members of the NORM group represent a NORM pattern as they were repeatedly classified as IMP-L or IMP-C. This highlights that some NORM limbs share movement characteristics with the abnormal group and consequently should not be considered when describing NORM.",

    "abstract": "The type III secretion system (T3SS) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been linked to severe disease and poor clinical outcomes in animal and human studies. Of the various T3SS effector genes, ExoS and ExoT showed mutually exclusive distributions, and these two genes showed varied virulence. We aimed to investigate whether the ExoS and ExoT effector proteins of P. aeruginosa affect the expression of the proinflammatory mediators Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 via the NF-{kappa}B and AKT signaling pathways. To understand the role of the T3SS, we used AExoS, AExoT, and T3SS transcriptional activator ExsA mutants (ExsA::{Omega}), as well as A549 cells stimulated with P. aeruginosa strain K (PAK). We investigated the effects of {Delta}ExoS, {Delta}ExoT, and ExsA::{Omega} on the development of pneumonia in a mouse model and on Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 production in A549 cells. {Delta}ExoS and {Delta}ExoT markedly decreased the neutrophil count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, with a reduction in Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression {Delta}ExoS and{Delta}ExoT reduced NF-{kappa}B and AKT phosphorylation, together with Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression in PAK-infected mice and A549 cells. In conclusion, P. aeruginosa infection induced the expression of Mucus, and the P. aeruginosa T3SS appeared to be a key player in Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression, which is further controlled by NF-{kappa}B and AKT signaling. These findings might be useful to devise a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic pulmonary infections by targeting ExoS and ExoT.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium causing serious infections. Many clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa have a specialized apparatus for injecting toxins into eukaryotic cells, namely, the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS is a syringe-like apparatus on the bacterial surface, with 4 effector toxins: ExoS, ExoT, ExoY, and ExoU. We investigated the effect of ExoS and ExoT of the T3SS of P. aeruginosa K strain (PAK). Mucus plays a vital role in protecting the lungs from environmental factors, but conversely, in muco-obstructive airway disease, mucus becomes pathologic. We showed that infection with ExoS and ExoT induced Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression in host cells. PAK clinical strains induce proinflammatory cytokine production through the T3SS, and this involves NF-{kappa}B and SP1/AKT activation in pneumonia mouse models. Mucus induction in response to ExoS and ExoT infection relied on NF-{kappa}B and SP1/AKT activation. Our findings highlight the roles of Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 in inducing proinflammatory cytokine expression during ExoS and ExoT exposure in PAK infections, paving the way for a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pulmonary infections.",

    "abstract": "In response to nutrient deprivation, the cell needs to mobilize an extensive amount of membrane to form and grow the autophagosome, allowing the progression of autophagy. By providing membranes and a source for LC3 lipidation, COPII (Coat Protein Complex II) localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and promotes autophagosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that, in response to starvation, divert COPII from the secretory pathway to the autophagic pathway are largely unknown. Here, we show that the F-box protein FBXW5 targets SEC23B, a component of COPII, for proteasomal degradation and that this event limits the autophagic flux in the presence of nutrients. In response to starvation, ULK1 phosphorylates SEC23B on Serine 186, preventing the interaction of SEC23B with FBXW5 and, therefore, inhibiting its degradation. Phosphorylated and stabilized SEC23B associates with SEC24A and SEC24B, but not SEC24C and SEC24D, and they re-localize to the ERGIC, promoting autophagic flux. Induction of autophagy and localization of both SEC23B and SEC24B to the ERGIC in response to nutrient deprivation are significantly reduced in SEC23B(S186A) knock-in cells. We propose that, in the presence of nutrients, FBXW5 limits COPII-mediated autophagosome biogenesis. Inhibition of this event by ULK1 ensures efficient execution of the autophagic cascade in response to nutrient starvation.",

    "abstract": "Visual processing and behavior depend on specialized neural representations and information channels that encode distinct visual information and enable distinct computations. Our understanding of the neural substrate, however, remain severely limited by sparse recordings and the restricted range of visual areas and visual stimuli considered. We characterized in the mouse the multidimensional spatiotemporal tuning properties of > 30,000 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons across seven areas of the cortex. The dataset reveals population specialized for processing of oriented and non-oriented contrast, spatiotemporal frequency, and motion speed. Areal analysis reveals profound functional diversity and specificity as well as highly specific representations of visual processing channels in distinct visual areas. Clustering analysis shows a branching of visual representations along the posterior to anterior axis, and between lateral and dorsal areas. Overall, this dataset provides a cellular-resolution atlas for understanding organizing principles underlying sensory representations across the cortex.\n\nSummaryVisual representations and visual channels are the cornerstones of mammalian visual processing and critical for a range of life sustaining behaviors. However, the lack of data sets spanning multiple visual areas preclude unambiguous identification of visual processing streams and the sparse, singular recording data sets obtained thus far are insufficient to reveal the functional diversity of visual areas and to study visual information channels. We characterized the tunings of over 30,000 cortical excitatory neurons from 7 visual areas to a broad array of stimuli and studied their responses in terms of their ability to encode orientation, spatiotemporal contrast and visual motion speed. We found all mouse visual cortical areas convey diverse information but show distinct biases in terms of numbers of neurons tuned to particular spatiotemporal features. Neurons in visual areas differ in their spatiotemporal tuning but also in their relative response to oriented and unoriented contrast. We uncovered a population that preferentially responds to unoriented contrast and shows only weak responses to oriented stimuli. This population is strongly overrepresented in certain areas (V1, LM and LI) and underrepresented in others (AL, RL, AM, and PM). Spatiotemporal tunings are broadly distributed in all visual areas indicating that all areas have access to broad spatiotemporal information. However, individual areas show specific biases. While V1 is heavily biased in favor of low spatial and temporal frequencies, area LM responds more strongly to mid-range frequencies. Areas PM and LI are biased in favor of slowly-varying high-resolution signals. By comparison, anterior areas AL, RL and AM are heavily biased in favor of fast-varying, low to mid spatial frequency signals. Critically, theses biases express themselves in vastly different number of cells tuned to particular features, suggesting differential sampling of visual processing channels across areas. Comparing across areas, we found divergent visual representations between anterior and posterior areas, and between lateral and dorsal areas, suggesting the segregated organization of cortical streams for distinct information processing.",

    "abstract": "One fundamental question is what makes two brain states similar. For example, what makes the activity in visual cortex elicited from viewing a robin similar to a sparrow? One common assumption in fMRI analysis is that neural similarity is described by Pearson correlation. However, there are a host of other possibilities, including Minkowski and Mahalanobis measures, with each differing in its mathematical, theoretical, neural computational assumptions. Moreover, the operable measures may vary across brain regions and tasks. Here, we evaluated which of several competing similarity measures best captured neural similarity. Our technique uses a decoding approach to assess the information present in a brain region and the similarity measures that best correspond to the classifiers confusion matrix are preferred. Across two published fMRI datasets, we found the preferred neural similarity measures were common across brain regions, but differed across tasks. Moreover, Pearson correlation was consistently surpassed by alternatives.",

    "abstract": "In metastatic cancer, the role of heterogeneity at the tumor-immune microenvironment, its molecular underpinnings and clinical relevance remain largely unexplored. To understand tumor-immune dynamics at baseline and upon chemotherapy treatment, we performed unbiased pathway and cell type-specific immunogenomics analysis of treatment-naive (38 samples from 8 patients) and paired chemotherapy treated (80 paired samples from 40 patients) high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) samples. Whole transcriptome analysis and image-based quantification of T cells from treatment-naive tumors revealed ubiquitous variability in immune signaling and distinct immune microenvironments co-existing within the same individuals and within tumor deposits at diagnosis. To systematically explore cell type composition of the tumor microenvironment using bulk mRNA, we derived consensus immune and stromal cell gene signatures by intersecting state-of-the-art deconvolution methods, providing improved accuracy and sensitivity when compared to HGSOC immunostaining and leukocyte methylation data sets. Cell-type deconvolution and pathway analyses revealed that Myc and Wnt signaling associate with immune cell exclusion in untreated HGSOC. To evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on the intrinsic tumor-immune heterogeneity, we compared site-matched and site-unmatched tumors before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Transcriptomic and T-cell receptor sequencing analyses showed that site-matched samples had increased cytotoxic immune activation and oligoclonal expansion of T cells after chemotherapy, which was not seen in site-unmatched samples where heterogeneity could not be accounted for. These results demonstrate that the tumor-immune interface in advanced HGSOC is intrinsically heterogeneous, and thus requires site-specific analysis to reliably unmask the impact of therapy on the tumor-immune microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "During early mammalian development, the genome undergoes profound transitions in chromatin states, topological organization and recruitment of cis regulatory factors involved in transcriptional control. How these three layers of gene regulation interact is the matter of intense research. The Zdbf2 gene--which is involved in growth control--provides a valuable model to study this question: upon exit from naive pluripotency and prior to tissue differentiation, it undergoes a switch in usage from a distal to a proximal promoter, along with a switch in chromatin states, from polycomb to DNA methylation occupancy. Using an embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture system to mimic this period, we show here that four enhancers contribute to the Zdbf2 promoter switch, concomitantly with dynamic changes in chromosome architecture. Indeed, CTCF plays a key role in partitioning the locus in ESCs, to facilitate enhancer contact with the distal Zdbf2 promoter only. Partition relieving enhances proximal Zdbf2 promoter activity, as observed during differentiation or with mutants that lack local CTCF-based partition. Importantly, we show that CTCF-based regulation occurs independently of the polycomb and DNA methylation pathways. Our study reveals the importance of multi-layered regulatory frameworks to ensure proper spatio-temporal activation of developmentally important genes.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are deadly vectors of arboviral pathogens including Zika, dengue, and yellow fever, and breed in containers of freshwater associated with human habitation1,2. Female Ae. aegypti lay eggs near freshwater because larval and pupal stages are aquatic3. They use volatile cues to locate water at a distance4, while at close-range they contact water to evaluate its suitability for egg-laying4-7. High salinity is lethal to mosquito offspring and therefore correctly laying eggs in freshwater is a crucial parenting decision made by female mosquitoes. Here we show that the DEG/ENaC channel8-10 ppk301 is required for mosquitoes to exploit freshwater egg-laying substrates. When ppk301 mutant females contact water, they do not lay eggs as readily as wild-type animals and are more likely to make aberrant decisions between freshwater and saltwater at concentrations that impair offspring survival. We used a CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic knock-in strategy combined with the Q-binary transactivator system11 to build genetic tools for labelling and imaging neurons in the mosquito. We found that ppk301 is expressed in sensory neurons in legs and proboscis, appendages that directly contact water, and that ppk301-expressing neurons project to central taste centres. Using in vivo calcium imaging with the genetically-encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s12, we found that ppk301-expressing cells respond to water but, unexpectedly, also to salt. This suggests that ppk301 is instructive for egg-laying at low salt concentrations but that a ppk301-independent pathway is responsible for inhibiting egg-laying at high salt concentrations. Water is a key resource for insect survival and understanding how mosquitoes interact with water to control different behaviours is an opportunity to study the evolution of chemosensory systems. The new genetic tools described here will enable direct study of not only egg-laying, but also other behaviours in mosquitoes that influence disease transmission and enable comparative studies of insect biology more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Curved-rods are a ubiquitous bacterial phenotype, but the fundamental question of why they are shaped this way remains unanswered. Through in silico experiments, we assessed freely swimming straight- and curved-rod bacteria of a wide diversity of equal-volume shapes parameterized by elongation and curvature, and predicted their performances in tasks likely to strongly influence overall fitness. Performance tradeoffs between these tasks lead to a variety of shapes that are Pareto-optimal, including coccoids, all straight rods, and a range of curvatures. Comparison with an extensive morphological survey of motile curved-rod bacteria indicates that the vast majority of species fall within the Pareto-optimal region of morphospace. This result is consistent with evolutionary tradeoffs between just three tasks: efficient swimming, chemotaxis, and low cell construction cost. We thus reveal the underlying selective pressures driving morphological diversity in a wide-spread component of microbial ecosystems.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBacteria exhibit a bewildering diversity of morphologies but despite their impact on nearly all aspects of life, they are frequently classified into a few general categories, usually just  spheres and  rods. Curved-rod bacteria are one simple variation and are widespread, particularly in the ocean. However, why so many species have evolved this shape is unknown. We show that curvature can increase swimming efficiency, revealing a widely-applicable selective advantage. Furthermore, we show that the distribution of cell lengths and curvatures observed across bacteria in nature are predicted by evolutionary tradeoffs between three tasks influenced by shape: efficient swimming, the ability to detect chemical gradients, and reduced cost of cell construction. We therefore reveal shape as an important component of microbial fitness.",

Transcriptional profiling of fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), the dominant stromal population of the LN, revealed reprogramming of these cells in immune related pathways, but also in fibroblast activation and mitochondrial function. However, tumor derived factors driving the changes in FRCs remained to be identified. Taking an unbiased approach, we show that lactate, a metabolite released by cancer cells, elicits upregulation of Pdpn and Thy1 in FRCs of TDLNs, making them akin to activated fibroblasts found at the primary tumor site. Furthermore, we show that tumor-derived lactate alters mitochondrial function of FRCs of TDLNs. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which a tumor-derived metabolite modulates the function of fibroblasts in TDLNs.",

During early development, Lmx1b is essential for induction and maintenance of the Isthmic Organizer (IsO), and genetic ablation results in the disruption of inductive activity from the IsO and loss of properly differentiated mdDA neurons.\\n\\nTo study the downstream targets of Lmx1b without affecting the IsO, we generated a conditional model in which Lmx1b was selectively deleted in Pitx3 expressing cells from embryonic day (E)13 onward. Supporting previous data, no significant changes could be observed in general dopamine (DA) marks, like Th, Pitx3 and Vmat2 at E14.5. However, in depth analysis by means of RNA-sequencing revealed that Lmx1b is important for the expression level of survival factors En1 and En2 and for the repression of mdDA subset mark Ahd2 during (late) development. Interestingly, the regulation of Ahd2 by Lmx1b was found to be Pitx3 independent, since Pitx3 levels were not altered in Lmx1b conditional knock-outs (cKO) and Ahd2 expression was also up-regulated in Lmx1b/Pitx3 double mutants compared to Pitx3 mutants. Further analysis of Lmx1b cKOs showed that post-mitotic deletion of Lmx1b additional leads to a loss of TH+ cells at 3 months age both in the VTA and SNc. Remarkably, different cell types were affected in the SNc and the VTA. While TH+AHD2+ cells were lost the SNc, TH+AHD2- neurons were affected in the VTA, reflected by a loss of Cck expression, indicating that Lmx1b is important for the survival of a sub-group of mdDA neurons.",

    "abstract": "The polycomb group proteins (PcGs) are a group of epigenetic factors associated with gene silencing. They are found in several families of multiprotein complexes, including Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2. EZH2, EED and SUZ12 form the core components of the PRC2 complex, which is responsible for the mono, di- and trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27Me3), the chromatin mark associated with gene silencing. Loss-of-function studies of Ezh2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2, have shown that PRC2 plays a role in regulating developmental transitions of neuronal progenitor cells; from self-renewal to differentiation and the neurogenic-to-gliogenic fate switch.\\n\\nTo further address the function of EZH2 and H3K27me3 during neuronal development we generated a conditional mutant in which Ezh2 was removed in the mammalian isthmic (mid-hindbrain) region from E10.5 onward. Loss of Ezh2 changed the molecular coding of the anterior ventral hindbrain leading to a fate switch and the appearance of ectopic dopaminergic neurons. The correct specification of the isthmic region is dependent on the signaling factors produced by the Isthmic organizer (IsO), located at the border of the mid- and hindbrain. We propose that the change of cellular fate is a result of the presence of Otx2 in the hindbrain of Ezh2 conditional knock-outs and a dysfunctional IsO, as represented by the loss of Fgf8 and Wnt1. Our work implies that next to controlling developmental transitions, EZH2 mediated gene silencing is important for specification of the isthmic region by influencing IsO functioning and repressing Otx2 in the hindbrain.",

    "abstract": "lonotropic Receptors (IRs) are a large, divergent subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors(iGluRs), with roles in chemosensation, thermosensation and hygrosensation. Analogous to the synaptic targeting mechanisms of their iGluR ancestors, IRs are thought to form complexes of broadly-expressed co-receptors and selectively-expressed  tuning receptors to localise to sensory cilia. While tuning receptors extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD) defines sensory specificity, the role of this domain in co-receptors is unclear. We identify a coreceptor-specific sequence in the LBD, which contains a single N-glycosylation site. Combining molecular genetic and cell biological analyses, we show that this site is dispensable for assembly of IR complexes in olfactory sensory neurons, but essential for endoplasmic reticulum exit of some,but not all, IR complexes. Our data reveal an important role for the IR co-receptor LBD in control of intracellular transport, provide novel insights into the stoichiometry and assembly of IR complexes, and uncover an unexpected heterogeneity in the trafficking regulation of this sensory receptor family.",

While structural biology methods can provide atomic details of static protein structures, these approaches cannot in general resolve less populated, functionally relevant conformations and uncover conformational kinetics. Here we demonstrate a new paradigm for illuminating dynamic conformational landscapes of target proteins. SETD8 (Pr-SET7/SET8/KMT5A) is a biologically relevant protein lysine methyltransferase for in vivo monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 and nonhistone targets. Utilizing covalent chemical inhibitors and depleting native ligands to trap hidden high-energy conformational states, we obtained diverse novel X-ray structures of SETD8. These structures were used to seed massively distributed molecular simulations that generated six milliseconds of trajectory data of SETD8 in the presence or absence of its cofactor. We used an automated machine learning approach to reveal slow conformational motions and thus distinct conformational states of SETD8, and validated the resulting dynamic conformational landscapes with multiple biophysical methods. The resulting models provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics plays a role in SAM binding and thus catalysis, and how this function can be modulated by diverse cancer-associated mutants. These findings set up the foundation for revealing enzymatic mechanisms and developing inhibitors in the context of conformational landscapes of target proteins.",

Across most sexually reproducing animals, centrosomes are provided to the oocyte through fertilization and must be positioned properly to establish the zygotic mitotic spindle. How centrosomes are positioned in space and time through the concerted action of key mitotic entry biochemical regulators including Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A-B55/SUR-6), biophysical regulators including Dynein and the nuclear lamina is unclear. Here, we uncover a role for PP2A-B55/SUR-6 in regulating centrosome positioning. Mechanistically, PP2A-B55/SUR-6 regulates nuclear size prior to mitotic entry, in turn affecting nuclear envelope-based Dynein density and motor capacity. Using computational simulations, PP2A-B55/ SUR-6 regulation of nuclear size and nuclear envelope Dynein density were both predicted to be required for proper centrosome positioning. Conversely, compromising nuclear lamina integrity led to centrosome detachment from the nuclear envelope and migration defects. Removal of PP2A-B55/SUR-6 and the nuclear lamina simultaneously further disrupted centrosome positioning, leading to unseparated centrosome pairs dissociated from the nuclear envelope. Taken together, we propose a model in which centrosomes migrate and are positioned through the concerted action of nuclear envelope-based Dynein pulling forces and cen-trosome-nuclear envelope tethering.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade several components have been identified to be differentially expressed in subsets of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons. These differences in molecular profile have been implied to be involved in the selective degeneration of the SNc neurons in Parkinsons disease. The emergence and maintenance of individual subsets is dependent on different transcriptional programs already present during development. In addition to the influence of transcription factors, recent studies have led to the hypothesis that modifications of histones might also influence the developmental program of neurons. In this study we focus on the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and its role in the development and maintenance of mdDA neurons. We generated two different conditional knock out (cKO) mice; an En1Cre driven cKO, for deletion of Ezh2 in mdDA progenitors and a Pitx3Cre driven cKO, to study the effect of post-mitotic deletion of Ezh2 on mdDA neurons maturation and neuronal survival. During development Ezh2 was found to be important for the generation of the proper amount of TH+ neurons. The loss of neurons primarily affected a rostrolateral population, which is also reflected in the analysis of the subset marks, Ahd2 and Cck. In contrast to early genetic ablation, post-mitotic deletion of Ezh2 did not lead to major developmental defects at E14.5. However, in 6 months old animals Cck was found ectopically in the rostral domain of mdDA neurons and Ahd2 expression was reduced in more mediocaudal positioned cells. In addition, Pitx3Cre driven deletion of Ezh2 led to a progressive loss of TH+ cells in the VTA and these animals display reduced climbing behavior. Together, our data demonstrates that Ezh2 is important for the generation of mdDA neurons during development and that during adult stages Ezh2 is important for the preservation of proper neuronal subset identity and survival.",

    "abstract": "Human alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3) is one of three alkaline ceramidases (ACERs) that catalyze the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine. ACERs are the members of the CREST superfamily of integral-membrane lipid hydrolases, including the adiponectin receptors which play roles in energy metabolism. All CREST members conserve a set of three Histidine, one Aspartate, and one Serine residue. However, the structural and catalytic roles for these residues are unclear. Here, we use ACER3 as a prototype enzyme to gain insight into this unique class of enzymes. Recombinant ACER3 was expressed in yeast cells that lack endogenous ceramidase activity, and microsomes were used for biochemical characterization. Six point mutantions of the conserved CREST motif were developed that are predicted to form a Zn-dependent active site based on homology with the human adiponectin receptors, whose crystal structures were recently determined. Five mutations completely lost their activity, except for S77A, which showed a 600-fold decrease compared with the wild-type enzyme. The activity of S77C mutation was pH sensitive, with neutral pH partially recovering ACER3 activity. This suggested a role for S77 in stabilizing the oxyanion of the transition state and differs from the proposed role in Zinc coordination for the adiponectin receptors (Vasiliauskaite-Brooks et. al., Nature, 2017). Together, these data suggest ACER3 is a Zn2+-dependent amidase that uses a catalytic mechanism for ceramide hydrolysis that is similar to other soluble Zn-based amidases. Consistent with this mechanism, ACER3 was specifically inhibited by trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, which is a strong chelator of Zinc.",

    "abstract": "Centriole is an essential structure with multiple functions in cellular processes. Centriole biogenesis and homeostasis is tightly regulated. Using electron cryo-tomography (cryoET) we present the structure of procentrioles from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We identified a set of non-tubulin components attached to the triplet microtubule (MT), many are at the junctions of tubules likely to reinforce the triplet. We describe structure of the A-C linker that bridges neighboring triplets. We find that POC1 is an integral component of the A-C linker. Its conserved WD40 {beta}-propeller domain provides sites for attachment to other A-C linker components. The twist of A-C linker results in an iris diaphragm-like motion of the triplets in the longitudinal direction of procentriole. Finally, we identified two assembly intermediates at the growing ends of procentriole allowing us to propose a model for the procentriole assembly. Our results provide a comprehensive structural framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning procentriole biogenesis and assembly.",

    "abstract": "Replicative senescence is the permanent growth arrest caused by gradual telomere attrition occurring at each round of genome replication. Critically shortened telomeres lose their protective shelterin complex and t-loop structure revealing uncapped chromosome ends that are recognized as DNA double-strand breaks causing a p53-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) towards proliferation arrest. Because telomeres are heterogeneous in length within a single cell, the number of short telomeres necessary for senescence onset remains ill defined. Using controlled Tin2-mediated shelterin inactivation, we show that telomere uncapping is not sufficient to trigger senescence. While uncapping generates expected telomeric DNA damage detection, the associated weak DDR allows a rapid bypass of the primary growth arrest and re-entry into the cell cycle despite dysfunctional telomeres. During the ensuing mitosis, fused telomeres lead to additional DNA breaks and to genomic instability including chromosomes bridges or micronuclei, which sustain a secondary entry into stable growth arrest. The loss of p53 prevented both primary and secondary growth arrest, leading to amplified genomic instablility. Our results support a new multistep model for entry into telomere-mediated replicative senescence in normal cells, which is not directly induced by telomere uncapping, but rather by an amplification of DNA lesions caused by telomere fusions that leads to permanent irreparable genome damage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is a fundamental component of multicellular organisms that orchestrates developmental processes and controls cell and tissue organization. We previously identified the novel ECM protein SNED1 as a promoter of breast cancer metastasis and showed that its level of expression negatively correlated with survival of breast cancer patients. Here we sought to identify the roles of SNED1 during murine development and in physiology.\n\nResultsWe generated two novel Sned1 knockout mouse strains and showed that Sned1 is essential since homozygous ablation of the gene led to ~67% early neonatal lethality. Phenotypic analysis of the surviving knockout mice obtained revealed a role for SNED1 in the development of craniofacial and skeletal structures since Sned1 knockout resulted in growth defects, nasal cavity occlusion, and craniofacial malformations. Sned1 is widely expressed in embryos, notably in neural-crest derivatives. We further show here that mice with a neural-crest-cell-specific deletion of Sned1 survive, but display facial anomalies partly phenocopying the global knockout mice.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate requisite roles for SNED1 during development and neonatal survival. Importantly, the deletion of 2q37.3 in humans, a region that includes the SNED1 locus, has been associated with facial dysmorphism and short stature.",
