    "abstract": "Animals must integrate the activity of multiple mechanoreceptors to navigate complex environments. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the general roles of the mechanosensory neurons have been defined, but most studies involve end-point or single-time-point measurements, and thus lack dynamical information. Here, we formulate a set of unbiased quantitative characterizations of the mechanosensory system by using reverse correlation analysis on behavior. We use a custom tracking, selective illumination, and optogenetics platform to compare two mechanosensory systems: the gentle-touch (TRNs) and harsh-touch (PVD) circuits. This method yields characteristic linear filters that allow for prediction of behavioral responses. The resulting filters are consistent with previous findings, and further provide new insights on the dynamics and spatial encoding of the systems. Our results suggest that the tiled network of the gentle-touch neurons has better resolution for spatial encoding than the harsh-touch neurons. Additionally, linear-nonlinear models accurately predict behavioral responses based only on sensory neuron activity. Our results capture the overall dynamics of behavior induced by the activation of sensory neurons, providing simple transformations that quantitatively characterize these systems. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to capture the behavioral dynamics induced by any neuron or other excitable cells in the animal.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimals constantly integrate the activity of neurons throughout their bodies to choose the most appropriate behavior. A key goal in quantitative neuroscience is to characterize and predict how neuronal circuits control and modulate behavior. C. elegans, a nematode with a fully mapped connectome, is an ideal model organism for elucidating the links between neuronal circuits and behavior. However, many studies relating activity in neurons to behavior rely on spontaneous behavior and lack information about their dynamics. In this study, we formulate unbiased quantitative characterizations of sensory neurons in C. elegans using with reverse correlation analysis with a white noise stimulus. We use optogenetics to stimulate body touch sensory neurons in freely moving worms, and provide quantitative descriptions that capture the dynamic transformations between sensory neuron activity and behavioral outputs. Our results are consistent with previous findings, and additionally provide new insights on the spatial encoding of these systems. Our system provides a simple platform for characterizing the behavioral output due to specific neurons, and can be extended to any excitable cell in the animal.",

    "abstract": "The nature of artificial vision with a retinal prosthesis, and the degree to which the brain can adapt to the unnatural input from such a device, are poorly understood. Therefore, the development of current and future devices may be aided by theory and simulations that help to infer and understand what prosthesis patients see. A biologically-informed, extensible computational framework is presented here to predict visual perception and the potential effect of learning with a subretinal prosthesis. The framework relies on optimal linear reconstruction of the stimulus from retinal responses to infer the visual information available to the patient. A simulation of the physiological optics of the eye and light responses of the major retinal neurons was used to calculate the optimal linear transformation for reconstructing natural images from retinal activity. The result was then used to reconstruct the visual stimulus during the artificial activation expected from a subretinal prosthesis in a degenerated retina, as a proxy for inferred visual perception. Several simple observations reveal the potential utility of such a simulation framework. The inferred perception obtained with prosthesis activation was substantially degraded compared to the inferred perception obtained with normal retinal responses, as expected given the limited resolution and lack of cell type specificity of the prosthesis. Consistent with clinical findings and the importance of cell type specificity, reconstruction using only ON cells, and not OFF cells, was substantially more accurate. Finally, when reconstruction was re-optimized for prosthesis stimulation, simulating the greatest potential for learning by the patient, the accuracy of inferred perception was much closer to that of healthy vision. The reconstruction approach thus provides a more complete method for exploring the potential for treating blindness with retinal prostheses than has been available previously. It may also be useful for interpreting patient data in clinical trials, and for improving prosthesis design.",

The moving particles are interpreted as clusters of cancer cells while stationary particles correspond to micro-tumors and metastases. The analysis of expected particle location, their locational variance, the furthest particle distribution, and the extinction probability leads to a common type of differential equation, namely, a non-local integro-differential equation with distributed delay. We prove global existence and uniqueness results for this type of equation. The solutions asymptotic behavior for long time is characterized by an explicit index, a metastatic reproduction number R0: metastases spread for R0 > 1 and become extinct for R0 < 1.

Here, we report the effect of the CCI on surrogate scores of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis.\n\nMethodsThis was a non-randomized longitudinal study, including adults with T2D who were self-enrolled to the CCI (n=262) or to receive usual care (UC, n=87) during one year. A NAFLD liver fat score [N-LFS] > -0.640 defined the presence of fatty liver. A NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS] of > 0.675 identified subjects with advanced fibrosis. Changes in N-LFS and NFS at one year were the main endpoints.\n\nResultsAt baseline, NAFLD was present in 95% of patients in the CCI and 90% of patients in the UC. At one year, weight loss of > 5% was achieved in 79% of patients in the CCI vs. 19% of patients in UC (P<0.001). N-LFS mean score was reduced in the CCI group (-1.95{+/-}0.22, P<0.001) whereas it was not changed in the UC (0.47{+/-}0.41, P=0.26) (CCI vs. UC, P<0.001).

In the CCI group, the percentage of individuals with a low probability of advanced fibrosis increased from 18% at baseline to 33% at 1 year (P<0.001).\n\nConclusionsOne year of a digitally-supported CCI significantly improved surrogates of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nDATA SHARINGData sets and statistical code used for the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\nArticle Summary Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis study highlights the beneficial effect of the CCI on NAFLD in high risk patients with T2D\nC_LIO_LIThis study also identifies positive associations between glycemic improvements and improvements in ALT levels\nC_LIO_LIThe assessment of resolution of steatosis and fibrosis is limited by the sensitivity and specificity of the non-invasive markers used in the study\nC_LIO_LIThe patients were restricted in their carbohydrate intake and monitored for their nutritional ketosis state, but dietary energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intakes were not assessed.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Language encoding models help explain language processing in the human brain by learning functions that predict brain responses from the language stimuli that elicited them. Current word embedding-based approaches treat each stimulus word independently and thus ignore the influence of context on language understanding. In this work, we instead build encoding models using rich contextual representations derived from an LSTM language model. Our models show a significant improvement in encoding performance relative to state-of-the-art embeddings in nearly every brain area. By varying the amount of context used in the models and providing the models with distorted context, we show that this improvement is due to a combination of better word embeddings learned by the LSTM language model and contextual information. We are also able to use our models to map context sensitivity across the cortex. These results suggest that LSTM language models learn high-level representations that are related to representations in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic connectivity, measured using resting-state fMRI, has emerged as a fundamental tool in the study of the human brain. However, due to practical limitations, many studies do not collect enough resting-state data to generate reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity necessary for studying individual differences. Here we present general functional connectivity (GFC) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task fMRI and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that GFC offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, GFC displays higher heritability on average than resting-state functional connectivity. We also show that predictions of cognitive ability from GFC generalize across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that GFC can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of GFC rather than solely using resting-state data. Moreover, by better capturing heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, GFC represents a novel endophenotype with broad applications in clinical neuroscience and biomarker discovery.",

    "abstract": "Many neuroimaging studies have investigated reward processing dysfunction in major depressive disorder. These studies have led to the common idea that major depressive disorder is associated with blunted responses within the reward circuit, particularly in the ventral striatum. Yet, the link between major depressive disorder and reward-related responses in other regions remains inconclusive, thus limiting our understanding of the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. To address this issue, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 41 whole-brain neuroimaging studies encompassing reward-related responses from a total of 794 patients with major depressive disorder and 803 healthy controls. Our findings argue against the common idea that major depressive disorder is primarily linked to deficits within the reward system. Instead, our results demonstrate that major depressive disorder is associated with opposing abnormalities in the reward circuit: hypo-responses in the ventral striatum and hyper-responses in the orbitofrontal cortex. The current findings suggest that dysregulated corticostriatal connectivity may underlie reward-processing abnormalities in major depressive disorder, providing an empirical foundation for a more refined understanding of abnormalities in the reward circuitry in major depressive disorder.",

Inhibiting ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons abolished cue-induced reward seeking but not reward retrieval, indicating that this pathway modulates response vigor but not reward expectancy. Locally inhibiting dopamine inputs to nucleus accumbens also disrupted cue-elicited reward seeking but not retrieval. Interestingly, the suppression produced by this treatment was greater in rats that responded to cues with exploratory reward seeking, without attempting to retrieve reward, than in rats exhibiting complete bouts of seeking with retrieval, indicating that individuals differ in their reliance on a dopamine-mediated motivational process.

    "abstract": "Peptide drugs have been used in the treatment of multiple pathologies. During peptide discovery, it is crucially important to be able to map the potential sites of cleavages of the proteases. This knowledge is used to later chemically modify the peptide drug to adapt it for the therapeutic use, making peptide stable against individual proteases or in complex medias. In some other cases it needed to make it specifically unstable for some proteases, as peptides could be used as a system to target delivery drugs on specific tissues or cells. The information about proteases, their sites of cleavages and substrates are widely spread across publications and collected in databases such as MEROPS. Therefore, it is possible to develop models to improve the understanding of the potential peptide drug proteolysis. We propose a new workflow to derive protease specificity rules and predict the potential scissile bonds in peptides for individual proteases. WebMetabase stores the information from experimental or external sources in a chemically aware database where each peptide and site of cleavage is represented as a sequence of structural blocks connected by amide bonds and characterized by its physicochemical properties described by Volsurf descriptors. Thus, this methodology could be applied in the case of non-standard amino acid. A frequency analysis can be performed in WebMetabase to discover the most frequent cleavage sites. These results were used to train several models using logistic regression, support vector machine and ensemble tree classifiers to map cleavage sites for several human proteases from four different families (serine, cysteine, aspartic and matrix metalloproteases). Finally, we compared the predictive performance of the developed models with other available public tools PROSPERous and SitePrediction.",

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of the brain has become a mainstay of fundamental neuroscience research and an increasingly prevalent clinical therapy. Despite decades of use in basic neuroscience research and the growing prevalence of neuromodulation therapies, gaps in knowledge regarding activation or inactivation of neural elements over time have limited its ability to adequately interpret evoked downstream responses or fine-tune stimulation parameters to focus on desired responses. In this work, in vivo two-photon microscopy was used to image neuronal calcium activity in layer 2/3 neurons of somatosensory cortex (S1) in male C57BL/6J-Tg(Thy1-GCaMP6s)GP4.3Dkim/J mice during 30 s of continuous electrical stimulation at varying frequencies. We show frequency-dependent differences in spatial and temporal somatic responses during continuous stimulation. Our results elucidate conflicting results from prior studies reporting either dense spherical activation of somas biased towards those near the electrode, or sparse activation of somas at a distance via axons near the electrode. These findings indicate that the neural element specific temporal response local to the stimulating electrode changes as a function of applied charge density and frequency. These temporal responses need to be considered to properly interpret downstream circuit responses or determining mechanisms of action in basic science experiments or clinical therapeutic applications.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMicrostimulation of small populations of neurons has the potential to ameliorate symptoms associated with several neurological disorders. However, the specific mechanisms by which microstimulation elicits therapeutic responses are unclear. This work examines the effects of continuous microstimulation on the local population of neurons surrounding the implanted electrode. Stimulation was found to elicit spatiotemporal neuronal responses in a frequency dependent manner. These findings suggest that stimulation frequency may be an important consideration for applications in research or therapy. Further research aimed at understanding these neuronal activation properties may provide insight into the mechanistic mode of action of continuous microstimulation.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions have been implicated in facilitating adaptation in the face of high levels of gene flow, but whether chromosomal fusions also have similar potential remains poorly understood. Atlantic salmon are usually characterized by population structure at multiple spatial scales; however, this is not the case for tributaries of the Miramichi River in North America. To resolve genetic relationships between populations in this system and the potential for known chromosomal fusions to contribute to adaptation we genotyped 728 juvenile salmon using a 50K SNP array. Consistent with previous work, we report extremely weak overall population structuring (Global FST = 0.004) and failed to support hierarchical structure between the rivers two main branches. We provide the first genomic characterization of a previously described polymorphic fusion between chromosomes 8 and 29. Fusion genomic characteristics included high LD, reduced heterozygosity in the fused homokaryotes, and strong divergence between the fused and the unfused rearrangement. Population structure based on fusion karyotype was five times stronger than neutral variation (FST = 0.019) and the frequency of the fusion was associated with summer precipitation supporting a hypothesis that this rearrangement may contribute local adaptation despite weak neutral differentiation. Additionally, both outlier variation among populations and a polygenic framework for characterizing adaptive variation in relation to climate identified a 250 Kb region of chromosome 9, including the gene six6 that has previously been linked to age-at-maturity and run-timing for this species. Overall our results indicate that adaptive processes, independent of major river branching, are more important than neutral processes for structuring these populations.",

    "abstract": "Behavioural consistency (i.e., personality) is a novel field of research in amphibians. Current published studies often address only one or two aspects of personality and therefore cannot assess more complex relationships and behavioural syndromes. This is the first study focusing on all relevant behavioural traits and their relationships in urodele amphibians. Based on the three trials of the experiment, we examined the consistency of activity (time spent moving), boldness (latency of the first movement and time spent escaping) and exploration (number of visited segments of testing arena) of 42 smooth newts (Lissotriton vulgaris). Individual consistency, calculated through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), was low in newt activity (ICC = 0.192) and moderate in boldness (0.476) and exploration (0.403). Activity was moderately consistent for each trial (0.425), indicating a possible habituation, supported by a decrease of mean activity throughout the trials. Correlation of the behavioural traits studied suggests the presence of a behavioural syndrome, which potentially shaped the traits together. Our findings suggest the need for a complex approach to the study of amphibian personality and the need for standardized methodology, which would solve the current difficulties in comparing published results.",

    "abstract": "A number of recent studies have shown that cell shape and cytoskeletal texture can be used as sensitive readouts of the physiological state of the cell. However, utilization of this information requires the development of quantitative measures that can describe relevant aspects of cell shape. In this paper we develop a toolbox, TISMorph, to calculate set of quantitative measures to address this need. Some of the measures introduced here are used previously and others are new and have desirable properties for shape and texture quantification of cells. These measures, broadly classifiable into the categories of textural, spreading and irregularity measures, are tested by using them to discriminate between osteosarcoma cell lines treated with different cytoskeletal drugs. We find that even though specific classification tasks often rely on a few measures, these are not the same between all classification tasks, thus requiring the use of the entire suite of measures for classification and discrimination. We provide detailed descriptions of the measures, well as TISMorph package to implement them. Image based quantitative analysis has the potential to become a new field of biological data (\\\"image-omics\\\"), providing quantitative insight into cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "Cephalopod mollusks evolved numerous anatomical innovations, including specialized arms and tentacles, but little is known about the developmental mechanisms underlying the evolution of cephalopod limbs. Here we show that all three axes of cuttlefish limbs are patterned by the same signaling networks that act in vertebrates and arthropods, although they evolved limbs independently. In cuttlefish limb buds, Hedgehog is expressed anteriorly. Posterior transplantation of Hedgehog-expressing cells induced mirror-image limb duplications. Bmp and Wnt signaling, which establishes dorsoventral polarity in vertebrate and arthropod limbs, is similarly polarized in cuttlefish. Inhibition of the dorsal Bmp signal caused ectopic expression of Notum, a ventral sucker field marker, and development of ectopic suckers. Cuttlefish limbs also show proximodistally regionalized expression of Htx, Exd, Dll, Dac, Sp8/9, and Wnt genes, which delineate arm and tentacle sucker fields. These results suggest that cephalopod limbs evolved by parallel activation of an ancient genetic program for appendage development that was present in the bilaterian common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSleep disruption is frequently associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hyperglycemia. We recently reported the effectiveness of a continuous care intervention (CCI) emphasizing nutritional ketosis for improving HbA1c, body weight and cardiovascular risk factors in T2D patients. The present study assessed the effect of this CCI approach on sleep quality using a subjective patient-reported sleep questionnaire.\n\nMethodsA non-randomized, controlled longitudinal study; 262 T2D and 116 prediabetes patientsenrolled in the CCI and 87 separately recruited T2D patients continued usual care (UC) treatment. Patients completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. A PSQI score of >5 (scale 0 to 21) was used to identify poor sleepers.\n\nResultsGlobal sleep quality improved in the CCI T2D (p<0.001) and prediabetes (p<0.001) patients after one year of intervention. Subjective sleep quality (component 1), sleep disturbance (component 5) and daytime dysfunction (component 7), also showed improvements in the CCI T2D (p<0.01 for sleep quality and sleep disturbance; and p<0.001 for daytime dysfunction) and prediabetes patients (p<0.001 for all three components); compared to the UC T2D group after one year. The proportion of patients with poor sleep quality was significantly reduced after one year of CCI (T2D; from 68.3% at baseline to 56.5% at one year, p=0.001 and prediabetes; from 77.9% at baseline to 48.7% at one year, p<0.001).\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates improved sleep quality as assessed by PSQI in patients with T2D and prediabetes undergoing CCI including nutritional ketosis but not in T2D patients receiving UC. The dietary intervention benefited both sleep quality and the severity of T2D symptoms suggesting that nutritional ketosis improves overall health via multiple mechanisms.",

In this work, we discuss the utility of this method to record calcium signals in brain tissue with two-photon frequency-division multiplexing (2P-FDM) microscopy. While frequency-multiplexed imaging appears slightly inferior in terms of image quality as compared to conventional two-photon laser scanning microscopy due to shot noise-induced cross-talk between frequency channels, applying this technique to record average signals from regions of interest (ROI) such as neuronal cell bodies was found to be promising. We use phase information associated with each pixel or waveform within a selected ROI to phase-align and recombine the signals into one extended amplitude-modulated waveform. This procedure narrows the frequency detection window, effectively decreasing noise contributions from other frequency channels. Using theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and in vitro imaging we demonstrate a reduction of cross-talk by more than an order of magnitude and predict the usefulness of 2P-FDM for functional studies of brain activity.",

Probabilistic models provide a low-error, compressed representation of single cell data that enables efficient large-scale computations. We apply PopAlign to analyze the impact of 40 different immunomodulatory compounds on a heterogeneous population of donor-derived human immune cells as well as patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma. PopAlign scales to comparisons involving tens to hundreds of samples, enabling large-scale studies of natural and engineered cell populations as they respond to drugs, signals or physiological change.",

In addition to causing direct damage due to the removal of photoassimilates, R. maidis transmits several destructive maize viruses, including Maize yellow dwarf virus, Barley yellow dwarf virus, Sugarcane mosaic virus, and Cucumber mosaic virus.\\n\\nFindingsA 326-Mb genome assembly of BTI-1, a parthenogenetically reproducing R. maidis clone, was generated with a combination of PacBio (208-fold coverage) and Illumina sequencing (80-fold coverage), which contains a total of 689 contigs with an N50 size of 9.0 Mb. The contigs were further clustered into four scaffolds using the Phase Genomics Hi-C interaction maps, consistent with the commonly observed 2n = 8 karyotype of R. maidis. Most of the assembled contigs (473 spanning 321 Mb) were successfully orientated in the four scaffolds. The R. maidis genome assembly captured the full length of 95.8% of the core eukaryotic genes, suggesting that it is highly complete. Repetitive sequences accounted for 21.2% of the assembly, and a total of 17,647 protein-coding genes were predicted in the R. maidis genome with integrated evidence from ab initio and homology-based gene predictions and transcriptome sequences generated with both PacBio and Illumina. An analysis of likely horizontally transferred genes identified two from bacteria, seven from fungi, two from protozoa, and nine from algae.\\n\\nConclusionsA high-quality R. maidis genome was assembled at the chromosome level. This genome sequence will enable further research related to ecological interactions, virus transmission, pesticide resistance, and other aspects of R. maidis biology.

Despite the scale of the outbreak, limited genomic sequence data were available from Colombia. We sought to sequence additional samples and use genomic epidemiology to describe ZIKV dynamics in Colombia.\\n\\nMethodsWe sequenced ZIKV genomes directly from clinical diagnostic specimens and infected Aedes ae-gypti samples selected to cover the temporal and geographic breadth of the Colombian outbreak. We performed phylogeographic analysis of these genomes, along with other publicly-available ZIKV genomes from the Americas, to estimate the frequency and timing of ZIKV introductions to Colombia.\\n\\nResultsWe attempted PCR amplification on 184 samples; 19 samples amplified sufficiently to perform sequencing. Of these, 8 samples yielded sequences with at least 50% coverage. Our phylogeo-graphic reconstruction indicates two separate introductions of ZIKV to Colombia, one of which was previously unrecognized. We find that ZIKV was first introduced to Colombia in February 2015 (95%CI: Jan 2015 - Apr 2015), corresponding to 5 to 8 months of cryptic ZIKV transmission prior to confirmation in September 2015. Despite the presence of multiple introductions, we find that the majority of Colombian ZIKV diversity descends from a single introduction. We find evidence for movement of ZIKV from Colombia into bordering countries, including Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.\\n\\nConclusionsSimilarly to genomic epidemiologic studies of ZIKV dynamics in other countries, we find that ZIKV circulated cryptically in Colombia. This more accurate dating of when ZIKV was circulating refines our definition of the population at risk. Additionally, our finding that the majority of ZIKV transmission within Colombia was attributable to transmission between individuals, rather than repeated travel-related importations, indicates that improved detection and control might have succeeded in limiting the scale of the outbreak within Colombia.",

    "abstract": "A large body of work on neural encoding has focused on \\\"cascade\\\" type models such as the linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model. This approach seeks to describe the encoding process in terms of a series of stages: (1) projection of the stimulus onto a bank of linear filters; (2) a nonlinear function combining these filter outputs; and (3) a noisy spike generation process. Here we explore the relationship of the LNP modeling framework to more recent approaches arising from the deep learning literature. Specifically, we show that deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models of neural activity sit firmly within the LNP framework, and correspond to particular parametrizations of the nonlinear stage of the LNP model. Using data from primate retina and primary visual cortex, we compare the performance of LNP models fit with deep learning methods to LNP models fit with traditional estimators, including spike-triggered covariance (STC), information-theoretic spike-triggered averaging and covariance (iSTAC), and maximum likelihood estimators also known as \\\"maximally informative dimensions\\\" (MID). We show that models with nonlinearities parametrized by deep networks achieve higher accuracy for a fixed number of filters, and can extract a larger number of informative filters than traditional models. Finally, we perform a dimensionality analysis of LNP models trained with deep learning methods, revealing that a large number of filters are needed to accurately describe the neural responses of many cells even early in the visual pathway. This result overturns one of the central tenets of the LNP modeling framework: that neural computations are low-dimensional, or depend on the stimulus only via its projection onto a small number of linear filters. We discuss the implications of these findings for both the fitting and interpretation of LNP encoding models.",

    "abstract": "Contrast enhanced ultrasound is a radiation-free imaging modality which uses encapsulated gas microbubbles for improved visualization of the vascular bed deep within the tissue. It has recently been used to enable imaging with unprecedented subwavelength spatial resolution by relying on super-resolution techniques. A typical preprocessing step in super-resolution ultrasound is to separate the microbubble signal from the cluttering tissue signal. This step has a crucial impact on the final image quality. Here, we propose a new approach to clutter removal based on robust principle component analysis (PCA) and deep learning. We begin by modeling the acquired contrast enhanced ultrasound signal as a combination of a low rank and sparse components. This model is used in robust PCA and was previously suggested in the context of ultrasound Doppler processing and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging. We then illustrate that an iterative algorithm based on this model exhibits improved separation of microbubble signal from the tissue signal over commonly practiced methods. Next, we apply the concept of deep unfolding to suggest a deep network architecture tailored to our clutter filtering problem which exhibits improved convergence speed and accuracy with respect to its iterative counterpart. We compare the performance of the suggested deep network on both simulations and in-vivo rat brain scans, with a commonly practiced deep-network architecture and the fast iterative shrinkage algorithm, and show that our architecture exhibits better image quality and contrast.",

    "abstract": "In a warned reaction time (RT) task, corticospinal excitability (CSE) decreases in task-related muscles at the time of the imperative signal (preparatory inhibition). Because RT tasks emphasise speed of response, it is impossible to distinguish whether preparatory inhibition reflects a mechanism preventing premature reactions, or whether it is an inherent part of movement preparation. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study CSE changes preceding RT movements and movements that were either self-paced (SP) or performed at predictable times to coincide with an external event (PT). Results show that CSE changes over a similar temporal profile in all cases, suggesting that preparatory inhibition is a necessary state in planned movements allowing the transition between rest and movement. Additionally, TMS given shortly before the times to move speeded the onset of movements in both RT and SP contexts, suggesting that their initiation depends on a form of trigger that can be conditioned by external signals. On the contrary, PT movements do not show this effect, suggesting the use of a mechanistically different triggering strategy. This relative immunity of PT tasks to be biased by external events may reflect a mechanism that ensures priority of internal predictive signals to trigger movement onset.",

Here we present a database of 10,449 morphological descriptions of insect eggs, with records for 6,706 unique insect species and representatives from every extant hexapod order. The dataset includes eggs whose volumes span more than eight orders of magnitude. We created this database by partially automating the extraction of egg traits from the primary literature. In the process, we overcame challenges associated with large-scale phenotyping by designing and employing custom bioinformatic solutions to common problems. We matched the taxa in this database to the currently accepted scientific names in taxonomic and genetic databases, which will facilitate the use of this data for testing pressing evolutionary hypotheses in offspring size evolution.",

    "abstract": "The underlying physical causes of SOD1-related ALS are still not well-understood. We address this problem here by computationally designing two de novo mutants, A89R and K128N, which were predicted theoretically to be either significantly destabilizing or stabilizing respectively. We subjected these in silico designed mutants to a series of experimental tests, including in vitro measures of thermodynamic stability, cell-based aggregation and toxicity assays, and an in vivo developmental model of zebrafish motor neuron axonopathy. The experimental tests validated the theoretical predictions: A89R is an unstable, highly-deleterious mutant, and K128N is a stable, non-toxic mutant. Moreover, K128N is predicted computationally to form an unusually stable heterodimer with the familial ALS mutant A4V. Consistent with this prediction, co-injection of K128N and A4V into zebrafish shows profound rescue of motor neuron pathology. The demonstrated success of these first principles calculations to predict the physical properties of SOD1 mutants holds promise for rationally designed therapies to counter the progression of ALS.\\n\\nSignificanceMutations in the protein superoxide dismutase cause ALS, and many of these mutants have decreased folding stability. We sought to pursue this thread using a synthetic biology approach, where we designed two de novo mutations, one stabilizing and one destabilizing, as predicted using computational molecular dynamics simulations. We then tested these mutants using in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo zebrafish models. We found that the unstable mutant was toxic, and induced a severe ALS phenotype in zebrafish; the predicted stable mutant, on the other hand, behaved even better than WT. In fact, it was able to rescue the ALS phenotype caused by mutant SOD1. We propose a mechanism for this rescue, which may provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in computational methods have facilitated large-scale sampling of protein structures, leading to breakthroughs in protein structural prediction and enabling de novo protein design. Establishing methods to identify candidate structures that can lead to native folds or designable structures remains a challenge, since few existing metrics capture high-level structural features such as architectures, folds, and conformity to conserved structural motifs. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in semantic segmentation -- a subfield of image classification in which a class label is predicted for every pixel. Here, we apply semantic segmentation to protein structures as a novel strategy for fold identification and structural quality assessment. We represent protein structures as 2D -carbon distance matrices (\\\"contact maps\\\"), and train a CNN that assigns each residue in a multi-domain protein to one of 38 architecture classes designated by the CATH database. Our model performs exceptionally well, achieving a per-residue accuracy of 90.8% on the test set (95.0% average accuracy over all classes; 87.8% average within-structure accuracy). The unique aspect of our classifier is that it encodes sequence agnostic residue environments from the PDB and can assess structural quality as quantitative probabilities. We demonstrate that individual class probabilities can be used as a metric that indicates the degree to which a randomly generated structure assumes a specific fold, as well as a metric that highlights non-conformative regions of a protein belonging to a known class. These capabilities yield a powerful tool for guiding structural sampling for both structural prediction and design.\\n\\nSignificanceRecent computational advances have allowed researchers to predict the structure of many proteins from their amino acid sequences, as well as designing new sequences that fold into predefined structures. However, these tasks are often challenging because they require selection of a small subset of promising structural models from a large pool of stochastically generated ones. Here, we describe a novel approach to protein model selection that uses 2D image classification techniques to evaluate 3D protein models. Our method can be used to select structures based on the fold that they adopt, and can also be used to identify regions of low structural quality. These capabilities yield a powerful tool for both protein design and structure prediction.",

Recent studies presented conflicting results over the impact of CRISPR on genome expansion. In this study, we assembled a comprehensive dataset of prokaryotic genomes and identified their associations with phages and plasmids. We found that genomes associated with phages and/or plasmids were significantly larger than those without, indicating that both phages and plasmids contribute to genome expansion. Genomes were increasingly larger with increasing numbers of associated phages or plasmids. Conversely, genomes with CRISPR systems were significantly smaller than those without, indicating that CRISPR has a negative impact on genome size. These results confirmed that on evolutionary timescales, bacteriophages and plasmids facilitate genome expansion, while CRISPR impairs such a process in prokaryotes. Furthermore, our results also revealed that CRISPR systems show a strong preference for targeting phages over plasmids.",

Calcium transients in ASP cytonemes correlate with signaling activity. Calcium transients in the ASP require GluRII, are activated by L-glutamate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion channel expressed in the wing disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and NASPM.

    "abstract": "Many forms of congenital heart disease (CHD) have high morbidity-mortality rates and require challenging surgeries. Human amniocytes have important stem cell characteristics and could potentially provide patient-specific tissue for repairs of some types of CHDs. We report that amniocytes express features of poised cardiomyocytes. However, a variety of direct reprogramming approaches failed to convert their fetal and transcriptionally repressed state into bona fide cardiomyocytes. Induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming removes repression and converts amniocytes to a baseline pluripotent state. Based on molecular and electrophysiological signatures, iPSC reprogrammed amniocytes can be induced to differentiate into functionally immature, predominantly ventricular cardiomyocytes and a heterogeneous mixture of vascular and unspecified epithelial cells. Developmental time course analyses and pattern clustering of amniocyte-derived cardiomyocytes identifies numerous temporal co-regulators of cardiac induction and maturation as well as distinct sarcomeric and ion channel gene signatures. Normal fetal cardiomyocytes are derived by overcoming complex forms of transcriptional repression that suppress direct transdifferentiation of human amniocytes. These results suggest the possibility of using amniocytes as a source of patient-specific ventricular cardiomyocytes for cell therapies.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTAmniocytes are a possible source of patient-specific cardiomyocytes for newborns with congenital heart disease.

In the past several years much progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic and extrinsic controls of GSC regulation but the complex gene regulatory networks that regulate stem cell behavior are only partially understood. HP1 is a dynamic epigenetic determinant mainly involved in heterochromatin formation, epigenetic gene silencing and telomere maintenance. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed the importance of HP1 in DNA repair, sister chromatid cohesion and, surprisingly, in positive regulation of gene expression. Here, we show that HP1 plays a crucial role in the control of GSC homeostasis in Drosophila. Our findings demonstrate that HP1 is required intrinsically to promote GSC self-renewal and progeny differentiation by directly stabilizing the transcripts of key genes involved in GSCs maintenance.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments, RNA transcripts are extracted and measured from isolated cells to understand gene expression at the cellular level. Measurements from this technology are affected by many technical artifacts, including batch effects. In analogous bulk gene expression experiments, external references, e.g., synthetic gene spike-ins often from the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), may be incorporated to the experimental protocol for use in adjusting measurements for technical artifacts. In scRNA-seq experiments, the use of external spike-ins is controversial due to dissimilarities with endogenous genes and uncertainty about sufficient precision of their introduction. Instead, endogenous genes with highly stable expression could be used as references within scRNA-seq to help normalize the data. First, however, a specific notion of stable expression at the single cell level needs to be formulated; genes could be stable in absolute expression, in proportion to cell volume, or in proportion to total gene expression. Different types of stable genes will be useful for different normalizations and will need different methods for discovery.\\n\\nResultsWe compile gene sets whose products are associated with cellular structures and record these gene sets for future reuse and analysis. We find that genes whose final product are associated with the cytosolic ribosome have expressions that are highly stable with respect to the total RNA content. Notably, these genes appear to be stable in bulk measurements as well.\\n\\nSupplementary informationThe Supplement is available on bioRxiv, and the gene set database is available through GitHub.\\n\\nContactjohanngb@umich.edu",

    "abstract": "The genome-wide chromatin occupancy of the TCF/LEF factors and its modulation by Wnt pathway activation remain poorly defined. Here, we describe mouse ES cell (mESC) lines expressing a single copy knock-in of the 3xFLAG epitope at the N-terminus of TCF7L1 and TCF7, the two most-highly expressed TCF/LEF factors in mESCs. TCF7L1 protein levels, detected by immunoblotting with a FLAG antibody, were much higher than TCF7 in mESCs maintained in standard serum- and LIF-supplemented medium, even in the presence of the GSK-3 inhibitor, CHIR99021 (CHIR). We used FLAG antibody-mediated ChIP-seq to determine TCF7 and TCF7L1 chromatin occupancy in mESCs cultured in standard medium with or without CHIR for 14 hours. TCF7 and TCF7L1 displayed very few overlapping ChIP peaks across the genome, with TCF7L1 binding significantly more genes than TCF7 in both culture conditions. Despite a reduction in total TCF7L1 protein after CHIR treatment, the TCF7L1 ChIP peak profiles were not uniformly attenuated. Our data demonstrate that TCF7L1 chromatin occupancy upon short-term CHIR treatment is modulated in a target-specific manner. Our findings also suggest that Wnt target genes in mESCs are not regulated by TCF/LEF switching, and TCF7L1, although often called a constitutive repressor, may serve as a transcriptional activator of certain target genes in CHIR-treated mESCs.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIChIP and cytometry data suggest that TCF7L1 does not directly regulate mESC Nanog expression.\\nC_LIO_LITCF7L1 remains associated with {beta}-catenin in the presence of CHIR99021.\\nC_LIO_LITCF7 and TCF7L1 display different chromatin occupancies in mESCs.\\nC_LIO_LITCF7L1 binding at specific genomic sites is variably altered by CHIR99021.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Rigorous exploration and dissection of potential actions and effects of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in animals remain challenging. Here using multiple knockout mouse models and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that the divergent lncRNA Hand2as has a key, complex modulatory effect on the expression of its neighboring gene HAND2 and subsequently on heart development and function, largely independent of Hand2as transcription and transcripts. Full-length deletion of Hand2as in mouse causes moderate yet prevalent upregulation of HAND2 in hundreds of cardiac cells, resulting in profound biological consequences, including dysregulated cardiac gene programs, congenital heart defects and perinatal lethality. We propose a cis-functional role for the Hand2as locus in dampening HAND2 expression to restrain cardiomyocyte proliferation, thereby orchestrating a balanced development of cardiac cell lineages. This study highlights the need for complementary genetic and single-cell approaches to delineate the function and primary molecular effects of an lncRNA in animals.\\n\\nImpact statementThe long noncoding RNA Hand2as critically controls the precise expression of its neighboring gene HAND2, thereby balancing cardiac lineages and expression programs that are essential for heart development and function.",

Recent studies have suggested that microenvironmental crosstalk mediated by exosomes is an important factor in the escape of tumour cells from the anti-tumour immune system in human haematopoietic malignancies. Here, we conducted comprehensive analysis of the miRNA and protein profiles within the exosomes released from four canine lymphoid tumour cell lines as a model of human lymphoid tumours. The results showed that the miRNAs and proteins abundantly contained in exosomes were similar among the four cell lines. However, the profiles of miRNA within exosomes differed among the cell lines and reflected the expression pattern of miRNAs of the parent cells. In the comparison of the amounts of miRNAs and proteins among the cell lines, those of three miRNAs (miR-151, miR-8908a-3p, and miR-486) and CD82 protein differed between exosomes derived from vincristine-sensitive and resistant cell lines. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the biological functions of the exosomal contents in the microenvironmental crosstalk of lymphoid tumours.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe full scope of the genes expressed by schistosomes during intramolluscan development has yet to be characterized. Understanding the gene products deployed by larval schistosomes in their snail hosts will provide insights into their establishment, maintenance, asexual reproduction, ability to castrate their hosts, and their prolific production of human-infective cercariae. Using the Illumina platform, the intramolluscan transcriptome of Schistosoma mansoni was investigated in field-derived specimens of the prominent vector species Biomphalaria pfeifferi at 1 and 3 days post infection (d) and from snails shedding cercariae. These S. mansoni samples were derived from the same snails used in our complementary B. pfeifferi transcriptomic study. We supplemented this view with microarray analyses of S. mansoni from B. glabrata at 2d, 4d, 8d, 16d, and 32d.\\n\\nPrincipal FindingsTranscripts representing at least 7,740 (66%) of known S. mansoni genes were expressed during intramolluscan development, with the greatest number expressed in snails shedding cercariae. Many transcripts were constitutively expressed throughout development featuring membrane transporters, and metabolic enzymes involved in protein and nucleic acid synthesis and cell division. Several proteases and protease inhibitors were expressed at all stages, including some proteases usually associated with cercariae. Transcripts associated with G-protein coupled receptors, germ cell perpetuation, and stress responses and defense were well represented. We noted transcripts homologous to planarian anti-bacterial factors, several neural development or neuropeptide transcripts including neuropeptide Y, and receptors that may be associated with schistosome germinal cell maintenance and that could also impact host reproduction. In at least one snail the presence of larvae of another digenean species (an amphistome) was associated with repressed S. mansoni transcriptional activity.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThis in vivo study, particularly featuring field-derived snails and schistosomes, provides a distinct view from previous studies of development of cultured intramolluscan stages from lab-maintained organisms. We found many highly represented transcripts with suspected or unknown functions, with connection to intramolluscan development yet to be elucidated.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSchistosoma mansoni is one of the most important schistosome species causing the neglected tropical disease human intestinal schistosomiasis. By focusing on S. mansoni in vivo with its broadly distributed sub-Saharan African snail intermediate host, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, we uncover new insights and basic knowledge of this host-parasite relationship that are critical for understanding schistosomiasis transmission. We show that in vivo studies, particularly using field-derived specimens, provides a distinct view from the uniformed transcriptional responses traditionally seen from in vitro studies on S. mansoni and Biomphalaria snails. With the growing consensus that we need to supplement chemotherapy with other control methods, understanding how S. mansoni interacts with its obligatory snail host becomes integral for future planning of control programs. The data provided within provides specific analysis on how the schistosomes successfully protect themselves from host defenses and the necessary transcriptional responses required for its amplifying asexual proliferation that result in human-infective cercariae.",

    "abstract": "Rhizobia inoculation can increase soybean yield, but its performance is influenced by soybean genotype, rhizobia strains, environment, and crop management among others. The objective of the study was to assess soybean response to rhizobia inoculation when grown in soils amended with urea or Vermicompost to improve nitrogen levels. Two greenhouse experiments and one field trial at two sites were carried out. The first greenhouse experiment included soils from sixty locations, sampled from smallholder farms in Western Kenya. The second greenhouse experiment consisted of one soil selected from soils used in the first experiment where inoculation response was poor. The soil was amended with Vermicompost or urea. In the two greenhouse experiments, Legumefix(R) (inoculant) + Sympal (legume fertilizer blend) were used as a standard package. Results from the second greenhouse experiment were then validated in the field. In the first greenhouse trial, soybean response to inoculation was significantly affected by soil fertility based on nodule fresh weight and shoot biomass. Soils with low nitrogen had low to no response to inoculation. After amendment, nodule fresh weight, nodule effectiveness, nodule occupancy, and shoot dry biomass were greater in the treatment amended with Vermicompost than those amended with urea (Legumefix(R) + Sympal + Vermicompost and Legumefix(R) + Sympal + urea). Under field conditions, trends were similar to the second experiment for nodulation, nodule occupancy, and nitrogen uptake resulting in significantly greater grain yields (475, 709, 856, 880, 966 kg ha-1) after application of Vermicompost at 0, 37, 74, 111, and 148 kg N ha-1, respectively. It was concluded that soybean nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation in low fertility soils would not be suppressed by organic amendments like Vermicompost up to 148 kg N ha-1.",

Exogenous fatty acids were required likely due to suppression of intrinsic fatty acid synthesis by hypoxia and low cytokine conditions. By contrast, high cytokine concentrations or normoxia induced HSC proliferation and differentiation. Our novel culture system provides a means to evaluate properties of steady state HSCs and test effects of defined factors in vitro under near-physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Malaria has had a major effect on the human genome, with many protective polymorphisms such as sickle cell trait having been selected to high frequencies in malaria endemic regions1, 2. Recently, we showed that a novel blood group variant, Dantu, provides 74% protection against all forms of severe malaria in homozygous individuals3-5. This is a similar degree of protection to sickle cell trait and considerably greater than the most advanced malaria vaccine, but until now the mechanism of protection has been unknown. In the current study, we demonstrate a significant impact of Dantu on the ability of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites to invade RBCs. The Dantu variant was associated with extensive changes to the RBC surface protein repertoire, but unexpectedly the malaria protective effect did not correlate with specific RBC-parasite receptor-ligand interactions. By following invasion using video microscopy, we found a strong link between RBC tension and parasite invasion and, even in non-Dantu RBCs, identified a tension threshold above which RBC invasion did not occur. Dantu RBCs had higher average tension, meaning that a higher proportion of Dantu RBCs could not be invaded. These findings not only provide an explanation for the protective effect of Dantu against severe malaria, but also provide fresh insights into the essential process of P. falciparum parasite invasion, and how invasion efficiency varies across the heterogenous populations of RBCs that are present both within and between individuals.",

Efforts have been made to reconcile these theories within a three-stage model, but the relevance of each theory remains controversial. We tested the validity of each theory with a single dataset using unbiased single-cell whole-brain imaging and data-driven analyses of neuronal activity in a mouse model of alcohol use disorder. Abstinence in alcohol dependent mice decreased brain modularity and resulted in clustering of brain regions that correspond to each stage of the three-stage theory of addiction. Furthermore, we identified several brain regions whose activity highly predicted addiction-like behaviors and \\\"hub\\\" regions that may drive neural activation during abstinence.

    "abstract": "Sign-tracking behavior, in which animals interact with a cue that predicts reward, provides an example of how incentive salience can be attributed to cues and elicit motivation. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum (VP) are two regions involved in cue-driven motivation. The VP, and subregions of the NAc including the medial shell and core, are critical for sign-tracking, and connections between the medial shell and VP are known to participate in sign-tracking and other motivated behaviors. The NAc lateral shell (NAcLSh) is a distinct and understudied subdivision of the NAc, and its contribution to the process by which reward cues acquire value remains unclear. The NAcLSh has been implicated in reward-directed behavior, and has reciprocal connections with the VP, suggesting that NAcLSh and VP interactions could be important mechanisms for incentive salience. Here, we use DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) and an intersectional viral delivery strategy to produce a biased inhibition of NAcLSh neurons projecting to the VP, and vice versa. We find that disruption of connections from NAcLSh to VP reduces sign-tracking behavior while not affecting consumption of food rewards. In contrast, VP to NAcLSh disruption affected neither sign-tracking nor reward consumption, but did produce a greater shift in animals behavior more towards the reward source when it was available. These findings indicate that the NAcLSh[-&gt;]VP pathway plays an important role in guiding animals towards reward cues, while VP[-&gt;]NAcLSh back-projections may not and may instead bias motivated behavior towards rewards.",

    "abstract": "Physical models of biological systems can become difficult to interpret when they have a large number of parameters. But the models themselves actually depend on (i.e. are sensitive to) only a subset of those parameters. Rigorously identifying this subset of \\\"stiff\\\" parameters has been made possible by the development of parameter space compression (PSC). However, PSC has only been applied to analytically-solvable physical models. We have generalized this powerful method by developing a numerical approach to PSC that can be applied to any computational model. We validated our method against analytically-solvable models of random walk with drift and protein production and degradation. We then applied our method to an active area of biophysics research, namely to a simple computational model of microtubule dynamic instability. Such models have become increasingly complex, perhaps unnecessarily. By adding two new parameters that account for prominent structural features of microtubules, we identify one that can be \\\"compressed away\\\" (the \\\"seam\\\" in the microtubule) and another that is essential to model performance (the \\\"tapering\\\" of microtubule ends). Furthermore, we show that the microtubule model has an underlying, low-dimensional structure that explains the vast majority of our experimental data. We argue that numerical PSC can identify the low-dimensional structure of any computational model in biophysics. The low-dimensional structure of a model is easier to interpret and identifies the mechanisms and experiments that best characterize the system.",

From these experiments, we derive a mathematical model of glioma progression focusing on cellular phenotypic plasticity.

    "abstract": "Correlated motions of proteins and their bound solvent molecules are critical to function, but these features are difficult to resolve using traditional structure determination techniques. Time-resolved methods hold promise for addressing this challenge but have relied on the exploitation of exotic protein photoactivity, and are therefore not generalizable. Temperature-jumps (T-jumps), through thermal excitation of the solvent, have been implemented to study protein dynamics using spectroscopic techniques, but their implementation in X-ray scattering experiments has been limited. Here, we perform T-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) measurements on a dynamic enzyme, cyclophilin A (CypA), demonstrating that these experiments are able to capture functional intramolecular protein dynamics. We show that CypA displays rich dynamics following a T-jump, and use the resulting time-resolved signal to assess the kinetics of conformational changes in the enzyme. Two relaxation processes are resolved, which can be characterized by Arrhenius behavior. We also used mutations that have distinct functional effects to disentangle the relationship of the observed relaxation processes. A fast process is related to surface loop motions important for substrate specificity, whereas a slower process is related to motions in the core of the protein that are critical for catalytic turnover. These results demonstrate the power of time-resolved X-ray scattering experiments for characterizing protein and solvent dynamics on the s-ms timescale. We expect the T-jump methodology presented here will be useful for understanding kinetic correlations between local conformational changes of proteins and their bound solvent molecules, which are poorly explained by the results of traditional, static measurements of molecular structure.",

    "abstract": "The absence of detergent and curvature makes nanodiscs to be excellent membrane mimetics. The lack of structural and mechanistic model of polymer-encapsulated lipid-nanodiscs limits their use to study the structure, dynamics and function of membrane proteins. In this study, we parametrized and optimized the coarse-graining (CG) bead-mapping for two differently charged and functionalized copolymers, namely styrene-maleic acid (SMAEA) and polymethacrylate (PMAQA), for the Martini force-field framework and showed nanodisc formation (< 8 nm diameter) on a time scale of tens of microseconds using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Structural models of ~ 2.0 or 4.8 kDa PMAQA and ~2.2 kDa SMAEA polymer based lipid-nanodiscs highlights the importance of polymer chemical structure, size and polymer:lipid molar ratio in the optimization of nanodisc structure. The ideal spatial arrangement of polymers in nanodisc, nanodisc size and thermal stability obtained from our MD simulation correlates well with the experimental observations. The polymer-nanodisc were tested for the reconstitution of single-pass or multi-pass transmembrane proteins. We expect this study to be useful in the development of novel polymer based lipid-nanodiscs and for the structural studies of membrane proteins.\n\nTOC GRAPHICS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=199 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476556v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ae71c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af961borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a7e6c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4a9a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Understanding the molecular targets by which such fusion oncoproteins promote malignancy offers an approach to develop rational treatment strategies to improve clinical outcomes. CIC-DUX4 is a transcription factor fusion that defines certain undifferentiated round cell sarcomas with high metastatic propensity and poor clinical outcomes. The molecular targets regulated by the CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein that promote this aggressive malignancy remain largely unknown. We show that increased expression of ETV4 and CCNE1 occurs via neo-morphic, direct effects of CIC-DUX4 and drives tumor metastasis and survival, respectively. We demonstrate a molecular dependence on the CCNE-CDK2 cell cycle complex that renders CIC-DUX4 tumors sensitive to inhibition of the CCNE-CDK2 complex, highlighting a therapeutic strategy for CIC-DUX4 tumors.

    "abstract": "A deficiency in BRG1, the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, results in a meiotic arrest during spermatogenesis. Here, we explore the causative mechanisms. BRG1 is preferentially enriched at active promoters of genes essential for spermatogonial pluripotency and meiosis. In contrast, BRG1 is also associated with the repression of somatic genes. Chromatin accessibility at these target promoters is dependent upon BRG1. These results favor a model where BRG1 coordinates spermatogenic transcription to ensure meiotic progression. In spermatocytes, BRG1 interacts with SCML2, a testes specific PRC1 factor that is associated with the repression of somatic genes. We present evidence to suggest that BRG1 and SCML2 concordantly regulate genes during meiosis. Furthermore, BRG1 is required for the proper localization of SCML2 and its associated deubiquitinase, USP7, to the sex chromosomes during pachynema. SCML2 associated, mono ubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) and acetylation of histone lysine 27 (H3K27ac) are elevated in Brg1cKO testes. Coincidentally, the PRC1 ubiquitin ligase, RNF2 is activated while a histone H2A/H2B deubiquitinase, USP3 is repressed. Thus, BRG1 impacts the male epigenome by influencing the localization and expression of epigenetic modifiers. This mechanism highlights a novel paradigm of co-operativity between SWI/SNF and PRC1.\\n\\nSummary statementBRG1, a catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, interacts with SCML2 (Sex comb on midleg-like 2), a polycomb repressive 1 (PRC1) factor, to regulate transcription during spermatogenesis. This represents a novel paradigm of SWI/SNF-PRC1 co-operation during gametogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The time of onset of the second cell fate decision in the mouse preimplantation embryo is still unknown. Ohnishi et al. (2014) looked for cell heterogeneity in the ICM at E3.25 that could indicate the time preceding the apparent segregation of PE and EPI at E3.5, but were not able to detect an early splitting transcriptomics event using state-of-the-art clustering techniques. We developed a new clustering algorithm, hierarchical optimal k-means (HOkM), and identified from single cell (sc) transcriptomics microarray data two groups of ICM cells during the 32 to 64 mouse embryo transition: from embryos with less than 34 cells, and more than 33 cells, corresponding to two developmental sub-stages. The genes defining these sub-stages indicate that the development of the embryo to 34 cells triggers a dramatic event as a result of which Bsg is high expressed, the canonical Wnt pathway is activated, Oct4 is stabilized to high expression and the chromatin remodeling program is initialized to establish a very early narve pluripotent state from the preceding totipotency. We characterized our HOkM partition comparing with independent scRNA-seq datasets. It was staggering to discover that from the 3.4360x1010 possible bi-partitions of the E3.25 data of Ohnishi et al. (2014), our HOkM discovered one partition that shares the biological features of the early and late 32 ICM cells of Posfai et al. (2017). We propose that the stabilization of Oct4 expression is a non-cell autonomous process that requires a minimal number of four inner cell contacts acquired during the transition from a homogeneous outer-cell environment to a heterogeneous inner/outer cell environment formed by the niche of a kernel of at least six inner cells covered by trophectoderm.",

    "abstract": "Achieving high intraspecific genetic diversity is a critical goal in ecological restoration as it increases the adaptive potential and long-term resilience of populations. Thus, we investigated genetic diversity within and between pristine sites in a fossil flood-plain and compared it to sites restored by hay-transfer between 1997 and 2014. RAD-seq genotyping revealed that the stenoecious flood-plain species Arabis nemorensis is co-occurring in pristine and restored sites with its relative Arabis sagittata, which has a documented preference for dry calcareous grasslands but has not been reported in floodplain meadows. We show that hay-transfer maintains genetic diversity for both species. In addition, in A. sagittata, transfer from multiple genetically isolated pristine sites resulted in restored sites with increased diversity and admixed local genotypes. In A. nemorensis, transfer also maintained diversity, but did not create novel admixture dynamics because genetic diversity between pristine sites was less differentiated. Thus, the effects of hay-transfer on genetic diversity also depend on the genetic makeup of each species in the donor communities, especially when material is mixed. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of hay-transfer for habitat restoration and emphasize the importance of pre-restoration characterization of micro-geographic patterns of intraspecific diversity of the community to guarantee that restoration practices reach their goal, i.e. maximize the adaptive potential of the entire restored plant community. Overseeing these patterns may differentially alter the adaptive potential of species present, thereby altering the balance between species in the community. Additionally, our comparison of summary statistics obtained from de novo and reference-based RAD-seq pipelines show that the genomic impact of restoration can be reliably monitored on species lacking prior genomic knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common cause of death from cancer among women worldwide, so there is a pressing need to identify factors influencing mortality. Much OC patient clinical data is now publically accessible (including patient age, cancer site stage and subtype), as are large datasets of OC gene transcription profiles. These have enabled studies correlating OC patient survival with clinical variables and with gene expression but it is not well understood how these two aspects interact to influence mortality. To study this we integrated clinical and tissue transcriptome data from the same patients available from the Broad Institute Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) portal. We investigated OC mRNA expression levels (relative to normal patient tissue) of 26 genes already strongly implicated in OC, assessed how their expression in OC tissue predicts patient survival then employed Cox Proportional Hazard regression models to analyse both clinical factors and transcriptomic information to determine relative risk of death associated with each factor. Multivariate analysis of combined data (clinical and gene mRNA expression) found age, ovary tumour site and cancer stage IB significantly correlated with patient survival. Univariate analysis also confirmed significant differences in patient survival time when altered transcription levels of KLK6, CD36, MEF2C and SCGB2A1 were evident, while multivariate analysis that considered the 26 genes simultaneously revealed a significant relationship of mortality with KLK6, CD36 and E2F1 genes. However, analysis that considered all 26 genes with clinical variables together identified WFDC2, E2F1, BRCA1, KLK6, SCGB2A1 and SLPI genes as independently related to mortality in OC. This indicated that the latter genes affect OC patient survival, i.e., provided mechanistic and predictive information in addition to that of the clinical traits and provide strong evidence that these genes are critical markers of processes that underlie OC progression and mortality.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe evolutionary probability (EP) of an allele in a DNA or protein sequence predicts evolutionarily permissible (ePerm; EP [&ge;] 0.05) and forbidden (eForb; EP < 0.05) variants. EP of an allele represents an independent evolutionary expectation of observing an allele in a population based solely on the long-term substitution patterns captured in a multiple sequence alignment. In the neutral theory, EP and population frequencies can be compared to identify neutral and non-neutral alleles. This approach has been used to discover candidate adaptive polymorphisms in humans, which are eForbs segregating with high frequencies. The original method to compute EP requires the evolutionary relationships and divergence times of species in the sequence alignment (a timetree), which are not known with certainty for most datasets. This requirement impedes a general use of the original EP formulation. Here, we present an approach in which the phylogeny and times are inferred from the sequence alignment itself prior to the EP calculation. We evaluate if the modified EP approach produces results that are similar to those from the original method.\n\nResultsWe compared EP estimates from the original and the modified approaches by using more than 18,000 protein sequence alignments containing orthologous sequences from 46 vertebrate species. For the original EP calculations, we used species relationships from UCSC and divergence times from TimeTree web resource, and the resulting EP estimates were considered to be the ground truth. We found that the modified approaches produced reasonable EP estimates for HGMD disease missense variant and 1000 Genomes Project missense variant datasets. Our results showed that reliable estimates of EP can be obtained without a priori knowledge of the sequence phylogeny and divergence times. We also found that, in order to obtain robust EP estimates, it is important to assemble a dataset with many sequences, sampling from a diversity of species groups.\n\nConclusionWe conclude that the modified EP approach will be generally applicable for alignments and enable the detection of potentially neutral, deleterious, and adaptive alleles in populations.",

We employed a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design to probe the impact of pharmacological enhancement of catecholamine levels on perceptual decision making. Catecholamine levels were manipulated using the clinically relevant drugs methylphenidate (MPH) and atomoxetine (ATM) and their effects were compared to those of citalopram (CIT), and placebo (PLA). Participants performed a classic EEG oddball paradigm which elicits the P3b, a centro-parietal potential that has been shown to trace evidence accumulation, under each of the four drug conditions. We found that MPH and ATM administration shortened RTs to the oddball targets. The neural basis of this behavioural effect was an earlier P3b peak latency, driven specifically by an increase in its build-up rate without any change in its time of onset or peak amplitude. This study provides neurophysiological evidence for the catecholaminergic enhancement of a discrete aspect of human decision making, i.e. evidence accumulation. Our results also support theoretical accounts suggesting that catecholamines may enhance cognition via increases in neural gain.",

Yet, the extent and exact mechanisms underlying sensory attenuation are still debated. To explore this issue, we asked participants to decide which of two visual stimuli was of higher contrast in a virtual reality situation where one of the stimuli could appear behind the participants invisible moving hand or not. Over two experiments, we measured the effects of such \\\"virtual occlusion\\\" on first-order sensitivity and on metacognitive monitoring. Our findings show that self-generated hand movements reduced the apparent contrast of the stimulus. This result can be explained by the active inference theory.

    "abstract": "Many genes differentially expressed in brain tissue from human alcoholics and animals that have consumed large amounts of alcohol are components of the innate immune toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. TLRs initiate inflammatory responses via two branches: (1) MyD88-dependent or (2) TRIF-dependent. All TLRs signal through MyD88 except TLR3. Prior work demonstrated a direct role for MyD88-dependent signaling in regulation of alcohol consumption. However, the role of TLR3 as a potential regulator of excessive alcohol drinking has not previously been investigated. To test the possibility TLR3 activation regulates alcohol consumption, we injected mice with the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and tested alcohol consumption in an every-other-day two-bottle choice test. Poly(I:C) produced a persistent increase in alcohol intake that developed over several days. Repeated poly(I:C) and ethanol exposure altered innate immune transcript abundance; increased levels of TRIF-dependent pathway components correlated with increased alcohol consumption. Administration of poly(I:C) before exposure to alcohol did not alter alcohol intake, suggesting that poly(I:C) and ethanol must be present together to change drinking behavior. To determine which branch of TLR signaling mediates poly(I:C)-induced changes in drinking behavior, we tested either mice lacking MyD88 or mice administered a TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor. MyD88 null mutants showed poly(I:C)-induced increases in alcohol intake. In contrast, mice pretreated with a TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor reduced their alcohol intake, suggesting poly(I:C)-induced escalations in alcohol intake function are, at least partially, dependent on TLR3. Together, these results strongly suggest that TLR3-dependent signaling drives excessive alcohol drinking behavior.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIActivation of TLR3 via poly(I:C) increased alcohol intake.\\nC_LIO_LIPoly(I:C) and ethanol must be present together to change drinking behavior.\\nC_LIO_LIIncreased alcohol intake due to poly(I:C) is independent of MYD88.\\nC_LIO_LIIncreased alcohol intake due to poly(I:C) is dependent on TLR3.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AimThere is a dearth of evidence that determines the genetic diversity of populations contained within present-day protected areas compared with their historic state prior to large-scale species declines, making inferences about a species conservation genetic status difficult to assess. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the use of historic specimens to assess the change in genetic diversity over a defined spatial area.\\n\\nLocationLike other species, African lion populations (Panthera leo) are undergoing dramatic contractions in range and declines in numbers, motivating the identification of a number of lion conservation strongholds across East and southern Africa. We focus on one such stronghold, the Kavango-Zambezi transfrontier conservation area (KAZA) of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\\n\\nMethodsWe compare genetic diversity between historical museum specimens, collected during the late 19th and early 20th century, with samples from the modern extant population. We use 16 microsatellite markers and sequence 337 base pairs of the hypervariable control region (HVR1) of the mitochondrial genome. We use bootstrap resampling to allow for comparisons between the historic and modern data.\\n\\nResultsWe show that the genetic diversity of the modern population was reduced by 12% to 17%, with a reduction in allelic diversity of approximately 15%, compared to historic populations, in addition to having lost a number of mitochondrial haplotypes. We also identify reduced allelic diversity and a number of  ghost alleles in the historical samples no longer present in the extant population.\\n\\nMain ConclusionsWe argue a rapid decline in allelic richness after 1895 suggests the erosion of genetic diversity coincides with the rise of a European colonial presence and the outbreak of rinderpest in the region. Our results support the need to improved connectivity between protected areas in order to prevent further loss of genetic diversity in the region.",

    "abstract": "Stimuli that resemble the content of visual working memory (VWM) capture attention. However, theories disagree on how many VWM items can bias attention simultaneously. The multiple-state account posits a distinction between template and accessory VWM items, such that only a single template item biases attention. In contrast, homogenous-state accounts posit that all VWM items bias attention. Recently, Van Moorselaar et al. (2014) and Hollingworth and Beck (2016) tested these accounts, but obtained seemingly contradictory results. Van Moorselaar et al. (2014) found that a distractor in a visual-search task captured attention more when it matched the content of VWM (memory-driven capture). Crucially, memory-driven capture disappeared when more than one item was held in VWM, in line with the multiple-state account. In contrast, Hollingworth and Beck (2016) found memory-driven capture even when multiple items were kept in VWM, in line with a homogenous-state account. Considering these mixed results, we replicated both studies with a larger sample, and found that all key results are reliable. It is unclear to what extent these divergent results are due to paradigm differences between the studies. We conclude that is crucial to our understanding of VWM to determine the boundary conditions under which memory-driven capture occurs.",

    "abstract": "Ageing has been shown to impact multisensory perception, but the underlying computational mechanisms are unclear. For effective interactions with the environment, observers should integrate signals that share a common source, weighted by their reliabilities, and segregate those from separate sources. Observers are thought to accumulate evidence about the worlds causal structure over time until a decisional threshold is reached.\\n\\nCombining psychophysics and Bayesian modelling, we investigated how ageing affects audiovisual perception of spatial signals. Older and younger adults were comparable in their final localisation and common-source judgement responses under both speeded and unspeeded conditions, but were disproportionately slower for audiovisually incongruent trials.\\n\\nBayesian modelling showed that ageing did not affect the ability to arbitrate between integration and segregation under either unspeeded or speeded conditions. However, modelling the within-trial dynamics of evidence accumulation under speeded conditions revealed that older observers accumulate noisier auditory representations for longer, set higher decisional thresholds, and have impaired motor speed. Older observers preserve audiovisual localisation performance, despite noisier sensory representations, by sacrificing response speed.",

    "abstract": "The ability to pass on learned information to progeny could present an evolutionary advantage for many generations. While apparently evolutionarily conserved1-12, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) is not well understood at the molecular or behavioral levels. Here we describe our discovery that C. elegans can pass on a learned pathogenic avoidance behavior to their progeny for several generations through epigenetic mechanisms. Although worms are initially attracted to the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa (PA14)13, they can learn to avoid this pathogen13. We found that prolonged PA14 exposure results in transmission of avoidance behavior to progeny that have themselves never been exposed to PA14, and this behavior persists through the fourth generation. This form of transgenerational inheritance of bacterial avoidance is specific to pathogenic P. aeruginosa, requires physical contact and infection, and is distinct from CREB-dependent long-term associative memory and larval imprinting. The TGF-{beta} ligand daf-7, whose expression increases in the ASJ upon initial exposure to PA1414, is highly expressed in the ASI neurons of progeny of trained mothers until the fourth generation, correlating with transgenerational avoidance behavior. Mutants of histone modifiers and small RNA mediators display defects in naive PA14 attraction and aversive learning. By contrast, the germline-expressed PRG-1/Piwi homolog15 is specifically required for transgenerational inheritance of avoidance behavior. Our results demonstrate a novel and natural paradigm of TEI that may optimize progeny decisions and subsequent survival in the face of changing environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Odor identity is encoded by spatiotemporal patterns of activity in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In natural environments, the intensity and timescales of odor signals can span several orders of magnitude, and odors can mix with one another, potentially scrambling the combinatorial code mapping neural activity to odor identity. Recent studies have shown that in Drosophila melanogaster the ORNs that express the olfactory co-receptor Orco scale their gain inversely with mean odor concentration according to the Weber-Fechner Law of psychophysics. Here we use a minimal biophysical model of signal transduction, ORN firing, and signal decoding to investigate the implications of this front-end scaling law for the neural representations of odor identity. We find that Weber-Fechner scaling enhances coding capacity and promotes the reconstruction of odor identity from dynamic odor signals, even in the presence of confounding background odors and rapid intensity fluctuations. We show that these enhancements are further aided by downstream transformations in the antennal lobe and mushroom body. Thus, despite the broad overlap between individual ORN tuning curves, a mechanism of front-end adaptation, when endowed with Weber-Fechner scaling, may play a vital role in preserving representations of odor identity in naturalistic odor landscapes.",
