    "abstract": "The proteinaceous extracellular matrix (ECM) is vital for cancer cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. However, little is known regarding metabolic pathways required in the ECM secretion process. By using an unbiased computational approach, we searched for enzymes whose suppression may lead to disruptions in protein secretion. Here, we show that 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD), a cytosolic enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism, is required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structural integrity and protein secretion. Chemical inhibition or genetic suppression of its activity led to cell stress accompanied by significantly expanded ER volume and can be rescued by compensating glutathione supplies. Our results also suggest that this characteristic ER-dilation phenotype may be a general marker indicating increased ECM protein congestion inside cells and decreased secretion. Thus, PGD exemplifies a nexus of cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism and protein secretion.",

    "abstract": "Intraflagellar transport (IFT), the movement of protein complexes responsible for the assembly of cilia and flagella, is remarkably well conserved from protists to humans. However, two IFT components (IFT25 and IFT27) are missing from multiple unrelated eukaryotic species. In mouse, IFT25 and IFT27 are not required for assembly of several cilia with the noticeable exception of the flagellum of spermatozoa. Here we show that the Trypanosoma brucei IFT25 protein is a proper component of the IFT-B complex and displays typical IFT trafficking. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we reveal that IFT25 and IFT27 interact within the flagellum in live cells during the IFT transport process. IFT25-depleted cells construct tiny disorganised flagella that accumulate IFT-B proteins (with the exception of IFT27, the binding partner of IFT25) but not IFT-A proteins. This phenotype is comparable to the one following depletion of IFT27 and shows that IFT25/IFT27 constitute a specific module requested for proper IFT and flagellum construction in trypanosomes. We discuss the possible reasons why IFT25/IFT27 would be required for only some types of cilia.",

    "abstract": "Microbes present survival challenge to pre-immune embryos. Our study provides evidence for antimicrobial-secretion-based strategy of zebrafish embryos against microbes during pre-immune stages. Chorion prevents physical contact between embryos and microbes, yet microbes compromise embryonic survival through their secretions. Development of embryos in microbe-free medium involves secretion of pro-microbial compounds that bacteria utilize to accelarete growth. Embryo senses presence of microbes through microbial secretions. They respond by altering their secretions to include antimicrobial compounds along with regular pro-microbial ones. Upon sensing embryonic anti-microbial secretions, microbes too alter their secretions to include more potent toxins for embryos. In response to this embryos alter their secretions to include more potent antimicrobial compounds. Ability of embryos to secrete antimicrobial compounds is positively correlated with amount of lipid droplets (LDs) in them. Inhibition of LD metabolism prevents antimicrobial secretions by embryos. Thus, LDs protect zebrafish embryos from microbes. This manuscript establishes that pre-immune embryos employ dynamically evolving biochemical warfare to protect themselves from harmful microbes.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to modulate gene expression, but their activity at the tissue-specific level remains largely uncharacterized. In order to study their contribution to tissue-specific gene expression, we developed novel tools to profile miRNA targets in the C. elegans intestine and body muscle.\n\nWe validated many previously described interactions, and identified ~3,500 novel targets. Many of the miRNA targets curated are known to modulate the functions of their respective tissues. Within our datasets we observed a disparity in the use of miRNA-based gene regulation between the intestine and body muscle. The intestine contained significantly more miRNA targets than the body muscle highlighting its transcriptional complexity. We detected an unexpected enrichment of RNA binding proteins targeted by miRNA in both tissues, with a notable abundance of RNA splicing factors.\n\nWe developed in vivo genetic tools to validate and further study three RNA splicing factors identified as miRNA targets in our study (asd-2, hrp-2 and smu-2), and show that these factors indeed contain functional miRNA regulatory elements in their 3UTRs that are able to repress their expression in the intestine. In addition, the alternative splicing pattern of their respective downstream targets (unc-60, unc-52, lin-10 and ret-1) is dysregulated when the miRNA pathway is disrupted.\n\nA re-annotation of the transcriptome data in C. elegans strains that are deficient in the miRNA pathway from past studies supports and expands on our results. This study highlights an unexpected role for miRNAs in modulating tissue-specific gene isoforms, where post-transcriptional regulation of RNA splicing factors associates with tissue-specific alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "ANK2 is a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gene where affected individuals exhibit diverse symptoms with a wide range of IQ. We report a cellular mechanism resulting in stochastic brain connectivity that provides a rationale for both gain and loss of function due to ANK2 mutation. Deficiency of giant ankyrin-B (ankB), the neurospecific ANK2 mutation target, results in ectopic CNS axon tracts associated with increased axonal branching. We elucidate a mechanism limiting axon branching, whereby giant ankB is recruited by L1CAM to periodic axonal plasma membrane domains where it coordinates cortical microtubules and prevents microtubule stabilization of nascent axon branches. Heterozygous giant ankB mutant mice exhibit innate social deficits combined with normal/enhanced cognitive function. Thus, giant ankB-deficiency results in gain of aberrant structural connectivity with penetrant behavioral consequences that may contribute to both high and low-function ASD and other forms of neurodiversity/divergence.",

    "abstract": "Human Tetherin, also known as BST-2 or CD317, is a dimeric, extracellular membrane-bound protein that consists of N and C terminal membrane anchors connected by an extracellular domain. BST-2 is involved in binding enveloped viruses, such as HIV, and inhibiting viral release in addition to a role in NF-kB signaling. Viral tethering by Tetherin can be disrupted by the interaction with Vpu in HIV-1 in addition to other viral proteins. The structural mechanism of Tetherin function is not clear and the effects of human Tetherin mutations identified by sequencing consortiums are not known. To address this gap in the knowledge, we used data from the Ensembl database to construct and model known human missense mutations within the ectodomain to investigate how the structure of the ectodomain influences function. From the data, we identified an island of sequence stability within the ectodomain, which corresponds to functionally or structurally important region identified in previous biochemical and biophysical studies. Additionally, most mutations have little effect on structure, suggesting that they would not affect function. These findings are in agreement with biochemical and cellular studies which suggest that mutations that do not disrupt the alpha helices of Tetherin have little apparent effect on function. Thus, Tetherin sequence is likely less important than structure and this apparent flexibility may allow for greater anti-viral activities with a larger number of viruses.",
