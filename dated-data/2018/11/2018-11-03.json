    "abstract": "Heterogeneity in strategies for survival and proliferation among the cells which constitute a tumour is a driving force behind the evolution of resistance to cancer therapy. The rules mapping the tumours strategy distribution to the fitness of individual strategies can be represented as an evolutionary game. We develop a game assay to measure effective evolutionary games in co-cultures of non-small cell lung cancer cells which are sensitive and resistant to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor Alectinib. The games are not only quantitatively different between different environments, but targeted therapy and cancer associated fibroblasts qualitatively switch the type of game being played by the in-vitro population from Leader to Deadlock. This observation provides empirical confirmation of a central theoretical postulate of evolutionary game theory in oncology: we can treat not only the player, but also the game. Although we concentrate on measuring games played by cancer cells, the measurement methodology we develop can be used to advance the study of games in other microscopic systems by providing a quantitative description of non-cell-autonomous effects.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that planned and corrective actions are recalibrated during some forms of motor adaptation. However, corrective (a.k.a., reactive) movements in human locomotion are thought to simply reflect sudden environmental changes independently from sensorimotor recalibration. Thus, we asked if corrective responses can indicate the motor systems adapted state following prolonged exposure to a novel walking situation inducing sensorimotor adaptation. We recorded electromyographic signals bilaterally on 15 leg muscles before, during, and after split-belts walking (i.e., novel walking situation), in which the legs move at different speeds. We exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of corrective responses upon introduction or removal of an unexpected speed transition to isolate them from the overall motor output. We found that corrective muscle activity was structurally different following short vs. long exposures to split-belts walking. Only after a long exposure, removal of the novel environment elicited corrective muscle patterns that matched those expected in response to a perturbation opposite to the one originally experienced. This indicated that individuals who recalibrated their motor system adopted split-belts environment as their new \"normal\" and transitioning back to the original walking environment causes subjects to react as if it was novel to them. Interestingly, this learning declined with age, but steady state modulation of muscle activity during split-belts walking did not, suggesting potentially different neural mechanisms underlying these motor patterns. Taken together, our results show that corrective motor commands reflect the adapted state of the motor system, which is less flexible as we age.\n\nSignificance statementWe showed that corrective muscle activity elicited by sudden environmental transitions is revealing of the underlying recalibration process during sensorimotor adaptation.

    "abstract": "Movement-related decreases in firing rate have been observed in basal ganglia output neurons. They may transmit motor signals to the thalamus, but the effect of these firing rate decreases on downstream neurons in the motor thalamus is not known. One possibility is that they lead to thalamic post-inhibitory rebound spikes. However, it has also been argued that the physiological conditions permitting rebound spiking are pathological, and primarily present in Parkinsons disease. As in Parkinsons disease neural activity becomes pathologically correlated, we investigated the impact of correlations in basal ganglia output on the transmission of motor signals using a Hodgkin-Huxley model of thalamocortical neurons. We found that such correlations disrupt the transmission of motor signals via rebound spikes by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio and increasing the trial-to-trial variability. We further examined the role of sensory responses in basal ganglia output neurons and the effect of cortical excitation of motor thalamus in modulating rebound spiking. Interestingly, both could either promote or suppress the generation of rebound spikes depending on their timing relative to the motor signal. Finally, we determined parameter regimes, such as levels of excitation, under which rebound spiking is feasible in the model, and confirmed that the conditions for rebound spiking are primarily given in pathological regimes. However, we also identified specific conditions in the model that would allow rebound spiking to occur in healthy animals in a small subset of thalamic neurons. Overall, our model provides novel insights into differences between normal and pathological transmission of motor signals.",

    "abstract": "Studies examining relationships between genotypic and phenotypic variation have historically been carried out on people of European ancestry. Efforts are underway to address this limitation, but until they succeed, the legacy of a Euro-centric bias will continue to hinder research, including the use of polygenic scores, which are individual-level metrics of genetic risk. Ongoing debate surrounds the generalizability of polygenic scores based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in European ancestry samples, to non-European ancestry samples. We analyzed the first decade of polygenic scoring studies (2008-2017, inclusive), and found that 67% of studies included exclusively European ancestry participants and another 19% included only East Asian ancestry participants. Only 3.8% of studies were carried out on samples of African, Hispanic, or Indigenous peoples. We find that effect sizes for European ancestry-derived polygenic scores are only 36% as large in African ancestry samples, as in European ancestry samples (t=-10.056, df=22, p=5.5x10-10). Analyzing global populations, we show that relationships between height polygenic scores and height are highly dependent on methodological choices in polygenic score construction, highlighting the need for caution in interpreting population level differences in distributions of polygenic scores, as currently calculated. These findings bolster the rationale for large-scale GWAS in diverse human populations and highlight the need for better handling of linkage disequilibrium and variant frequencies when applying scores to non-European samples.",

Although FHL2 has a confirmed important role in muscle development, its autophagy-related function in muscle differentiation has not been fully determined. To explore the role of FHL2 in autophagy-related muscle regulation, FHL2-silenced and -overexpressing C2C12 mouse cells were examined. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assay findings showed that FHL2 silencing reduced LC3- protein expression and the amount of LC3 that co-immunoprecipitated with FHL2, indicating that FHL2 interacts with LC3- in the formation of autophagosomes. Moreover, the expression of muscle development marker genes such as MyoD1 and MyoG was lower in FHL2-silenced C2C12 cells but not in FHL2-overexpressing C2C12 cells. Electron microscopy analysis revealed large empty autophagosomes in FHL2-silenced myoblasts, while flow cytometry suggested that FHL2 silencing made cells more vulnerable to staurosporine-induced cell death. In conclusion, we propose that FHL2 interacts with LC3- in autophagosome formation to regulate the development of muscle cells.",

However, the function of the claustrum is unknown, which is due to its peculiar anatomical arrangement. Here, we use resting state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate claustrum function in human subjects. We first describe a method to reveal claustrum signal with no linear relationship with adjacent regions. We applied this approach to resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis of the claustrum at high resolution (1.5 mm isotropic voxels) using a 7T dataset (n=20) and a separate 3T dataset for replication (n=35). We then assessed claustrum activation during performance of a cognitive task, the multi-source interference task, at 3T (n=33). Extensive functional connectivity was observed between claustrum and cortical regions associated with cognitive control, including anterior cingulate, prefrontal and parietal cortices. Cognitive task performance was associated with widespread activation and deactivation that overlapped with the cortical areas showing functional connectivity to the claustrum. Furthermore, the claustrum was significantly activated at the onset of the difficult condition of the task, but not during the remainder of the difficult condition. These data suggest that the claustrum can be functionally isolated with fMRI, and that it is involved in cognitive control in humans independent of sensorimotor processing.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIRemoving signal from neighboring structures isolates claustrum BOLD signal at 7T and 3T field strength\\nC_LIO_LIClaustrum is extensively functionally connected with cortex, including cognitive networks\\nC_LIO_LIClaustrum is activated at the onset of a cognitive conflict task\\nC_LIO_LIClaustrum may be involved in cognition independent of sensorimotor processing\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Toxicity is widespread among living organisms, and evolves as a multimodal phenotype. Part of this phenotype is the ability to avoid self-intoxication (autoresistance). Evolving toxin resistance can involve fitness tradeoffs, so autoresistance is often expected to evolve gradually and in tandem with toxicity, resulting in a correlation between the degrees of toxicity and autoresistance among toxic populations. We investigate this correlation in Phyllobates poison frogs, notorious for secreting batrachotoxin (BTX), a potent neurotoxin that targets sodium channels, using ancestral sequence reconstructions of BTX-sensing areas of the muscular voltage-gated sodium channel. Reconstructions suggest that BTX resistance arose at the root of Phyllobates, coinciding with the evolution of BTX secretion. After this event little or no further evolution of autoresistance seems to have occurred, despite large increases in toxicity throughout the history of these frogs. Our results therefore provide no evidence in favor of an evolutionary correlation between toxicity and autoresistance, which conflicts with previous work. Future research on the functional costs and benefits of mutations putatively involved in BTX resistance, as well as their prevalence in natural populations should shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms driving the relationship between toxicity and autoresistance in Phyllobates frogs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate spatial correspondence between template and subject images is a crucial step in neuroimaging studies and clinical applications like stereotactic neurosurgery. In the absence of a robust quantitative approach, we sought to propose and validate a set of point landmarks, anatomical fiducials (AFIDs), that could be quickly, accurately, and reliably placed on magnetic resonance images of the human brain. Using several publicly available brain templates and individual participant datasets, novice users could be trained to place a set of 32 AFIDs with millimetric accuracy. Furthermore, the utility of the AFIDs protocol is demonstrated for evaluating subject-to-template and template-to-template registration. Specifically, we found that commonly used voxel overlap metrics were relatively insensitive to focal misregistrations compared to AFID point-based measures. Our entire protocol and study framework leverages open resources and tools, and has been developed with full transparency in mind so that others may freely use, adopt, and modify. This protocol holds value for a broad number of applications including alignment of brain images and teaching neuroanatomy.",

    "abstract": "In our recent behavioural research (Callaghan et al., 2017), we reported age-related changes in the costs of switching between from a temporal (rapid serial visual presentation) to a spatial (visual search) attention task. Using magnetoencephalography, we have now compared the neural signatures of attention refocusing between three age groups (19-30, 40-49 and 60+ years) and found differences in task-related modulation and cortical localisation of alpha and theta oscillations. Efficient, faster switching between the temporal and spatial attention tasks in the youngest group compared to both older groups was reflected in parietal theta effects that were significantly reduced in the older groups. Residual parietal theta activity in older individuals was, however, beneficial to attentional switching, and could reflect the preservation of attention mechanisms. Difficulties in refocusing attention in the older and middle-aged adults (slowed response times) were accompanied by reduced theta power modulation in occipital and cerebellar regions. In addition to this posterior theta deficit, older and middle-aged adults presented with increased recruitment of frontal (both groups) and temporal (older group) areas. Theta oscillations therefore demonstrated a posterior to anterior processing shift, which may reflect the engagement of alternative strategies in older- and middle-age, such as top-down attentional control in an attempt to compensate for posterior processing deficits. Additional frontal theta recruitment indeed appeared to be beneficial for faster performance, as reflected by correlational analysis. Temporal theta (in older-age), however, did not correlate with performance, but could reflect strategies unrelated to speeded performance (e.g. silent vocalisation to maintain task goals). Alpha oscillations did not significantly correlate with task performance, possibly reflecting decreased neural precision or de-differentiation, but require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Tactile feature extraction is essential to guide the dexterous manipulation of objects. The longstanding theory is that geometric features at each location of contact between hand and object are extracted from the spatial layout of the response of populations of tactile nerve fibers. However, recent evidence suggests that some features (edge orientation, e.g.) are extracted very rapidly (<200ms), casting doubt that this information relies on a spatial code, which ostensibly requires integrating responses over time. An alternative hypothesis is that orientation is conveyed in precise temporal spiking patterns. Here, we simulate, using a recently developed and validated model, the responses of tactile fibers from the entire human fingertip ([~]800 afferents) to edges indented into the skin. We show that edge orientation can be quickly (<50 ms) and accurately (<3{degrees}) decoded from the spatial pattern of activation across the afferent population, starting with the very first spike. Next, we implement a biomimetic decoder of edge orientation, consisting of a bank of oriented Gabor filters, designed to mimic the documented responses of cortical neurons. We find that the biomimetic approach leads to orientation decoding performance that approaches the limit set by optimal decoders and is actually more robust to changes in other stimulus features. Finally, we show that orientation signals, measured from single units in non-human primate cortex (2 macaque monkeys, 1 female), follow a time course consistent with that of their counterparts in the nerve. We conclude that a spatial code is fast and accurate enough to support object manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Biophysical modeling of neuronal networks helps to integrate and interpret rapidly growing and disparate experimental datasets at multiple scales. The NetPyNE tool (www.netpyne.org) provides both programmatic and graphical interfaces to develop data-driven multiscale network models in NEURON. NetPyNE clearly separates model parameters from implementation code. Users provide specifications at a high level via a standardized declarative language, e.g., a connectivity rule, instead of tens of loops to create millions of cell-to-cell connections. Users can then generate the NEURON network, run efficiently parallelized simulations, optimize and explore network parameters through automated batch runs, and use built-in functions for visualization and analysis - connectivity matrices, voltage traces, raster plots, local field potentials, and information theoretic measures. NetPyNE also facilitates model sharing by exporting and importing using NeuroML and SONATA standardized formats. NetPyNE is already being used to teach computational neuroscience students and by modelers to investigate different brain regions and phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The dense circuit structure of the mammalian cerebral cortex is still unknown. With developments in 3-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy, the imaging of sizeable volumes of neuropil has become possible, but dense reconstruction of connectomes from such image data is the limiting step. Here, we report the dense reconstruction of a volume of about 500,000 m3 from layer 4 of mouse barrel cortex, about 300 times larger than previous dense reconstructions from the mammalian cerebral cortex. Using a novel reconstruction technique, FocusEM, we were able to reconstruct a total of 0.9 meters of dendrites and about 1.8 meters of axons investing only about 4,000 human work hours, about 10-25 times more efficient than previous dense circuit reconstructions. We find that connectomic data alone allows the definition of inhibitory axon types that show established principles of synaptic specificity for subcellular postsynaptic compartments. We find that also a fraction of excitatory axons exhibit such subcellular target specificity. Only about 35% of inhibitory and 55% of excitatory synaptic subcellular innervation can be predicted from the geometrical availability of membrane surface, revoking coarser models of random wiring for synaptic connections in cortical layer 4. We furthermore find evidence for enhanced variability of synaptic input composition between neurons at the level of primary dendrites in cortical layer 4. Finally, we obtain evidence for Hebbian synaptic weight adaptation in at least 24% of connections; at least 35% of connections show no sign of such previous plasticity. Together, these results establish an approach to connectomic phenotyping of local dense neuronal circuitry in the mammalian cortex.",

We constructed differentiation trajectories for each cell lineage and identified the transcription factors expressed along these trajectories, thus creating a comprehensive molecular map of all developmental lineages in the adult animal. We unexpectedly found that neuron and gland cell differentiation transits through a common progenitor state, suggesting a shared evolutionary history for these secretory cell types.

    "abstract": "Human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold a large potential for disease modeling. hiPSC-derived human astrocyte and neuronal cultures permit investigations of neural signaling pathways with subcellular resolution. Combinatorial cultures, and three-dimensional (3-D) embryonic bodies enlarge the scope of investigations to multi-cellular phenomena. A the highest level of complexity, brain organoids that - in many aspects - recapitulate anatomical and functional features of the developing brain permit the study of developmental and morphological aspects of human disease. An ideal microscope for 3-D tissue imaging at these different scales would combine features from both confocal laser-scanning and light-sheet microscopes: a micrometric optical sectioning capacity and sub-micrometric spatial resolution, a large field of view and high frame rate, and a low degree of invasiveness, i.e., ideally, a better photon efficiency than that of a confocal microscope. In the present work, we describe such an instrument that belongs to the class of two-photon (2P) light-sheet microsocpes. Its particularity is that - unlike existing two- or three-lens designs - it is using a single, low-magnification, high-numerical aperture objective for the generation and scanning of a virtual light sheet. The microscope builds on a modified Nipkow-Petran spinning-disk scheme for achieving wide-field excitation. However, unlike the common Yokogawa design that uses a tandem disk, our concept combines micro lenses, dichroic mirrors and detection pinholes on a single disk. This design, advantageous for 2P excitation circumvents problems arising with the tandem disk from the large wavelength-difference between the infrared excitation light and visible fluorescence. 2P fluorescence excited in by the light sheet is collected by the same objective and imaged onto a fast sCMOS camera. We demonstrate three-dimensional imaging of TO-PRO3-stained embryonic bodies and of brain organoids, under control conditions and after rapid (partial) transparisation with triethanolamine and /ormamide (RTF) and compare the performance of our instrument to that of a confocal microscope having a similar numerical aperture. 2P-virtual light-sheet microscopy permits one order of magnitude faster imaging, affords less photobleaching and permits better depth penetration than a confocal microscope with similar spatial resolution.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection works best when the two alleles in a diploid organism are transmitted to offspring at equal frequencies. Despite this, selfish loci known as meiotic drivers that bias their own transmission into gametes are found throughout eukaryotes. Drive is thought to be a powerful evolutionary force, but empirical evolutionary analyses of drive systems are limited by low numbers of identified meiotic drive genes. Here, we analyze the evolution of the wtf gene family of Schizosaccharomyces pombe that contains both killer meiotic drive genes and suppressors of drive. We completed assemblies of all wtf genes for two S. pombe strains, as well as a subset of wtf genes from over 50 strains. We find that wtf copy number can vary greatly between strains, and that amino acid substitutions, expansions and contractions of DNA sequence repeats, and nonallelic gene conversion between family members all contribute to dynamic wtf gene evolution. This work demonstrates the power of meiotic drive to foster rapid evolution and identifies a recombination mechanism through which transposons can indirectly mobilize meiotic drivers.",

    "abstract": "Egg trading, whereby simultaneous hermaphrodites exchange each others eggs for fertilization, constitutes one of the few rigorously documented and most widely cited examples of direct reciprocity among unrelated individuals. Yet how egg trading may initially invade a population of non-trading simultaneous hermaphrodites is still unresolved. Here, we address this question with an analytical model that considers mate encounter rates and costs of egg production in a population that may include traders (who provide eggs for fertilization only if their partners also have eggs to reciprocate), providers (who provide eggs regardless of whether their partners have eggs to reciprocate), and withholders (\\\"cheaters\\\" who only mate in the male role and just use their eggs to elicit egg release from traders). Our results indicate that a combination of inter-mediate mate encounter rates, sufficiently high costs of egg production, and a sufficiently high probability that traders detect withholders (in which case eggs are not provided) is conducive to the evolution of egg trading. Under these conditions traders can invade--and resist invasion from--providers and withholders alike. The prediction that egg trading evolves only under these specific conditions is consistent with the rare occurrence of this mating system among simultaneous hermaphrodites.",

    "abstract": "Maternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria infect about half of all insect species. Many Wolbachia cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), reduced egg hatch when uninfected females mate with infected males. CI produces a frequency-dependent fitness advantage that leads to high equilibrium Wolbachia frequencies but does not aid Wolbachia spread from low frequencies. The fitness advantages that produce initial Wolbachia spread and maintain non-CI Wolbachia remain elusive. Wolbachia variant wMau that infects Drosophila mauritiana does not cause CI, despite being very closely related to the CI-causing Wolbachia wNo in D. simulans (0.068% sequence divergence over 682,494 bp), suggesting that CI was recently lost. Using draft Wolbachia genomes, we identify a deletion in a WO phage gene that may disrupt CI. We find no evidence that wMau increases host fecundity. We report intermediate and apparently stable wMau infection frequencies on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, consistent with no CI and no appreciable positive effect on fecundity. Our data indicate that wMau frequencies reflect a balance between unknown, weak positive effects on fitness and imperfect maternal transmission. Phylogenomic analyses suggest that Supergroup B Wolbachia, including wMau, diverged from Supergroup A Wolbachia, including wMel from D. melanogaster, 6-46 million years ago, later than previously estimated.",

    "abstract": "Demographic inference methods in population genetics typically assume that the ancestry of a sample can be modeled by the Kingman coalescent. A defining feature of this stochastic process is that it generates genealogies that are binary trees: no more than two ancestral lineages may coalesce at the same time. However, this assumption breaks down under several scenarios. For example, pervasive natural selection and extreme variation in offspring number can both generate genealogies with \\\"multiple-merger\\\" events in which more than two lineages coalesce instantaneously. Therefore, detecting multiple mergers is important both for understanding which forces have shaped the diversity of a population and for avoiding fitting misspecified models to data. Current methods to detect multiple mergers in genomic data rely on the site frequency spectrum (SFS). However, the signatures of multiple mergers in the SFS are also consistent with a Kingman coalescent with a time-varying population size. Here, we present a new method for detecting multiple mergers based on the pointwise mutual information of the two-site frequency spectrum for pairs of linked sites. Unlike the SFS, the pointwise mutual information depends mostly on the topologies of genealogies rather than on their branch lengths and is therefore largely insensitive to population size change. This statistic is global in the sense that it can detect when the genome-wide genetic diversity is inconsistent with the Kingman coalescent, rather than detecting outlier regions, as in selection scan methods. Finally, we demonstrate a graphical model-checking procedure based on the point-wise mutual information using genomic diversity data from Drosophila melanogaster.",

Moreover, genome analysis of the new species also allowed us to resolve the evolutionary history of inversion 3La.

    "abstract": "It is a plausible hypothesis that parallel adaptation events to the same environmental challenge should result in genetic changes of similar or identical effects, depending on the underlying fitness landscapes. However, systematic testing of this is scarce. Here we examine this hypothesis in two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis arenosa, which co-occur at two calamine metalliferous sites harbouring toxic levels of the heavy metals zinc and cadmium. We conduct individual genome resequencing alongside soil elemental analysis for 64 plants from 8 populations on metalliferous and non-metalliferous soils, and identify genomic footprints of selection and local adaptation. Selective sweep and environmental association analyses indicate a modest degree of gene as well as functional network convergence, whereby the proximal molecular factors mediating this convergence mostly differ between site pairs and species. Notably, we observe repeated selection on identical SNPs in several A. halleri genes at two independently colonized metalliferous sites. Our data suggest that species-specific metal handling and other biological features could explain a low degree of convergence between species. The parallel establishment of plant populations on calamine metalliferous soils involves convergent evolution, which will likely be more pervasive across sites purposely chosen for maximal similarity in soil composition.",
