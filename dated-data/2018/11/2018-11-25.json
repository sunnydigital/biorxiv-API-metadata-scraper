Here we propose an optimized, blockchain-based monitoring and reporting process which can achieve all the desired features of an ideal surveillance system while maintaining costs down and being transparent and robust.

    "abstract": "An integral aspect of human cognition is the ability to inhibit habitual responses in order to initiate complex, rule-guided actions. Moreover, humans have also the ability to alternate between different sets of rules or tasks, at the cost of degraded performance when compared to repeating the same task, a phenomenon called the  task switch cost. While it is recognized that switching between tasks requires often to inhibit habitual responses, the interaction between these two forms of cognitive control has been much less studied than each of them separately. Here, we use a computational model to draw a bridge between inhibitory control and voluntary action generation and thereby provide a novel account of seemingly paradoxical findings in the task switch literature. We investigated task switching in the mixed antisaccade task, in which participants are cued to saccade either in the same or in the opposite direction to a peripheral stimulus. Our model demonstrates that stopping a habitual action leads to increased inhibitory control that persists on the next trial. However, enhanced inhibition affects only the probability of generating habitual responses, and, contrary to previous accounts, cannot be characterized as proactive task interference. In addition, our model demonstrates that voluntary actions (but not habitual responses) are slower and more prompt to errors on switch trials compared to repeat trials. We conclude that precisely the interaction between these two effects explains a variety of contradictory findings reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies and other computational biology techniques are gradually discovering the causal gene variants that contribute to late-onset human diseases. After more than a decade of genome-wide association study efforts, these can account for only a fraction of the heritability implied by familial studies, the so-called \\\"missing heritability\\\" problem.\\n\\nMethodsComputer simulations of polygenic late-onset diseases in an aging population have quantified the risk allele frequency decrease at older ages caused by individuals with higher polygenic risk scores becoming ill proportionately earlier. This effect is most prominent for diseases characterized by high cumulative incidence and high heritability, examples of which include Alzheimers disease, coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nResultsThe incidence rate for late-onset diseases grows exponentially for decades after early onset ages, guaranteeing that the cohorts used for genome-wide association studies overrepresent older individuals with lower polygenic risk scores, whose disease cases are disproportionately due to environmental causes such as old age itself. This mechanism explains the decline in clinical predictive power with age and the lower discovery power of familial studies of heritability and genome-wide association studies. It also explains the relatively constant-with-age heritability found for late-onset diseases of lower prevalence, exemplified by cancers.\\n\\nConclusionsFor late-onset polygenic diseases showing high cumulative incidence together with high initial heritability, rather than using relatively old age-matched cohorts, study cohorts combining the youngest possible cases with the oldest possible controls may significantly improve the discovery power of genome-wide association studies.",

    "abstract": "A plethora of studies demonstrated that repeated selective retrieval of target items from semantic categories has an adverse memory effect on semantically-related memories, a phenomenon called retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). However, there is a range of boundary conditions for RIF. For instance, forming interconnections between target and competitors, long-term delay without sleep between practice and final recall, and the form of learning all attenuate the effect of selective practice on the accessibility of semantically-related competitors. The aim of the present research was to investigate the latent general preconditions behind the reductions of RIF. In Experiment 1 participants learned category-exemplar pairs with repeated study or combined study-full test sessions followed by a selective retrieval practice and a full cued-recall test. We found lower difference between performance on the non-practiced items from practiced categories (Rp-) and their baseline from unpracticed categories (Nrp-) suggesting a reduction in retrieval-induced forgetting. However, regression analysis revealed that this was possibly caused by the increased recall performance independently from the presence of an initial full retrieval session. Therefore, in Experiment 2 participants learned the same pairs through a study followed by two study, two test or combined study-test cycles. As the consequence of increased rate of learning we confirmed the complete absence of retrieval-induced forgetting with Bayes factor analysis. Our results suggest that the adverse memory effect of selective retrieval practice shows a non monotonic dependency on the strength of the mnemonic representations.",

    "abstract": "Two main types of small eye movements occur during gaze fixation: microsaccades and slow ocular drifts. While microsaccade generation has been relatively well-studied, ocular drift control mechanisms are unknown. Here we explored the degree to which monkey smooth eye movements, on the velocity scale of slow ocular drifts, can be generated systematically. Two male rhesus macaque monkeys tracked a spot moving sinusoidally, but slowly, along the horizontal or vertical directions. Maximum target displacement in the motion trajectory was 30 min arc (0.5 deg), and we varied the temporal frequency of target motion from 0.2 to 5 Hz. We obtained an oculomotor \\\"transfer function\\\" by measuring smooth eye velocity gain (relative to target velocity) as a function of frequency, similar to past work with large-amplitude pursuit. Monkey eye velocities as slow as those observed during slow ocular drifts were clearly target-motion driven. Moreover, like with large-amplitude smooth pursuit, eye velocity gain varied with temporal frequency. However, unlike with large-amplitude pursuit, exhibiting low-pass behavior, small-amplitude motion tracking was band-pass with the best ocular movement gain occurring at ~0.8-1 Hz. When oblique directions were tested, we found that the horizontal component of pursuit gain was larger than the vertical component. Our results provide a catalogue of the control abilities of the monkey oculomotor system for slow target motions, and they also support the notion that smooth fixational ocular drifts are controllable. This has implications for neural investigations of drift control and the image-motion consequences of drifts on visual coding in early visual areas.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWithin the next few decades, gene therapy techniques and genetic knowledge may sufficiently advance to support prophylactic gene therapy to prevent polygenic late-onset diseases. A combination of a large number of common low effect gene variants offers the most likely explanation for the heritability of the majority of these diseases, and their risk may be lowered by correcting the effect of a subset of such gene variants.\\n\\nMethodsComputer simulations quantified the correlation between the aging process, polygenic risk score, and hazard ratio change with age, using as inputs clinical incidence rates and familial heritability, and estimated the outcomes of hypothetical future prophylactic gene therapy on the lifetime risk and age of onset for eight highly prevalent late-onset diseases.\\n\\nResultsThe simulation results confirmed that gene therapy would be beneficial in both delaying the age of onset and lowering the lifetime risk of the analyzed lateonset diseases. Longer life expectancy is associated with a higher lifetime risk of these diseases, and this tendency, while delayed, will continue after the therapy.\\n\\nConclusionsWhen the gene therapy as hypothesized here becomes possible, and if the incidences of the treated diseases follow the proportional hazards model with multiplicative genetic architecture composed of a sufficient number of common small effect gene variants, then (a) late-onset diseases with the highest familial heritability will have the largest number of variants available for editing, (b) diseases that currently have the highest lifetime risk, and particularly those with the highest incidence rate continuing into older ages, will prove the most challenging cases in which to lower lifetime risk and delay the age of onset at the populational level, and (c) diseases that are characterized by the lowest lifetime risk will show the strongest and longest-lasting response to such therapy.",

    "abstract": "1The coupling of Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measure of brain activity at high spatial and temporal resolution. The localisation of EEG sources depends on several parameters including the knowledge of the position of the electrodes on the scalp. An accurate knowledge about this information is important for source reconstruction. Currently, when acquiring EEG and fMRI together, the position of the electrodes is generally estimated according to fiducial points by using a template. In the context of simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition, a natural idea is to use magnetic resonance (MR) images to localise EEG electrodes. However, most MR compatible electrodes are built to be almost invisible on MR Images. Taking advantage of a recently proposed Ultra short Echo Time (UTE) sequence, we introduce a fully automatic method to detect and label those electrodes in MR images. Our method was tested on 8 subjects wearing a 64-channel EEG cap. This automated method showed an average detection accuracy of 94% and the average position error was 3.1 mm. These results suggest that the proposed method has potential for determining the position of the electrodes during simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition with a very light cost procedure.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations within non-coding regions and even exons may have unidentified regulatory consequences that are often overlooked in analysis workflows. Here we present RegTools (www.regtools.org), a computationally efficient, free, and open-source software package designed to integrate somatic variants from genomic data with splice junctions from bulk or single cell transcriptomic data to identify variants that may cause aberrant splicing. RegTools was applied to over 9,000 tumor samples with both tumor DNA and RNA sequence data. We discovered 235,778 events where a splice-associated variant significantly increased the splicing of a particular junction, across 158,200 unique variants and 131,212 unique junctions. To characterize these somatic variants and their associated splice isoforms, we annotated them with the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), SpliceAI, and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) junction counts and compared our results to other tools that integrate genomic and transcriptomic data. While many events were corroborated by the aforementioned tools, the flexibility of RegTools also allowed us to identify novel splice-associated variants and previously unreported patterns of splicing disruption in known cancer drivers, such as TP53, CDKN2A, and B2M, as well as in genes not previously considered cancer-relevant.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere are over 25 tools dedicated for the detection of Copy Number Variants (CNVs) using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data based on read depth analysis.\\n\\nThe tools reported consist of several steps, including: (i) calculation of read depth for each sequencing target, (ii) normalization, (iii) segmentation and (iv) actual CNV calling. The essential aspect of the entire process is the normalization stage, in which systematic errors and biases are removed and the reference sample set is used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\\n\\nAlthough some CNV calling tools use dedicated algorithms to obtain the optimal reference sample set, most of the advanced CNV callers do not include this feature.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to assess the impact of reference sample set selection on CNV detection performance.\\n\\nMethodsWe used WES data from the 1000 Genomes project to evaluate the impact of various methods of reference sample set selection on CNV calling performance of three chosen state-of-the-art tools: CODEX, CNVkit and exomeCopy. Two naive solutions (all samples as reference set and random selection) as well as two clustering methods (k-means and k nearest neighbours with a variable number of clusters or group sizes) have been evaluated to discover the best performing sample selection method.\\n\\nResults and ConclusionsThe performed experiments have shown that the appropriate selection of the reference sample set may greatly improve the CNV detection rate. In particular, we found that smart reduction of reference sample size may significantly increase the algorithms precision while having negligible negative effect on sensitivity. We observed that a complete CNV calling process with the k-means algorithm as the selection method has significantly better time complexity than kNN-based solution.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have thus far achieved substantial success. In the last decade a large number of common variants underlying complex diseases have been identified through GWAS. In most existing GWAS, the identified common variants are obtained by single marker based tests, that is, testing one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at a time. Generally the basic functional unit of inheritance is a gene, rather than a SNP. Thus, results from gene level association test can be more readily integrated with downstream functional and pathogenic investigation. In this paper, we propose a general gene-based p-value adaptive combination approach (GPA) which can integrate association evidence of multiple genetic variants using only GWAS summary statistics (either p-value or other test statistics). The proposed method could be used to test both continuous and binary traits through not only a single but also multiple studies, which helps overcome the limitation of existing methods that only can be applied to specific type of data. We conducted thorough simulation studies to verify that the proposed method controls type I errors well, and performs favorably compared to single-marker analysis and other existing methods. We demonstrated the utility of our proposed method through analysis of GWAS meta-analysis results for fasting glucose and lipids from the international MAGIC consortium and Global Lipids Consortium, respectively. The proposed method identified some novel traits associated genes which can improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in {beta}-cell function, glucose homeostasis and lipids traits.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how gene expression translates to and affects human behaviour is one of the ultimate aims of neuroscience. In this paper, we present a pipeline based on Mapper, a topological simplification tool, to produce and analyze genes co-expression data. We first validate the method by reproducing key results from the literature on the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and the correlations between resting-state fMRI and gene co-expression maps. We then analyze a dopamine-related gene-set and find that co-expression networks produced by Mapper returned a structure that matches the well-known anatomy of the dopaminergic pathway. Our results suggest that topological network descriptions can be a powerful tool to explore the relationships between genetic pathways and their association with brain function and its perturbation due to illness and/or pharmacological challenge.",

Previous work has shown disturbances in white matter tracts in human carriers of the deletion at this locus. Using a novel rat model, we have recapitulated low dosage of the candidate risk gene CYFIP1 present within the 15q11.2 interval to reveal alterations in white matter microstructure. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we first showed extensive white matter changes in Cyfip1 mutants that were most pronounced in the corpus callosum and external capsule. Transmission electron microscopy showed that these changes were associated with thinning of the myelin sheath in the corpus callosum. Myelin thinning was independent of changes in axon number or diameter but was associated with a reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes. Finally, we demonstrated functional effects on cognitive phenotypes sensitive to both disruptions in myelin and callosal circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Infant and childhood growth are dynamic processes characterized by drastic changes in fat mass and body mass index (BMI) at distinct developmental stages. To elucidate how genetic variation influences these processes, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BMI measurements at 12 time points from birth to eight years of age (9,286 children, 74,105 measurements) in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) with replication in 5,235 children (41,502 measurements). We identified five loci associated with BMI at distinct developmental stages with different patterns of association. Notably, we identified a novel transient effect in the leptin receptor (LEPR) locus, with no effect at birth, increasing effect on BMI in infancy, peaking at 6-12 months (rs2767486, P6m = 2.0 x 10-21, {beta}6m = 0.16) and little effect after age five. A similar transient effect was found near the leptin gene (LEP), peaking at 1.5 years of age (rs10487505, P1.5y = 1.3 x 10-8, {beta}1.5y = 0.079). Both signals are protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for soluble LEPR and LEP in plasma in adults and independent from signals associated with other adult traits mapped to the respective genes, suggesting novel key roles of common variation in the leptin signaling pathway for healthy infant growth. Hence, our longitudinal analysis uncovers a complex and dynamic influence of common variation on BMI during infant and early childhood growth, dominated by the LEP-LEPR axis in infancy.",

    "abstract": "Two trypanosomatid species, Lotmaria passim and Crithidia mellificae, have been shown to parasitize honey bees to date. L. passim appears to be more prevalent than C. mellificae and specifically infects the honey bee hindgut. Although the genomic DNA has been sequenced, the effects of infection on honey bee health and colony are poorly understood. To identify the genes that are important for infecting honey bees and to understand their functions, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to establish a method to manipulate L. passim genes. By electroporation of plasmid DNA and subsequent selection by antibiotics, we first established an L. passim clone expressing tdTomato, GFP, or Cas9. We also successfully knocked out the endogenous miltefosine transporter and tyrosine amino transferase genes by replacement with antibiotics (hygromycin) resistant gene using the CRISPR/Cas9-induced homology-directed repair pathway. The L. passim clones expressing fluorescent markers, as well as the simple method for knocking out specific genes, could become useful approaches to understand the underlying mechanisms of honey bee-trypanosomatid parasite interactions.",

RNA-binding proteins contribute to specificity but this is not fully understood. Here, we reconstitute accelerated and selective deadenylation of RNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) and Pumilio-response elements (PREs). We find that the fission yeast homologues of Tristetraprolin/TTP and Pumilio/Puf (Zfs1 and Puf3) act as molecular tethers: They recruit Ccr4-Not via multiple regions within low-complexity sequences, and bind specific RNA sequences via RNA-binding domains. Using a two-color assay to simultaneously monitor poly(A) tail removal from different RNAs, we demonstrate that Puf3 can distinguish between RNAs of very similar sequence. This is primarily due to differences in the dissociation rate constants. As a result, motif quality is a major determinant of mRNA stability for Puf3 targets in vivo. Together, we provide new insight into the selective deadenylation of specific mRNAs by Ccr4-Not, and the prediction of targeted mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus subtilis ParB forms multimeric networks involving non-specific DNA binding leading to DNA condensation. In our previous work (Fisher et al., 2017), we found that an excess of the free C-terminal domain (CTD) of ParB impeded DNA condensation or promoted decondensation of pre-assembled networks. However, interpretation of the molecular basis for this phenomenon was complicated by our inability to uncouple protein binding from DNA condensation. Here, we have combined lateral magnetic tweezers with TIRF microscopy to simultaneously control the restrictive force against condensation and to visualize ParB protein binding by fluorescence. At non-permissive forces for condensation, ParB binds non-specifically and highly dynamically to DNA. Our new approach concluded that the free CTD blocks the formation of ParB networks by heterodimerization with full length DNA-bound ParB. This strongly supports a model in which the CTD acts as a key bridging interface between distal DNA binding loci within ParB networks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUsing combined Magnetic Tweezers and TIRF microscopy we show that the CTD of ParB blocks ParB network formation by heterodimerization with the full-length protein, which remains bound to the DNA.",

The results suggested some differences in the proportion of MII-stage oocytes between the personalized superovulation protocol and the superovulation protocols I and II.

    "abstract": "We discuss various models of spatial organization of the 30-nm fiber that remains enigmatic despite 40 years of intensive studies. Using computer simulations, we found two topologically different families of the fiber conformations distinguished by the linker length, L: the fibers with L = {10n} and {10n+5} bp have DNA linking numbers per nucleosome DLk >> -1.5 and -1.0, respectively. The fibers with DLk >> -1.5 were observed earlier, while the topoisomer with DLk >> -1.0 is novel. These predictions were confirmed for circular nucleosome arrays with precisely positioned nucleosomes. We suggest that topological polymorphism of chromatin fibers may play a role in the process of transcription, which is known to generate different levels of DNA supercoiling upstream and downstream from RNA polymerase. In particular, the {10n+5} DNA linkers are likely to produce transcriptionally competent chromatin structures. This hypothesis is consistent with available data for several eukaryotes, from yeast to human. We also analyzed two recent studies of chromatin fibers - on the nucleosome crosslinking in vitro, and on radioprobing DNA folding in human cells. In both cases, we show that the novel topoisomer with DLk >> -1.0 has to be taken into account to interpret experimental data. This is yet another evidence for occurrence of two distinct fiber topoisomers. Potentially, our findings may reflect a general tendency of chromosomal domains with different levels of transcription to retain topologically different higher-order structures.",

Moreover, in vivo TRPC3 also regulated complex spike firing and its interaction with simple spikes exclusively in Z- Purkinje cells. Finally, we found that eyeblink conditioning, related to Z- modules, but not compensatory eye movement adaptation, linked to Z+ modules, was affected in TRPC3 loss-of-function mice.
