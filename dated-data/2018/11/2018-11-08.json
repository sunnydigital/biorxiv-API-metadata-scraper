    "abstract": "SynopsisO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSData are limited regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of intravenous colistin for treatment of infections by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\\n\\nMethodsSystematic review of intravenous colistin use in critically ill paediatric patients with MDR-GNB infection in PubMed, Scopus and Embase (through January 31st, 2018).\\n\\nResultsOut of 1,181 citations, 7 studies were included on the use of intravenous colistin for 405 patients in PICU. Majority of patients were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections, with Acinetobacter baumannii being the predominant pathogen. Colistin dosages ranged between 2.6-18 mg/kg/day, with none but one case reporting a loading dose. Emergence of colistin-resistance during treatment was reported in two cases. Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity were reported in 6.1% and 0.5% respectively, but concomitant medications and severe underlying illness limited our ability to definitively associate use of colistin with nephrotoxicity. Crude mortality was 29.5% (95%CI 21.7-38.1%), whereas infection-related mortality was 16.6% (95%CI 12.2-21.5%).\\n\\nConclusionsWhile the reported incidence of adverse events related to colistin were low, reported mortality rates for infections by MDR-GNB in PICU were notable. In addition to severity of disease and comorbidities, inadequate daily dosage and the absence of a loading dose may have contributed to mortality. As the use of colistin for treatment of MDR-GNB infections increases, it is imperative to understand whether optimal dosing of colistin in paediatric patients differs across different age groups. As such, future studies to establish the pharmacokinetic properties of colistin in different paediatric settings are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the United States and often co-presents with sleep problems. Sleep problems in ASD predict the severity of ASD core diagnostic symptoms and have a considerable impact on the quality of life of caregivers. Little is known, however, about the underlying molecular mechanisms. We investigated the role of Shank3, a high confidence ASD gene candidate, in sleep architecture and regulation. We show that mice lacking exon 21 of Shank3 have problems falling asleep even when sleepy. Using RNA-seq we show that sleep deprivation increases the differences in gene expression between mutants and wild types, downregulating circadian transcription factors Per3, Dec2, Hlf, Tef, and Reverb. Shank3 mutants also have trouble regulating wheel-running activity in constant darkness. Overall our study shows that Shank3 is an important modulator of sleep and clock gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of large-scale neural recording capabilities has provided new opportunities to examine multi-scale cortical network activity at single neuron resolution. At the same time, the growing scale and complexity of these datasets introduce new conceptual and technical challenges beyond what can be addressed using traditional analysis techniques. Here, we present SIMNETS, a mathematically rigorous and efficient unsupervised relational analysis framework designed to generate intuitive, low-dimensional neuron maps that support a multi-scale view of the computational similarity (CS) relations among individual neurons. The critical innovation is the use of a novel measure of computational similarity that is based on comparing the intrinsic structure of latent spaces representing the spiking output of individual neurons. We use three publicly available neural population test datasets from the visual, motor, and hippocampal CA1 brain regions to validate the SIMNETS framework and demonstrate how it can be used to identify putative subnetworks (i.e., clusters of neurons with similar computational properties). Our analysis pipeline includes a novel statistical test designed to evaluate the likelihood of detecting spurious neuron clusters to validate network structure results. The SIMNETS framework can facilitate linking computational geometry representations across scales, from single neurons to subnetworks, within large-scale neural recording data.",

    "abstract": "Plants coordinate the expression of genes required to conduct photosynthesis in response to growth and environmental changes. In species that conduct two-cell C4 photosynthesis, the expression of photosynthesis genes is partitioned such that leaf mesophyll and vascular sheath cells accumulate different components of the photosynthetic pathway. The identity of the regulatory networks that facilitate this partitioning are unknown. Here we show that differences in light perception between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells facilitate differential regulation and accumulation of photosynthesis genes in the C4 crop Zea mays (maize). We show that transcripts encoding photoreceptors differentially accumulate in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in a manner that is consistent with biophysical light filtration. We further show the blue light (but not red) is necessary and sufficient to activate photosystem II assembly in etiolated maize mesophyll cells, while both red and blue produce the same effect in C3 Hordeum vulgare (barley). Finally, we demonstrate that changes in abundance of >20% of genes that differentially accumulate between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells can be recapitulated by spectrum specific deetiolation of maize seedlings. These findings provide evidence that subdivision of light signalling networks is a key component of cellular partitioning of C4 photosynthesis in maize.",

Recent expansion in the availability of microbial genomic data and in silico analysis tools have accelerated the discovery of these promising alternatives to antibiotics. Following the genome-mining approach, a biosynthetic gene cluster for a putative two-component lantibiotic roseocin was identified in the genome of an Actinomycete, Streptomyces roseosporus NRRL 11379. Post-translationally modified lanthipeptides of this cluster were obtained by heterologous expression of the genes in E. coli, and were in vitro reconstituted to their bioactive form. The two lanthipeptides displayed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria only synergistically, a property reminiscent of two-component lantibiotics. Structural analysis of the -component identified a disulfide bridge flanking two of its four thioether bridges and the {beta}-component having six thioether bridges with its C-terminus extended than the previously known two-component lantibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Lichens are traditionally divided into short \\\"crustose\\\", intermediate \\\"foliose\\\" and tall \\\"fruticose\\\" types, a practice that hides a growth continuum. Substrate, temperature and water are thought to affect vertical growth, but such factors are difficult to measure, because, for example, the water actually available to lichens does not match rainfall patterns or even ground water levels. To reliably assess the effect of those factors, I recorded temperature, moisture, and substrate in and under individual terricolous lichen colonies in 60 fixed quadrats on April, August, October, and December of 2015 (Cerro de la Muerte, Costa Rica, 9{degrees}33'N; 83{degrees}45'W). The measurements were taken inside the colonies themselves (rather than on the general environment), covering an annual cycle of the relatively simple paramo habitat, where animals and vegetation have less impact than in lower ecosystems. The hypotheses were that lichens would grow taller on softer, warmer, and moister ground; on the Caribbean versant; and on the rainy season. Results matched the hypotheses, with one exception: lichens on soft ground were not taller than those on rock. Caribbean colonies were, on the average, 7 cm taller than those on the drier Pacific versant. Physiologically available water seems to be the main determinant of lichen vertical growth: more water means taller lichens and greater protection from climatic change for both the lichens and their microcommunities.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a widely accepted force in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes. However, in eukaryotes, it is still in hot debate. Some bdelloid rotifers that are resistant to extreme desiccation and radiation were reported to have a very high level of HGTs. However, a similar report in another resistant invertebrate, tardigrades, has been mired in controversy. The DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by prolonged desiccation have been postulated to open the gateway of nuclear genome for foreign DNA integration and thus facilitate the HGT process. If so, the rate of endosymbiotic DNA transfer should also be enhanced. We first surveyed the abundance of nuclear mitochondrial DNAs (NUMTs) and nuclear plastid DNAs (NUPTs) in three groups of eukaryotes that are extremely resistant to desiccation, bdelloid rotifers, A. vaga and A. ricciae, tardigrades, H. dujardini and R. varieornatus, and the resurrection plants, D. hygrometricum and S. tamariscina. Excessive NUMTs or NUPTs have not been detected. Furthermore, we compared nine groups of desiccation-tolerant organisms with their desiccation-sensitive relatives but did not find significant difference in the NUMT/NUPT contents. Desiccation could induce DSBs, but it unlikely dramatically increase the frequency of foreign sequence integration in most eukaryotes. Only in the nuclear genomes enriched in repetitive sequences, the DSBs are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and desiccation-induced DSBs is possible to enhance the integration of foreign sequences into nuclear genome for some degree.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal regulation in DNA replication maintains kinetochore stability. The epigenetically regulated centromeres (CENs) in the budding yeast Candida albicans have unique DNA sequences, replicate early and are clustered throughout the cell cycle. In this study, the genome-wide occupancy of replication initiation protein Orc4 reveals its abundance at all CENs in C. albicans. Orc4 associates with four different DNA motifs, one of which coincides with tRNA genes. Hi-C combined with genome-wide replication timing analyses identify enriched interactions among early or late replicating Orc4-bound regions. A simulated polymer model of chromosomes reveals that early replicating and strongly enriched Orc4-bound sites localize towards the kinetochores. Orc4 is constitutively localized to CENs, and both Orc4 and Mcm2 stabilize CENPA. CENPA chaperone Scm3 localizes at the kinetochore during anaphase, coinciding with the loading time of CENPA. We propose that this spatiotemporal nuclear localization of Orc4, with Mcm2 and Scm3, recruits CENPA and stabilizes centromeric chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Neurosteroids are naturally-occurring molecules in the brain that modulate neurotransmission. They are physiologically important since disrupting their biosynthesis precipitates neurological disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The endogenous neurosteroids, allopregnanolone and tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone are derived from sex and stress hormones respectively, and exhibit therapeutically-useful anxiolytic, analgesic, sedative, anticonvulsant and antidepressant properties. Their main target is the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type-A inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor (GABAAR), whose activation they potentiate. However, whether specific GABAAR isoforms and neural circuits differentially mediate endogenous neurosteroid effects is unknown. By creating a knock-in mouse that removes neurosteroid potentiation from 2-GABAAR subunits, we reveal that this isoform is a key target for neurosteroid modulation of phasic and tonic inhibition, and is essential for the anxiolytic role of endogenous neurosteroids, but not for their anti-depressant or analgesic properties. Overall, 2-GABAAR targeting neurosteroids may act as selective anxiolytics for the treatment of anxiety disorders, providing new therapeutic opportunities for drug development.",

    "abstract": "The Lesser Antilles, in the Eastern Caribbean, were long considered to have only two species in the genus Iguana Laurenti 1768: the Lesser Antillean iguana Iguana delicatissima, which is endemic to parts of the Lesser Antilles, and the common green iguana Iguana iguana, which also occurs throughout Central and South America. However, herpetologists and reptile collectors have pointed out strong physical differences between some of the island populations of Iguana iguana and those from the continent. Drawing on both morphological and genetic data, this paper describes a third species Iguana insularis sp. nov. from the southern Lesser Antilles, specifically the countries of Saint Lucia, St Vincent & the Grenadines, and Grenada. The new species is described based on the following unique combination of characters: Presence of high median and medium to small lateral horns on the snout; Small subtympanic plate not exceeding 20% of the eardrum size; Two or three scales of decreasing size anterior to the subtympanic plate; Fewer than ten small to medium triangular gular spikes; Medium sized dewlap; Low number of small to medium dispersed nuchal tubercles; Dark brown iris, with the white of the eye visible; Oval, prominent nostril; Short and relatively flat head; High dorsal spines; No swelling of the jowls in reproductively active males; Colour of head, body and tail changing from green to pale grey or creamy white in old adults; Vertical black stripes on body and tail, fading with age in some populations. This paper furthermore distinguishes two subspecies: Iguana insularis insularis from the Grenada Bank (comprising Grenada and the Grenadine islands), and Iguana insularis sanctaluciae from Saint Lucia. The form on the island of Saint Vincent has not been identified. Both subspecies are globally threatened by unsustainable hunting (including the pet trade) and by invasive alien species, including hybridization from invasive iguanas from South and Central America (I. iguana and I. rhinolopha, considered here as full species) that have become established in all three countries. The authors call for stronger measures to conserve the remaining purebred Iguana insularis sp. nov. throughout its range and for further research to identify other cryptic species and subspecies of Iguana in the Lesser Antilles.",

However, it has recently become clear that senescence also contributes to the pathophysiology of aging through the accumulation of damaged cells within tissues. Here we describe that inhibition of the reaction catalysed by LSG1, a GTPase involved in the biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit, leads to a robust induction of cellular senescence. Perhaps surprisingly, this was not due to ribosome depletion or translational insufficiency, but rather through perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and a dramatic upregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This cholesterol/ER signature is shared with several other forms of senescence and contributes to the cell cycle arrest in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Furthermore, targetting of LSG1 resulted in amplification of the cholesterol/ER signature and restoration of a robust cellular senescence response in transformed cells, suggesting potential therapeutic uses of LSG1 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used to make beer, bread and wine are genetically and phenotypically distinct from wild populations associated with trees. The origins of these domesticated populations are not always clear; human-associated migration and admixture with wild populations have had a strong impact on S. cerevisiae population structure. We examined the population genetic history of beer strains and find that ale strains and the S. cerevisiae portion of allotetraploid lager strains were derived from admixture between populations closely related to European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains. Similar to both lager and baking strains, ale strains are polyploid, providing them with a passive means of remaining isolated from other populations and providing us with a living relic of their ancestral hybridization. To reconstruct their polyploid origin we phased the genomes of two ale strains and found ale haplotypes to both be recombinants between European and Asian alleles and to also contain novel alleles derived from extinct or as yet uncharacterized populations. We conclude that modern beer strains are the product of a historical melting pot of fermentation technology.",

Although an endoribonuclease has been proposed to initiate cleavages upstream of the stall sequence, the production of two RNA fragments resulting from a unique cleavage has never been demonstrated. We have used mRNAs expressing a 3-ribozyme to produce truncated transcripts in vivo to mimic naturally occurring truncated mRNAs known to trigger NGD. This technique allows us to analyse endonucleolytic cleavage events at single-nucleotide resolution starting at the third collided ribosome, which we show to be Hel2-dependent. These cleavages map precisely in the mRNA exit tunnel of the ribosome, 8 nucleotides upstream of the first P-site residue and release 5-hydroxylated RNA fragments requiring 5-phosphorylation prior to digestion by the exoribonuclease Xrn1, or alternatively by Dxo1. Finally, we identify the RNA kinase Trl1, alias Rlg1, as an essential player in the degradation of NGD RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Although it is often assumed that memory of episodic associations requires recollection, it has been suggested that when stimuli are experienced as a unit, familiarity processes might contribute to their subsequent associative recognition. We investigated the effects of associative relations and perceptual domain during episodic encoding on retrieval of associative information. During study, participants encoded compound and non-compound words-pairs, presented either to the same sensory modality (visual presentation) or to different sensory modalities (audio-visual presentation). At test, they discriminated between old, rearranged, and new pairs while event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In an early ERP component, generally associated with familiarity processes, differences related to associative memory only emerged for compounds, regardless their encoding modality. In contrast, in a later ERP component associated with recollection, differences related to associative memory emerged in all encoding conditions. These findings may indicate that episodic retrieval of compound words can be supported by familiarity-related processes, regardless of whether both words were presented to the same or different sensory modalities.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Rv0081 of M. tuberculosis controls the hypoxic gene expression and acts as a regulatory hub in the latent phase of tuberculosis infection. We report here the crystal structure of Rv0081 at 3.3 [A] resolution revealing that it belongs to the well-known ArsR/SmtB family proteins. ArsR/SmtB family transcriptional repressors exert gene regulation by reversible metal binding. Hypoxia in general is sensed by bacterial transcriptional regulators via metals or Cys-mediated thiol switches. Oxygen sensing typically leads to transcriptional repressor changing its conformational state with altered DNA-binding property under different oxygen levels. Surprisingly Rv0081 neither has a metal binding domain nor does it possess Cys residues suggesting an alternate mechanism of gene regulation. Our structural analysis identified Ser 48, Ser 49, Ser 52 and Gln 53 as potential residues of Rv0081 involved in DNA binding. We probed DNA-binding of Rv0081 with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as well as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), where the Alanine mutants of these residues showed diminished DNA binding. Similarly, Aspartate mutants of these Ser residues was shown to fail to bind to DNA. Since, phosphorylation of various regulatory proteins is one of the important controlling mechanisms, we expected the role of Ser-phosphorylation of Rv0081 in hypoxic condition. Probing Rv0081 with anti-phosphoserine antibodies in M. tuberculosis cell lysate showed marked enhancement in the phosphorylation of Rv0081 protein under hypoxia. Overall, our structural and biochemical analysis provides the molecular basis for the regulation of Rv0081 in the latent phase of tuberculosis infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCETuberculosis is one of the deadliest infectious diseases caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In about 90% of the infected people, M. tuberculosis exists in a dormant or a latent stage which can be reactivated in favorable conditions. Hypoxia (low oxygen pressure) is one of causes of dormancy. Understanding hypoxic gene regulation in M. tuberculosis is therefore an important step to understand latency. Rv0081 is a transcriptional regulator of genes expressed during hypoxia. In order to understand the mechanism by which Rv00081 regulates gene expression during hypoxia, we have solved the crystal structure of Rv0081 and identified amino acid residues which are critical in its transcriptional regulator activity. The crystal structure is suggestive of mechanism of gene regulation under hypoxia.",

Cancer cells in 2D monolayers fail to mimic the exact tumor microenvironment existing in the real clinical samples. The 3D anchorage-independent cancer models can better explain the cell adhesion properties in ovarian cancer cells.\\n\\nResultsTranscriptome profiling of 3D models compared to 2D models in various cancer cell lines shows differential expression of TGF-{beta}-mediated and cell adhesion pathways. Presence of TGF-{beta} in these cell lines shows an increased invasion potential which is specific to cell type. We decided to choose two ovarian cancer cell lines as model systems to study Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and cancer invasion based on their invasion potential and ability to switch the cadherins expression. TGF-{beta} modulation in EMT and cancer invasion was successfully depicted in both 2D and 3D models of SKOV3 and CAOV3 cell lines. Functional evaluations in 3D and 2D models demonstrate that the addition of the exogenous TGF-{beta} can induce EMT and invasion in cancer cells by turning them into aggressive phenotypes. TGF-{beta} receptor kinase I inhibitor (LY364947) can revert TGF-{beta} effect in these cells.\\n\\nConclusionsIn a nutshell, TGF-{beta} can induce EMT and migration, increase aggressiveness, increase cell survival, alter cell characteristics, remodel the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and increase cell metabolism favorable for tumor invasion and metastasis.",

Although most DDM implementations assume that only a single value guides decisions, choices often involve multiple attributes that could make separable contributions to choice. Here, we fit incentive-compatible dietary choices to a multi-attribute, time-dependent drift diffusion model (mtDDM), in which taste and health could differentially influence the evidence accumulation process. We found that these attributes shaped both the relative value signal and the latency of evidence accumulation in a manner consistent with participants idiosyncratic preferences. Moreover, by using a dietary prime, we showed how a healthy choice intervention alters mtDDM parameters that in turn predict prime-dependent choices. Our results reveal that different decision attributes make separable contributions to the strength and timing of evidence accumulation - providing new insights into the construction of interventions to alter the processes of choice.",

    "abstract": "Identification of enhancers has been a challenge in plants. STARR-seq measures enhancer activity of millions fragments in parallel. Here we present a global map of rice enhancers quantitatively determined using STARR-seq. Most enhancers are mapped within genes, especially at the 5 untranslated regions (5 UTR) and the coding sequences. Silent and low expressed genes in genomic regions enriched with transposable elements (TEs) are frequently found containing proximal enhancers. Analysis of enhancer epigenetic features at their endogenous loci revealed that most enhancers do not co-localize with DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and are lack of H3K4me1. Clustering enhancers by their epigenetic modifications revealed that about 40% of identified enhancers carry one or more epigenetic marks. Repressive H3K27me3 is frequently enriched with positive marks of H3K4m3 and/or H3K27ac, which together may bookmark poised enhancers. Intergenic enhancers were predicted based on the location of DHS relative to genes, which overlap poorly with functionally identified enhancers. In summary, enhancers were quantitatively identified by functional analysis in a model plant genome, which provides a valuable resource for further mechanistic studies in different biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Sediment-hosted CO2-rich aquifers deep below the Colorado Plateau (USA) contain a remarkable diversity of uncultivated microorganisms, including Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria that are putative symbionts unable to synthesize membrane lipids. The origin of organic carbon in these ecosystems is unknown and the source of CPR membrane lipids remains elusive. We collected cells from deep groundwater brought to the surface by eruptions of Crystal Geyser, sequenced the community, and analyzed the whole community lipidome over time. Characteristic stable carbon isotopic compositions of microbial lipids suggest that bacterial and archaeal CO2 fixation ongoing in the deep subsurface provides organic carbon for the complex communities that reside there. Coupled lipidomic-metagenomic analysis indicates that CPR bacteria lack complete lipid biosynthesis pathways but still possess regular lipid membranes. These lipids may therefore originate from other community members, which also adapt to high in situ pressure by increasing fatty acid unsaturation. An unusually high abundance of lysolipids attributed to CPR bacteria may represent an adaptation to membrane curvature stress induced by their small cell sizes. Our findings provide new insights into the carbon cycle in the deep subsurface and suggest the redistribution of lipids into putative symbionts within this community.",

    "abstract": "A trade-off between seed mass (SM) and seed output (SO) defines a central axis of ecological variation among plants, with implications for understanding both plant trait evolution and plant responses to environmental change. While an observed negative SM-SO relationship is hypothesized to reflect universal constraints on resource allocation in all plants, domestication has likely fundamentally altered this relationship. Using a dataset of SM and SO for 41 of the world most widespread crops and 1,190 wild plant species, coupled with observational data on these traits in soy (Glycine max) and maize (Zea mays), I show that domestication has systematically rewired SM-SO relationships in crops. Compared to wild plants, virtually all crops express a higher SM for a given SO; this domestication signature is especially prominent in seed crops, and also influences the phylogenetic signal in SM and SO. In maize these traits have become positively related likely due to simultaneous selection for greater SM and SO, while in soy these traits have become decoupled likely due to primary selection for SM only. Evolved relationships between SM and SO in plants have been disrupted by both conscious and unconscious artificial selection, which represents a key aspect of how the functional biology of crops differ fundamentally from wild plants along \\\"universal\\\" plant trait spectra.",
