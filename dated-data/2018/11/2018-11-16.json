    "abstract": "The extent to which visual inference is shaped by attentional goals is unclear. Voluntary attention may simply modulate the priority with which information is accessed by higher cognitive functions involved in perceptual decision making. Alternatively, voluntary attention may influence fundamental visual processes, such as those involved in segmenting an incoming retinal signal into a structured scene of coherent objects, thereby determining perceptual organisation. Here we tested whether the segmentation and integration of visual form can be determined by an observers goals by exploiting a novel variant of the classical Kanizsa figure. We generated predictions about the influence of attention with a machine classifier, and tested these predictions with a psychophysical response classification technique. Despite seeing the same image on each trial, observers perception of illusory spatial structure depended on their attentional goals. These attention-contingent illusory contours directly conflicted with equally plausible visual form implied by the geometry of the stimulus, revealing that attentional selection can determine the perceived layout of a fragmented scene. Attentional goals, therefore, not only select pre-computed features or regions of space for prioritised processing, but, under certain conditions, also greatly influence perceptual organisation and thus visual appearance.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe extent to which higher cognitive functions can influence perceptual organisation is debated. The role of voluntary spatial attention, the ability to focus on only some parts of a scene, has been particularly controversial among neuroscientists and psychologists who aim to uncover the basic neural computations involved in grouping image features into coherent objects. To address this issue, we repeatedly presented the same novel ambiguous image to observers and changed their attentional goals by having them make fine spatial judgements about only some elements of the image. We found that observers attentional goals determine the perceived organisation of multiple illusory shapes. We thus reveal that voluntary spatial attention can control the fundamental processes that determine perceptual organisation.",

    "abstract": "Associated stimulus valence affects neural responses at an early processing stage. However, in the field of written language processing, it is unclear whether semantics of a word or low-level visual features affect early neural processing advantages. The current study aimed to investigate the role of semantic content on reward and loss associations. Participants completed a learning session to associate either words (Experiment 1, N=24) or pseudowords (Experiment 2, N=24) with different monetary outcomes (gain-associated, neutral or loss-associated). Gain-associated stimuli were learned fastest. Behavioural and neural response changes based on the associated outcome were further investigated in separate test sessions. Responses were faster towards gain- and loss-associated than neutral stimuli if they were words, but not pseudowords. Early P1 effects of associated outcome occurred for both pseudowords and words. Specifically, loss-association resulted in increased P1 amplitudes to pseudowords, compared to decreased amplitudes to words. Although visual features are likely to explain P1 effects for pseudowords, the inversed effect for words suggests that semantic content affects associative learning, potentially leading to stronger associations.\\n\\nHighlights- Neural mechanisms of gain/loss association to pseudowords and words were investigated\\n- Loss effects can be observed for the P1 component\\n- Words and pseudowords differ in the direction of loss effects\\n- Semantic content may play a role during word association\\n- Low-level visual features may play a role during pseudoword association",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPerceptual choices depend not only on the current sensory input, but also on the behavioral context. An important contextual factor is the history of ones own choices. Choice history often strongly biases perceptual decisions, and leaves traces in the activity of brain regions involved in decision processing. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. Models of perceptual choice construe decision formation as the accumulation of sensory evidence towards decision bounds. In this framework, it is commonly assumed that choice history signals shift the starting point of accumulation towards the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit bounded-accumulation decision models to behavioral data from perceptual choice tasks, and estimated bias parameters that depended on observers previous choices. Across multiple task protocols and sensory modalities, individual history biases in overt behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to bias the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention towards (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.",

    "abstract": "The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany studies have examined how the spiking activity of single neurons can encode stimulus features, such the direction of motion of visual stimuli. However, majority of such studies to date have only recorded from a small number of neurons at the same time, meaning that one cannot adequately account for the trial-to-trial correlations in spiking activity between neurons. Using multi-channel recordings, we were able to measure the neuronal correlations, and their effects on population coding of stimulus features. Our results have implications on the way which neural populations must be readout in order to maximize information.",

    "abstract": "One of the basics and fundamentals problems in ecology is understand the factors that shape the spatial patterns in the distribution of the species and the coexistence of close relatives species. Among the most important factors governing the distributions and the coexistence of species are the spatiotemporal changes occurring in the microhabitat heterogeneity. Here, we assessed the heterogeneity of microhabitats and how they have an effect in the spatial segregation of two species of small mammals (i. e., Peromyscus difficilis and P. melanotis), which coexist in a temperate, mixed forest. We evaluated the microhabitat heterogeneity through multivariate statistics, using onto 23 habitat variables for vertical-horizontal habitat structure along pluvial seasons. To detect specific microdistribution changes and habitat preferences by two species of small mammals, we used second order spatial statistics and general linear models. According to their respective morphology and locomotive adaptations, the middle sized, midscansorial P. difficilis was resident all year long and preferred microhabitats with a high log ground cover, while the opportunistic, small sized, cursorial P. melanotis changed its occupancy area, depending on density of herbaceous and woody plants cover. Under the more benign microhabitat conditions of rainy season (denser plant coverage, milder temperature), both species showed closer microdistribution patterns; while these became repulsive at the less benign conditions of dry season (scarcer plant cover, colder temperature). Thus, we could confirm that seasonal changes of microhabitat heterogeneity promoted Peromyscus coexistence, through dispersion patterns reflecting partition of microhabitat resources.",

The P system designed in this work reproduces complex biological landscapes in the computer world. It uses nested \\\"membrane-surrounded entities\\\" able to divide, propagate and die, be transferred into other membranes, exchange informative material according to flexible rules, mutate and being selected by external agents. This allows the exploration of hierarchical interactive dynamics resulting from the probabilistic interaction of genes (phenotypes), clones, species, hosts, environments, and antibiotic challenges. Our model facilitates analysis of several aspects of the rules that govern the multi-level evolutionary biology of antibiotic resistance. We examine a number of selected landscapes where we predict the effects of different rates of patient flow from hospital to the community and viceversa, cross-transmission rates between patients with bacterial propagules of different sizes, the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics, antibiotics and dosing in opening spaces in the microbiota where resistant phenotypes multiply. We can also evaluate the selective strength of some drugs and the influence of the time-0 resistance composition of the species and bacterial clones in the evolution of resistance phenotypes. In summary, we provide case studies analyzing the hierarchical dynamics of antibiotic resistance using a novel computing model with reciprocity within and between levels of biological organization, a type of approach that may be expanded in the multi-level analysis of complex microbial landscapes.",

This result calls into question a foundational assumption of extant models of visual working memory. Once psychophysical similarity is taken into account, aspects of memory that have been thought to demonstrate a fixed working memory capacity of ~3-4 items and to require fundamentally different representations -- across different stimuli, tasks, and types of memory -- can be parsimoniously explained with a unitary signal detection framework.

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine nitration is a hallmark of oxidative stress related disease states, commonly detected as anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. The precise reactive oxygen sources, mechanisms of nitration as well as the modified target proteins and functional consequences, however, remain often unclear. Here we explore protein tyrosine nitration under basal conditions and find surprisingly physiologically nitrated proteins. Upon purifying a prominent physiologically nitrotyrosine immunopositive in hearts from mouse, rat and pig, we identify it as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Mechanistically, LDHs degree of basal nitration depended on two canonical sources, NO synthase (NOS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), respectively. When validating the nitrated amino acid by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we, surprisingly, located LDH nitration not to a tyrosine but the C-terminal tryptophan, Trp324. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Trp324 nitration restricts the interaction of the active site loop with the C-terminal -helix essential for activity. This prediction was confirmed by enzyme kinetics revealing an apparent lower Vmax of nitrated LDH, although yet unidentified concurrent oxidative modifications may contribute. Protein nitration is, thus, not a by definition disease marker but reflects also physiological signaling by eNOS/NO, MPO/nitrite and possibly other pathways. The commonly used assay of anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is apparently cross-reactive to nitrotryptophan requiring a reevaluation of the protein nitration literature. In the case of LDH, nitration of Trp324 is aggravated under cardiac metabolic stress conditions and functionally limits maximal enzyme activity. Trp324-nitrated LDH may serve both as a previously not recognized disease biomarker and possibly mechanistic lead to understand the metabolic changes under these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Successful prediction of the likely paths of tumor progression is valuable for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes. Cancer progression models (CPMs) use cross-sectional samples to identify restrictions in the order of accumulation of driver mutations and thus CPMs encode the paths of tumor progression. Here we analyze the performance of four CPMs to examine whether they can be used to predict the true distribution of paths of tumor progression and to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. Employing simulations we show that if fitness landscapes are single peaked (have a single fitness maximum) there is good agreement between true and predicted distributions of paths of tumor progression when sample sizes are large, but performance is poor with the currently common much smaller sample sizes. Under multi-peaked fitness landscapes (i.e., those with multiple fitness maxima), performance is poor and improves only slightly with sample size. In all cases, detection regime (when tumors are sampled) is a key determinant of performance. Estimates of evolutionary unpredictability from the best performing CPM, among the four examined, tend to overestimate the true un-predictability and the bias is affected by detection regime; CPMs could be useful for estimating upper bounds to the true evolutionary unpredictability. Analysis of twenty-two cancer data sets shows low evolutionary unpredictability for several of the data sets. But most of the predictions of paths of tumor progression are very unreliable, and unreliability increases with the number of features analyzed. Our results indicate that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting cancer progression but that, currently, obtaining useful predictions of paths of tumor progression from CPMs is dubious, and emphasize the need for methodological work that can account for the probably multi-peaked fitness landscapes in cancer.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryKnowing the likely paths of tumor progression is instrumental for cancer precision medicine as it would allow us to identify genetic targets that block disease progression and to improve therapeutic decisions. Direct information about paths of tumor progression is scarce, but cancer progression models (CPMs), which use as input cross-sectional data on genetic alterations, can be used to predict these paths. CPMs, however, make assumptions about fitness landscapes (genotype-fitness maps) that might not be met in cancer. We examine if four CPMs can be used to predict successfully the distribution of tumor progression paths; we find that some CPMs work well when sample sizes are large and fitness landscapes have a single fitness maximum, but in fitness landscapes with multiple fitness maxima prediction is poor. However, the best performing CPM in our study could be used to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. When we apply the best performing CPM in our study to twenty-two cancer data sets we find that predictions are generally unreliable but that some cancer data sets show low unpredictability. Our results highlight that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting disease progression, but emphasize the need for methodological work to account for multi-peaked fitness landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Linear mixed effect models are powerful tools used to account for population structure in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and estimate the genetic architecture of complex traits. However, fully-specified models are computationally demanding and common simplifications often lead to reduced power or biased inference. We describe Grid-LMM (https://github.com/deruncie/GridLMM), an extendable algorithm for repeatedly fitting complex linear models that account for multiple sources of heterogeneity, such as additive and non-additive genetic variance, spatial heterogeneity, and genotype-environment interactions. Grid-LMM can compute approximate (yet highly accurate) frequentist test statistics or Bayesian posterior summaries at a genome-wide scale in a fraction of the time compared to existing general-purpose methods. We apply Grid-LMM to two types of quantitative genetic analyses. The first is focused on accounting for spatial variability and non-additive genetic variance while scanning for QTL; and the second aims to identify gene expression traits affected by non-additive genetic variation. In both cases, modeling multiple sources of heterogeneity leads to new discoveries.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe goal of quantitative genetics is to characterize the relationship between genetic variation and variation in quantitative traits such as height, productivity, or disease susceptibility. A statistical method known as the linear mixed effect model has been critical to the development of quantitative genetics. First applied to animal breeding, this model now forms the basis of a wide-range of modern genomic analyses including genome-wide associations, polygenic modeling, and genomic prediction. The same model is also widely used in ecology, evolutionary genetics, social sciences, and many other fields. Mixed models are frequently multi-faceted, which is necessary for accurately modeling data that is generated from complex experimental designs. However, most genomic applications use only the simplest form of linear mixed methods because the computational demands for model fitting can be too great. We develop a flexible approach for fitting linear mixed models to genome scale data that greatly reduces their computational burden and provides flexibility for users to choose the best statistical paradigm for their data analysis. We demonstrate improved accuracy for genetic association tests, increased power to discover causal genetic variants, and the ability to provide accurate summaries of model uncertainty using both simulated and real data examples.",

    "abstract": "Many cognitive and social processes involve mental simulations of a change in perspective. Behavioral studies suggest that such egocentric mental rotations rely on brain areas that are also involved in processing actual self-motion, thus depending on vestibular input. In a combined galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the brain areas that underlie both simulated changes in self-location and the processing of vestibular stimulation within the same individuals. Participants performed an egocentric mental rotation task, an object-based mental rotation task, or a pure lateralization task during GVS or sham stimulation. At the neural level, we expected an overlap between brain areas activated during vestibular processing and egocentric mental rotation (against object-based mental rotation) within area OP2 and the Posterior Insular Cortex (PIC), two core brain regions involved in vestibular processing. The fMRI data showed a small overlap within area OP2 and a larger overlap within the PIC for both egocentric mental rotation against object-based mental rotation and vestibular processing. GVS did not influence the ability to perform egocentric mental rotation.\\n\\nOur results provide evidence for shared neural mechanisms underlying perceived and simulated self-motion. We conclude that mental rotation of ones body involves neural activity in the PIC and area OP2, but the behavioral results also suggest that those mental simulations of ones body might be robust to modulatory input from vestibular stimulation.",

    "abstract": "We developed a 3D localization-based super-resolution technique providing a slowly varying localization precision over a 1 m range with precisions down to 15 nm. The axial localization is performed through a combination of point spread function (PSF) shaping and supercritical angle fluorescence (SAF), which yields absolute axial information. Using a dual-view scheme, the axial detection is decoupled from the lateral detection and optimized independently to provide a weakly anisotropic 3D resolution over the imaging range. This method can be readily implemented on most homemade PSF shaping setups and provides drift-free, tilt-insensitive and achromatic results. Its insensitivity to these unavoidable experimental biases is especially adapted for multicolor 3D super-resolution microscopy, as we demonstrate by imaging cell cytoskeleton, living bacteria membranes and axon periodic submembrane scaffolds. We further illustrate the interest of the technique for biological multicolor imaging over a several-m range by direct merging of multiple acquisitions at different depths.",

We trained rats in a sucrose intensity discrimination task and found that sucrose evoked a widespread response in neurons recorded in posterior-Insula (pIC), anterior-Insula (aIC), and Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Remarkably, only a few Intensity-selective neurons conveyed the most information about sucroses intensity, indicating that for sweetness the gustatory system used a compact and distributed code. Sucrose intensity was encoded in both firing-rates and spike-timing. The pIC, aIC, and OFC neurons tracked movement direction, with OFC neurons yielding the most robust response. aIC and OFC neurons encoded the subjects choices, whereas all three regions tracked reward omission.

Three core features of EPIC are its open-population design (incorporating projections of future population growth, aging, and smoking trends), its incorporation of heterogeneity in lung function decline and burden of exacerbations, and its modeling of the natural history of COPD from inception. Multiple original data analyses, as well as values reported in the literature, were used to populate the model. Extensive face validity as well as internal and external validity evaluations were performed.\\n\\nResultsThe model was internally validated on demographic projections, mortality rates, lung function trajectories, COPD exacerbations, and stability of COPD prevalence over time within strata of risk factors. In external validation, it moderately overestimated rate of overall exacerbations in two independent trials, but generated consistent estimates of rate of severe exacerbations and mortality.\\n\\nLimitationsIn its current version, EPIC does not consider uncertainty in the evidence. Several components such as additional (e.g., environmental and occupational) risk factors, treatment, symptoms, and comorbidity will have to be added in future iterations.\\n\\nConclusionsEPIC is the first multi-purpose outcome- and policy-focused model of COPD for Canada. By modeling the natural history of COPD from its inception, it is capable of modeling the outcomes of decisions across the entire care pathway of COPD. Platforms of this type have the capacity to be iteratively updated to incorporate the latest evidence and to project the outcomes of many different scenarios within a consistent framework.",

    "abstract": "The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as an important model organism to study the molecular mechanisms of protein misfolding diseases associated with amyloid formation because of its small size, ease of genetic manipulation and optical transparency. Obtaining a reliable and quantitative read-out of protein aggregation in this system, however, remains a challenge. To address this problem, we here present a fast time-gated fluorescence lifetime imaging (TG-FLIM) method and show that it provides functional insights into the process of protein aggregation in living animals by enabling the rapid characterisation of different types of aggregates. More specifically, in longitudinal studies of C. elegans models of Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases, we observed marked differences in the aggregation kinetics and the nature of the protein inclusions formed by -synuclein and polyglutamine. In particular, we found that -synuclein inclusions do not display amyloid-like features until late in the life of the worms, whereas polyglutamine forms amyloid characteristics rapidly in early adulthood. Furthermore, we show that the TG-FLIM method is capable of imaging live and non-anaesthetised worms moving in specially designed agarose micro-chambers. Taken together, our results show that the TG-FLIM method enables high-throughput functional imaging of living C. elegans that can be used to study in vivo mechanisms of aggregation and that has the potential to aid the search for therapeutic modifiers of protein aggregation and toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation has arisen as a powerful strategy for drug discovery allowing the targeting of undruggable proteins for proteasomal degradation. This approach most often employs heterobifunctional degraders consisting of a protein-targeting ligand linked to an E3 ligase recruiter to ubiquitinate and mark proteins of interest for proteasomal degradation. One challenge with this approach, however, is that only few E3 ligase recruiters currently exist for targeted protein degradation applications, despite the hundreds of known E3 ligases in the human genome. Here, we utilized activity-based protein profiling (ABPP)-based covalent ligand screening approaches to identify cysteine-reactive small-molecules that react with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF4 and provide chemical starting points for the design of RNF4-based degraders. The hit covalent ligand from this screen reacted with either of two zinc-coordinating cysteines in the RING domain, C132 and C135, with no effect on RNF4 activity. We further optimized the potency of this hit and incorporated this potential RNF4 recruiter into a bifunctional degrader linked to JQ1, an inhibitor of the BET family of bromodomain proteins. We demonstrate that the resulting compound CCW 28-3 is capable of degrading BRD4 in a proteasome- and RNF4-dependent manner. In this study, we have shown the feasibility of using chemoproteomics-enabled covalent ligand screening platforms to expand the scope of E3 ligase recruiters that can be exploited for targeted protein degradation applications.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk score (PRS) is the state-of-art prediction method for complex traits using summary level data from discovery genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The PRS, as its name suggests, is designed for polygenic traits by aggregating small genetic effects from a large number of causal SNPs and thus is viewed as a powerful method for predicting complex polygenic traits by the genetics community. However, one concern is that the prediction accuracy of PRS in practice remains low with little clinical utility, even for highly heritable traits. Another practical concern is whether genome-wide SNPs should be used in constructing PRS or not. To address the two concerns, we investigate PRS both empirically and theoretically. We show how the performance of PRS is influenced by the triplet (n, p, m), where n, p, m are the sample size, the number of SNPs studied, and the number of true causal SNPs, respectively. For a given heritability, we find that i) when PRS is constructed with all p SNPs (referred as GWAS-PRS), its prediction accuracy is controlled by the p/n ratio; while ii) when PRS is built with a set of top-ranked SNPs that pass a pre-specified threshold (referred as threshold-PRS), its accuracy varies depending on how sparse the true genetic signals are. Only when m is magnitude smaller than n, or genetic signals are sparse, can threshold-PRS perform well and outperform GWAS-PRS. Our results demystify the low performance of PRS in predicting highly polygenic traits, which will greatly increase researchers aware-ness of the power and limitations of PRS, and clear up some confusion on the clinical application of PRS.",

Most methods designed to detect positive selection along sequenced genomes, however, use simplified representations of past histories as null models of genetic drift. Here, we present the first method that can detect signatures of strong local adaptation across the genome using arbitrarily complex admixture graphs, which are typically used to describe the history of past divergence and admixture events among any number of populations. The method--called Graph-aware Retrieval of Selective Sweeps (GRoSS)--has good power to detect loci in the genome with strong evidence for past selective sweeps and can also identify which branch of the graph was most affected by the sweep. As evidence of its utility, we apply the method to bovine, codfish and human population genomic data containing multiple population panels related in complex ways. We find new candidate genes for important adaptive functions, including immunity and metabolism in under-studied human populations, as well as muscle mass, milk production and tameness in specific bovine breeds. We are also able to pinpoint the emergence of large regions of differentiation due to inversions in the history of Atlantic codfish.",

    "abstract": "Chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) initiated by the cochaperone Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) represents an important mechanism for the disposal of misfolded and damaged proteins in mammalian cells. Under mechanical stress, the cochaperone cooperates with the small heat shock protein HSPB8 and the cytoskeleton-associated protein SYNPO2 to degrade force-unfolded forms of the actin-crosslinking protein filamin. This is essential for muscle maintenance in flies, fish, mice and men. Here, we identify the serine/threonine protein kinase 38 (STK38), which is part of the Hippo signaling network, as a novel interactor of BAG3. STK38 was previously shown to facilitate cytoskeleton assembly and to promote mitophagy as well as starvation and detachment induced autophagy. Significantly, our study reveals that STK38 exerts an inhibitory activity on BAG3-mediated autophagy. Inhibition relies on a disruption of the functional interplay of BAG3 with HSPB8 and SYNPO2 upon binding of STK38 to the cochaperone. Of note, STK38 attenuates CASA independently of its kinase activity, whereas previously established regulatory functions of STK38 involve target phosphorylation. The ability to exert different modes of regulation on central protein homeostasis (proteostasis) machineries apparently allows STK38 to coordinate the execution of diverse macroautophagy pathways and to balance cytoskeleton assembly and degradation.\\n\\nAbbreviationsBAG3, BCL2-associated athanogene; CASA, chaperone-assisted selective autophagy; CHIP, carboxy terminus of HSP70 interacting protein; EPS, electrical pulse stimulation; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; STK38, serine/threonine protein kinase 38.",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Although radiotherapy is an effective treatment choice for early-stage cases, the 5-year survival rate of patients diagnosed in late-stages remains poor. Increasing evidence suggests that the local and systemic effects of radiotherapy dependent on the induced anti-tumor immune responses. We believe that an educated adaptation of radiotherapy plans based not only on the induced immune responses, but also on the tumor-immune ecosystem composition at the beginning of treatment might increase local tumor control. We propose two different mathematical models to evaluate the potential of the tumor-immune context to inform adaptation of treatment plans with the aim of improving outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumor types. Evidence continues to accrue indicating that the complex relationship between GBM and the brain microenvironment contributes to this malignant phenotype. However, the interaction between GBM and neurotransmitters, signaling molecules involved in neuronal communication, remains incompletely understood. Here we examined, in both sexes of humans and mice, how the monoamine dopamine influences GBM cells. We demonstrate that GBM cells express DRD2, with elevated expression in the glioma-initiating cell (GIC) population. Stimulation of DRD2 caused neuron-like depolarization exclusively in GICs. In addition, long-term activation of DRD2 heightened the sphere-forming capacity of GBM cells as well as tumor engraftment efficiency. Mechanistic investigation revealed that DRD2 signaling activates the hypoxia response and functionally alters metabolism. Finally, we found that GBM cells synthesize and secrete dopamine themselves, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. These results identify dopamine signaling as a potential therapeutic target in GBM and further highlight neurotransmitters as a key feature of the pro-tumor microenvironment.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis work offers critical insight into the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the progression of GBM. We show that dopamine induces specific changes in the state of tumor cells, augmenting their growth and shifting them to a more stem-cell like state. Further, we show that dopamine can alter the metabolic behavior of GBM cells, increasing glycolysis. Finally, we show that GBM cells, including tumor samples from patients, can synthesize and secrete dopamine, suggesting an autocrine signaling process underlying these results. These results describe a novel connection between neurotransmitters and brain cancer, further highlighting the critical influence of the brain milieu on GBM.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the least treatable types of cancer. Recent work highlights two key factors contributing to this resistant phenotype--cellular plasticity, the ability of GBM cells to adopt many phenotypes, and the microenvironment. Here, we provide evidence that Interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays a vital role in promoting cellular plasticity and cancer initiating cells (CICs) niche during anti-glioma chemotherapy. IL-8 expression is significantly elevated during chemotherapy, and immunohistochemical analysis of matched primary and recurrent patient GBM tissues revealed about 60% of recurrent tissues IL-8 expression is upregulated. In silico analysis of the TCGA data indicated that IL-8 signaling could promote epigenetic plasticity by altering the polycomb repressor complex activity. We are proposing that such regulation my promote epigenetic plasticity, which allows the GBM cells to adapt therapy and may promote therapeutic resistance. Our data show that IL-8 is a crucial microenvironmental factor involved in developing therapeutic adaptation and can be targeted in combination with conventional chemo-and radiotherapy to prevent disease recurrence.\\n\\nABSTRACTEmerging evidence reveals enrichment of glioma initiating cells (GICs) following therapeutic intervention. This enrichment occurs partly by dedifferentiation of non-GICs to GICs within the tumor, which may contribute to therapeutic resistance and the generation of lethal recurrent tumors. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing therapy-induced cellular plasticity, we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and gene expression analysis (gene microarray analysis) during treatment with standard of care temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. Analysis revealed significant enhancement of open chromatin marks in known astrocytic enhancers for Interleukin-8 (IL-8) loci as well as elevated expression during anti-glioma chemotherapy. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project data demonstrated that IL-8 transcript expression is negatively correlated with GBM patient survival (p=0.001) and positively correlated with that of genes associated with the CIC phenotype such as KLF4, c-Myc and HIF2 (p<0.001). Immunohistochemical analysis of patient samples demonstrated elevated IL-8 expression in about 60% of recurrent GBM tumors relative to matched primary tumors and this expression also positively correlates with time to recurrence. Exposure to IL-8 significantly enhanced the self-renewing capacity of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) GBM (average 3-fold, p<0.0005). Furthermore, IL-8 knockdown significantly delayed PDX GBM tumor growth in vivo (p<0.0005). Finally, guided by in silico analysis of TCGA data, we examined the effect of therapy-induced IL-8 expression on the epigenomic landscape of GBM cells and observed increased trimethylation of H3K9 and H3K27. Our results show that IL-8 alters cellular plasticity and mediates alterations in histone status. These finding suggest that IL-8 signaling participates in regulating GBM adaptation to therapeutic stress and therefore represents a promising target for combination with conventional chemotherapy in order to limit GBM recurrence.",

In the course of training with multiple trials, an animal may change its behavior abruptly, and capturing such events calls for a trial-by-trial analysis of the animals strategy. To address this challenge, we developed an integrated platform for automated animal training and analysis of behavioral data. A low-cost and space-efficient apparatus serves to train entire cohorts of mice on a decision-making task under identical conditions. A generalized linear model (GLM) analyzes each animals performance at single-trial resolution. This model infers the momentary decision-making strategy and can predict the animals choice on each trial with an accuracy of ~80%. We also assess the animals detailed trajectories and body poses within the apparatus. Unsupervised analysis of these features revealed unusual trajectories that represent hesitation in the response. This integrated hardware/software platform promises to accelerate the understanding of animal learning.",

    "abstract": "The impermeability of the luminal endothelial cell monolayer is crucial for the normal performance of the vascular and lymphatic systems. A key to this function is the integrity of the monolayers intercellular junctions. The known repertoire of junction-regulating genes is incomplete. Current permeability assays are incompatible with high-throughput genome-wide screens that could identify these genes. To overcome these limitations, we designed a new permeability assay that consists of cell monolayers grown on [~]150 m microcarriers. Each microcarrier functions as a miniature individual assay of permeability (MAP). We demonstrate that false-positive results can be minimized, and that MAP sensitivity to thrombin-induced increase in monolayer permeability is similar to the sensitivity of the measurement of impedance. We validate the assay by showing that the expression of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that target genes encoding known thrombin signaling proteins blocks effectively thrombin-induced junction disassembly, and that MAPs carrying such cells can be separated effectively by a fluorescent probe from those that carry cells expressing non-targeting sgRNAs. These results indicate that MAPs are suitable for high-throughput experimentation and for genome-wide screens for genes that mediate the disruptive effect of thrombin on endothelial cell junctions.",

Contradicting this idea, we readily observe mRNAs targeted by cytoplasmic capping in uncapped, yet stable forms. 5 RACE shows that nearly all uncapped ends correspond to CAGE tags and that the recapping of ZNF207 mRNA may be restricted to a single splice isoform. A modified RACE approach detected uncapped 5 RNA ends mapping to 46 mRNAs in dominant negative cytoplasmic capping enzyme expressing and normal cells. 11 of 46 cloned mRNAs also contained splice isoform-limiting sequences. Collectively, these data reinforce earlier work and suggest that alternative splicing may play a role in targeting transcripts for- and/or determining the position of- cytoplasmic capping.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Nrf2 plays a critical role in the organism wide-regulation of the antioxidant stress response. The Nrf2 homolog SKN-1 functions in the intestine cell non-autonomously to negatively regulate neuromuscular (NMJ) function in Caenorhabditis elegans. To identify additional molecules that mediate SKN-1 signaling to the NMJ, we performed a candidate screen for suppressors of aldicarb-resistance caused by acute treatment with the SKN-1 activator, arsenite. We identified two receptor tyrosine kinases, EGL-15 (fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR) and DAF-2 (insulin-like peptide receptor, IR) that are required for NMJ regulation in response to stress. Through double mutant analysis, we found that EGL-15 functions downstream of SKN-1 and SPHK-1 (sphingosine kinase), and that the EGL-15 ligand EGL-17 FGF and canonical EGL-15 effectors are required for oxidative stress-mediated regulation of NMJ function. DAF-2 also functions downstream of SKN-1, independently of DAF-16/FOXO, to regulate NMJ function. Through tissue-specific rescue experiments, we found that FGFR signaling functions primarily in the hypodermis, whereas IR signaling is required in multiple tissues. Our results support the idea that the regulation of NMJ function by SKN-1 occurs via a complex organism-wide signaling network involving RTK signaling in multiple tissues.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins are over-expressed in many cancers and hence are attractive therapeutic targets. In this study we tested the sensitivity of two NPC cell lines HK1 and C6661-1 to Maritoclax which is reported to repress anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 and BH3 mimetic ABT-263 which selectively inhibits anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w. We investigated the sensitization of the NPC cell lines to these drugs using the SYBR Green I assay and 3D NPC spheroids.\\n\\nResultsWe report that Maritoclax repressed MCL-1, BCL-2, and BCL-XL in a dose- and time-dependent manner and displayed a single agent activity in inhibiting cell proliferation of the NPC cell lines. Moreover, combination of Maritoclax and ABT-263 exhibited synergistic cell proliferation effect in the HK1 cell line. Similar results were obtained in the 3D spheroids. More notably, 3D spheroids either treated with single agent Maritoclax or combination with ABT-263 over 10 days did not develop resistance to the treatment rapidly. Collectively, the findings illustrate that Maritoclax as a single agent or combination with BH3 mimetics could be a potential treatment strategy for NPC but further studies in preclinical models are warranted to fully unravel the prospects of these drugs.",

    "abstract": "Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays an important role in metastasis and immunotherapy. However, it has been not much known how to classify TIMEs and how TIMEs are genetically regulated. Here we showed that tumors were classified into TIME-rich, -intermediate and -poor subtypes which had significant differences in clinical outcomes, abundances of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), the degree of key immune programs activation, and immunotherapy response across 13 common cancer types (n= [~]6,000). Furthermore, TIME-intermediate/-poor patients had significantly more inherited genetic defects (i.e., functional germline variants) in natural killer (NK) cells, antigen processing and presentation (APP) and Wnt signaling pathways than TIME-rich patients, and so did cancer patients than non-cancer individuals (n=4,500). These results suggested that individuals who had more inherited defects in NK cells, APP and Wnt pathways had a higher risk of developing cancers. Moreover, in the 13 common cancers the number of inheritably defected genes of NK cells was significantly negative-correlated with patients survival, TILs abundance in TIMEs and immunotherapy response, suggesting that inherited defects in NK cells alone were sufficient to shape TILs recruitment, clinical outcome, and immunotherapy response, highlighting that NK cell activation was required in the 13 cancer types to drive the recruitment of immune troops into TIMEs. Thus, we proposed that cancer was a disease of NK cell inherited deficiencies. These results had implications in identifying of high-risk individuals based on germline genomes, implementing precision cancer prevention by adoptive transfer of healthy NK cells, and improving existing immunotherapies by combining of adoptive NK cell transfer (i.e., converting TIME-intermediate/-poor tumors into TIME-rich tumors) and anti-PD-1 or CAR-T therapy.\\n\\nContactEW (edwin.wang@ucalgary.ca)",

    "abstract": "Mammalian female fertility relies on the proper development of follicles. Right after birth in mouse, oocytes associate with somatic ovarian cells to form follicles. These follicles grow during adult lifetime to produce viable gametes. In this study, we analyzed the role of the ATM and rad3-related (ATR) kinase in mouse oogenesis and folliculogenesis using a hypomorphic mutation of the Atr gene (Murga et al., 2009). Female mice homozygote for this allele have been reported to be sterile. Our data show that female meiotic prophase is not grossly altered when ATR levels are reduced. However, follicle development is majorly compromised since Atr mutant ovaries present a decrease of growing follicles. Comprehensive analysis of follicular cell death and proliferation suggest that wild-type levels of ATR are required to achieve optimal follicular development. Altogether, these findings suggest that reduced ATR expression causes sterility due to defects in follicular progression rather than in meiotic recombination. We discuss the implication of these findings for the use of ATR inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs and its possible side effects on female fertility.",

    "abstract": "The sense of touch hinges on tissues transducing stimuli applied to the skin and somatosensory neurons converting mechanical inputs into currents. Like mammalian Pacinian corpuscles, the light-touch response of the prime model organism C. elegans adapts rapidly, and is symmetrically activated by the onset and offset of a step indentation. Here, we propose a quantitative model that combines transduction of stimuli across the skin and subsequent gating of mechanoelectrical channels. For mechanics, we use an elastic model based on geometrically-nonlinear deformations of a pressurized cylindrical shell. For gating, we build upon consequences of the dermal layers thinness and tangential stimuli. Our model demonstrates how the onset-offset symmetry arises from the coupling of mechanics and adaptation, and accounts for experimental neural responses to a broad variety of stimuli. Predicted effects of modifications in the mechanics or the internal pressure of the body are tested against mechanical and neurophysiological experiments.",

Monocotyledons express a higher number of HKT proteins than dicotyledons, and it is only within this clade of HKT channels that cation symport mechanisms are found. The prevailing ion composition in the extracellular medium affects the transport abilities of various HKT channels by changing their selectivity or ion transport rates. How this mutual effect is achieved at the molecular level is still unknown. Here, we built a homology model of the monocotyledonous OsHKT2;2, which shows sodium and potassium symport activity, and performed molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of sodium and potassium ions. By analyzing ion-protein interactions, we identified a cation binding pocket on the extracellular protein surface, which is formed by residues P71, D75, D501 and K504. Proline and the two aspartate residues coordinate cations, while K504 forms salt bridges with D75 and D501 and may be involved in the forwarding of cations towards the pore entrance. Functional validation via electrophysiological experiments confirmed the biological relevance of the predicted ion binding pocket and identified K504 as a central key residue. Mutation of the cation coordinating residues affected the functionality of HKT only slightly. Additional in silico mutants and simulations of K504 supported experimental results.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the post-ingestive fate of two host-plant derived small-molecule phenolics (the acetophenones piceol and pungenol) that have previously been shown to be toxic to the outbreaking forest pest, spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). We test first whether these compounds are transformed during passage through the midgut, and second whether the budworm upregulates activity of the detoxification enzyme glutathione-s-transferase (GST) in response to feeding on these compounds. Insects were reared on either foliage or artificial diet to the fourth instar, when they were transferred individually to one of two treatment diets, either control or phenolic-laced, for approximately 10 days, after which midguts were dissected out and used for Bradford soluble protein and GST enzyme activity analysis. Frass was collected and subjected to HPLC-DAD-MS. HPLC showed that the acetophenones do not autoxidize under midgut pH conditions, but that glucose- and glutathione-conjugates are present in the frass of insects fed the phenolic-laced diet. GST enzyme activity increases in insects fed the phenolic-laced diet, in both neutral pH and alkaline assays. These data show that the spruce budwom exhibits counter-adaptations to plant phenolics similar to those seen in angiosperm feeders, upregulating an important detoxifying enzyme (GST) and partially conjugating these acetophenones prior to elimination, but that these counter-measures are not totally effective at mitigating toxic effects of the ingested compounds in the context of our artifical-diet based laboratory experiment.",

    "abstract": "Current strategies for cartilage cell therapy are mostly based on the use of autologous chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, these cells have limitations of a small number of cells available and of low chondrogenic ability, respectively. Many studies now suggest that fetal stem cells are more plastic than adult stem cells and can therefore more efficiently differentiate into target tissues. This study introduces, efficiency chondrogenic differentiation of fetal cartilage-derived progenitor cells (FCPCs) to adult cells can be achieved using a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture method based on silica nanopatterning techniques. In evaluating the issue of silica nano-particle size (Diameter of 300, 750, 1200 nm), each particle size was coated into the well of a 6-well tissue culture plate. FCPCs (2 x 105 cells/well in 6-well plate) were seeded in each well with chondrogenic medium. In this studys, the 300 nm substrate that formed multi-spheroids and the 1200 nm substrate that showed spreading were due to the cell-cell adhesion force(via N-cadherin) and cell-substrate(via Integrin) force, the 750 nm substrate that formed the mass-aggregation can be interpreted as the result of cell monolayer formation through cell-substrate force followed by cell-cell contact force contraction. We conclude that our 3D spheroid culture system contributes to an optimization for efficient differentiation of FCPC, offers insight into the mechanism of efficient differentiation of engineered 3D culture system, and has promise for wide applications in regeneration medicine and drug discovery fields.",

    "abstract": "Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) vector pathogenic trypanosomes (Trypanosoma spp.) in sub-Saharan Africa. These parasites cause human and animal African trypanosomiases, which are debilitating diseases that inflict an enormous socio-economic burden on inhabitants of endemic regions. Current disease control strategies rely primarily on treating infected animals and reducing tsetse population densities. However, relevant programs are costly, labor intensive and difficult to sustain. As such, novel strategies aimed at reducing tsetse vector competence require development. Herein we investigated whether an Enterobacter bacterium (Esp_Z), which confers Anopheles gambiae with resistance to Plasmodium, is able to colonize tsetse and induce a trypanosome refractory phenotype in the fly. Esp_Z established stable infections in tsetses gut, and exhibited no adverse effect on the survival of individuals from either group. Flies with established Esp_Z infections in their gut were significantly more refractory to infection with two distinct trypanosome species (T. congolense, 6% infection; T. brucei, 32% infection) than were age-matched flies that did not house the exogenous bacterium (T. congolense, 36% infected; T. brucei, 70% infected). Additionally, 52% of Esp_Z colonized tsetse survived infection with entomopathogenic Serratia marcescens, compared with only 9% of their wild-type counterparts. These parasite and pathogen refractory phenotypes result from the fact that Esp_Z acidifies tsetses midgut environment, which inhibits trypanosome and Serratia growth and thus infection establishment. Finally, we determined that Esp_Z infection does not impact the fecundity of male or female tsetse, nor the ability of male flies to compete with their wild-type counterparts for mates. We propose that Esp_Z could be used as one component of an integrated strategy aimed at reducing the ability of tsetse to transmit pathogenic trypanosomes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTsetse flies transmit pathogenic African trypanosomes, which are the causative agents of socio-economically devastating human and animal African trypanosomiases. These diseases are currently controlled in large part by reducing the population size of tsetse vectors through the use of insecticides, traps and sterile insect technique. However, logistic and monetary hurdles often preclude the prolonged application of procedures necessary to maintain these control programs. Thus, novel strategies, including those aimed at sustainably reducing the ability of tsetse to transmit trypanosomes, are presently under development. Herein we stably colonize tsetse flies with a bacterium (Enterobacter sp. Z, Esp_Z) that acidifies their midgut, thus rendering the environment inhospitable to infection with two distinct, epidemiologically important trypanosome strains as well as an entomopathogenic bacteria. In addition to inducing a trypanosome refractory phenotype, colonization of tsetse with Esp_Z exerts only a modest fitness cost on the fly. Taken together, these findings suggest that Esp_Z could be applied to enhance the effectiveness of currently employed tsetse control programs.",

This study took advantage of publicly available data attached to a previous paper. The classification accuracy was assessed using an area under curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Given 24 phenotypic variables for 280 indica/japonica accessions, the LRMs were fitted with up to six phenotypic variables of all possible combinations; the highest AUC accounts for 0.9977, obtained with six variables including panicle number per plant, seed number per panicle, florets per panicle, panicle fertility, straighthead susceptibility and blast resistance. Overall, the more variables there are, the higher the resulting AUCs are. The ultimate purpose of this study is to demonstrate the indica/japonica prediction ability of the LRM when applied to unclassified Asian rice cultivars. To estimate the indica/japonica prediction accuracy, ten-fold cross-validations were conducted 100 times with the 280 indica/japonica accessions using the LRM with parameters that yielded the highest AUC. The resulting prediction accuracy accounted for 0.9779. This suggests that the LRM promises to be a highly effective indica/japonica prediction tool using phenotypic variables in Asian cultivated rice.",

Hence, this study aimed to further investigate the epidemic mechanism and associated factors of human brucellosis in China so as to provide suggestions on more effective countermeasures.\\n\\nMethodsData of human brucellosis incidence and some associated factors in economy, animal husbandry, transportation and health were collected at provincial level from 2005-2016. Time series plot and cluster analysis were first used to visualize incidence levels and categorize provinces based on their incidence level and epidemic trend of human brucellosis. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of data, the dynamic panel data model in combination with supervised principal component analysis was proposed to explore the effects of associated factors on human brucellosis.\\n\\nResults[circled1] The incidence rate of human brucellosis has increased threefold (from 1.41 in 2005 to 4.22 in 2016) in mainland China. Incidence rates in the north have always been higher than those in the south, but the latter also experienced an upward trend especially in the recent five years. [circled2] The 31 provinces of mainland China were categorized into three clusters, and each cluster had its own characteristics of incidence level and epidemic trend. [circled3] Public health expenditure and rural medical expenditure proportion were potential protective factors of human brucellosis, with attribute risks of -0.74 and -1.04 respectively. Other factors (such as amount of sheep, total length of highways, etc.) exhibited relatively trivial effects.\\n\\nConclusionsThe epidemic status of human brucellosis has changed in both spatial and temporal dimensions in recent years. Apart from those traditional control measures, more attention should be paid to the improvement of medical healthcare especially in rural areas in order to strengthen the control effect.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of HTN among Kaele dwellers, in the Far North Region of Cameroon where less attention seems to be paid on awareness and sensitization against overnutrition related diseases.\\n\\nMethodsTwo hundred and four participants were recruited during free health campaign on cardiovascular diseases organized from 10-15th February 2017 in kaele. Anthropometric and clinical parameters (weight, height, waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure and heart rate) were measured. A blood sampling was done for lipid profile analysis. HTN and subtypes were diagnosed according to WHO and IDF definitions respectively meanwhile hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia were diagnosed with IDF criteria.\\n\\nResultsThe overall prevalence of the HTN was 29.9%. Men were more affected than women (35% vs 22.6%, p<0.05). Participants aged between 50-59 years and > 60 years were more exposed (p<0.05). Forty-one percent (41%) of the hypertensive subjects of the study had systo-diastolic sub-type of HTN meanwhile 31.6% had isolated systolic HTN vs 23% with isolated diastolic HTN. Risk factors associated to HTN were : male gender (OR=2.236; p<0.05); absence of education (OR= 24.296; p<0.05); primary education level (OR=1.933; p<0.05); marital status \\\"married\\\" (OR=3.117; p<0.05), increased age (30-39, 50-59, and > 60 years, respectively with OR=4.113, p<0.05; OR=31.405, p<0.05 and OR=18.694, p<0.05), abdominal obesity (OR= 2.476; p<0.05) and low milky products consumption (OR=2.031, p<0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsHTN is quite present in Kaele locality and many non-modifiable, modifiable and socioeconomic risk factors significantly contributed to its development.",

    "abstract": "Lifetime reproductive capacity, or the total number of offspring that an individual can give rise to in its lifetime, is a fitness component critical to the evolutionary process. In insects, female reproductive capacity is largely determined by the number of ovarioles, the egg-producing subunits of the ovary. Recent work has provided insights into the genetic and environmental control of ovariole number in Drosophila melanogaster. However, whether regulatory mechanisms discovered under laboratory conditions also explain evolutionary variation in natural populations is an outstanding question. Here we report, for the first time, insights into the mechanisms regulating ovariole number and its evolution among Hawaiian Drosophila, a large adaptive radiation of fruit flies in which the highest and lowest ovariole numbers of the genus have evolved within 25 million years. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that ovariole number variation among Hawaiian Drosophila is best explained by adaptation to specific oviposition substrates. Further, we show that evolution of oviposition on ephemeral egg-laying substrates is linked to changes the allometric relationship between body size and ovariole number. Finally, we provide evidence that the developmental mechanism principally responsible for controlling ovariole number in D. melanogaster also regulates ovariole number in natural populations of Hawaiian drosophilids. By integrating ecology, organismal growth, and cell behavior during development to understand the evolution of ovariole number, this work connects the ultimate and proximate mechanisms of evolutionary change in reproductive capacity.",

    "abstract": "Dance as one of the earliest cultural assets of mankind is practised in different cultures, mostly for wellbeing or for treating psycho-physiological disorders like Parkinson, depression, autism. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are still unclear and only few studies address the effects of particular dance styles. For a first impression, we were interested in the effects of modern jazz dance (MJD) on the brain activation that would contribute to the understanding of these mechanisms. 11 female subjects rehearsed a MJD choreography for three weeks (1h per week) and passed electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements in a crossover-design thereafter. The objectives were to establish the differences between dancing physically and participating just mentally with or without music. Therefore, each subject realized the four following test conditions: dancing physically to and without music, dancing mentally to and without music. Each of the conditions were performed for 15 minutes. Before and after each condition, the EEG activities were recorded under resting conditions (2 min. eyes-open, 2 min. eyes-closed) followed by a subsequent wash-out phase of 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe results of the study revealed no time effects for the mental dancing conditions, either to or without music. An increased electrical brain activation was followed by the physical dancing conditions with and without music for the theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta and gamma frequency band across the entire scalp. Especially the higher frequencies (alpha-2, beta, gamma) showed increased brain activation across all brain areas. Higher brain activities for the physical dancing conditions were identified in comparison to the mental dancing condition. No statistically significant differences could be found as to dancing to or without music. Our findings demonstrate evidence for the immediate influence of modern jazz dance and its sweeping effects on all brain areas for all measured frequency bands, when dancing physically. In comparison, dancing just mentally does not result in similar effects.",

    "abstract": "Soil nutrients play a principal role in Camellia oleifera Abel (oil-seed camellia) production. Camellia oleifera absorbs nutrients from surrounding soils and its production is highly influenced by nutrients or fertilization. In this study, we investigated the effects of biogas slurry applications on soil nutrients and economic traits of C. oleifera fruits. Five different amounts of fertilizing biogas slurry (0, 10, 20, 30, or 40 kg/plant/year from three applications per year) were applied to C. oleifera plants in 2015 and 2016. Rhizosphere soil nutrients and C. oleifera fruit economic traits (yield, seed rate, and oil yield)were measured. Fertilization with biogas slurryincreasedsoil organic matter, available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in both 2015 and 2016. Increases in soil available N, P, and Kwere largest at the highest slurry application rate and second largest at the second highest application rate. Fruit economic traits were maximized at the two highest application rates. Oil yield was correlated withsoil available P in 2015 and 2016, and soil organic matter in 2015. Fertilization with biogas slurry decreased saturated fatty acid content in fruit but had no effect on unsaturated fatty acid content. In conclusion, fertilization with biogas slurry increases rhizosphere soil nutrients and fruit economic traits of C. oleifera with the rates of at least 30 kg/plant/year having the most positive effects.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of selection on genetic variation depends on the geographic organization of individuals and populations as well as the syntenic organization of loci within the genome. Spatially variable selection between marine and freshwater habitats has had a significant and heterogeneous impact on patterns of genetic variation across the genome of threespine stickleback fish. When marine stickleback invade freshwater habitats, more than a quarter of the genome can respond to divergent selection, even in as little as 50 years. This process largely uses standing genetic variation that can be found ubiquitously at low frequency in marine populations, can be millions of years old, and is likely maintained by significant bidirectional gene flow. Here, we combine population genomic data of marine and freshwater stickleback from Cook Inlet, Alaska, with genetic maps of stickleback fish derived from those same populations to examine how linkage to loci under selection affects genetic variation across the stickleback genome. Divergent selection has had opposing effects on linked genetic variation on chromosomes from marine and freshwater stickleback populations: near loci under selection, marine chromosomes are depauperate of variation while these same regions among freshwater genomes are the most genetically diverse. Forward genetic simulations recapitulate this pattern when different selective environments also differ in population structure. Lastly, dense genetic maps demonstrate that the interaction between selection and population structure may impact large stretches of the stickleback genome. These findings advance our understanding of how the structuring of populations across geography influences the outcomes of selection, and how the recombination landscape broadens the genomic reach of selection.",

    "abstract": "Condensins play a crucial role in the organization of genetic material by compacting and disentangling chromosomes. The condensin I and condensin II complexes are widely considered to have distinct functions based on studies in a few model organisms, although the specific functions of each complex are yet to be fully understood. The condensin II complex is critical for genome organization in Drosophila, and is a key anti-pairing factor that separates homologous chromosomes in somatic cells. Intriguingly, the Cap-G2 subunit of condensin II is absent in Drosophila melanogaster, and this loss may be related to the high levels of homologous chromosome pairing in somatic cells seen in flies. Here, we find that this Cap-G2 loss predates the origin of Dipterans, and other CapG2 losses have occurred independently in multiple insect lineages. Furthermore, the Cap-H2 and Cap-D3 subunits have also been repeatedly and independently lost in several insect orders, and some taxa lack condensin II-specific subunits entirely. We used Oligopaint DNA-FISH to quantify pairing levels in ten species across seven orders, representing several different configurations of the condensin II complex. We find that all non-Dipteran insects display near-uniform low pairing levels, suggesting that some key aspects of genome organization are robust to condensin II subunit losses. Finally, we observe consistent signatures of positive selection in condensin II subunits across flies and mammals. These findings suggest that these ancient complexes are far more evolutionarily labile than previously suspected, and are at the crossroads of several forms of genomic conflicts. Our results raise fundamental questions about the specific functions of the two condensin complexes and the interplay between them in taxa that have experienced subunit losses, and open the door to further investigations to elucidate the diversity of molecular mechanisms that underlie genome organization across various life forms.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that higher-order epistasis is ubiquitous and can have large effects on complex traits. Yet, we lack frameworks for understanding how epistatic interactions are influenced by basic aspects of cell physiology. In this study, we assess how protein quality control machinery--a critical component of cell physiology--affects epistasis for different traits related to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Specifically, we attempt to disentangle the interactions between different protein quality control genetic backgrounds and two sets of mutations: (i) SNPs associated with resistance to antibiotics in an essential bacterial enzyme (dihydrofolate reductase, or DHFR) and (ii) differing DHFR bacterial species-specific amino acid background sequences (Escherichia coli, Listeria grayi, and Chlamydia muridarum). In doing so, we add nuance to the generic observation that non-linear genetic interactions are widespread and capricious in nature, by proposing a mechanistically-grounded analysis of how proteostasis shapes epistasis. These findings simultaneously fortify and demystify the role of environmental context in modulating higher-order epistasis, with direct implications for evolutionary theory, genetic modification technology, and efforts to manage antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the presence of endo- and ecto-parasites, and vector-borne pathogens, in dogs from four islands of Greece. A total of 200 owned and sheltered dogs were examined with different microscopic, serological and molecular methods.\\n\\nOf the examined dogs, 130 (65%) were positive for one or more parasites and/or vector-borne pathogens. The most common zoonotic intestinal helminths recorded were Ancylostomatidae (12.5%) and Toxocara canis (3.5%). Ninety-three dogs (46.5%) seroreacted to Rickettsia conorii. Twenty-two (11%) of them were also PCR positive and 7 (3.5%) showed corpuscoles suggestive of Rickettsia spp. on the blood smears. Nineteen dogs (9.5%) were seropositive for Ehrlichia canis, three of them being also PCR positive. Dogs positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum-Anaplasma platys (1%), Dirofilaria immitis (0.5%) and Babesia canis (0.5%) were also found. Fleas and ticks were recorded in 53 (26.5%) and 50 (25%) dogs and all specimens were identified as Ctenocephalides felis felis and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu latu. Binary multiple univariate Generalized Linear Models were used to investigate factors and clinical signs related to the recorded positivity, while the association of specific signs with the pathogens was evaluated using tests of independence. Knowledge of occurrence and impact of zoonotic parasites and vector-borne pathogens in dog populations is crucial to prevent the infection in animals and people, and to control the risk of spreading of these pathogens in endemic and non-endemic areas.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBoth owned and sheltered dogs can harbor a variety of intestinal and extra-intestinal endoparasites, as well as vector-borne pathogens and ectoparasites, of zoonotic concern. Dog shelters and stray dogs are present in several touristic areas of Greece, including Sporades and Cyclades islands, where tourists often bring their pets with them, likely travelling from non-endemic to endemic areas. The present study has been carried out with the aim to evaluate the occurrence of the aforementioned pathogens. Data obtained showed that they are present in canine populations of Greece, with possibilities of infection for travelling dogs, which can also contribute to the spreading of zoonotic vector-borne diseases, introducing new pathogens in previously non-endemic areas. For these reasons, a constant monitoring of the epidemiological situation, improving control measures and correct diagnostic approaches are of primary importance for the prevention of canine and human infections, decreasing the spreading of potentially deadly pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The insulin insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway has been hypothesized as a major determinant of life history profiles that vary adaptively in natural populations. In Drosophila melanogaster, multiple components of this pathway vary predictably with latitude; this includes foxo, a conserved gene that regulates insulin signaling and has pleiotropic effects on a variety of fitness-associated traits. We hypothesized that allelic variation at foxo underlies genetic variance for traits that vary with latitude and reflect local adaptation. To evaluate this, we generated recombinant outbred populations in which the focal foxo allele was homozygous and fixed for either the allele common at high latitude or low latitude and the genomic background was randomized across 20 inbred lines. After eight generations of recombination, experimental populations were phenotyped for a series of traits related to gene function. Our results demonstrate that natural allelic variation at foxo has major and predictable effects on body size and starvation tolerance, but not on development time. These patterns mirror those observed in natural populations collected across the latitudinal gradient in the eastern U.S.: clines were observed for starvation tolerance and body size, but development time exhibited no association with latitude. Furthermore, differences in size between foxo genotypes were equivalent to those observed between populations sampled from the latitudinal extremes, although contribution to the genetic variance for starvation tolerance was less pronounced. These results suggest that allelic variation at foxo is a major contributor to adaptive patterns of life history variation in natural populations of this genetic model.",

    "abstract": "Our brain perceives the world by exploiting multiple sensory modalities to extract information about various aspects of external stimuli. If these sensory cues are from the same stimulus of interest, they should be integrated to improve perception; otherwise, they should be segregated to distinguish different stimuli. In reality, however, the brain faces the challenge of recognizing stimuli without knowing in advance whether sensory cues come from the same or different stimuli. To address this challenge and to recognize stimuli rapidly, we argue that the brain should carry out multisensory integration and segregation concurrently with complementary neuron groups. Studying an example of inferring heading-direction via visual and vestibular cues, we develop a concurrent multisensory processing neural model which consists of two reciprocally connected modules, the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), and that at each module, there exists two distinguishing groups of neurons, congruent and opposite neurons. Specifically, congruent neurons implement cue integration, while opposite neurons compute the cue disparity, both optimally as described by Bayesian inference. The two groups of neurons provide complementary information which enables the neural system to assess the validity of cue integration and, if necessary, to recover the lost information associated with individual cues without re-gathering new inputs. Through this process, the brain achieves rapid stimulus perception if the cues come from the same stimulus of interest, and differentiates and recognizes stimuli based on individual cues with little time delay if the cues come from different stimuli of interest. Our study unveils the indispensable role of opposite neurons in multisensory processing and sheds light on our understanding of how the brain achieves multisensory processing efficiently and rapidly.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOur brain perceives the world by exploiting multiple sensory cues. These cues need to be integrated to improve perception if they come from the same stimulus and otherwise be segregated. To address the challenge of recognizing whether sensory cues come from the same or different stimuli that are unknown in advance, we propose that the brain should carry out multisensory integration and segregation concurrently with two different neuron groups. Specifically, congruent neurons implement cue integration, while opposite neurons compute the cue disparity, and the interplay between them achieves rapid stimulus recognition without information loss. We apply our model to the example of inferring heading-direction based on visual and vestibular cues and reproduce the experimental data successfully.",

    "abstract": "When solving dynamic visuo-spatial tasks, the brain copes with perceptual and cognitive processing challenges. In the multiple-object tracking (MOT) task, the number of objects to be tracked (i.e. load) imposes attentional demands, but so does spatial interference from irrelevant objects (i.e. crowding). Presently, it is not clear whether load and crowding activate separate cognitive and physiological mechanisms. Such knowledge would be important to understand the neurophysiology of visual attention. Furthermore, it would help resolve conflicting views between theories of visual cognition, particularly concerning sources of capacity limitations. To address this problem, we varied the degree of processing challenge in the MOT task in two ways: First, the number of objects to track, and second, the spatial proximity between targets and distractors. We first measured task-induced pupil dilations and saccades during MOT. In a separate cohort we measured fMRI brain activity during MOT. The behavioral results in both cohorts revealed that increased load and crowding led to reduced accuracy in an additive manner. Load was associated with pupil dilations, whereas crowding was not. Activity in dorsal attentional areas and frequency of saccades were proportionally larger both with higher levels of load and crowding. Higher crowding recruited additionally ventral attentional areas that may reflect orienting mechanisms. The activity in the brainstem nuclei ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and locus coeruleus showed clearly dissociated patterns. Our results constitute convergent evidence from independent samples that processing challenges due to load and object spacing may rely on different mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Myosteatosis is the pathological accumulation of lipid that can occur in conjunction with atrophy and fibrosis following skeletal muscle injury. Little is known about the mechanisms by which lipid accumulates in myosteatosis, but many clinical studies have demonstrated the degree of lipid infiltration negatively correlates with muscle function and regeneration. Our objective was to determine the pathological changes that result in lipid accumulation in injured muscle fibers. We used a rat model of rotator cuff injury in this study, as the rotator cuff muscle group is particularly prone to the development of myosteatosis after injury. Muscles were collected from uninjured controls, or 10, 30, or 60 days after injury, and analyzed using a combination of muscle fiber contractility assessments, RNA sequencing, and undirected metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics, along with bioinformatics techniques, to identify potential pathways and cellular processes that are dysregulated after rotator cuff tear. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that mitochondrial function was likely disrupted after injury. Based on these findings, and given the role that mitochondria play in lipid metabolism, we then performed targeted biochemical and imaging studies and determined that mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced fatty acid oxidation likely leads to the accumulation of lipid in myosteatosis.",

    "abstract": "Dingoes (Canis dingo) are wild canids living in Australia. They have lived isolated from both the wild and the domestic ancestor and are a unique model for studying feralization, the process in which a domestic species escapes human control, adapts to the wild, and diverges from the domestic ancestor into a genetically distinct population. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 10 dingoes and 2 New Guinea Singing Dogs, to study the origins and feralization process of the dingo. Phylogenetic and demographic analyses show that dingoes originate from domestic dogs in southern East Asia, which migrated via Island Southeast Asia to reach Australia 4300-5000 years ago, and subsequently diverged into a genetically distinct population. Selection analysis identified 99 positively selected genes enriched in starch and fat metabolism pathways, indicating a diet change during feralization of dingoes. Interestingly, we found that 14 genes have shifted allele frequencies compared to dogs but not compared to wolves. This suggests that the selection affecting these genes during domestication of the wolf was reversed in the feralization process. One of these genes, ARHGEF7, may promote the formation of neural spine and synapses in hippocampal neurons. Functional assays showed that an A to G mutation in ARHGEF7, located in a transcription factor-binding site, decreases the endogenous expression. This suggests that ARHGEF7 may have been under selection for behavioral adaptations related to the transitions in environment both from wild to domestic and from domestic back to wild. Our results indicate that adaptation to domestication and feralization primarily affected different genomic regions, but that some genes, related to neurodevelopment, metabolism and reproduction, may have been reversibly affected in the two processes.",

To study how the intestinal microbiota influence enteric virus infection, several groups have used an antibiotic regimen in mice to deplete bacteria. These studies have shown that bacteria promote infection with several enteric viruses. However, very little is known about whether antibiotics influence viruses in a microbiota-independent manner. Here, we sought to determine the effects of antibiotics on coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) using an in vitro cell culture model in the absence of bacteria. We determined that an aminoglycoside antibiotic, neomycin, enhanced plaque size of CVB3-Nancy strain. Neomycin treatment did not alter viral attachment, translation, or replication. However, we found that the positive charge of neomycin and other positively charged compounds enhanced viral diffusion by overcoming the negative inhibitory effect of sulfated polysaccharides present in agar overlays. Overall, these data lend further evidence that antibiotics can play non-canonical roles in viral infections and that this should be considered when studying enteric virus-microbiota interactions.\\n\\nImportanceCoxsackieviruses primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans, but they can disseminate systemically and cause severe disease.

The mature protein YxaL contains a repeated beta-propeller domain, but the subcellular location and function of YxaL has not been determined. The gene encoding the mature YxaL protein was PCR amplified from genomic DNA of B. velezensis strain GH1-13 and used for recombinant protein production. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the purified YxaL was generated and used for western blotting to determine the constitutive expression and secretion of YxaL, which exhibited a half-life of 1.6 h in the culture medium of strain GH1-13. In this study, we show that seed treatments of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa L) with less than 1 mg L-1 of purified YxaL in a soaking solution were effective at improving the root growth of plants. The seedlings of the treated Arabidopsis seeds markedly increased transcription of a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthetase marker gene (ACS 11) but reduced expression of auxin-and abscisic acid-responsive marker genes (IAA1, GH3.3, and ABF4), especially when provided exogenous auxin. The horticulture experiments showed that pepper (Capsicum annum) seeds treated with 1 mg L-1 YxaL in soaking solution increased shoot growth and improved tolerance to drought stress. We hypothesize that YxaL secreted from plant growth-promoting Bacillus cells has a significant impact on plant roots, with the potential of improving plant growth and tolerance against stress.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring permanent non-selective (ns) His bundle (HB) pacing, it is crucial to confirm HB capture / exclude that only right ventricle (RV)-myocardial septal pacing is present. Because the effective refractory period (ERP) of the working myocardium is different than the ERP of the HB, we hypothesized that it should be possible to differentiate ns-HB capture from RV-myocardial capture using programmed extra-stimulus technique.\\n\\nMethodsIn consecutive patients during HB pacemaker implantation, programmed HB pacing was delivered from the screwed-in HB pacing lead. Premature beats were introduced at 10 ms steps during intrinsic rhythm and also after a drive train of 600 ms. The longest coupling interval that resulted in an abrupt change of QRS morphology was considered equal to ERP of HB or RV-myocardium.\\n\\nResultsProgrammed HB pacing was performed from 50 different sites in 32 patients. In 34/36 cases of ns-HB pacing, the RV-myocardial ERP was shorter than HB ERP (271.8{+/-}38 ms vs 353.0{+/-}30 ms, p < 0.0001). Programmed HB pacing using a drive train resulted in a typical abrupt change of paced QRS morphology: from ns-HB to RV-myocardial QRS (34/36 cases) or to selective HB QRS (2/36 cases). Programmed HB pacing delivered during supraventricular rhythm resulted in obtaining selective HB QRS in 20/34 and RV-myocardial QRS in 14/34 of the ns-HB cases. In RV-myocardial only pacing cases (\\\"false ns-HB pacing\\\", n=14), such responses were not observed - the QRS morphology remained stable. Therefore, the PHB pacing correctly diagnosed all ns-HB cases and all RV-myocardial pacing cases.\\n\\nConclusionsA novel maneuver for the diagnosis of HB capture, based on the differences in ERP between HB and myocardium was formulated, assessed and found as diagnostically valuable. This method is unique in enabling to visualize selective HB QRS in patients with otherwise obligatory ns-HB pacing (RV-myocardial capture threshold < HB capture threshold).\\n\\nWhat this study addsO_LIProgrammed His bundle pacing - a novel and straightforward method for unquestionable diagnosis of His bundle capture during non-selective pacing was developed and assessed.\\nC_LIO_LIA method for visualization of selective HB capture QRS in patients with obligatory non-selective pacing (myocardial capture threshold < His bundle capture threshold) was discovered and physiology behind it explained.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive investigation of early brain alterations in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is critical for understanding the neuroanatomical underpinnings of autism and its early diagnosis. Most previous brain imaging studies in ASD, however, are based on children older than 6 years - well after the average age of ASD diagnosis (~46 months). In this study, we use brain magnetic resonance images that were collected as part of clinical routine from patients who were later diagnosed with ASD. Using 15 ASD subjects of age three to four years and 18 age-matched non-ASD subjects as controls, we perform comprehensive comparison of different brain morphometric features and ASD vs. non-ASD classification by Random Forest machine learning method. We find that, although total intracranial volume (TIV) of ASD was 5.5 % larger than in non-ASD, brain volumes of many other brain areas (as a percentage of TIV) were smaller in ASD and can be partly attributed to larger (>10 %) ventricles in ASD. The larger TIV in ASD was correlated to larger surface area and increased amount of cortical folding but not to cortical thickness. The white matter regions in ASD had less image intensity (predominantly in the frontal and temporal regions) suggesting myelination deficit. We achieved 95 % area under the ROC curve (AUC) for ASD vs. non-ASD classification using all brain features. When classification was performed separately for each feature type, image intensity yielded the highest predictive power (95 % AUC), followed by cortical folding index (69 %), cortical and subcortical volume (69 %), and surface area (68 %). The most important feature for classification was white matter intensity surrounding the rostral middle frontal gyrus and was lower in ASD (d = 0.77, p = 0.04). The high degree of classification success indicates that the application of machine learning methods on brain features holds promise for earlier identification of ASD. To our knowledge this is the first study to leverage a clinical imaging archive to investigate early brain markers in ASD.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOrganismal life history traits are ideally adapted to local environments when an organism has a fitness advantage in one location relative to conspecifics from other geographies. Local adaptation has been best studied across, for example, latitudinal gradients, where organisms may tradeoff between investment in traits that maximize one, but not both, fitness components of somatic maintenance or reproductive output in the context of finite environmental resources. Latitudinal gradients in life history strategies are traditionally attributed to environmentally mediated selection on an animals genotype, without any consideration of the possible impact of associated microorganisms ( microbiota) on life history traits. Here we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, a key organism for studying local adaptation and life history strategies, associated microorganisms can drive life history variation. First, we reveal that an isogenic fly line reared with different bacteria vary the investment in early reproduction versus somatic maintenance, with little resultant variation in lifetime fitness. Next, we show that in wild Drosophila the abundance of these same bacteria was correlated with the latitude and life history strategy of the flies, and bacterial abundance was driven at least in part by host genetic selection. Finally, by eliminating or manipulating the microbiota of fly lines collected across a latitudinal gradient, we reveal that host genotype contributes to latitude-specific life history traits independent of the microbiota; but that the microbiota can override these host genetic adaptations. Taken together, these findings establish the microbiota as an essential consideration in local adaptation and life history evolution.\\n\\nSignificance statementExplanations of local adaptation have historically focused on how animal genotypes respond to environmental selection. Although the impact of variation in host life histories on the composition of the microbiota has been investigated for many associations, the scale and pattern of microbial effects on host life history strategy are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that microbiota effects on host life history strategy in the laboratory are matched by patterns of microbiota composition in wild host populations. In particular, microbiota composition varies with latitude and the effects of the microbiota on life history traits are greater than host genetic adaptations. Together, these findings demonstrate that the microbiota plays an important role in local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 proteins enable oncogenic transformation of HPV-infected cells by inactivating host cellular proteins. High-risk but not low-risk HPV E7 target PTPN14 for proteolytic degradation, suggesting that PTPN14 degradation may be related to their oncogenic activity. HPV infects human keratinocytes but the role of PTPN14 in keratinocytes and the consequences of PTPN14 degradation are unknown. Using an HPV16 E7 variant that can inactivate RB1 but cannot degrade PTPN14 we found that high-risk HPV E7-mediated PTPN14 degradation impairs keratinocyte differentiation. Deletion of PTPN14 from primary human keratinocytes decreased keratinocyte differentiation gene expression. Related to oncogenic transformation, both HPV16 E7-mediated PTPN14 degradation and PTPN14 deletion promoted keratinocyte survival following detachment from a substrate. PTPN14 degradation contributed to high-risk HPV E6/E7-mediated immortalization of primary keratinocytes and HPV-positive but not HPV-negative cancers exhibit a gene expression signature consistent with PTPN14 inactivation. We find that PTPN14 degradation impairs keratinocyte differentiation and propose that this contributes to high-risk HPV E7-mediated oncogenic activity independent of RB1 inactivation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman papillomaviruses uncouple proliferation from differentiation in order to enable virus replication in epithelial cells. HPV E7 proteins are well established to promote proliferation by binding to and inactivating retinoblastoma family proteins and other cell cycle inhibitors. However, mechanisms by which high-risk HPV oncoproteins inhibit differentiation have not been defined. This paper identifies the first mechanism by which high-risk HPV E7 inhibit keratinocyte differentiation. The inhibition of differentiation requires degradation of the cellular protein PTPN14 by high-risk HPV E7 and this degradation is related to the ability of high-risk HPV oncoproteins to immortalize keratinocytes and to cause cancer.",

    "abstract": "The complex genetic architecture of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and its heterogeneous phenotype make molecular diagnosis and patient prognosis challenging tasks. To establish more precise genotype-phenotype correlations in ASD, we developed a novel machine learning integrative approach, which seeks to delineate associations between patients clinical profiles and disrupted biological processes inferred from their Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that span brain genes. Clustering analysis of relevant clinical measures from 2446 ASD cases in the Autism Genome Project identified two distinct phenotypic subgroups. Patients in these clusters differed significantly in ADOS-defined severity, adaptive behaviour profiles, intellectual ability and verbal status, the latter contributing the most for cluster stability and cohesion. Functional enrichment analysis of brain genes disrupted by CNVs in these ASD cases identified 15 statistically significant biological processes, including cell adhesion, neural development, cognition and polyubiquitination, in line with previous ASD findings. A Naive Bayes classifier, generated to predict the ASD phenotypic clusters from disrupted biological processes, achieved predictions with a high Precision (0.82) but low recall (0.39), for a subset of patients with higher biological Information Content scores. This study shows that milder and more severe clinical presentations can have distinct underlying biological mechanisms. It further highlights how machine learning approaches can reduce clinical heterogeneity using multidimensional clinical measures, and establish genotype-phenotype correlations in ASD. However, predictions are strongly dependent on patients information content. Findings are therefore a first step towards the translation of genetic information into clinically useful applications, but emphasize the need for larger datasets with very complete clinical and biological information.",

These findings demonstrate genetic mechanisms by which early developmental events have a striking and widespread influence on adult anatomical and behavioral phenotypes, as well as the evolution of the human cerebral cortex.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIGenome wide map of human fetal brain eQTLs and sQTLs provides a new view of genetic control of expression and splicing.\\nC_LIO_LIThere is substantial contrast between genetic control of transcript regulation in mature versus developing brain.\\nC_LIO_LIWe identify novel regulatory regions specific to fetal brain development.\\nC_LIO_LIIntegration of eQTLs and GWAS reveals specific relationships between expression and disease risk for neuropsychiatric diseases and relevant human brain phenotypes.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Extinction-resistant threat is considered to be a central feature of pathological anxiety. Reduced threat extinction is observed in individuals with high intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Here we sought to determine whether contingency instructions could alter the course threat extinction for individuals high in IU. We tested this hypothesis in two identical experiments (Exp 1 n = 60, Exp 2 n = 82) where we recorded electrodermal activity during threat acquisition with partial reinforcement, and extinction. Participants were split into groups based on extinction instructions (instructed, uninstructed) and IU score (low, high). All groups displayed larger skin conductance responses to learned threat versus safety cues during threat acquisition, indicative of threat conditioning. In both experiments, only the uninstructed high IU groups displayed larger skin conductance responses to the learned threat versus safety cue during threat extinction. These findings suggest that uncertain threat during extinction maintains conditioned responding in individuals high in IU.",

    "abstract": "Existing treatments against drug addiction are often ineffective due to the complexity of the networks of protein-drug and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that mediate the development of drug addiction and related neurobiological disorders. There is an urgent need for understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie drug addiction toward designing novel preventive or therapeutic strategies. The rapidly accumulating data on addictive drugs and their targets as well as advances in machine learning methods and computing technology now present an opportunity to systematically mine existing data and draw inferences on potential new strategies. To this aim, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of cellular pathways implicated in a diverse set of 50 drugs of abuse using quantitative systems pharmacology methods. The analysis of the drug/ligand-target interactions compiled in DrugBank and STITCH databases revealed 142 known and 48 newly predicted targets, which have been further analyzed to identify the KEGG pathways enriched at different stages of drug addiction cycle, as well as those implicated in cell signaling and regulation events associated with drug abuse. Apart from synaptic neurotransmission pathways detected as a common upstream signaling module that  senses the early effects of drugs of abuse, pathways involved in neuroplasticity are distinguished as determinants of neuronal morphological changes. Notably, many signaling pathways converge on important targets such as mTORC1. The latter is proposed to act as a universal effector of the persistent restructuring of neurons in response to continued use of drugs of abuse.",

Though microbial physiology and biofilm formation have been studied for decades, tracing the mechanistic and ecological links between individual cell properties and the emergent features of cell groups is still in its infancy. Here we use single-cell resolution confocal microscopy to explore biofilm properties of the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae in conditions closely mimicking its marine habitat. We find that some - but not all - pandemic isolates produce filamentous cells than can be over 50 m long. This filamentous morphotype gains a profound competitive advantage in colonizing and spreading on particles of chitin, the material many marine Vibrio species depend on for growth outside of hosts. Furthermore, filamentous cells can produce biofilms that are independent of all currently known secreted components of the V. cholerae biofilm matrix; instead, filamentous biofilm architectural strength appears to derive from the entangled mesh of cells themselves. The advantage gained by filamentous cells in early chitin colonization and growth is counter-balanced in longer term competition experiments with matrix-secreting V. cholerae variants, whose densely packed biofilm structures displace competitors from surfaces. Overall our results reveal a novel mode of biofilm architecture that is dependent on filamentous cell morphology and advantageous in environments with rapid chitin particle turnover. This insight provides concrete links between V. cholerae cell morphology, biofilm formation, marine ecology, and - potentially - the strain composition of cholera epidemics.",

More recently, the pace of functional discovery has slowed, leaving around 20% of the proteins even in well-studied model organisms without informative descriptions of their biological roles. Remarkably, many uncharacterized proteins are conserved from yeasts to human, suggesting that they contribute to fundamental biological processes. To fully understand biological systems in health and disease, we need to account for every part of the system. Unstudied proteins thus represent a collective blind spot that limits the progress of both basic and applied biosciences.\\n\\nWe use a simple yet powerful metric based on Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms to define characterized and uncharacterized proteins for human, budding yeast, and fission yeast. We then identify a set of conserved but unstudied proteins in S. pombe, and classify them based on a combination of orthogonal attributes determined by large-scale experimental and comparative methods. Finally, we explore possible reasons why these proteins remain neglected, and propose courses of action to raise their profile and thereby reap the benefits of completing the catalog of proteins biological roles.",

    "abstract": "One of the key challenges in cancer precision medicine is finding robust biomarkers of drug response. Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) have emerged as reliable preclinical models since they better recapitulate tumor response to chemo- and targeted therapies. However, the lack of standard tools poses a challenge in the analysis of PDXs with molecular and pharmacological profiles. Efficient storage, access and analysis is key to the realization of the full potential of PDX pharmacogenomic data. We have developed Xeva (XEnograft Visualization & Analysis), an open-source software package for processing, visualization and integrative analysis of a compendium of in vivo pharmacogenomic datasets. The Xeva package follows the PDX minimum information (PDX-MI) standards and can handle both replicate-based and 1x1x1 experimental designs. We used Xeva to characterize the variability of gene expression and pathway activity across passages. We found that only a few genes and pathways have passage specific alterations (median intraclass correlation of 0.53 for genes and positive enrichment score for 92.5% pathways). For example, activity of the mRNA 3-end processing and elongation arrest and recovery pathways were strongly affected by model passaging (gene set enrichment analysis false discovery rate [FDR] <5%). We then leveraged our platform to link the drug response and the pathways whose activity is consistent across passages by mining the Novartis PDX Encyclopedia (PDXE) data containing 1,075 PDXs spanning 5 tissue types and 62 anticancer drugs. We identified 87 pathways significantly associated with response to 51 drugs (FDR < 5%), including associations such as erlotinib response and signaling by EGFR in cancer pathways and MAP kinase activation in TLR cascade and binimetinib response. Among the significant pathway-drug associations, we found novel biomarkers based on gene expressions, Copy Number Aberrations (CNAs) and mutations predictive of drug response (concordance index > 0.60; FDR < 0.05). Xeva provides a flexible platform for integrative analysis of preclinical in vivo pharmacogenomics data to identify biomarkers predictive of drug response, a major step toward precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures proper chromosome segregation by monitoring kinetochore-microtubule interactions. SAC proteins are shed from kinetochores once stable attachments are achieved. Human kinetochores consist of hundreds of SAC protein recruitment modules and bind up to 20 microtubules, raising the question how the SAC responds to intermediate attachment states. We show that the  RZZS-MAD1/2 module of the SAC is removed from kinetochores at low microtubule occupancy and remains absent at higher occupancies, while the  BUB1/R1 module is retained at substantial levels irrespective of attachment states. Artificially tuning the affinity of kinetochores for microtubules further shows that ~50% occupancy is sufficient to shed MAD2 and silence the SAC. Kinetochores thus responds as a single unit to shut down SAC signaling at submaximal occupancy states, but retains one SAC module. This may ensure continued SAC silencing on kinetochores with fluctuating occupancy states while maintaining the ability for fast SAC re-activation.",

The MAC is formed by sequential assembly of soluble complement proteins C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9, but little is known about the rate-limiting steps in this process. Here, we use rapid atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to show that MAC proteins oligomerize within the membrane, unlike structurally homologous bacterial pore-forming toxins. C5b6 interacts with the lipid bilayer prior to recruiting C7 and C8. We discover that incorporation of the first C9 is the kinetic bottleneck of MAC formation, after which rapid C9 oligomerization completes the pore. This defines the kinetic basis for MAC assembly and provides insight into how human cells are protected from bystander damage by the cell surface receptor CD59, which is offered a maximum temporal window to halt the assembly at the point of C9 insertion.",

Nonetheless, a subset of physiologically important mRNAs (e.g., HIF-1, FGF-9, and p53) is still translated by an unknown, cap-independent mechanism. Additionally, expression levels of eIF4G and its homolog, death associated protein 5 (DAP5), are elevated. Using fluorescence anisotropy binding studies, luciferase reporter-based in vitro translation assays, and mutational analyses, here we demonstrate that eIF4GI and DAP5 specifically bind to the 5 UTRs of these cap-independently translated mRNAs. Surprisingly, we find that the eIF4E binding domain of eIF4GI increases not only the binding affinity, but also the selectivity among these mRNAs. We further demonstrate that the affinities of eIF4GI and DAP5 binding to these 5 UTRs correlate with the efficiency with which these factors drive cap-independent translation of these mRNAs. Integrating the results of our binding and translation assays, we show that eIF4GI and/or DAP5 are critical for recruitment of a specific subset of mRNAs to the ribosome and provide mechanistic insight into their cap-independent translation.",

    "abstract": "Growth factors initiate anabolism by activating mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via the small GTPase Rheb. We show that the GTPase cycle of Rheb is spatially regulated by the interaction with its GDI-like solubilizing factor (GSF) - PDE{delta}. Arl2-GTP mediated localized release of cytosolic Rheb-GTP from PDE{delta} deposits it onto perinuclear membranes where it forms a complex with mTORC1. The membrane associated GTPase activating protein (GAP) TSC2 hydrolyzes Rheb-GTP, weakening the interaction with mTOR. Rheb-GDP is readily released into the cytosol where it is maintained soluble by interaction with PDE{delta}. This solubilized Rheb is re-activated by nucleotide exchange to be re-deposited by Arl2-mediated release onto perinuclear membranes. This spatial GTPase cycle thereby enables mTORC1 activation to be solely controlled by growth factor induced inactivation of TSC2. The coupling between mTOR activation and spatially regulated Rheb nucleotide exchange makes growth factor induced proliferation critically dependent on PDE{delta} expression.",

Here, we present experimental evidence that a homoplasmic mutation in the mitochondrially encoded complex I gene mt-Nd2 modulates lifespan by altering cellular tryptophan levels and, consequently, ageing-related pathways in mice. A conplastic mouse strain carrying a mutation at m.4738C>A in mt-Nd2 lived significantly shorter than the controls did. The same mutation led to a higher susceptibility to glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet feeding. These phenotypes were not observed in mice carrying a mutation in another mtDNA-encoded complex I gene, mt-Nd5, suggesting the functional relevance of particular mutations in complex I to ageing and age-related diseases.",

Here we analyzed brain MRI data from the UK Biobank in a population-based sample of individuals (ages 44-80) who were exposed (n=2,510) or unexposed (n=6,079) to smoking around birth. We used robust statistical models, including quantile regressions, to test the effect of perinatal smoke exposure (PSE) on cortical surface area (SA), thickness, and subcortical volume. We hypothesized that PSE would be associated with cortical disruption in primary sensory areas compared to unexposed (PSE-) adults. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, SA was significantly lower in the pericalcarine (PCAL), inferior parietal (IPL), and regions of the temporal and frontal cortex of PSE+ adults; these abnormalities were associated with increased risk for several diseases, including circulatory and endocrine conditions. Sensitivity analyses conducted in a hold-out group of healthy participants (exposed, n=109, unexposed, n=315) replicated the effect of PSE on SA in the PCAL and IPL.
