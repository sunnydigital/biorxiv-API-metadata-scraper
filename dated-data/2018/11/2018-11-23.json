    "abstract": "BackgroundHealth care workers (HCW) are at risk of infection during Ebola virus disease outbreaks and therefore may be targeted for vaccination before or during outbreaks. The effect of these strategies depends on the role of HCW in transmission which is understudied.\\n\\nMethodsTo evaluate the effect of HCW-targeted or community vaccination strategies, we used a transmission model to explore the relative contribution of HCW and the community to transmission. We calibrated the model to data from multiple Ebola outbreaks. We quantified the impact of ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies, and reactive HCW and community vaccination.\\n\\nResultsWe found that for some outbreaks (we call \\\"type 1\\\") HCW amplified transmission both to other HCW and the community, and in these outbreaks prophylactic vaccination of HCW decreased outbreak size. Reactive vaccination strategies had little effect because type 1 outbreaks ended quickly. However, in outbreaks with longer time courses (\\\"type 2 outbreaks\\\"), reactive community vaccination decreased the number of cases, with or without prophylactic HCW-targeted vaccination. For both outbreak types, we found that ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies had an impact at coverage of 30%.\\n\\nConclusionsThe optimal vaccine strategy depends on the dynamics of the outbreak and the impact of other interventions on transmission. Although we will not know the characteristics of a new outbreak, ahead-of-time HCW-targeted vaccination can decrease the total outbreak size, even at low vaccine coverage.\\n\\nsummaryTargeting health care workers for Ebola virus disease vaccination can decrease the size of outbreaks, and the number of health care workers infected. The impact of these strategies decrease depends on timing, coverage, and the dynamics of the outbreak.",

    "abstract": "Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and unbiasedness of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time in Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but models were increasingly inaccurate at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making requiring predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.",

    "abstract": "FDA approval of multiple drugs differing in chemical structures but targeting the same protein raises the question whether such drugs have sufficiently similar mechanisms of action to be considered functionally equivalent. In this paper we compare three recently approved inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4/6 - palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib - that are becoming important therapies for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast and potentially other cancers. We find that transcriptional and proteomic changes induced by the three drugs differ significantly and that abemaciclib has unique cellular activities including induction of cell death (even in pRb-deficient cells), arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and reduced drug adaptation. These activities appear to arise from inhibition of kinases other than CDK4/6 including CDK2/Cyclin A/E and CDK1/Cyclin B.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe target profiles of most drugs are established relatively early in their development and are not systematically revisited at the time of approval. Scattered reports suggest that palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib differ in pharmacokinetics, dosing, and adverse effects but the three drugs are generally regarded as similar. Our finding that the drugs differ substantially in mechanism of action - abemaciclib retains activities of the earlier-generation drug alvocidib - suggests the potential for different uses in the clinic: in particular, abemaciclib may show activity in patients progressing on palbociclib or ribociclib. More generally, our approach relying on data from five distinct phenotypic and biochemical assays strongly suggests that a multi-faceted approach is necessary to get a reliable picture the target spectrum of kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "At least two distinct processes have been identified by which motor commands are adapted according to movement-related feedback: reward based learning and sensory error based learning. In sensory error based learning, mappings between sensory targets and motor commands are recalibrated according to sensory error feedback. In reward based learning, motor commands are associated with subjective value, such that successful actions are reinforced. We designed two tasks to isolate reward and sensory error based motor adaptation, and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from humans to identify and dissociate the neural correlates of reward and sensory error processing. We designed a visuomotor rotation task to isolate sensory error based learning which was induced by altered visual feedback of hand position. In a reward learning task, we isolated reward based learning induced by binary reward feedback that was decoupled from the visual target. We found that a fronto-central event related potential called the feedback related negativity (FRN) was elicited specifically by reward feedback but not sensory error feedback. A more posterior component called the P300 was evoked by feedback in both tasks. In the visuomotor rotation task, P300 amplitude was increased by sensory error induced by perturbed visual feedback, and was correlated with learning rate. In the reward learning task, P300 amplitude was increased by reward relative to non reward and by surprise regardless of feedback valence. We propose that during motor adaptation, the FRN might specifically mark reward prediction error while the P300 might reflect processing which is modulated more generally by prediction error.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyWe studied the event related potentials evoked by feedback stimuli during motor adaptation tasks that isolate reward and sensory error learning mechanisms. We found that the feedback related negativity was specifically elicited by reward feedback, while the P300 was observed in both tasks. These results reveal neural processes associated with different learning mechanisms and elucidate which classes of errors, from a computational standpoint, elicit the FRN and P300.",

We focus on inferring the symmetric division probability for cancer stem cells in our model, as this is believed to be a key driving parameter of tumour progression and therapeutic response. Given the advent of multi-region sampling, and the opportunities offered by them to understand tumour evolutionary history, we focus on a suite of statistical measures of the phylogenetic trees resulting from the tumours evolution in different regions of parameter space and through time. We find strikingly different patterns in these measures for changing symmetric division probability which hinge on the inclusion of spatial constraints.

    "abstract": "Cell diversity in multicellular organisms relies on coordination between cell proliferation and the acquisition of cell identity. The equilibrium between these two processes is essential to assure the correct number of determined cells at a given time at a given place. Here, we show that Tramtrack-69 (Ttk69, a BTB-ZF transcription factor ortholog of the human PLZF factor) plays an essential role in controlling this balance. In the Drosophila bristle cell lineage, producing the external sensory organs composed by a neuron and accessory cells, we show that ttk69 loss of function leads to supplementary neural-type cells at the expense of accessory cells. Our data indicate that Ttk69 (1) promotes cell-cycle exit of newborn terminal cells by downregulating cycE, the principal cyclin involved in S-phase entry and (2) regulates cell fate acquisition and terminal differentiation by downregulating the expression of hamlet and upregulating that of Suppressor of Hairless, two transcription factors involved in neural-fate acquisition and accessory-cell differentiation, respectively. Thus, Ttk69 plays a central role in shaping neural cell lineages by integrating molecular mechanisms that regulate progenitor cell-cycle exit and cell-fate commitment.\\n\\nSummary statementTramtrack-69, a transcription factor orthologous to the human tumor-suppressor PLZF, plays a central role in precursor cell lineages by integrating molecular mechanisms that regulate progenitor cell-cycle exit and cell-fate determination.",

The presence of hexagonally ordered DNA is observed in virus capsids, sperm heads and in dinoflagellates. Rigorous modelling of this process in all-atom MD simulations is presently difficult to achieve due to size and time scale limitations. We used a hierarchical approach for systematic multiscale coarse-grained (CG) simulations of DNA phase separation induced by the three-valent cobalt(III)-hexammine (CoHex3+). Solvent-mediated effective potentials for a CG model of DNA were extracted from all-atom MD simulations. Simulations of several hundred 100-bp-long CG DNA oligonucleotides in the presence of explicit CoHex3+ ions demonstrated aggregation to a liquid crystalline hexagonally ordered phase. Following further coarse-graining and extraction of effective potentials, we conducted modelling at mesoscale level. In agreement with electron microscopy observations, simulations of an 10.2-kbp-long DNA molecule showed phase separation to either a toroid or a fibre with distinct hexagonal DNA packing. The mechanism of toroid formation is analysed in detail. The approach used here is based only on the underlying all-atom force field and uses no adjustable parameters and may be generalized to modelling chromatin up to chromosome size.",

    "abstract": "Primeval forests are today exceedingly rare in Europe and transfer of forest reproductive material for afforestation and improvement have been very common, especially over the last two centuries. This can be a serious impediment when inferring past population movements in response to past climate changes such as the last glacial maximum (LGM), some 18,000 years ago. In the present study, we genotyped 1,672 individuals from three Picea species (P. abies, P. obovata, and P. omorika) at 400K SNPs using exome capture to infer the past demographic history of Norway spruce and estimate the amount of recent introduction used to establish the Norway spruce breeding program in Southern Sweden. Most of these trees belong to P. abies and originate from the base population of the Swedish breeding program. Others originate from populations across the natural ranges of the three species. Of the 1,499 individuals stemming from the breeding program, a large proportion corresponds to recent introductions. The split of P. omorika occurred 23 million years ago (mya), while the divergence between P. obovata and P. abies began 17.6 mya. Demographic inferences retrieved the same main clusters within P. abies than previous studies, i.e. a vast northern domain ranging from Norway to central Russia, where the species is progressively replaced by Siberian spruce (P. obovata) and two smaller domains, an Alpine domain, and a Carpathian one, but also revealed further subdivision and gene flow among clusters. The three main domains divergence was ancient (15 mya) and all three went through a bottleneck corresponding to the LGM. Approximately 17% of P. abies Nordic domain migrated from P. obovata ~103K years ago, when both species had much larger effective population sizes. Our analysis of genome-wide polymorphism data thus revealed the complex demographic history of Picea genus in Western Europe and highlighted the importance of material transfer in Swedish breeding program.",

One consequence of WGD is a dramatic restructuring of the genome as it undergoes diploidization, a process under which deletions and rearrangements of various sizes scramble the genetic material, leading to a repacking of the genome and eventual return to diploidy. Here, we investigate the history of WGD in the columbine genus Aquilegia, a basal eudicot, and use it to illuminate the origins of the core eudicots.\\n\\nResultsWithin-genome synteny confirms that columbines are ancient tetraploids, and comparison with the grape genome reveals that this tetraploidy appears to be shared with the core eudicots. Thus, the ancient gamma hexaploidy found in all core eudicots must have involved a two-step process: first tetraploidy in the ancestry of all eudicots, then hexaploidy in the ancestry of core eudicots. Furthermore, the precise pattern of synteny sharing suggests that the latter involved allopolyploidization, and that core eudicots thus have a hybrid origin.\\n\\nConclusionsNovel analyses of synteny sharing together with the well-preserved structure of the columbine genome reveal that the gamma hexaploidy at the root of core eudicots is likely a result of hybridization between a tetraploid and a diploid species.",

    "abstract": "Pupillometry, the measure of pupil size and reactivity, has been widely used to assess cognitive processes. As such, changes in pupil size have been shown to correlate with arousal, locomotion, cortical state and decision-making processes. In addition, pupillary responses have been linked to the activity of neuromodulatory systems that modulate attention and perception as the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems. Due to the extent of processes reflected by the pupil, we aimed at resolving pupillary responses in context of behavioral state and task performance while recording pupillary transients of mice performing a vibrotactile two-alternative forced choice task (2-AFC). We show that pre-stimulus pupil size differentiates between states of disengagement from task performance versus active engagement. In addition, when actively engaged, post-stimulus, pupillary dilations for correct responses are larger than for error responses with this difference reflecting response confidence. Importantly, in a delayed 2-AFC task version, we show that even though pupillary transients mainly reflect motor output or reward anticipation following the response of the animal, they also reflect animal decision confidence prior to its response. Finally, in a condition of passive engagement, when stimulus has no task relevance with reward provided automatically, pupillary dilations reflect stimulation and reward being reduced relative to a state of active engagement explained by shifts of attention from task variables. Our results provide further evidence for how pupillary dilations reflect cognitive processes in a task relevant context, showing that the pupil reflects response confidence and baseline pupil size encodes attentiveness rather than general arousal.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFor the last 60 years, pupillometry has been used to study various cognitive processes. Among which are mental load, arousal and various decision related components, linking pupil dilations to underlying neuromodulatory systems. Our results provide extensive evidence that in addition to reflecting attentiveness under task performance, pupil dilations also reflect the confidence of the subject in his ensuing response. This confidence coding is overlaid within a more pronounced pupil dilation that reflects motor output or other post-decision components such that are related to the response itself but not to the decision. Our results also provide evidence how different behavioral states, imposed by task demands, modulate what the pupil is reflecting, presumably showing what the underlying cognitive network is coding for.",

    "abstract": "Artificial selection experiments are designed to investigate phenotypic evolution of complex traits and its genetic bases. Here we focused on flowering time, a trait of key importance for plant adaptation and life-cycle shifts. We undertook divergent selection experiments (Saclay DSEs) from two maize inbred lines. After 13 generations of selection, we obtained we obtained a time-lag of roughly two weeks between Early- and Late-populations. We used this material to characterize the genome-wide transcriptomic response to selection in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) before, during and after floral transition in realistic field conditions during two consecutive years. We validated the reliability of performing RNA-sequencing in uncontrolled conditions. We found that roughly half of maize genes were expressed in the SAM, 59.3% of which were differentially expressed. We detected a majority of genes with differential expression between inbreds and across meristem status, and retrieved a subset of 2,451 genes involved in the response to selection. Among these, we found a significant enrichment for genes with known function in maize flowering time. Furthermore, they were more often shared between inbreds than expected by chance, suggesting convergence of gene expression. We discuss new insights into the expression pattern of key players of the underlying gene regulatory network including ZCN8, RAP2.7, ZMM4, KN1, GA2ox1, as well as alternative scenarios for genetic convergence.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells transmit information by signaling through complex networks of interacting proteins. Here we develop a theoretical and computational framework that relates the biophysics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within a signaling network to its information processing properties. To do so, we generalize statistical physics-inspired models for protein binding to account for interactions that depend on post-translational state (e.g. phosphorylation). By combining these models with information-theoretic methods, we find that PPIs are a key determinant of information transmission within a signaling network, with weak interactions giving rise to \\\"noise\\\" that diminishes information transmission. While noise can be mitigated by increasing interaction strength, the accompanying increase in transmission comes at the expense of a slower dynamical response. This suggests that the biophysics of signaling protein interactions give rise to a fundamental \\\"speed-information\\\" trade-off. Surprisingly, we find that cross-talk between pathways in complex signaling networks do not significantly alter information capacity-an observation that may partially explain the promiscuity and ubiquity of weak PPIs in heavily interconnected networks. We conclude by showing how our framework can be used to design synthetic biochemical networks that maximize information transmission, a procedure we dub \\\"InfoMax\\\" design.",

However, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of APOE genotype on microflora speciation and metabolism is completely lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between APOE genotype and the gut microbiome composition in human and APOE-targeted replacement (TR, APOE3 and APOE4) transgenic mice. Faecal microbiota amplicon sequencing from matched individuals with different APOE genotypes revealed no significant differences in overall microbiota diversity (alpha or beta diversity) in group-aggregated human APOE genotypes. However, several bacterial taxa showed significantly different relative abundance between APOE genotypes. Notably, we detected an association of Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae and several butyrate-producing genera abundances with APOE genotypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the gut microbiota of APOE-TR mice. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of faecal water from murine samples detected significant differences in microbe-associated amino acids and short-chain fatty acids between APOE genotypes. Together, the findings indicate that APOE genotype associated with specific gut microbiome profiles in both humans and in APOE-TR mice. This suggests that the gut microbiome is worth further investigation as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the deleterious impact of the APOE4 allele on cognitive decline and the prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSearch results from local alignment search tools use statistical parameters sensitive to the size of the database. NCBI BLAST, for example, reports important matches using similarity scores and expect or e-values calculated against database size. Over the course of an investigation, the database grows and the best matches may change. To update the results of a sequence similarity search to find the most optimal hits, bioinformaticians must rerun the BLAST search against the entire database; this translates into irredeemable spent time, money, and computational resources.\\n\\nResultsWe develop an efficient way to redeem spent BLAST search effort by introducing the Incremental BLAST. This tool makes use of the previous BLAST search results as it conducts new searches on only the incremental part of the database, recomputes statistical metrics such as e-values and combines these two sets of results to produce updated results. We develop statistics for correcting e-values of any BLAST result against any arbitrary sequence database. The experimental results and accuracy analysis demonstrate that Incremental BLAST can provide search results identical to NCBI BLAST at a significantly reduced computational cost. We apply three case studies to showcase different use cases where Incremental BLAST can make biological discovery more efficiently at a reduced cost. This tool can be used to update sequence blasts during the course of genomic and transcriptomic projects, such as in re-annotation projects, and to conduct incremental addition of taxon-specific sequences to a BLAST database. Incremental BLAST performs (1 +{delta} )/{delta} times faster than NCBI BLAST for{delta} fraction of database growth.\\n\\nAvailabilityIncremental BLAST is available at https://bitbucket.org/sajal000/incremental-blast.\\n\\nContactsajal@vt.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at https://bitbucket.org/sajal000/incremental-blast",

We performed GWAS on three traits (grain yield, plant height and male flowering time) measured in 22 environments on a panel of 247 diverse dent maize inbred lines using three genotyping technologies (Genotyping-By-Sequencing, Illumina Infinium 50K and Affymetrix Axiom 600K arrays).\\n\\nResultsThe effects of ascertainment bias of both arrays were negligible for deciphering global genetic trends of diversity in this panel and for estimating relatedness. We developed an original approach based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) extent in order to determine whether SNPs significantly associated with a trait and that are physically linked should be considered as a single QTL or several independent QTLs. Using this approach, we showed that the combination of the three technologies, which have different SNP distribution and density, allowed us to detect more Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs, gain in power) and potentially refine the localization of the causal polymorphisms (gain in position).\\n\\nConclusionsConceptually different technologies are complementary for detecting QTLs by tagging different haplotypes in association studies. Considering LD, marker density and the combination of different technologies (arrays and re-sequencing), the genotypic data presently available were most likely enough to well represent polymorphisms in the centromeric regions, whereas using more markers would be beneficial for telomeric regions.",

This opens the way, in principle, to large studies, such as those required for human genetics, clinical trials, or precise cell atlases of large organs. However, such applications are currently limited by batch effects, sequential processing, and costs. To address these challenges, we present an approach for multiplexing snRNA-seq, using sample-barcoded antibodies against the nuclear pore complex to uniquely label nuclei from distinct samples. Comparing human brain cortex samples profiled in multiplex with or without hashing antibodies, we demonstrate that nucleus hashing does not significantly alter the recovered transcriptome profiles. We further developed demuxEM, a novel computational tool that robustly detects inter-sample nucleus multiplets and assigns singlets to their samples of origin by antibody barcodes, and validated its accuracy using gender-specific gene expression, species-mixing and natural genetic variation. Nucleus hashing significantly reduces cost per nucleus, recovering up to about 5 times as many single nuclei per microfluidc channel. Our approach provides a robust technique for diverse studies including tissue atlases of isogenic model organisms or from a single larger human organ, multiple biopsies or longitudinal samples of one donor, and large-scale perturbation screens.",

However, identification of SNVs using deep sequencing data is a challenging computational problem as different sequencing artifacts limit the analytical sensitivity of SNV detection, especially at low variant allele frequencies (VAFs).\\n\\nMethodsTo address the problem of relatively high noise levels in amplicon-based deep sequencing data (e.g. with the Ion AmpliSeq technology) in the context of SNV calling, we have developed a new bioinformatics tool called AmpliSolve. AmpliSolve uses a set of normal samples to model position-specific, strand-specific and nucleotide-specific background artifacts (noise), and deploys a Poisson model-based statistical framework for SNV detection.\\n\\nResultsOur tests on both synthetic and real data indicate that AmpliSolve achieves a good trade-off between precision and sensitivity, even at VAF below 5% and as low as 1%. We further validate AmpliSolve by applying it to the detection of SNVs in 96 circulating tumor DNA samples at three clinically relevant genomic positions and compare the results to digital droplet PCR experiments.\\n\\nConclusionsAmpliSolve is a new tool for in-silico estimation of background noise and for detection of low frequency SNVs in targeted deep sequencing data. Although AmpliSolve has been specifically designed for and tested on amplicon-based libraries sequenced with the Ion Torrent platform it can, in principle, be applied to other sequencing platforms as well.

    "abstract": "Cyclic GMP is considered as one of the master regulators of diverse functions in eukaryotes; its architecture and functioning in protozoans remain poorly understood however. We characterized an unusual and extra-large guanylate cyclase (477-kDa) containing at least 4 putative P-type ATPase motifs and 21 transmembrane helices in a common parasitic protist, Toxoplasma gondii. This protein, termed as TgATPaseP-GC due to its anticipated multi-functionality, localizes in the plasma membrane at the apical pole, while the corresponding cGMP-dependent protein kinase (TgPKG) is distributed in cytomembranes. Both proteins are expressed constitutively during the entire lytic cycle of the parasite in human cells, which suggests a post-translational control of cGMP signaling. Homology modeling indicated an activation of guanylate cyclase by heterodimerization of its two cyclase domains. TgATPaseP-GC is refractory to genetic deletion, and its CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption aborts the lytic cycle. Likewise, Cre/loxP-regulated knockdown of the TgATPaseP-GC by 3 UTR excision inhibited the parasite growth due to impairments in motility-dependent egress and invasion events. Consistently, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors restored the gliding motility of the mutant. A genetic repression of TgPKG, or its pharmacological inhibition phenocopied the defects observed in the TgATPaseP-GC mutant. Our data show a vital function of cGMP signaling, which is inducted by an alveolate-specific guanylate cyclase coupled to P-type like ATPase, and transduced by a dedicated PKG in T. gondii. The presence of TgATPaseP-GC orthologs in many other alveolates with contrasting habitats implies a divergent functional repurposing of cGMP signaling in protozoans. The work also lays an avenue to systematically dissect the cascade and understand its evolution in a model protist.",

We demonstrate that gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative Escherichia coli 24-hour initial biofilms on glass consist of 76 and 96% PI-positive red cells in situ, respectively, even though 68% the cells of either species in these aggregates are metabolically active. Furthermore, 82% of E. coli and 89% S. epidermidis are cultivable after harvesting. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that this false dead layer of red cells is due to a subpopulation of double-stained cells that have green interiors under red coating layer which hints at extracellular DNA (eDNA) being stained outside intact membranes. Therefore, viability staining results of adherent cells should always be validated by an alternative method for estimating viability, preferably by cultivation.",

Here, we present extensive behavioral data alongside a normative model that correctly predicts human precision grasping of unfamiliar 3D objects. We tracked participants forefinger and thumb as they picked up objects of 10 wood and brass cubes configured to tease apart effects of shape, weight, orientation, and mass distribution. Grasps were highly systematic and consistent across repetitions and participants. We employed these data to construct a model which combines five cost functions related to force closure, torque, natural grasp axis, grasp aperture, and visibility. Even without free parameters, the model predicts individual grasps almost as well as different individuals predict one anothers, but fitting weights reveals the relative importance of the different constraints. The model also accurately predicts human grasps on novel 3D-printed objects with more naturalistic geometries and is robust to perturbations in its key parameters. Together, the findings provide a unified account of how we successfully grasp objects of different 3D shape, orientation, mass, and mass distribution.\n\nAuthor SummaryA model based on extensive behavioral data unifies the varied and fragmented literature on human grasp selection by correctly predicting human grasps across a wide variety of conditions.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we perform a full genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify statistically significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with three red blood cell (RBC) components and follow it with two independent PheWASs to examine associations between phenotypic data (case-control status of diagnoses or disease), significant SNPs, and RBC component levels. We first identified associations between the three RBC components: mean platelet volume (MPV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and platelet counts (PC), and the genotypes of approximately 500,000 SNPs on the Illumina Infimum(R) DNA Human OmniExpress-24 BeadChip using a single cohort of 4,700 Northern Nevadans. Twenty-one SNPs in five major genomic regions were found to be statistically significantly associated with MPV, two regions with MCV, and one region with PC, with p<5x10-8. Twenty-nine SNPs and nine chromosomal regions were identified in 30 previous GWASs, with effect sizes of similar magnitude and direction as found in our cohort. The two strongest associations were SNP rs1354034 with MPV (p=2.4x10-13) and rs855791 with MCV (p=5.2x10-12). We then examined possible associations between these significant SNPs and incidence of 1,488 phenotype groups mapped from International Classification of Disease version 9 and 10 (ICD9 and ICD10) codes collected in the extensive electronic health record (EHR) database associated with Healthy Nevada Project consented participants. Further leveraging data collected in the EHR, we performed an additional PheWAS to identify associations between continuous red blood cell (RBC) component measures and incidence of specific diagnoses. The first PheWAS illuminated whether SNPs associated with RBC components in our cohort were linked with other hematologic phenotypic diagnoses or diagnoses of other nature. Although no SNPs from our GWAS were identified as strongly associated to other phenotypic components, a number of associations were identified with p-values ranging between 1x10-3 and 1x10-4 with traits such as respiratory failure, sleep disorders, hypoglycemia, hyperglyceridemia, GERD and IBS. The second PheWAS examined possible phenotypic predictors of abnormal RBC component measures: a number of hematologic phenotypes such as thrombocytopenia, anemias, hemoglobinopathies and pancytopenia were found to be strongly associated to RBC component measures; additional phenotypes such as (morbid) obesity, malaise and fatigue, alcoholism, and cirrhosis were also identified to be possible predictors of RBC component measures.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe combination of electronic health records and genomic data have the capability to revolutionize personalized medicine. Each separately contains invaluable data; however, combined, the two are able to identify new discoveries that may have long-term health benefits. The Healthy Nevada Project is a non-profit initiative between Renown Medical Center and the Desert Research Institute in Reno, NV. The project has so far collected a cohort of 6,500 Northern Nevadans, with extensive medical electronic health records in the Renown Health database. Combining the genotypes of these participants with the clinical data, this studys aim is to find associations between genotypes (genes) and phenotypes (diagnoses and lab records). Here, we identify and examine clinical associations with red blood cell components such as platelet counts and mean platelet volume. These are components that have clinical relevance for several diseases, such as anemia, atherothrombosis and cancer. Our results from genome wide association studies mirror previous studies, and identify new associations. The extensive electronic health records enabled us to perform phenome wide associations to discover strong associations with hematologic components, as well as other important traits and diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause persistent infections clinically. Treatment for chronic S. aureus infections ranges from at least one week to several months and such infections are prone to relapse likely due to the presence of persistent forms of bacteria such as persister cells. Persister cells, which are bacterial cells that become dormant under stress conditions, can be isolated in vitro but their clinical significance in in vivo infections are largely unclear. Here, we evaluated S. aureus persistent forms using stationary phase cultures and biofilm bacteria (enriched in persisters) in comparison with log phase cultures in terms of their ability to cause disease in a mouse skin infection model. Surprisingly, we found that infection of mice with stationary phase cultures and biofilm bacteria produced a more severe chronic skin infection with more pronounced lesions which took longer to heal than log phase (actively growing) cultures. After two week infection, the bacterial load and skin tissue pathology, as determined by hyperplasia, immune cell infiltration, and crust/lesion formation, of mice infected with the more persistent forms (e.g. stationary phase bacteria and biofilm bacteria) were greater than mice infected with log phase bacteria. Using our persistent infection mouse model, we showed that the clinically recommended treatment for recurrent S. aureus skin infection, doxycycline + rifampin, was not effective in eradicating the bacteria in the treatment study, despite reducing lesion sizes and pathology in infected mice. Analogous findings were also observed in a Caenorhabditis elegans model, where S.aureus stationary phase cultures caused a greater mortality than log phase culture as early as two days post-infection. Thus, we established a new model for chronic persistent infections using persister bacteria that could serve as a relevant model to evaluate therapeutic options for persistent infections in general. Our findings connect persisters with persistent infections, have implications for understanding disease pathogenesis, and are likely to be broadly valid for other pathogens.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLong-read sequencing technologies offer promising alternatives to high-throughput short read sequencing, especially in the context of RNA-sequencing. However these technologies are currently hindered by high error rates that affect analyses such as the identification of isoforms, exon boundaries, open reading frames, and the creation of gene catalogues. Due to the novelty of such data, computational methods are still actively being developed and options for the error-correction of RNA-sequencing long reads remain limited.\\n\\nResultsIn this article, we evaluate the extent to which existing long-read DNA error correction methods are capable of correcting cDNA Nanopore reads. We provide an automatic and extensive benchmark tool that not only reports classical error-correction metrics but also the effect of correction on gene families, isoform diversity, bias toward the major isoform, and splice site detection. We find that long read error-correction tools that were originally developed for DNA are also suitable for the correction of RNA-sequencing data, especially in terms of increasing base-pair accuracy. Yet investigators should be warned that the correction process perturbs gene family sizes and isoform diversity. This work provides guidelines on which (or whether) error-correction tools should be used, depending on the application type.\\n\\nBenchmarking softwarehttps://gitlab.com/leoisl/LR_EC_analyser",

However, analyzing omics data is still very challenging, especially for researchers with less experience in bioinformatics, software, and programming. Omics data analysis workflows usually are composed of many processes involving different software tools that demand different compute resources. So, it is often difficult to perform a full workflow in an automated way, despite that many computational tools and resources are available. Here I present NGOMICS-WF, a lightweight workflow tool for batch omics data analysis. This workflow tool has been used in several projects. It can assist researchers to configure and run workflows for various types of omics data on Linux computers or Linux computer clusters. The software package is available from https://github.com/weizhongli/ngomicswf. In addition to the workflow tool, several pre-configured workflows that were tested and published are also available in the package. These pre-configured workflows can be directly used or be used as templates to configure new workflows to analyze metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, RNA-seq and 16S data.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis relies on the active generation of forces, and the transmission of these forces to surrounding cells and tissues. Hence measuring forces directly in developing embryos is an essential task to study the mechanics of development. Among the experimental techniques that have emerged to measure forces in epithelial tissues, force inference is particularly appealing. Indeed it only requires a snapshot of the tissue, as it relies on the topology and geometry of cell contacts, assuming that forces are balanced at each vertex. However, establishing force inference as a reliable technique requires thorough validation in multiple conditions. Here we performed systematic comparisons of force inference with laser ablation experiments in three distinct Drosophila epithelia. We show that force inference accurately predicts single junction tensions, tension patterns in stereotyped groups of cells, and tissue-scale stress patterns, in wild type and mutant conditions. We emphasize its ability to capture the distribution of forces at different scales from a single image, which gives it a critical advantage over perturbative techniques such as laser ablation. Our results demonstrate that force inference is a reliable and efficient method to quantify the mechanics of epithelial tissues during morphogenesis.",

Here, we examine the relationship between MacArthurs proposed index and measures of local and global stability in Lotka-Volterra food web models. Our results provide support for MacArthurs intuitive hypothesis that increasing the diversity of energy pathways through food webs endows them with greater stability, as measured by both the probability of local and global point stabilities, and the return time to stable equilibria following perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Due to their comparatively small genome size and short generation time, fungi are exquisite model systems to study eukaryotic genome evolution. Powdery mildew (PM) fungi present an exceptional case where their strict host dependency (a lifestyle termed obligate biotrophy) is associated with some of the largest fungal genomes sequenced so far (>100 Mbp). This size expansion is largely due to the pervasiveness of transposable elements (TEs), which can cover more than 70% of these genomes, and is associated with the loss of multiple conserved ascomycete genes (CAGs) required for a free-living lifestyle. To date, little is known about the mechanisms that drove this expansion, and information on ancestral PM genomes is lacking. We report the genome analysis of the early-diverged PM species Parauncinula polyspora that in contrast to most other PMs reproduces exclusively sexually. The P. polyspora genome is surprisingly small (<30 Mb) and sparsely equipped with TEs (<10%), despite the conserved absence of a common defense mechanism (RIP) involved in constraining repetitive elements. The genome still harbors the majority of the CAGs that are absent in the genomes of the recently evolved PMs. We speculate that TE spread might have been limited by its unique reproduction strategy and host features and further hypothesize that the loss of CAGs may promote the evolutionary isolation and host niche specialization of PM fungi. Limitations associated with this evolutionary trajectory might have been in part counteracted by the evolution of plastic, TE-rich genomes and/or the expansion of gene families encoding secreted virulence proteins.",

    "abstract": "Spreading resistance to antibiotics and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains have become frequent in many bacterial species, including mycobacteria. The genus Mycobacterium encompasses both human and animal pathogens that cause severe diseases and have profound impacts on global health and the world economy. Here, we used a novel system of microfluidics, fluorescence microscopy and target-tagged fluorescent reporter strains of M. smegmatis to perform real-time monitoring of replisome and chromosome dynamics following the addition of replication-altering drugs (novobiocin, nalidixic acid and griselimycin) at the single-cell level. We found that novobiocin stalled replication forks and caused relaxation of the nucleoid, nalidixic acid triggered rapid replisome collapse and compaction of the nucleoid, and griselimycin caused replisome instability with subsequent over-initiation of chromosome replication and over-relaxation of the nucleoid. This work is an example of using a microscopy-based approach to evaluate the activity of potential replication inhibitors and provides mechanistic insights into their modes of action. Our system also enabled us to observe how the tested antibiotics affected the physiology of mycobacterial cells (i.e., growth, chromosome segregation, etc.). Because proteins involved in the DNA replication are well conserved among bacteria (including mycobacterial species), the properties of various replication inhibitors observed here in fast-growing M. smegmatis may be easily extrapolated to slow-growing pathogenic tubercle bacilli, such as M. tuberculosis.\\n\\nSignificanceThe growing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the emergence of new strains that are resistant to multiple drugs raise the need to explore new antibiotics and re-evaluate the existing options. Here, we present a system that allows the action of antibiotics to be monitored at the single-cell level. Such studies are important in the light of bacterial heterogeneity, which may be enhanced in unfavorable conditions, such as under antibiotic treatment. Moreover, our studies provide mechanistic insights into the action modes of the tested compounds. As combined therapies have recently gained increased interest, it is also notable that our described system may help researchers identify the best combination of antimicrobials for use against infections caused by a variety of bacteria.",

Protocols published in scientific journals were searched in MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases using the query terms  systematic review[Title] AND  protocol[Title] from February 2011 to December 2017. Protocols registered at PROSPERO during the same period were obtained by web scraping all non-Cochrane records with a Python script. After excluding protocols with less than 90% fulfilled or duplicated, they were classified as published  only in PROSPERO,  only in journals, or in both  journals and PROSPERO. Results of data and metadata extraction using text-mining processes were curated by two reviewers. Datasets and R scripts are freely available to facilitate reproducibility. We obtained 20,814 protocols of non-Cochrane SRs. While  unique protocols by re-viewers institutions from 60 countries were the most frequent, to prepare  collaborative protocols a median of 6 (2-150) institutions were involved from 130 different countries. Ranked list of countries involved in overall protocol production were the UK, the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Most protocols were registered only in PROSPERO. However, the number of protocols published in scientific journals (924) or in both PROSPERO and journals (807) has progressively increased over the last three years. Syst Rev and BMJ Open published more than half of the total protocols. While most productive countries were involved in  unique and  collaborative protocols, less productive countries only participated in  collaborative protocols that were mainly published only in PROSPERO. Our results suggest that although most countries were involved in producing in solitary protocols of non-Cochrane SRs during the study period, it would be desirable to develop new strategies to promote international collaborations, especially with less productive countries.",

Due to their major role in the generation and propagation of electrical signals, VGICs are considered important from a medical viewpoint and their dysfunction is often associated with a group of diseases known as \\\"Channelopathies\\\". We identified disease associated mutations and polymorphisms in these proteins through mapping missense Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from the UniProt and ClinVar databases on their amino acid sequence, taking into consideration their special topological and functional characteristics. Statistical analysis revealed that disease associated SNPs are mostly found in the Voltage Sensor Domain - and especially at its fourth transmembrane segment (S4) - and in the Pore Loop. Both these regions are extremely important for the activation and ion conductivity of VGICs. Moreover, amongst the most frequently observed mutations are those of arginine to glutamine, to histidine or to cysteine, which can probably be attributed to the extremely important role of arginine residues in the regulation of membrane potential in these proteins. We suggest that topological information in combination with genetic variation data can contribute towards a better evaluation of the effect of currently unclassified mutations in VGICs. It is hoped that potential associations with certain disease phenotypes will be revealed in the future, with the use of similar approaches.",

The activation of dopamine type-1 receptors (D1Rs) within the medial amygdala, in the presence of ovarian hormones (EB+P), are both necessary and sufficient for increases in proceptive, or sexually motivated, behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that methamphetamine increases progesterone receptor expression in the medial amygdala independently of D1R activation, and that lentiviral overexpression of the progesterone receptor was able to recapitulate the methamphetamine-induced enhancement of proceptive behaviors. Furthermore, we found that within the medial amygdala, these progesterone receptors show an increase in phosphorylation of serine 294 of the progesterone receptor in a region-specific manner. The involvement of this phosphorylation site suggests a role for cytosolic kinases, which may be responsible for enhanced progesterone receptor action. The phosphorylation of serine 294 is blocked by D1R antagonists, and by inhibiting cSrc and ERK1/2, downstream of D1R signaling, we identified that Src and ERK1/2 are required for enhanced proceptive behavior. Taken together, we propose that within the medial amygdala, methamphetamine enhances progesterone receptors sensitivity to its cognate ligand via interaction with cSrc kinase and ERK1/2, as well as an increase total progesterone receptors, thus leading to enhanced proceptive behaviors in the rat.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (1, 2). Our laboratory has studied a class of small molecules produced by P. aeruginosa known as phenazines, including pyocyanin and its biogenic precursor phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). As phenazines are known virulence factors (3), we and others have explored the possibility of using phenazine concentrations as a marker for disease progression (4-6). Previously, we reported that sputum concentrations of pyocyanin and PCA negatively correlate with lung function in cystic fibrosis patients (6). Our study used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify phenazines by UV-vis absorbance after extraction from lung sputum. Since our initial study, methods for metabolite analysis have advanced considerably, aided in large part by usage of mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Because a more recent study employing LC-MS/MS revealed a surprising decoupling of P. aeruginosa metabolites in sputum and the detection of P. aeruginosa through culturing or microbiome profiles (4), we decided to check whether we could reproduce our previous findings by analyzing sputum samples from a different patient cohort with a new LC-MS instrument in our laboratory. Our new samples were provided by the Mountain West CF Consortium Sputum Biomarker study (7). In the course of performing our new analyses, comparison of our old HPLC data to our new LC-MS data led us to realize that the peak previously assigned to PCA instead originates from heme, and the peak assigned to pyocyanin originates from an as-yet unknown compound. This correction only affects the measurements of phenazines in sputum, and we are confident in the phenazine measurements from isolated cultures and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from that study (6). Here we outline the basis for our correction and present additional data showing that heme concentration negatively correlates with lung function in cystic fibrosis patients.",

However, the diversity of coliphages that are present in seawater remains largely unknown, with previous studies largely focusing on morphological diversity. Here, we isolated and characterised coliphages from three coastal locations in the UK and Poland. This revealed a surprising genetic diversity, with comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis of phage isolates facilitating the identification of putative new species within the genera RB69virus and T5virus and a putative new genus within the subfamily Tunavirinae. Furthermore, by combining this genomic data with proteomic and host range analyses a number of phage structural proteins were identified, one of which is likely to be responsible for the observed differences in host range.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCampylobacter jejuni, the most frequent cause of foodborne bacterial infection, is found on around 70% of retail chicken. As such there is a need for effective controls in chicken production. Microbial-based controls such as probiotics are attractive to the poultry industry, but of limited efficacy. Furthermore, as commercially-produced chickens have no maternal contact, their pioneer microbiome is likely to come from the hatchery environment. Early delivery of microbials that lead to a more  natural avian microbiome may, therefore, improve bird health and reduce susceptibility to C.jejuni colonisation.\\n\\nA faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) was used to transfer a mature cecal microbiome to newly-hatched broiler chicks and its effects on C.jejuni challenge assessed. We used both a seeder-bird infection model that mimics natural bird-to-bird infection alongside a direct-challenge model. We used a 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based approach to characterize the transplant material itself alongside changes to the chicken microbiome following FMT.\\n\\nRESULTSFMT changes the composition of the chicken intestinal microbiome. We observed little change in species richness following FMT compared to untreated samples, but there is an increase in phylogenetic diversity within those species. The most significant difference in the ceca is an increase in Lactobacilli, although not a major component of the transplant material, suggesting the FMT results in a change in the intestinal milieu as much as a direct change to the microbiome.\\n\\nUpon direct challenge, FMT resulted in lower initial intestinal colonisation with C.jejuni. More significantly, in a seeder-bird challenge of infection transmission, FMT reduced transmission and intestinal colonisation until common UK retail age of slaughter. In a repeat experiment, transmission was completely blocked following FMT treatment. Delayed FMT administration at 7 days of-age had limited effect on colonisation and transmission.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe show that transfer of a whole mature microbiome to newly-hatched chicks reduces transmission and colonisation of C.jejuni. This indicates that modification of the broiler chick microbiome can reduce intestinal colonisation of C.jejuni to levels projected to lead to lower the human infection rate. We believe these findings offer a way to identify key taxa or consortia that are effective in reducing C.jejuni colonisation and improving broiler gut health.",

In contrast to other major subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons, VIP neurons show a remarkable diversity. Studying morphological and electrophysiological properties of VIP cells, we found a peculiar group of neurons in layer II/III of mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex, which showed a highly dynamic burst firing behavior at resting membrane potential that switched to tonic mode at depolarized membrane potentials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that burst firing depends on T-type calcium channels. The burst-tonic switch could be induced by acetylcholine and serotonin. Acetylcholine mediated a depolarization via nicotinic receptors whereas serotonin evoked a biphasic depolarization via ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in 48% of the population and a purely monophasic depolarization via metabotropic receptors in the remaining cells. These data disclose an electrophysiologically-defined subpopulation of VIP neurons that via neuromodulator-induced changes in firing behavior is likely to regulate the state of cortical circuits in a profound manner.",

    "abstract": "11.1 BackgroundChildren with oropharyngeal dysphagia have impaired airway protection mechanisms and are at higher risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications. Aspiration of gastric contents is often implicated as a cause for these pulmonary complications, despite being supported by little evidence. The goal of this study is to determine the relative contribution of oropharyngeal and gastric microbial communities to perturbations in the lung microbiome of children with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration.\\n\\n1.2 MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 222 patients consecutively recruited from a tertiary aerodigestive center undergoing simultaneous esophagogastroduodenoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage, gastric and oropharyngeal samples were collected and 16S sequencing was performed. A subset of patients also underwent video fluoroscopic swallow studies to assess swallow function and were categorized as aspiration/no aspiration. Microbial communities across the aerodi-gestive tract were compared in patients with and without aspiration by calculating within-patient beta diversities and quantifying microbial exchange across sites.\\n\\n1.3 ResultsWithin all patients, lung, oropharyngeal and gastric microbiomes overlap. The degree of similarity is the lowest between the oropharynx and lungs (median Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) = 0.90), and as high between the stomach and lungs as between the oropharynx and stomach (median JSD = 0.55 and 0.56, respectively; p = 0.6). Unlike the oropharyngeal microbiome, lung and gastric communities are highly variable across people and driven primarily by person rather than body site. In patients with aspiration, the lung microbiome more closely resembles oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities and there is greater prevalence of microbial exchange between the lung and oropharynx than between gastric and lung sites (p = 0.04 and 3x10-5, respectively).\\n\\n1.4 ConclusionsThe gastric and lung microbiomes display significant overlap in patients with intact airway protective mechanisms while the lung and oropharynx remain distinct. In patients with impaired swal-low function and aspiration, the lung microbiome shifts towards oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities. This finding may explain why antireflux surgeries fail to show benefit in pediatric pulmonary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "For diseases such as influenza, where the majority of infected persons experience mild (if any) symptoms, surveillance systems are sensitive to changes in healthcare-seeking and clinical decision-making behaviours. This presents a challenge when trying to interpret surveillance data in near-real-time (e.g., in order to provide public health decision-support). Australia experienced a particularly large and severe influenza season in 2017, perhaps in part due to (a) mild cases being more likely to seek healthcare; and (b) clinicians being more likely to collect specimens for RT-PCR influenza tests. In this study we used weekly Flutracking surveillance data to estimate the probability that a person with influenza-like illness (ILI) would seek healthcare and have a specimen collected. We then used this estimated probability to calibrate near-real-time seasonal influenza forecasts at each week of the 2017 season, to see whether predictive skill could be improved. While the number of self-reported influenza tests in the weekly surveys are typically very low, we were able to detect a substantial change in healthcare seeking behaviour and clinician testing behaviour prior to the high epidemic peak. Adjusting for these changes in behaviour in the forecasting framework improved predictive skill. Our analysis demonstrates a unique value of community-level surveillance systems, such as Flutracking, when interpreting traditional surveillance data.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in southern and eastern Africa was driven sharply upwards during 1980s and 1990s by coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although drug treatments for TB infection (isoniazid preventive therapy) and disease (combinations of TB drugs) can reduce TB incidence if implemented effectively, we find that antiretroviral therapy (ART) given to people with HIV infection was strongly and systematically associated with the accelerated decline of TB in 12 of the worst affected African countries between 2003 and 2016. Inferring that ART was a significant cause of TB decline, ART prevented approximately 1.88 {+/-} 0.23 million HIV-positive TB cases, or 15.7 {+/-} 1.9 percent of the total number expected. There is no evidence that drug treatment of TB infection (IPT) or disease (combination chemotherapy) played more than a minor role in accelerating TB decline after 2003. In these 12 countries, over the period 2003-16, ART made a major contribution towards achieving international targets for the reduction of TB incidence.\\n\\nSignificanceTuberculosis (TB) is still the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. To cut the TB incidence rate by 80% between 2015 and 2030, in line with the WHO End TB Strategy, demands a five-fold increase in the rate of decline worldwide, from 2% to 10%/year. We find that the reduction in TB incidence rate in 12 African countries, at up to 8%/year, is due mainly to the expanded provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to people living with HIV, rather than to improvements in the treatment of TB infection and disease. ART should remain central to TB control where rates of TB-HIV coinfection are high, but new efforts are needed to maximize the direct benefits of treating TB infection and disease.",

In this work we present and discuss an approach to the problem of pathogen reinfections in a given area that associates people mobility and transmission of dengue, using a Markov-chain Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) metapopulation model over a network. Our model postulates a parameter that we have named the effective inoculum size which represents a local measure of the population size of infected hosts that arrive at a given location as a function of population size, current incidence at neighboring locations and the connectivity of the patches. This parameter can be interpreted as an indicator of outbreak risk of any location. Our model also incorporates climate variability represented by an index based upon precipitation data.

They are the causative mutations in about 10% of patients in a large number of rare genetic diseases. High concentrations of the antibiotic gentamicin can induce the incorporation of an amino acid at a PTC and formation of full-length protein, a process called PTC readthrough. Gentamicin is composed of several related aminoglycosides. We recently reported (doi/10.1073/pnas.1620982114) that the major gentamicin components that are responsible for its antibacterial activity showed weak to no PTC readthrough activity but that the minor component gentamicin B1 was a potent readthrough inducer. We have now determined that gentamicin B1 acquired from the sole supplier at the time the study was carried out was not gentamicin B1 but instead the closely related aminoglycoside G418. Gentamicin B1 recently became available from a second commercial source. Here, we provide nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assignment data for the two commercial compounds and verify only the second is indeed gentamicin B1. We show that gentamicin B1 lacks PTC readthrough activity in HDQ-P1 and DMS-114 cells homozygous for the TP53 R213X nonsense mutation, as well as in a cell-free translation assay.",

Previous studies have identified recurrent nonsense mutations in the HBV large S (LHBs) gene from the liver from HBV core antigen-positive HCC patients. These nonsense mutants have been shown to be oncogenic in mouse xenograft models using a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. Here, we expressed in a liver cell line Huh-7 a carboxy terminally truncated protein from a nonsense mutant of the LHBs gene, sW182* (stop codon at tryptophane-182). Although the sW182* protein appeared not to be very stable in the cultured liver cells, we confirmed that the protein can be highly expressed and retained for a prolonged period of time in the hepatocytes in the mouse liver, indicating its stable nature in the physiological condition.\\n\\nIn the Huh-7 cells, the sW182* mutant downregulated tumor suppressors p53 and Smad4. This downregulation was reversed by a proteasome inhibitor MG132, implying the involvement of proteasome-based protein degradation in the observed regulation of the tumor suppressors. On the other hand, we found that c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) physically interacts with the sW182*, but not wild-type LHBs. RNA interference (RNAi) of Jab1 restored the levels of the downregulated p53 and Smad4. The sW182* mutant inhibited the promoter activity of downstream target genes of the tumor suppressors. Consistently, Jab1 RNAi reversed the inhibition.\\n\\nThese results suggest that the LHBs nonsense mutant antagonizes the tumor suppressor pathways through Jab1 in the liver contributing to HCC development.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle development and regeneration are tightly regulated processes. How the intracellular organization of muscle fibers is achieved during these steps is unclear. Here we focus on the cellular and physiological roles of amphiphysin 2 (BIN1), a membrane remodeling protein mutated in both congenital and adult centronuclear myopathies, that is ubiquitously expressed and has skeletal muscle-specific isoforms. We created and characterized constitutive, muscle-specific and inducible Bin1 homozygous and heterozygous knockout mice targeting either ubiquitous or muscle-specific isoforms. Constitutive Bin1-deficient mice died at birth from lack of feeding due to a skeletal muscle defect. T-tubules and other organelles were misplaced and altered, supporting a general early role of BIN1 on intracellular organization in addition to membrane remodeling. Whereas restricted deletion of Bin1 in unchallenged adult muscles had no impact, the forced switch from the muscle-specific isoforms to the ubiquitous isoforms through deletion of the in-frame muscle-specific exon delayed muscle regeneration. Thus, BIN1 ubiquitous function is necessary for muscle development and function while its muscle-specific isoforms fine-tune muscle regeneration in adulthood, supporting that BIN1 centronuclear myopathy with congenital onset are due to developmental defects while later onset may be due to regeneration defects.",

    "abstract": "Multiple cellular organelles tightly orchestrate intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamics to regulate cellular activities and maintain homeostasis. The interplay between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a major store of intracellular Ca2+, and mitochondria, an important source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), has been the subject of much research, as their dysfunctionality has been linked with metabolic diseases. Interestingly, through out the cells cytosolic domain, these two organelles share common microdomains called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), where their membranes are in close apposition. The role of MAMs is critical for intracellular Ca2+ dynamics as they provide hubs for direct Ca2+ exchange between the organelles. A recent experimental study reported correlation between obesity and MAM formation in mouse liver cells, and obesity-related cellular changes that are closely associated with the regulation of Ca2+ dynamics. We constructed a mathematical model to study the effects of MAM Ca2+ dynamics on global Ca2+ activities. Through a series of model simulations, we investigated cellular mechanisms underlying the altered Ca2+ dynamics in the cells under obesity. We found that the formation of MAMs is negatively correlated with the amplitude of cytosolic Ca2+ activities, but positively correlated with that of mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics and the overall frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. We predict that, as the dosage of stimulus gradually increases, liver cells from obese mice will reach the state of saturated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration at a lower stimulus concentration, compared to cells from healthy mice.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIt is well known that intracellular Ca2+ oscillations carry encoded signals in their amplitude and frequency to regulate various cellular processes, and accumulating evidence supports the importance of the interplay between the ER and mitochondria in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Miscommunications between the organelles may be involved in the development of metabolic diseases. Based on a recent experimental study that spotlighted a correlation between obesity and physical interactions of the ER and mitochondria in mouse hepatic cells, we constructed a mathematical model as a probing tool that can be used to computationally investigate the effects of the cellular changes linked with obesity on global cellular Ca2+ dynamics. Our model successfully reproduced the experimental study that observed a positive correlation between the ER-mitochondrial junctions and the magnitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ responses. We postulate that hepatic cells from lean animals exhibit Ca2+ oscillations that are more robust under higher concentrations of stimulus, compared to cells from obese animals.",

    "abstract": "Pituitary endocrine cells fire action potentials (APs) to regulate their cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and hormone secretion rate. Depending on animal species, cell type, and biological conditions, pituitary APs are generated either by TTX-sensitive Na+ currents (INa), high-voltage activated Ca2+ currents (ICa), or by a combination of the two. Previous computational models of pituitary cells have mainly been based on data from rats, where INa is largely inactivated at the resting potential, and spontaneous APs are exclusively mediated by ICa. As a part of the previous modeling studies, a paradoxical role was identified for the big conductance K+ current (IBK), which was found to prolong the duration of ICa-mediated APs, and sometimes give rise to pseudo-plateau bursts, contrary to what one would expect from a hyperpolarizing current. Unlike in rats, spontaneous INa-mediated APs are consistently seen in pituitary cells of several other animal species, including several species of fish. In the current work we develop the, to our knowledge, first computational model of a pituitary cell that fires INa-mediated APs. Although we constrain the model to experimental data from gonadotrope cells in the teleost fish medaka (Oryzias latipes), it may likely provide insights also into other pituitary cell types that fire INa-mediated APs. In the current work, we use the model to explore how the effect of IBK depends on the AP generating mechanisms of pituitary cells. We do this by comparing simulations on the medaka gonadotrope model (two versions thereof) with simulations on a previously developed model of a rat pituitary cell. Interestingly, we find that IBK has the opposite effect on APs in the two models, i.e. it reduces the duration of already fast INa-mediated APs in the medaka model, and prolongs the duration of already slow ICa-mediated APs in the rat model.\\n\\nAuthor summaryExcitable cells elicit electrical pulses called action potentials (APs), which are generated and shaped by a combination of ion channels in the cell membrane. While neurons use APs for interneuronal communication and heart cells use them to generate heart-beats, pituitary cells use APs to regulate their cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which in turn controls their hormone secretion rate. The amount of Ca2+ that enters the pituitary cell during an AP depends strongly on how long it lasts, and it is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that control this. Depending on animal species and biological conditions, pituitary APs may be initiated either by Ca2+ channels or Na+ channels. Here, we explore the differences between the two scenarios by comparing simulations on two different computer models: (i) a previously developed model which fires Na+-based APs, adapted to data from pituitary cells in rats, and (ii) a novel model that fires Ca2+-based APs, adapted to data from pituitary cells in the fish medaka. Interestingly, we find that the role of big conductance K+ (BK) channels, which are known to affect the duration of the AP, are opposite in the two models, i.e., they act to prolong Ca2+-based APs while they act to shorten Na+-based APs.",

    "abstract": "Iron is a critical nutrient for most microbial pathogens, and the innate immune system exploits this requirement by sequestering iron and other metals through a process termed nutritional immunity. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa provides a model system for understanding the microbial response to host iron depletion, as this organism exhibits a high requirement for iron as well as an exquisite ability to overcome iron deprivation during infection. Hallmarks of P. aeruginosas iron starvation response include the induction of multiple high affinity iron acquisition systems and an \\\"iron sparing response\\\" that is post-transcriptionally mediated by the PrrF small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Here, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to conduct label-free proteomics of the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response, revealing several iron-regulated processes that have not been previously described. Iron starvation induced multiple proteins involved in branched chain and aromatic amino acid catabolism, providing the capacity for iron-independent entry of carbons into the TCA cycle. Proteins involved in sulfur assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis were reduced upon iron starvation, while proteins involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis were paradoxically increased, highlighting the central role of iron in P. aeruginosa metabolism. Iron starvation also resulted in changes in the expression of several zinc-responsive proteins, as well as the first experimental evidence for increased levels of twitching motility proteins upon iron starvation. Subsequent proteomics analyses demonstrated that the PrrF sRNAs were required for iron regulation of many of these newly-identified proteins, and we identified PrrF complementarity with mRNAs encoding key iron-regulated proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur biogenesis, and zinc homeostasis. Combined, these results provide the most comprehensive view of the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response to date and outline novel roles for the PrrF sRNAs in the P. aeruginosa iron sparing response and pathogenesis.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIron is central for the metabolism of almost all microbial pathogens, and as such this element is sequestered by the host innate immune system to restrict microbial growth. Defining the response of microbial pathogens to iron starvation is therefore critical for understanding how pathogens colonize and propagate within the host. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes significant morbidity and mortality in compromised individuals, provides an excellent model for studying this response due to its high requirement for iron yet well-documented ability to overcome iron starvation. Here we used label-free proteomics to investigate the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response, revealing a broad landscape of metabolic and metal homeostasis changes that have not previously been described. We further provide evidence that many of these processes are regulated through the iron responsive PrrF small regulatory RNAs, which are integral to P. aeruginosa iron homeostasis and virulence. These results demonstrate the power of proteomics for defining stress responses of microbial pathogens, and they provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response.",

    "abstract": "Urine is increasingly being considered as a source of biomarker development in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe, life-limiting disorder that affects approximately 1 in 4500 boys. In this study, we used the mdx mice--a murine model of DMD--to discover biomarkers of disease, as well as pharmacodynamic biomarkers responsive to prednisolone, commonly used to treat DMD. Longitudinal urine samples were analyzed from male age-matched mdx and wild-type mice randomized to prednisolone or vehicle. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to discover metabolic biomarkers of both disease and glucocorticoid treatment. A large number of metabolites (869 out of 6,334) were found to be significantly different between mdx and wild-type mice at baseline (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05), thus being associated with disease status. These included a peak with m/z=357 and creatine, which were also discovered in a previous human study looking at serum. Novel observations included biliverdin and hypusine. These four peaks were also significantly higher in mdx mice compared to wild-type, as well as significantly associated with time after the baseline. Creatine and biliverdin were also associated with treatment after the baseline, but the association with creatine may have been driven by an imbalance at baseline. In conclusion, our study reports a number of biomarkers, both known and novel, which may be related to either the mechanisms of muscle injury in DMD and/or prednisolone treatment.",

In this report, we implicate the G-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and peroxisome proliferator receptor (PPAR) in regulation of lipid homeostasis and the expression of steroidogenesis-controlling molecules in clinical specimens of LCTs and cell line (mouse tumor Leydig cells; MA-10). We also show the general structure and morphology of human LCTs with the use of scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy, respectively. In LCTs, protein immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of GPER and decreased expression of PPAR, {beta} and {gamma}. Concomitantly, changes in expression pattern of the lutropin receptor (LHR), protein kinase A (PKA), perilipin (PLIN), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), translocator protein (TSPO), HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCA), and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) were observed.\\n\\nUsing MA-10 cells treated with GPER and PPAR antagonists (alone and in combination), we demonstrated there is a GPER-PPAR mediated control of cholesterol concentration. In addition, GPER-PPAR regulated estradiol secretion, while GPER-PPAR{gamma} affected cGMP concentration. It is assumed that GPER and PPAR can be altered in LCT, resulting in a perturbed lipid balance and steroidogenesis. In LCTs, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was disturbed. Thus, PI3K-Akt-mTOR, together with cGMP, can play a role in LCT proliferation, growth, and metastasis as well as lipid balance control.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we discuss the implications of GPER-PPAR interaction with lipid metabolism and steroidogenesis controlling-molecules in LCT biology that can be used in future studies as potential targets of diagnostic and therapeutic implementations.",

    "abstract": "Broad and potent neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with multiple epitope specificities evolve in HIV-1 infected children. Herein we studied two antiretroviral naive chronically HIV-1C in-fected monozygotic pediatric twins AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330 with potent plasma bnAbs. Elite plasma neutralizing activity was observed since initial sampling at 78 months in AIIMS_330 and persisted throughout, while in AIIMS_329 it was seen at 90-months of age after which potency decreased overtime. We evaluated potential viral characteristics associated with the varied immune profile by generating single genome amplified pseudoviruses. The AIIMS_329 viruses generated from 90-month time point sampling were neutralization sensitive to second generation bnAbs and contemporaneous autologous plasma antibodies, while viruses from 112-months and 117-month timepoints were resistant to most bnAbs and autologous contemporaneous plasma. AIIMS_329 viruses developed resistance to plasma nAbs plausibly by N160-glycan loss, V1- and V4-loop lengthening. The viruses generated from AIIMS_330 at 90-month and 117-month timepoint showed varied susceptibility to bnAbs and autologous contemporaneous plasma antibodies while the viruses of 112-month timepoint, at which plasma nAb specificities mapped to the V2-glycan, V3-glycan and CD4bs, were resistant to autologous contemporaneous plasma antibodies as well as most bnAbs. We observed evolution of a viral pool in AIIMS_330 donor, comprising of plasma antibody neutralization sensitive or resistant diverse autologous viruses that in turn may have contributed to development and maintenance of elite neutralizing activity. The findings of this study provide information towards understanding factors involved in generation and maintenance of potent plasma nAbs.\\n\\nImportanceChronically HIV-1 infected children that develop elite neutralizing activity are suitable candidates to understand the mechanisms that lead to the co-evolution of virus and antibody response. Here, we evaluated the alterations in virus and antibody responses over time in chronically HIV-1C infected monozygotic pediatric twins, AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330, who had acquired the infection by vertical transmission. AIIMS_330 retained the elite plasma neutralizing activity throughout, while in AIIMS_329, the potency decreased post 90 months of age. The corresponding viral pool from post 90-month samples in AIIMS_330 showed varied susceptibility, while that in AIIMS_329, developed resistance to bnAbs and autologous plasma antibodies. The findings of this study, conducted in twin children of same genetic make-up and infected at birth with a single source of HIV-1C, suggest that a viral pool with varied susceptibility to antibodies could have been one of the factors responsible for sustained elite neutralizing activity in AIIMS_330.",

One such measure is binocular rivalry, however, previous studies have not measured rivalry characteristics and brain neurochemistry together in people with migraine. This study compared spectroscopy-measured levels of GABA and Glx (glutamine and glutamate complex) in visual cortex between 16 people with migraine and 16 non-headache controls, and assessed whether the concentration of these neurochemicals explains, at least partially, inter-individual variability in binocular rivalry perceptual measures. Mean Glx level was significantly reduced in migraineurs relative to controls, whereas mean occipital GABA levels were similar between groups. Neither GABA levels, nor Glx levels correlated with rivalry percept duration. Our results thus suggest that the previously suggested relationship between rivalry percept duration and GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmitter concentration in visual cortex is not strong enough to enable rivalry percept duration to be reliably assumed to be a surrogate for GABA concentration, at least in the context of healthy individuals and those that experience migraine.",

    "abstract": "One way to create new components for synthetic transcription circuits is to re-purpose naturally occurring transcription factor proteins and their cognate DNA operators. For the proteins, re-engineering can be accomplished via domain recombination (to create chimeric regulators) and/or amino acid substitutions. The resulting activities of new protein regulators are often assessed in vitro using a representative operator. However, when functioning in vivo, transcription factors can interact with multiple operators. We compared in vivo and in vitro results for two LacI-based transcription repressor proteins, their mutational variants, and four operator sequences. The two sets of repressor variants differed in their overall in vivo repression, even though their in vitro binding affinities for the primary operator spanned the same range. Here, we show that the offset can be explained by different abilities to simultaneously bind and \\\"loop\\\" two DNA operators. Further in vitro studies of the looping-competent repressors were carried out to measure binding to a secondary operator sequence. Surprisingly, binding to this operator was largely insensitive to amino acid changes in the repressor protein. In vitro experiments with additional operators and analyses of published data indicates that amino acid changes in these repressor proteins leads to complicated changes in ligand specificity. These results raise new considerations for engineering components of synthetic transcription circuits and - more broadly - illustrate difficulties encountered when trying to extrapolate information about specificity determinant positions among protein homologs.",

Specifically, the use of novel mass spectrometry-cleavable (MS-cleavable) reagents dramatically reduces complexity of the data by providing i) characteristic reporter ions and ii) the mass of the individual peptides, rather than that of the cross-linked moiety. However, optimum acquisition strategies to obtain the best quality data for such cross-linkers with higher energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) alone is yet to be achieved. Therefore, we have carefully investigated and optimized MS parameters to facilitate the identification of disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO)- based cross-links on HCD-equipped mass spectrometers. From the comparison of 9 different fragmentation energies we chose several stepped-HCD fragmentation methods that were evaluated on a variety of cross-linked proteins. The optimal stepped-HCD-method was then directly compared with previously described methods using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos TribridTM instrument using a high-complexity sample. The final results indicate that our stepped-HCD method is able to identify more cross-links than other methods, mitigating the need for multistage MS (MSn) enabled instrumentation and alternative dissociation techniques.",

    "abstract": "A new ecologically inspired paradigm in cancer treatment known as \\\"adaptive therapy\\\" capitalizes on competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones. The goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a controllable stable tumor burden by allowing a significant population of treatment sensitive cells to survive. These, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit resistant populations. However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies, particularly in extending these therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. We present a cancer treatment case study (metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer) as a point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multi-drug adaptive therapies.

    "abstract": "A new ecologically inspired paradigm in cancer treatment known as \\\"adaptive therapy\\\" capitalizes on competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones. The goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a controllable stable tumor burden by allowing a significant population of treatment sensitive cells to survive. These, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit resistant populations. However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies, particularly in extending these therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. We present a cancer treatment case study (metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer) as a point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multi-drug adaptive therapies. First, frequency-dependent \\\"cycles\\\" of tumor evolution can trap tumor evolution in a periodic, controllable loop. Second, the availability and selection of treatments may limit the evolutionary \\\"absorbing region\\\" reachable by the tumor.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPlacing a new species on an existing phylogeny has increasing relevance to several applications. Placement can be used to update phylogenies in a scalable fashion and can help identify unknown query samples using (meta-)barcoding, skimming, or metagenomic data. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods of phylogenetic placement exist, but these methods are not scalable to reference trees with many thousands of leaves, limiting their ability to enjoy benefits of dense taxon sampling in modern reference libraries. They also rely on assembled sequences for the reference set and aligned sequences for the query. Thus, ML methods cannot analyze datasets where the reference consists of unassembled reads, a scenario relevant to emerging applications of genome-skimming for sample identification. We introduce APPLES, a distance-based method for phylogenetic placement. Compared to ML, APPLES is an order of magnitude faster and more memory efficient, and unlike ML, it is able to place on large backbone trees (tested for up to 200,000 leaves). We show that using dense references improves accuracy substantially so that APPLES on dense trees is more accurate than ML on sparser trees, where it can run. Finally, APPLES can accurately identify samples without assembled reference or aligned queries using kmer-based distances, a scenario that ML cannot handle.

    "abstract": "Information transmission in neural networks is influenced by both short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) as well as non-synaptic factors, such as after-hyperpolarization currents and changes in excitability. Although these effects have been widely characterized in vitro using intracellular recordings, how they interact in vivo is unclear. Here we develop a statistical model of the short-term dynamics of spike transmission that aims to disentangle the contributions of synaptic and non-synaptic effects based only on observed pre- and postsynaptic spiking. The model includes a dynamic functional connection with short-term plasticity as well as effects due to the recent history of postsynaptic spiking and slow changes in postsynaptic excitability. Using paired spike recordings, we find that the model accurately describes the short-term dynamics of in vivo spike transmission at a diverse set of identified and putative excitatory synapses, including a thalamothalamic connection in mouse, a thalamocortical connection in a female rabbit, and an auditory brainstem synapse in a female gerbil. We illustrate the utility of this modeling approach by showing how the spike transmission patterns captured by the model may be sufficient to account for stimulus-dependent differences in spike transmission in the auditory brainstem (endbulb of Held). Finally, we apply this model to large-scale multi-electrode recordings to illustrate how such an approach has the potential to reveal cell-type specific differences in spike transmission in vivo. Although short-term synaptic plasticity parameters estimated from ongoing pre- and postsynaptic spiking are highly uncertain, our results are partially consistent with previous intracellular observations in these synapses.\n\nSignificance StatementAlthough synaptic dynamics have been extensively studied and modeled using intracellular recordings of post-synaptic currents and potentials, inferring synaptic effects from extracellular spiking is challenging. Whether or not a synaptic current contributes to postsynaptic spiking depends not only on the amplitude of the current, but also on many other factors, including the activity of other, typically unobserved, synapses, the overall excitability of the postsynaptic neuron, and how recently the postsynaptic neuron has spiked. Here we developed a model that, using only observations of pre- and postsynaptic spiking, aims to describe the dynamics of in vivo spike transmission by modeling both short-term synaptic plasticity and non-synaptic effects. This approach may provide a novel description of fast, structured changes in spike transmission.",

    "abstract": "Sign-tracking is a form of autoshaping where by animals reliably develop conditioned responses toward stimuli that predict an outcome. While the assignment of some value to a predictive cue may be adaptive (i.e., to be alerted to food and water sources), the attribution of value to predictive cues can be maladaptive as seen in behaviors elicited during addiction. Here we test if responding to the predictive cue changes in the context of other cues that are only partially predictive (Experiment 1). Previous work on sequential cues leading to reward have shown a bias in responding toward the first cue in the sequence over learning (Smedley and Smith 2018a, 2018b). Here we test if this effect is unique to discrete cues or if a bias in responding can be seen in a single, long cue (Experiment 2). Finally, we investigate if sign-tracking responses can reliably develop towards a cue that arrives after the delivery of reward (backwards conditioning, Experiment 3). Together, we aim to address various gaps in knowledge about the nature of the sign-tracking response.",

    "abstract": "GWAS and eQTL studies identified thousands of genetic variants associated with complex traits and gene expression. Despite the important role of environmental exposures in complex traits, only a limited number of environmental factors are measured in these studies. Measuring molecular phenotypes in tightly controlled cellular environments provides a more tractable setting to study gene-environment interactions in the absence of other confounding variables.\\n\\nWe performed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in endothelial cells exposed to retinoic acid, dexamethasone, caffeine, and selenium to model genetic and environmental effects on gene regulation in the vascular endothelium, a common site of pathology in cardiovascular disease. We found that genes near regions of differentially accessible chromatin were more likely to be differentially expressed (OR = [3.41, 6.52], p < 10-16). Furthermore, we confirmed that environment-specific changes in transcription factor binding are a key mechanism for cellular response to environmental stimuli. SNPs in these transcription response factor footprints for dexamethasone, caffeine, and retinoic acid were enriched in GTEx eQTLs from artery tissues indicating that these environmental conditions are latently present in GTEx samples. Additionally, SNPs in footprints for response factors in caffeine are enriched in colocalized eQTLs for coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting a role for caffeine in CAD risk. Interestingly, each treatment may amplify or buffer genetic risk for CAD, depending on the particular SNP considered.",
