    "abstract": "Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1-3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn-soy-wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9% compared to monocultures. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity.",

Despite that changes in N-availability have been demonstrated to impact forests, we still miss evidence of its effect on species composition over the long-term.\\nC_LIO_LIBased on a large number of floristic observations (n = 45 604), the French forest status related to soil N-availability was reconstructed from herb species assemblage between 1910 and 2010 using both a bioindication approach and a spatiotemporal sampling aiming to pair past and recent floristic observations.\\nC_LIO_LIWe showed that soil N content bioindicated from forest herb communities was higher at the start of the 20th century than over the 2005-2010 period. It decreased more or less continuously until 1975 and 2005 in coniferous (mean {Delta}C:N=+0.79) and broadleaved (mean {Delta}C:N=+0.74) forests, respectively, and then was lower than the most recent bioindicated N level observed over the 2005-2010 period (mean {Delta}C:N=-0.10 and -0.16, respectively). Spatial analysis confirmed the temporal trends with a decrease and increase in forest surface areas where soil N impoverishment and enrichment have been bioindicated over the time, respectively.\\nC_LIO_LIN bioindicated trends are opposite to changes in N atmospheric deposition compared the 2005-2010 period, while they follow temporal variation in mean N deposition until 1990.\\nSynthesis. Our results showed that forest herb communities have been reshuffled in regards of their soil N requirements over the 20th century highlighting that temporal changes in soil N supply have impacted the understory species composition of forest. We evidenced changes in communities towards less nitrophilous plant assemblage followed by a recent eutrophication since 2005. We propose that the nitrogen forest vegetation status is likely related to N atmospheric deposition trend, but also to both acidification, climate change and forestry management which impacted organic matter decomposition and soil N mineralization through effects on soil microbial and fauna activities. The current eutrophication observed in forest herb communities is worrisome for temperate forest ecosystem and its functioning in regards of biodiversity homogenization which often accompanied such a community reshuffling.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The gradual heterogeneity of climatic factors pose varying selection pressures across geographic distances that leave signatures of clinal variation in the genome. Separating signatures of clinal adaptation from signatures of other evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes, genetic drift, and adaptation to non-clinal conditions of the immediate local environment is a major challenge. Here, we examine climate adaptation in five natural populations of the harlequin fly Chironomus riparius sampled along a climatic gradient across Europe. Our study integrates experimental data, individual genome resequencing, Pool-Seq data, and population genetic modelling. Common-garden experiments revealed a positive correlation of population growth rates corresponding to the population origin along the climate gradient, suggesting thermal adaptation on the phenotypic level. Based on a population genomic analysis, we derived empirical estimates of historical demography and migration. We used an FST outlier approach to infer positive selection across the climate gradient, in combination with an environmental association analysis. In total we identified 162 candidate genes as genomic basis of climate adaptation. Enriched functions among these candidate genes involved the apoptotic process and molecular response to heat, as well as functions identified in other studies of climate adaptation in other insects. Our results show that local climate conditions impose strong selection pressures and lead to genomic adaptation despite strong gene flow. Moreover, these results imply that selection to different climatic conditions seems to converge on a functional level, at least between different insect species.",

To address this issue, institutions are creating extremely large cohorts with sample sizes on the order of one million. Unfortunately, such cohorts are likely to contain confounding factors such as population structure and family/cryptic relatedness. The linear mixed model (LMM) can often correct for such confounding factors, but is too slow to use even with algebraic speedups known as FaST-LMM.

    "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) undergoes regulated degradation as part of feedback control of the sterol pathway. In yeast the stability of the Hmg2 isozyme of HMGR is controlled by the 20 carbon isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP): increasing levels of GGPP causes more efficient degradation by the HRD pathway, allowing feedback regulation of HMGR. The HRD pathway is a conserved quality control pathway critical for the ER-associated degradation of misfolded ER proteins. We have explored the action of GGPP in HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation. GGPP was highly potent as a regulatory molecule in vivo, and in vitro, GGPP altered Hmg2 folding at nanomolar concentrations. These effects of GGPP were absent in a variety of stabilized or non-regulated Hmg2 mutants. Consistent with its high potency, the effects of GGPP were highly specific; other closely related molecules were ineffective in altering Hmg2 structure. In fact, two close GGPP analogues, 2F-GGPP and GGSPP were completely inactive at all concentrations tested, and GGSPP was an antagonist of GGPPs effects in vivo and in vitro. The effects of GGPP on Hmg2 structure and degradation were reversed by chemical chaperones, indicating that GGPP caused selective Hmg2 misfolding. These data indicate that GGPP functions in a manner analogous to an allosteric ligand, causing Hmg2 misfolding through interaction with a reversible, specific binding site. Consistent with this, the Hmg2 protein forms mulitmers. We propose that this \\\"allosteric misfolding,\\\" or mallostery, may be a widely used tactic of biological regulation, with potential for development of small molecule pharmaceuticals that induce selective misfolding.",

    "abstract": "PurposeIntensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has allowed optimization of three-dimensional spatial radiation dose distributions permitting target coverage while reducing normal tissue toxicity. However, radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity is a major contributor to patients quality of life and often a dose-limiting factor in the definitive treatment of cancer with radiation therapy. We propose the next logical step in the evolution of IMRT using canonical radiobiological principles, optimizing the temporal dimension through which radiation therapy is delivered to further reduce radiation-induced toxicity by increased time for normal tissue recovery. We term this novel treatment planning strategy \\\"temporally feathered radiotherapy\\\" (TFRT).\\n\\nMethodsTFRT plans were generated as a composite of five simulated treatment plans each with altered constraints on particular hypothetical organs at risk (OARs) to be delivered sequentially. For each of these TFRT plans, OARs chosen for feathering receive higher doses while the remaining OARs receive lower doses than the standard fractional dose delivered in a conventional fractionated IMRT plan. Each TFRT plan is delivered a specific weekday, which in effect leads to a higher dose once weekly followed by four lower fractional doses to each temporally feathered OAR. We compared normal tissue toxicity between TFRT and conventional fractionated IMRT plans by using a dynamical mathematical model to describe radiation-induced tissue damage and repair over time.\\n\\nResultsModel-based simulations of TFRT demonstrated potential for reduced normal tissue toxicity compared to conventionally planned IMRT. The sequencing of high and low fractional doses delivered to OARs by TFRT plans suggested increased normal tissue recovery, and hence less overall radiation-induced toxicity, despite higher total doses delivered to OARs compared to conventional fractionated IMRT plans. The magnitude of toxicity reduction by TFRT planning was found to depend on the corresponding standard fractional dose of IMRT and organ-specific recovery rate of sublethal radiation-induced damage.\\n\\nConclusionsTFRT is a novel technique for treatment planning and optimization of therapeutic radiotherapy that considers the non-linear aspects of tissue repair to optimize toxicity profiles. Model-based simulations of TFRT to carefully conceptualized clinical cases have demonstrated potential for normal tissue toxicity reduction in a previously described dynamical model of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the amount and infectiousness of influenza virus shed into exhaled breath. This contributes to uncertainty about the importance of airborne influenza transmission. We screened 355 symptomatic volunteers with acute respiratory illness and report 142 cases with confirmed influenza infection who provided 218 paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and 30-minute breath samples (coarse >5 m and fine <5 m fractions) on days 1 to 3 post symptom onset. We assessed viral RNA copy number for all samples and cultured NP swabs and fine aerosols. We recovered infectious virus from 52 (39%) of the fine aerosols and 150 (89%) of the NP swabs with valid cultures. The geometric mean RNA copy numbers were 3.8x104/30-min fine, 1.2x104/30-min coarse aerosol sample, and 8.2x108 per NP swab. Fine and coarse aerosol viral RNA was positively associated with body mass index (fine p<0.05, coarse p<0.10) and number of coughs (fine p<0.001, coarse p<0.01) and negatively associated with increasing days since symptom onset (fine p<0.05 to p<0.01, coarse p<0.10) in adjusted models. Fine aerosol viral RNA was also positively associated with having influenza vaccination for both the current and prior season (p<0.01). NP swab viral RNA was positively associated with upper respiratory symptoms (p<0.01) and negatively associated with age (p<0.01) but was not significantly associated with fine or coarse aerosol viral RNA or their predictors. Sneezing was rare, and sneezing and coughing were not necessary for infectious aerosol generation. Our observations suggest that influenza infection in the upper and lower airways are compartmentalized and independent.\\n\\nSignificanceLack of human data on influenza virus aerosol shedding fuels debate over the importance of airborne transmission. We provide overwhelming evidence that humans generate infectious aerosols and quantitative data to improve mathematical models of transmission and public health interventions. We show that sneezing is rare and not important for, and that coughing is not required for influenza virus aerosolization. Our findings, that upper and lower airway infection are independent and that fine particle exhaled aerosols reflect infection in the lung, open a new pathway for understanding the human biology of influenza infection and transmission. Our observation of an association between repeated vaccination and increased viral aerosol generation demonstrated the power of our method, but needs confirmation.",

    "abstract": "The spread of antibiotic resistance, a major threat to human health, is poorly understood. Empirically, resistant strains gradually increase in prevalence as antibiotic consumption increases, but current mathematical models predict a sharp transition between full sensitivity and full resistance. In other words, we do not understand what drives persistent coexistence between resistant and sensitive strains of disease-causing bacteria in host populations. Without knowing what drives patterns of resistance, we cannot accurately predict the impact of potential strategies for managing resistance. Here, we show that within-host dynamics--bacterial growth, strain competition, and host immune responses--promote frequency-dependent selection for resistant strains, explaining patterns of resistance at the population level. By capturing these processes in a parsimonious mathematical framework, we resolve a long-standing conflict between theory and observation. Our models capture widespread coexistence for multiple bacteria-drug combinations across 30 European countries and explain associations between carriage prevalence and resistance prevalence among bacterial subtypes. A mechanistic understanding of resistance evolution is needed to accurately forecast the impact and effectiveness of resistance-management strategies.",

Whether ecologists subconsciously rate the quality of their peers work more favourably if men are the dominant co-authors is still unclear. To test this hypothesis, we examined how expert ecologists ranked important ecology articles based on a previously compiled list. Women proposed articles with a higher average proportion of women co-authors (0.18) than did men proposers (0.07). For the 100 top-ranked articles, women voters placed more emphasis on articles co-authored by women (0.06) than did men (0.02). However, women voters were still biased because they ranked men-dominated articles more highly, albeit not by as much as men did. This effect disappeared after testing read-only articles. This indicates a persistent, subconscious bias that men-dominated articles are considered to be of higher quality before actual assessment. We add that ecologists need to examine their own subconscious biases when appointing students, hiring staff, and choosing colleagues with whom to publish.",

    "abstract": "To make decisions, animals must evaluate outcomes of candidate choices by accessing memories of relevant experiences. Yet little is known about which experiences are considered or ignored during deliberation, which ultimately governs choice. Here, we propose a normative theory to predict which memories should be accessed at each moment to optimize future decisions. Using nonlocal \\\"replay\\\" of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task where an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility: how much extra reward would be earned due to the computation enabling better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices, vs. the gain from propagating newly encountered information to predecessor states. We show that this theory offers a unifying account of a range of hitherto disconnected findings in the place cell literature such as the balance of forward and reverse replay, biases in the replayed content, and effects of experience. Accordingly, various types of nonlocal events during behavior and rest are re-interpreted as instances of a single choice evaluation operation, unifying seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning and consolidation, and whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In South East Asia, mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) have long been a cause of high disease burden and significant economic costs. While in some SEA countries the epidemiology of MBVs is spatio-temporally well characterised and understood, in others such as Myanmar our understanding is largely incomplete. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we use a simple mathematical approach to estimate a climate-driven suitability index aiming to better characterise the intrinsic, spatio-temporal potential of MBVs in Myanmar. RESULTS: Results show that the timing and amplitude of the natural oscillations of our suitability index are highly informative for the temporal patterns of DENV case counts at the country level, and a mosquito-abundance measure at a city level. When projected at fine spatial scales, the suitability index suggests that the time period of highest MBV transmission potential is between June and October independently of geographical location. Higher potential is nonetheless found along the middle axis of the country and in particular in the southern corridor of international borders with Thailand. DISCUSSION: This research complements and expands our current understanding of MBV transmission potential in Myanmar, by identifying key spatial heterogeneities and temporal windows of importance for surveillance and control. We discuss our findings in the context of Zika virus given its recent worldwide emergence, public health impact, and current lack of information on its epidemiology and transmission potential in Myanmar. The proposed suitability index here demonstrated is applicable to other regions of the world for which surveillance data is missing, either due to lack of resources or absence of an MBV of interest.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome evolution, an important component of mico- and macroevolutionary dynamics 1-5, presents an enigma in the mega-diverse Lepidoptera6. While most species exhibit constrained chromosome evolution, with nearly identical haploid chromosome counts and chromosome-level shared gene content and collinearity among species despite more than 140 Million years of divergence7, a small fraction of species independently exhibit dramatic changes in chromosomal count due to extensive fission and fusion events that are facilitated by their holocentric chromosomes7-9. Here we address this enigma of simultaneous conservation and dynamism in chromosome evolution in our analysis of the chromonome (chromosome level assembly10) of the green-veined white butterfly, Pieris napi (Pieridae, Linnaeus, 1758). We report an unprecedented reorganization of the standard Lepidopteran chromosome structure via more than 90 fission and fusion events that are cryptic at other scales, as the haploid chromosome number is identical to related genera and gene collinearity within the large rearranged segments matches other Lepidoptera. Furthermore, these rearranged segments are significantly enriched for clusters of functionally related genes and the maintenance of ancient telomeric ends. These results suggest an unexpected role for selection in shaping chromosomal evolution when the structural constraints of monocentricq chromosomes are relaxed.",

We utilise a genome wide approach using generalized restricted maximum likelihood (GCTA-GREML) to determine the total phenotypic variance in educational attainment and value-added measures that is attributable to common genetic variation across the genome within a sample of unrelated individuals from a UK birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Our findings suggest that the heritability of educational attainment measured using point score test data increases with age from 47% at age 11 to 61% at age 16. We also find that genetic variation does not contribute towards value-added measures created only from educational attainment point score data, but it does contribute a small amount to measures that additionally control for background characteristics (up to 20.09% [95%CI: 6.06 to 35.71] from age 11 to 14). Finally, our results show that value-added measures built from teacher rated ability have higher heritability than those built from exam scores. Our findings suggest that the heritability of educational attainment increases through childhood and adolescence. Value-added measures based upon fine grain point scores may be less prone to between-individual genomic differences than measures that control for students backgrounds, or those built from more subjective measures such as teacher rated ability.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing-based analyses of low-biomass samples are known to be prone to misinterpretation due to the potential presence of contaminating molecules derived from laboratory reagents and environments. Due to its inherent instability, contamination with RNA is usually considered to be unlikely. Here we report the presence of small RNA (sRNA) contaminants in widely used microRNA extraction kits and means for their depletion. Sequencing of sRNAs extracted from human plasma samples was performed and significant levels of non-human (exogenous) sequences were detected. The source of the most abundant of these sequences could be traced to the microRNA extraction columns by qPCR-based analysis of laboratory reagents. The presence of artefactual sequences originating from the confirmed contaminants were furthermore replicated in a range of published datasets. To avoid artefacts in future experiments, several protocols for the removal of the contaminants were elaborated, minimal amounts of starting material for artefact-free analyses were defined, and the reduction of contaminant levels for identification of bona fide sequences using  ultra-clean extraction kits was confirmed. In conclusion, this is the first report of the presence of RNA molecules as contaminants in laboratory reagents. The described protocols should be applied in the future to avoid confounding sRNA studies.",

Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States and is major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ectopic pregnancy among women. We use an agent-based network model to capture the complex heterogeneous assortative sexual mixing network of men and women. Both long-term and casual partnerships are modeled with different sexual contact frequencies and condom use. We use simulations to compare the effectiveness of intervention strategies based on randomly screening people for infection, treating the partners of infected people, and rescreening for infection after treatment. We compare the difference between treating the partners of an infected person both with, and without, testing them first for infection. The highest prevalence is among young sexually active individuals. We calibrate the model parameters to agree with recent survey data showing chlamydia prevalence of 14% of the women and 9% of the men in the 15 - 25 year-old African American residents of New Orleans, Louisiana. We observed that although increased chlamydia screening and treating most of the partners of infected people will reduce the incidence, these mitigations alone are not sufficient to control the epidemic. The model predicts that the current epidemic can brought under control once over half of the partners of infected people are tested and treated.",

    "abstract": "The problem of pattern and scale is a central challenge in ecology. The problem of scale is central to community ecology, where functional ecological groups are aggregated and treated as a unit underlying an ecological pattern, such as aggregation of \\\"nitrogen fixing trees\\\" into a total abundance of a trait underlying ecosystem physiology. With the emergence of massive community ecological datasets, from microbiomes to breeding bird surveys, there is a need to objectively identify the scales of organization pertaining to well-defined patterns in community ecological data.\\n\\nThe phylogeny is a scaffold for identifying key phylogenetic scales associated with macroscopic patterns. Phylofactorization was developed to objectively identify phylogenetic scales underlying patterns in relative abundance data. However, many ecological data, such as presence-absences and counts, are not relative abundances, yet it is still desireable and informative to identify phylogenetic scales underlying a pattern of interest. Here, we generalize phylofactorization beyond relative abundances to a graph-partitioning algorithm for any community ecological data.\\n\\nGeneralizing phylofactorization connects many tools from data analysis to phylogenetically-informe analysis of community ecological data. Two-sample tests identify three phylogenetic factors of mammalian body mass which arose during the K-Pg extinction event, consistent with other analyses of mammalian body mass evolution. Projection of data onto coordinates defined by the phylogeny yield a phylogenetic principal components analysis which refines our understanding of the major sources of variation in the human gut microbiome. These same coordinates allow generalized additive modeling of microbes in Central Park soils and confirm that a large clade of Acidobacteria thrive in neutral soils. Generalized linear and additive modeling of exponential family random variables can be performed by phylogenetically-constrained reduced-rank regression or stepwise factor contrasts. We finish with a discussion of how phylofac-torization produces an ecological species concept with a phylogenetic constraint. All of these tools can be implemented with a new R package available online.",

    "abstract": "Critical animal behaviors, especially among rodents, are guided by odors in remarkably well-coordinated manners. While many extramodal sensory cues compete for cognitive resources in these ecological contexts, that rodents can engage in such odor-guided behaviors suggests that they selectively attend to odors. We developed a behavioral paradigm to reveal that rats are indeed capable of selectively attending to odors in the presence of competing extramodal stimuli and found that this selective attention facilitates accurate odor-guided decisions. Further, we uncovered that attention to odors adaptively sharpens their representation among neurons in a brain region considered integral for odor-driven behaviors. Thus, selective attention contributes to olfaction by enhancing the coding of odors in a manner analogous to that observed among other sensory systems.",

    "abstract": "MotivationOxford Nanopore sequencing is a rapidly developed sequencing technology in recent years. To keep pace with the explosion of the downstream data analytical tools, a versatile Nanopore sequencing simulator is needed to complement the experimental data as well as to benchmark those newly developed tools. However, all the currently available simulators are based on simple statistics of the produced reads, which have difficulty in capturing the complex nature of the Nanopore sequencing procedure, the main task of which is the generation of raw electrical current signals.\\n\\nResultsHere we propose a deep learning based simulator, DeepSimulator, to mimic the entire pipeline of Nanopore sequencing. Starting from a given reference genome or assembled contigs, we simulate the electrical current signals by a context-dependent deep learning model, followed by a base-calling procedure to yield simulated reads. This workflow mimics the sequencing procedure more naturally. The thorough experiments performed across four species show that the signals generated by our context-dependent model are more similar to the experimentally obtained signals than the ones generated by the official context-independent pore model. In terms of the simulated reads, we provide a parameter interface to users so that they can obtain the reads with different accuracies ranging from 83% to 97%. The reads generated by the default parameter have almost the same properties as the real data. Two case studies demonstrate the application of DeepSimulator to benefit the development of tools in de novo assembly and in low coverage SNP detection.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software can be accessed freely at: https://github.com/lykaust15/deep_simulator.",

Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL>=3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCultured neuronal networks are widely used to study and characterize neuronal network activity. Among the many uses of neuronal cultures are the capabilities to evaluate neurotoxicity and the effects of pharmacological compounds on cellular physiology. Multi-well microelectrode arrays (MEAs) can collect high-throughput data from multiple neuronal cultures simultaneously, and thereby make possible hypotheses-driven inquiries into neurobiology and neuropharmacology. The analysis of MEA-derived information presents many computational challenges. High frequency data recorded simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes can be difficult to handle. The need to compare network activity across various drug treatments or genotypes recorded on the same plate from experiments lasting several weeks presents another challenge. These challenges inspired us to develop meaRtools; an MEA data analysis package that contains new methods to characterize network activity patterns, which are illustrated here using examples from a genetic mouse model of epilepsy. Among the highlights of meaRtools are novel algorithms designed to characterize neuronal activity dynamics and network properties such as bursting and synchronization, options to combine multiple recordings and use a robust statistical framework to draw appropriate statistical inferences, and finally data visualizations and plots. In summary, meaRtools provides a platform for the analyses of singular and longitudinal MEA experiments.",

We previously showed that the three-dimensional organization of the P. falciparum genome is strongly associated with gene expression during its replication cycle inside red blood cells. Here, we analyzed genome organization in the P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission stages. Major changes occurred in the localization and interactions of genes involved in pathogenesis and immune evasion, erythrocyte and liver cell invasion, sexual differentiation and master regulation of gene expression. In addition, we observed reorganization of subtelomeric heterochromatin around genes involved in host cell remodeling. Depletion of heterochromatin protein 1 (PfHP1) resulted in loss of interactions between virulence genes, confirming that PfHP1 is essential for maintenance of the repressive center. Overall, our results suggest that the three-dimensional genome structure is strongly connected with transcriptional activity of specific gene families throughout the life cycle of human malaria parasites.",

We observe brain endothelial cells (BECs) in the aged mouse hippocampus express an inflammatory transcriptional profile with focal upregulation of Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM1), a protein that facilitates vascular-immune cell interactions. Concomitantly, the shed, soluble form of VCAM1 is prominently increased in the aged circulation of humans and mice, and aged plasma is sufficient to increase VCAM1 expression in cultured BECs and young mouse hippocampi. Systemic anti-VCAM1 antibody or genetic ablation of VCAM1 in BECs counteracts the detrimental effects of aged plasma on young brains and reverses aging aspects in old mouse brains. Thus, VCAM1 is a negative regulator of adult neurogenesis and inducer of microglial reactivity, establishing VCAM1 and the luminal side of the BBB as possible targets to treat age-related neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The everyday environment brings about many competing inputs from different modalities to our sensory systems. The ability to filter these multisensory inputs in order to identify and efficiently utilize useful spatial cues is necessary to detect and process the relevant information. In the present study, we investigate how feature-based attention affects the detection of motion across sensory modalities. We were interested to determine how subjects use intramodal, crossmodal auditory, and combined audiovisual motion cues to attend to specific visual motion signals. The results show that in most cases, both visual and auditory cues enhance feature-based orienting to a visual motion pattern that is presented among distractor patterns. Furthermore, in many cases, detection of transparent motion patterns was significantly more accurate after combined visual-auditory than unimodal attention cues. Whereas previous studies have shown crossmodal effects of spatial attention, our results demonstrate a spread of crossmodal feature-based attention cues, which have been matched for the detection threshold of the visual target. These effects were evident in comparisons between cued and uncued conditions, as well as in analyses comparing the effects of valid vs. invalid cues.",

    "abstract": "Honey bees have a remarkable sense of time and individual honey bee foragers are capable to adjust their foraging activity with respect to the time of food availability. Although, there is plenty of experimental evidence that foraging behavior is guided by the circadian clock, nothing is known about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Here we present a first study exploring whether the time-restricted foraging under natural light-dark condition affects the molecular clock in honey bees. In an enclosed flight chamber (12m x 4m x 4m), food was presented either for 2 hours in the morning or 2 hours in the afternoon for several consecutive days and daily cycling of the two major clock genes, cryptochrome2 (cry2) and period (per), were analyzed in three different tissues involved in feeding-related behaviors: brain, antennae and subesophageal ganglion (SEG). We found that morning and afternoon trained foragers showed significant phase-differences in the cycling of both clock genes in all three tissues. Furthermore, the phase-differences were more pronounced when the feeder was scented with the general plant odor linalool. Our results clearly demonstrate that foraging time functions as a strong circadian Zeitgeber in honey bees. More surprisingly our results suggest that foraging time might have the potential to override the entrainment effect of the light-dark cycle.",

    "abstract": "Plant immunity is overcome by pathogens by the means of secreted effectors. Host effector targets might be proteins acting in pathogen defense or serve demands of the pathogen. The barley ROP GTPase HvRACB is involved in entry of the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh) into barley epidermal cells. We found that HvRACB interacts with the ROP-interactive peptide 1 (ROPIP1) that is encoded on the active non-long terminal repeat retroelement Eg-R1 of Bgh. Over-expression of ROPIP1 in barley epidermal cells and host-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (HIGS) of ROPIP1 suggested that ROPIP1 is involved in virulence of Bgh. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-localization supported that ROPIP1 can interact with activated HvRACB in planta. We show that ROPIP1 is expressed by Bgh on barley and translocated into the cytoplasm of infected barley cells. ROPIP1 is recruited to microtubules upon co-expression of MICROTUBULE ASSOCIATED ROP GTPase ACTIVATING PROTEIN (HvMAGAP1) and can destabilize cortical microtubules. Bgh ROPIP might target HvRACB and manipulate host cell microtubule organization for facilitated host cell entry. Data suggest a possible neo-functionalization of retroelement-derived transcripts for the evolution of a pathogen virulence effector.",

Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) represses this pathway by manipulating the L cell glycolysis, thus reducing insulin- and GLP-1 secretion. The mechanism by which FXR manipulates the L cell glycolysis is unclear. In this study, we construct an L cell specific protein-protein interactome and identify all significantly active protein complexes, inferred by co-expression scores, in FXR-activated and control L cells. Contrary to previous reports, we find extensive glycolytic enzyme activity in FXR-activated L cells. We present how FXRs repression of the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PKLR), is causing the reduction in glycolytic activity. This mechanistic insight may aid development of drugs targeting the GLP-1 pathway.",

How this accuracy is achieved is not fully understood in all its details. Using an E. coli in vitro system, I explore novel mechanisms that contribute to the high accuracy of translation termination. By comparing the Michaelis-Menten parameters of methylated and non-methylated release factors on cognate and non-cognate codons. Post-translational methylation of a strictly conserved GGQ motif in class I release factors increases the accuracy of termination by up to 5-fold. This happens by increasing both the maximum rate of peptide release (kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constant (KM). Further, I demonstrate here that a non-methylated release factor acts like an uncompetitive inhibitor of enzyme reactions. Overall, this study shows that the methylation of class I release factors is a novel mechanism contributing to highly accurate translation termination.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The semi-aquatic bugs conquered water surfaces worldwide and occupy ponds, streams, lakes, mangroves, and even open oceans. As such, they inspired a range of scientific studies from ecology and evolution to developmental genetics and hydrodynamics of fluid locomotion. However, the lack of a representative water strider genome hinders thorough investigations of the mechanisms underlying the processes of adaptation and diversification in this group. Here we report the sequencing and manual annotation of the Gerris buenoi (G. buenoi) genome, the first water strider genome to be sequenced so far. G. buenoi genome is about 1 000Mb and the sequencing effort recovered 20 949 predicted protein-coding genes. Manual annotation uncovered a number of local (tandem and proximal) gene duplications and expansions of gene families known for their importance in a variety of processes associated with morphological and physiological adaptations to water surface lifestyle. These expansions affect key processes such as growth, vision, desiccation resistance, detoxification, olfaction and epigenetic components. Strikingly, the G. buenoi genome contains three Insulin Receptors, a unique case among metazoans, suggesting key changes in the rewiring and function of the insulin pathway. Other genomic changes include wavelength sensitivity shifts in opsin proteins likely in association with the requirements of vision in water habitats. Our findings suggest that local gene duplications might have had an important role during the evolution of water striders. These findings along with the G. buenoi genome open exciting research opportunities to understand adaptation and genome evolution of this unique hemimetabolous insect.",

Here, we evaluate motor function, as measured by single pellet reaching (SPR), as well as local EEG changes in NREM, REM and wakefulness during a 30-day recovery period after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery in rats. Small cortical infarcts resulted in poor SPR performance and induced widespread changes in EEG spectra in the ipsilesional hemisphere in all vigilance states, without causing major changes in sleep-wake architecture. Ipsilesional 1-4 Hz power was increased after stroke, whereas power in higher frequencies was reduced, resulting in a steeper slope of the power spectrum. Multielectrode array analysis of ipsilesional M1 showed that these spectral changes were present on the microelectrode level throughout M1 and were not related to increased synchronization between electrodes. Spectrum slope was significantly correlated with post-stroke motor function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundL1 retrotransposons have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for the entire history of mammals and currently make up to 20% of a typical mammalian genome. B1 retrotransposons are dependent on L1 for retrotransposition and span the evolutionary history of rodents since their radiation. L1s were found to have lost their activity in a group of South American rodents, the Sigmodontinae, and B1 inactivation preceded the extinction of L1 in the same group. Consequently, a basal group of sigmodontines have active L1s but inactive B1s and a derived clade have both inactive L1s and B1s. It has been suggested that B1s became extinct during a long period of L1 quiescence and that L1s subsequently reemerged in the basal group.\\n\\nResultsHere we investigate the evolutionary histories of L1 and B1 in the sigmodontine rodents and show that L1 activity continued until after the split of the L1-extinct clade and the basal group. After the split, L1s had a small burst of activity in the former group, followed by extinction. In the basal group, activity was initially low but was followed by a dramatic increase in L1 activity. We found the last wave of B1s retrotransposition was large and probably preceded the split between the two rodent clades.\\n\\nConclusionsGiven that L1s had been steadily retrotransposing during the time corresponding to B1 extinction and that the burst of B1 activity preceding B1 extinction was large, we conclude that B1 extinction was not a result of L1 quiescence. Rather, the burst of B1 activity may have contributed to L1 extinction both by competition with L1 and by putting strong selective pressure on the host to control retrotransposition.",
