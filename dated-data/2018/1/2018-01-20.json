    "abstract": "Mitochondria are organized as tubular networks in the cell and undergo fission and fusion. While several of the molecular players involved in mediating mitochondrial dynamics have been identified, the precise cellular cues that initiate fission or fusion remain largely unknown. In fission yeast, mitochondria are organized along microtubule bundles. Here, we employed deletions of kinesin-like proteins to perturb microtubule dynamics, and determined that cells with long microtubules exhibited long, but fewer mitochondria, whereas cells with short microtubules exhibited short, but several mitochondria due to reduced mitochondrial fission in the former and elevated fission in the latter. Correspondingly, upon onset of closed mitosis in fission yeast, wherein interphase microtubules assemble to form the spindle within the nucleus, we measured increased mitochondrial fission. We determined that the consequent rise in the mitochondrial copy number was necessary to reduce partitioning errors while stochastically partitioning mitochondria between daughter cells. We discovered that the association of mitochondria with microtubules physically impeded the assembly of the fission protein Dnm1 around mitochondria, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial fission. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for regulation of mitochondrial fission that is dictated by the interaction between mitochondria and the microtubule cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria have been studied for half a century but the possibility that Gram-positive bacteria secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) was not pursued due to the assumption that the thick peptidoglycan cell wall would prevent their release to the environment. However, following discovery in fungi, which also have cell walls, EVs have now been described for a variety of Gram-positive bacteria. EVs purified from Gram-positive bacteriaare implicated in virulence, toxin release and transference to host cells, eliciting immune responses, and spread of antibiotic resistance. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that is the etiological agent of listeriosis. Here we report that L. monocytogenes produces EVs with diameter ranging from 20-200 nm, containing the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O(LLO) and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Using simultaneous metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction (MPLEx) multi-omics we characterized protein, lipid and metabolite composition of bacterial cells and secreted EVs and found that EVs carry the majority of listerial virulence proteins. Cell-free EV preparations were toxic to the murine macrophage cell line J774.16, in a LLO-dependent manner, evidencing EV biological activity. The deletion of plcA increased EV toxicity, suggesting PI-PLC can restrain LLO activity. Using immunogold electron microscopy we detect LLO localization at several organelles within infected human epithelial cells and with high-resolution fluorescence imaging we show that dynamic lipid structures are released from L. monocytogenes that colocalize with LLO during infection. Our findings demonstrate that L. monocytogenes utilize EVs for toxin release and implicate these structures in mammalian cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new concept called macrocompetition - defined as the mutual suppression of diversity/species richness of competing clades - and investigate evidence for its existence. To this end, we analyzed the distribution of two convergent nectarivorous families, hawk-moths and hummingbirds, over the continental United States to determine whether there is geographic partitioning between the families and its potential causes. Using stepwise regression, we tested for latitudinal and longitudinal biases in the species richness of both taxa and the potential role of 10 environmental variables in their distribution pattern. Hawk-moth species richness increases with longitude (eastward-bias) while that of hummingbirds declines (westward-bias). Similar geographic patterns can be seen across Canada, Mexico and South America. Hawk-moth species richness is positively correlated with higher overall temperatures (especially summer minimums), atmospheric pressure, and summer precipitation; hummingbird species richness is negatively correlated with atmospheric pressure and positively correlated with winter daily maxima. The species richness patterns reflect each familys respective anatomical differences and support the concept of macrocompetition between the two taxa. Hawk-moth species richness was highest in states with low elevation, summer-time flowering, and warm summer nights; hummingbird species richness is highest in the southwest with higher elevation, greater cool season flowering and high daytime winter temperatures. Hawk-moths and hummingbirds as distinct evolutionary technologies exhibit niche overlap and geographical partitioning. These are two of three indicators suggested by Brown and Davidson for inter-taxonomic competition. We intend the patterns revealed here to inspire further exploration into competition and community structuring between hawk-moths and hummingbirds.",

    "abstract": "All known phototrophic metabolisms on Earth are based on one of three energy-converting pigments: chlorophyll-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, and retinal, which is the chromophore in rhodopsins [1]. While the contribution of chlorophylls to global energy flows and marine carbon cycling has been studied for decades, the role of retinal-based phototrophy remains largely unexplored [1,2]. We report the first vertical distributions of the three energy-converting pigments measured along a contrasting nutrient gradient through the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. The highest proteorhodopsin concentrations were observed above the deep chlorophyll-a maxima, and their geographical distribution tended to be inversely related to that of chlorophyll-a. We further show that proteorhodopsins potentially absorb as much or more light energy than chlorophyll-a -based phototrophy and this energy is sufficient to sustain bacterial basal metabolism. Our results suggest that ubiquitous proteorhodopsin-containing heterotrophs are important contributors to the light energy captured in the sea.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVESTo conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of chronic back pain (CBP).\\n\\nMETHODSAdults of European ancestry were included from 16 cohorts in Europe and North America. CBP cases were defined as those reporting back pain present for >3-6 months; non-cases were included as comparisons (\\\"controls\\\"). Each cohort conducted genotyping using commercially available arrays followed by imputation. GWAS used logistic regression models with additive genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population substructure. The threshold for genome-wide significance in the fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was p<5x10-8. Suggestive (p<5x10-7) and genome-wide significant (p<5x10-8) variants were carried forward for replication or further investigation in an independent sample.\\n\\nRESULTSThe discovery sample was comprised of 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 CBP cases. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p=7.2x10-10). This was subsequently replicated in an independent sample of 283,752 subjects, including 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p=5.3x10-11), and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis (0R=1.07, p=4.5x10-19). We found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant, rs7833174, located between CCDC26 and GSDMC (OR 1.05, p=4.4x10-13), and an intronic variant, rs4384683, in DCC (OR 0.97, p=2.4x10-10).\\n\\nDISCUSSIONIn this first reported meta-analysis of GWAS for CBP, we identified and replicated a genetic locus associated with CBP (SOX5). We also identified 2 other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis (CCDC26/GSDMC and DCC).",

    "abstract": "To infer brain source activation patterns under different cognitive tasks is an integral step to understand how our brain works. Traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) Source Imaging (ESI) methods usually do not distinguish task-related and spurious non-task-related sources that jointly generate EEG signals, which inevitably yield misleading reconstructed activation patterns. In this research, we argue that the task-related source signal intrinsically has a low-rank property, which is exploited to to infer the true task-related EEG sources location. Although the true task-related source signal is sparse and low-rank, the contribution of spurious sources scattering over the source space with intermittent activation patterns makes the actual source space lose the low-rank property. To reconstruct a low-rank true source, we propose a novel ESI model that involves a spatial low-rank representation and a temporal Laplacian graph regularization, the latter of which guarantees the temporal smoothness of the source signal and eliminate the spurious ones. To solve the proposed model, an augmented Lagrangian objective function is formulated and an algorithm in the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy with high effciency.",

    "abstract": "SummaryAlphaMate is a flexible program that optimises selection, maintenance of genetic diversity, and mate allocation in breeding programs. It can be used in animal and cross- and self-pollinating plant populations. These populations can be subject to selective breeding or conservation management. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation of a valid mating plan that is solved with an evolutionary algorithm. A valid mating plan is defined by a combination of mating constraints (the number of matings, the maximal number of parents, the minimal/equal/maximal number of contributions per parent, or allowance for selfing) that are gender specific or generic. The optimisation can maximize genetic gain, minimize group coancestry, minimize inbreeding of individual matings, or maximize genetic gain for a given increase in group coancestry or inbreeding. Users provide a list of candidate individuals with associated gender and selection criteria information (if applicable) and coancestry matrix. Selection criteria and coancestry matrix can be based on pedigree or genome-wide markers. Additional individual or mating specific information can be included to enrich optimisation objectives. An example of rapid recurrent genomic selection in wheat demonstrates how AlphaMate can double the efficiency of converting genetic diversity into genetic gain compared to truncation selection. Another example demonstrates the use of genome editing to expand the gain-diversity frontier.\\n\\nAvailabilityExecutable versions of AlphaMate for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms are available at http://www.alpha-genes.roslin.ed.ac.uk/AlphaMate\\n\\nContactgregor.gorjanc@roslin.ed.ack.uk",

    "abstract": "Estimating the correct binding modes of ligands in protein-ligand complexes is not only crucial in the drug discovery process, but also for elucidating potential toxicity mechanisms. In the current paper, we discuss and demonstrate a computational modelling protocol using the combination of docking, classical (cMD) and accelerated (aMD) molecular dynamics and free energy perturbation (FEP+ protocol) for identification of the binding modes of selected perfluorocarboxyl acids (PFCAs) in the PPAR{gamma} nuclear receptor.\\n\\nInitially, we employed both the regular and induced fit docking which failed to correctly predict the ligand binding modes and rank the compounds with respect to experimental free energies of binding, when they were docked into non-native X-ray structure. The cMD and aMD simulations identified the presence of multiple binding modes for these compounds, and the shorter chain PFCAs (C6-C8) continuously moved between a few energetically favourable binding conformations. These results demonstrate that the docking scoring function cannot rank compounds precisely in such cases, not due to its insufficiency, but because of the use of incorrect or only one unique bindings pose, neglecting the protein dynamics. Finally, based on MD predictions of binding conformations, the FEP+ sampling protocol was extended and then accurately reproduced experimental differences in the free energies. Thus, the preliminary MD simulations can also provide helpful information about correct set-up of the FEP+ calculations. These results show that the PFCAs binding modes were accurately predicted and the FEP+ protocol can be used to estimate free energies of binding of flexible molecules outside of typical drug-like compounds.\\n\\nOur in silico workflow revealed the main characteristics of the PFCAs, which are week PPAR{gamma} partial agonists and illustrated the importance of specific ligand-residue interactions within the LBD. This work also suggests a common workflow for identification of ligand binding modes, ligand-protein dynamics description and relative free energy calculations.",

    "abstract": "Efficient precision genome editing requires a quick, quantitative, and inexpensive assay of editing outcomes. Here we present ICE (Inference of CRISPR Edits), which enables robust analysis of CRISPR edits using Sanger data. ICE proposes potential outcomes for editing with guide RNAs (gRNAs) and then determines which are supported by the data via regression. Additionally, we develop a score called ICE-D (Discordance) that can provide information on large or unexpected edits. We empirically confirm through over 1,800 edits that the ICE algorithm is robust, reproducible, and can analyze CRISPR experiments within days after transfection. We also confirm that ICE strongly correlates with next-generation sequencing of amplicons (Amp-Seq). The ICE tool is free to use and offers several improvements over current analysis tools. For instance, ICE can analyze individual experiments as well as multiple experiments simultaneously (batch analysis). ICE can also detect a wider variety of outcomes, including multi-guide edits (multiple gRNAs per target) and edits resulting from homology-directed repair (HDR), such as knock-ins and base edits. ICE is a reliable analysis tool that can significantly expedite CRISPR editing workflows. It is available online at ice.synthego.com, and the source code is at github.com/synthego-open/ice",

Consequently, these miRNAs have been studied as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors and oncogenes. However, the cell-type specificity of these miRNAs is not well defined in prostate tissue. Through two different microdissection techniques, and droplet digital RT-PCR, we quantified these miRNAs in the stroma and epithelium of radical prostatectomy specimens. In contrast to their purported roles as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors, we found miR-1 and miR-143 expression to be predominantly stromal. Conversely, miR-141 was predominantly epithelial. MiR-21 was detected in both stroma and epithelium. Strikingly, the levels of miR-1 and miR-143 were significantly reduced in tumor-associated stroma, but not tumor epithelium. Gene expression analyses in human cell lines, tissues, and prostate-derived stromal cultures support the cell-type selective expression of miR-1, miR-141, and miR-143. Analyses of the PCa Genome Atlas (TCGA-PRAD) showed a strong positive correlation between stromal markers and miR-1 and miR-143, and a strong negative correlation between stromal markers and miR-141.

A previous phylogenetic study based on two ribosomal RNA genes provided insight into the internal relationships between major siphonophore groups, however there was little support for many deep relationships within the clade Codonophora. Here, we present a new siphonophore phylogeny based on new transcriptome data from 30 siphonophore species analyzed in combination with 13 publicly available genomic and transcriptomic datasets. We use this new phylogeny to reconstruct several traits that are central to siphonophore biology, including sexual system (monoecy vs. dioecy), gain and loss of zooid types, life history traits, and habitat. The phylogenetic relationships in this study are largely consistent with the previous phylogeny, but we find strong support for new clades within Codonophora that were previously unresolved. These results have important implications for trait evolution within Siphonophora, including favoring the hypothesis that monoecy arose twice.",

    "abstract": "Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) are synthetic model systems widely used in biophysical studies of lipid membranes. Phase separation behaviors of lipid species in these two model systems differ due to the lipid-substrate interactions that are present only for SLBs. Therefore, GUVs are believed to resemble natural cell membranes more closely, and a very large body of literature focuses on applying nano-characterization techniques to quantify phase separation on GUVs. However, one important technique, atomic force microscopy (AFM), has not yet been used successfully to study phase separation on GUVs. In the present study, we report that in binary systems, certain phase domains on GUVs retain their original shapes and patterns after the GUVs rupture on glass surfaces. This enabled AFM experiments on phase domains from binary GUVs containing 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) and either 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). These DLPC/DSPC and DLPC/DPPC GUVs both presented two different gel phases, one of which (bright phase) included a relatively high concentration of DiI-C20 but excluded Bodipy-HPC, and the other of which (dark phase) excluded both probes. The bright phases are of interest because they seem to stabilize dark phases against coalescence. Results suggested that the gel phases labeled by DiI-C20 in the DLPC/DSPC membrane, which surround the dark gel phase, is an extra layer of membrane, indicating a highly curved structure that might stabilize the interior dark domains. This phenomenon was not found in the DLPC/DPPC membrane. These results show the utility of AFM on collapsed GUVs, and suggest a possible mechanism for stabilization of lipid domains.",

In spite of a wealth of information, including several experimentally determined structural models of TRP channels, the mechanism of temperature activation remains unknown. We have carefully characterized the repeated activation of TRPV1 by thermal stimuli and discovered a previously unknown inactivation process, which is irreversible. This inactivation is associated with specific conformational changes in the membrane proximal domain. We propose that this form of gating in TRPV1 channels is a consequence of the heat absorption process that leads to channel opening.",

    "abstract": "The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis targets epithelial cells lining the genital mucosa. We observed that infection of various cell types, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells resulted in the formation of unusually stable focal adhesions that resisted disassembly induced by the myosin II inhibitor, blebbistatin. Super-resolution microscopy revealed in infected cells the vertical displacement of paxillin and FAK from the signaling layer of focal adhesions; while vinculin remained in its normal position within the force transduction layer. The candidate type III effector TarP which localized to focal adhesions during infection and when expressed ectopically, was sufficient to mimic both the reorganization and blebbistatin-resistant phenotypes. These effects of TarP, including its localization to focal adhesions required interaction with the host protein vinculin through a specific domain at the C-terminus of TarP. The consequence of Chlamydia-stabilized focal adhesions was restricted cell motility and enhanced attachment to the extracellular matrix. Thus, via a novel mechanism, Chlamydia inserts TarP within focal adhesions to alter their organization and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Basal constriction occurs at the zebrafish midbrain-hindbrain boundary constriction (MHBC) and is likely a widespread morphogenetic mechanism. 3D reconstruction demonstrates that MHBC cells are wedge-shaped, and initially constrict basally, with subsequent apical expansion. wnt5b is expressed in the MHB and is required for basal constriction. Consistent with a requirement for this pathway, expression of dominant negative Gsk3{beta} overcomes wnt5b knockdown. Immunostaining identifies focal adhesion kinase (Fak) as active in the MHB region, and knockdown demonstrates Fak is a regulator of basal constriction. Tissue specific knockdown further indicates that Fak functions cell autonomously within the MHBC. Fak is epistatic to wnt5b, suggesting that Wnt5b signals locally as an early step in basal constriction and acts together with more widespread Fak activation. This study delineates signaling pathways that regulate basal constriction during brain morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In pig production, insufficient feed digestion causes excessive nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which are then released to the environment. To address the issue of environmental emissions, we have established transgenic pigs harboring a single-copy quad-cistronic transgene and simultaneously expressing three microbial enzymes, {beta}-glucanase, xylanase, and phytase in the salivary glands. All the transgenic enzymes were successfully expressed, and the digestion of non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) and phytate in the feedstuff was enhanced. Fecal nitrogen and phosphate outputs were reduced by 23%-46%, and growth rate improved by 23.4% (gilts) and 24.4% (boars) when the pigs were fed on a corn and soybean-based diet and high-NSP diet. The transgenic pigs showed a 11.5%- 14.5% improvement in feed conversion rate compared to the age-matched wild-type littermates. These findings indicate that transgenic pigs are promising resources for improving feed efficiency and reducing nutrient emissions to the environment.",

    "abstract": "In previous work, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with adsorbed high-density lipoprotein (HDL) nanoparticles have been utilized to deliver oligonucleotides, yet HDL-AuNPs functionalized with small molecule inhibitors have not been systematically explored. Here, we report an AuNP-based therapeutic system (HDL-AuNPs-BMS) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by delivering BMS309403 (BMS), a small molecule that selectively inhibits AML-promoting factor fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4). HDL-AuNPs-BMS are synthesized using a gold nanoparticle as template to control conjugate size and ensure a spherical shape to engineer HDL-like nanoparticle containing BMS. The zeta potential and size of the HDL-AuNPs obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that the nanoparticles are electrostatically stable and 25 nm in diameter. Functionally, compared to free drug, HDL-AuNPs-BMS conjugates are more readily internalized by AML cells and have more pronounced effect on downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), reduction of global DNA methylation, and restoration of epigenetically-silenced tumor suppressor p15INK4b coupled with AML growth arrest. Importantly, systemic administration of HDL-AuNPs-BMS conjugates into AML-bearing mice inhibits DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation, induces AML cell differentiation and diminishes AML disease progression without obvious side effects. In summary, these data, for the first time, demonstrate HDL-AuNPs as an effective delivery platform with great potential to attach distinct inhibitors, and HDL-AuNPs-BMS conjugates as a promising therapeutic platform to treat leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Periodontal disease (PD) is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) but the casual relationship is unclear. American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) have high rate of both PD and CVD and a better understanding of how PD might affect heart health would be particularly helpful in this population. In this study, we sequenced the bacterial biofilms of periodontal (gum) pockets and used metagenomic sequencing and vascular health measurements (immune cytokine profiles and vascular flow) to determine the relationship of microbial pathogens and CVD. Twelve subjects were sequenced before and after standard periodontal treatment. Other measures taken before and after treatment included a full dental screening; serum concentration of key immune cytokines from blood samples; lipid profiles from fasting venous blood; and plasma glucose concentrations. The non-invasive Laser Doppler Fluxmetry (LDF) procedure was conducted to measures the microvascular vasodilation. We found highly significant relationships between the total abundance of 4 periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola, and the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1{beta}) (r=0.63; p=0.009) as well as with vascular flow post sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment (r=p=0.006). Two bacterial species that correlated most with IL-1{beta} were F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. IL-1{beta} has been strongly implicated as a causal factor in atherosclerosis and in periodontal bone loss. To our knowledge, this is the first direct link between abundance of specific periodontal pathogens and cardiovascular disease in humans, and suggests that these pathogens could be used as warning signs for cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-evoked brain activity is critical because it would provide a way to map task-related brain regions in patients unable to comply with such tasks. A crucial question within this realm is to what extent the execution of a cognitive task affects the intrinsic activity of brain regions not involved in the task. Computational models can be useful to answer this question because they allow us to distinguish task from non-task neural elements while giving us the effects of task execution on non-task regions of interest at the neuroimaging level. The quantification of those effects in a computational model would represent a step towards elucidating the intrinsic versus task-evoked connection. Here we used computational modeling and graph theoretical metrics to quantify changes in intrinsic functional brain connectivity due to task execution. We used our Large-Scale Neural Modeling framework to embed a computational model of visual short-term memory into an empirically derived connectome. We simulated a neuroimaging study consisting of ten subjects performing passive fixation (PF), passive viewing (PV) and delay match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. We used the simulated BOLD fMRI time-series to calculate functional connectivity (FC) matrices and used those matrices to compute several graph theoretical measures. After determining that the simulated graph theoretical measures were largely consistent with experiments, we were able to quantify the differences between the graph metrics of the PF condition and those of the PV and DMS conditions. Thus, we show that we can use graph theoretical methods applied to simulated brain networks to aid in the quantification of changes in intrinsic brain functional connectivity during task execution. Our results represent a step towards establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-related brain activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStudies of resting-state conditions are popular in neuroimaging. Participants in resting-state studies are instructed to fixate on a neutral image or to close their eyes. This type of study has advantages over traditional task-based studies, including its ability to allow participation of those with difficulties performing tasks. Further, a resting-state neuroimaging study reveals intrinsic activity of participants brains. However, task-related brain activity may change this intrinsic activity, much as a stone thrown in a lake causes ripples on the waters surface. Can we measure those activity changes? To answer that question, we merged a computational model of visual short-term memory (task regions) with an anatomical model incorporating major connections between brain regions (non-task regions). In a computational model, unlike real data, we know how different regions are connected and which regions are doing the task. First, we simulated neuronal and neuroimaging activity of both task and non-task regions during three conditions: passive fixation (baseline), passive viewing, and visual short-term memory. Then, applying graph theory to the simulated neuroimaging of non-task regions, we computed differences between the baseline and the other conditions. Our results show that we can measure changes in non-task regions due to brain activity changes in task-related regions.",
