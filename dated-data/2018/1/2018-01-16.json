    "abstract": "Substantial research has investigated the association between intelligence and psychopathic traits. The findings to date have been inconsistent and have not always considered the multi-dimensional nature of psychopathic traits. Moreover, there has been a tendency to confuse psychopathy with other closely related, clinically significant disorders. The current study represents a meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the association of intelligence with global psychopathy, as well as its factors and facets, and related disorders (Antisocial Personality Disorder, Conduct Disorder, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder). Our analyses revealed a small, significant, negative relationship between intelligence and total psychopathy (r = -.07, p = .001). Analysis of factors and facets found differential associations, including both significant positive (e.g., interpersonal facet) and negative (e.g., affective facet) associations, further affirming that psychopathy is a multi-dimensional construct. Additionally, intelligence was negatively associated with Antisocial Personality Disorder (r = -.13, p = .001) and Conduct Disorder (r = -.11, p = .001), but positively with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (r = .06, p = .001). There was significant heterogeneity across studies for most effects, but the results of moderator analyses were inconsistent. Finally, bias analyses did not find significant evidence for publication bias or outsized effects of outliers.",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the decision to mate or invade relies on environmental cues that converge on a shared transcription factor, Ste12. Specificity toward invasion occurs via Ste12 binding cooperatively with the co-factor Tec1. Here, we characterize the in vitro binding preferences of Ste12 to identify a defined spacing and orientation of dimeric sites, one that is common in pheromone-regulated genes. We find that single amino acid changes in the DNA-binding domain of Ste12 can shift the preference of yeast toward either mating or invasion. These mutations define two distinct regions of this domain, suggesting alternative modes of DNA binding for each trait. Some exceptional Ste12 mutants promote hyperinvasion in a Tec1-independent manner; these fail to bind cooperative sites with Tec1 and bind to unusual dimeric Ste12 sites that contain one highly degenerate half site. We propose a model for how activation of invasion genes could have evolved with Ste12 alone.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) often work cooperatively, where the binding of one TF to DNA enhances the binding affinity of a second TF to a nearby location. Such cooperative binding is important for activating gene expression from promoters and enhancers in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Existing methods to detect cooperative binding of a TF pair rely on analyzing the sequence that is bound. We propose a method that uses, instead, only ChIP-seq peak intensities and an expectation maximization (CPI-EM) algorithm. We validate our method using ChIP-seq data from cells where one of a pair of TFs under consideration has been genetically knocked out. Our algorithm relies on our observation that cooperative TF-TF binding is correlated with weak binding of one of the TFs, which we demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus cells. We show that this method performs significantly better than a predictor based only on the ChIP-seq peak distance of the TFs under consideration. This suggests that peak intensities contain information that can help detect the cooperative binding of a TF pair. CPI-EM also outperforms an existing sequence-based algorithm in detecting cooperative binding. The CPI-EM algorithm is available at https://github.com/vishakad/cpi-em.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage lambda makes a decision between lysis and lysogeny based on the number of coinfecting phages, namely the multiplicity of infection (MoI): lysis at low MoIs; lysogeny at high MoIs. Here, by evaluating various rationally designed models on their ability a) to make the lytic decision at MoI of 1 and the lysogeny decision at MoI of 2, b) to exhibit bistability at both MoIs, and c) to perform accurately in the presence of noise, it is demonstrated that lambdas lysis/lysogeny decision is based on three features, namely a) mutual repression, b) cooperative positive autoregulation of CI, and c) cooperative binding of the activator protein, not basal expression, triggering positive autoregulatory loop of CI. Cro and CI are sufficient to acquire the first two features. CII is required to acquire the third feature. The quasi-minimal two-protein model for the switch is justified by showing its qualitative equivalence, except for Cro repression of pRM, to the lambdas gene regulatory network responsible for the decision. A three-protein simplified version of the lambdas switch is shown to possess all the three design features. Bistability at MoI of 1 is responsible for lysogen stability, whereas bistability at MoI of 2 imparts stability to lytic development post-infection and especially during prophage induction.",

    "abstract": "The goal of lineage tracing is to understand body formation over time by discovering which cells are the progeny of a specific, identified, ancestral progenitor. Subsidiary questions include unequivocal identification of what they have become, how many descendants develop, whether they live or die, and where they are located in the tissue or body at the end of the window examined. A classical approach in experimental embryology, lineage tracing continues to be used in developmental biology, stem cell and cancer research, wherever cellular potential and behavior need to be studied in multiple dimensions, of which one is time. Each technical approach has its advantages and drawbacks. This chapter, with some previously unpublished data, will concentrate non-exclusively on the use of interspecies chimeras to explore the origins of perivascular (or mural) cells, of which those adjacent to the vascular endothelium are termed pericytes for this purpose. These studies laid the groundwork for our understanding that pericytes derive from progenitor mesenchymal pools of multiple origins in the vertebrate embryo, some of which persist into adulthood. The results obtained through xenografting, like in the methodology described here, complement those obtained through genetic lineage tracing techniques within a given species.",

    "abstract": "PIF1 family helicases are conserved from bacteria to man. With the exception of the well-studied yeast PIF1 helicases (e.g., ScPif1 and ScRrm3), however, very little is known about how these enzymes help maintain genome stability. Indeed, we lack a basic understanding of the protein domains found N- and C-terminal to the characteristic central PIF1 helicase domain in these proteins. Here, using chimeric constructs, we show that the ScPif1 and ScRrm3 helicase domains are interchangeable and that the N-terminus of ScRrm3 is important for its function in vivo. This suggests that PIF1 family helicases evolved functional modules fused to a generic motor domain. To investigate this hypothesis, we characterized the biochemical activities of the PIF1 helicase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga elfii (TePif1), which contains a C-terminal WYL domain of unknown function. Like helicases from other thermophiles, recombinant TePif1 was easily prepared, thermostable in vitro, and displayed activities similar to its eukaryotic homologs. We also found that the WYL domain was necessary for high-affinity single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding and affected both ATPase and helicase activities. Deleting the WYL domain from TePif1 or mutating conserved residues in the predicted ssDNA binding site uncoupled ATPase activity and DNA unwinding, leading to higher rates of ATP hydrolysis but less efficient DNA helicase activity. Our findings suggest that the domains of unknown function found in eukaryotic PIF1 helicases may also confer functional specificity and additional activities to these enzymes, which should be investigated in future work.",

    "abstract": "Cospeciation studies aim at investigating whether hosts and symbionts speciate simultaneously or whether the associations diversify through host shifts. This problem is often tackled through reconciliation analyses that map the symbiont phylogeny onto the host phylogeny by mixing different types of diversification events. These reconciliations can be difficult to interpret and not always biologically realistic. Researchers have underlined that the biogeographic histories of both hosts and symbionts influence the probability of cospeciation and host switches, but up to now no reconciliation software integrates geographic data. We present a new functionality in the Mowgli software that bridges this gap. The user can provide geographic information on both the host and symbiont extant and ancestral taxa. Constraints in the reconciliation algorithm have been implemented to generate biologically realistic codiversification scenarios. We apply our method to the fig/fig wasp association and infer diversification scenarios that differ from reconciliations ignoring geographic information. In addition, we updated the reconciliation viewer SylvX in order to visualize ancestral character states on the phylogenetic trees and highlight zones that are geographically inconsistent in reconciliations computed without geographic constraints. We suggest that the comparison of reconciliations obtained with and without constraints can help solving ambiguities in the biogeographic histories of the partners. With the development of robust methods in historical biogeography and the advent of next-generation sequencing that leads to better-resolved trees, a geography aware reconciliation method represents a substantial advance that is likely to be useful to researchers studying the evolution of biotic interactions and biogeography.",

Our results revealed higher prevalence of piDNMs in the probands than in controls (P = 8.19x10-17), and piDNM-harboring genes were enriched for epigenetic modifications and neuronal or synaptic functions. Moreover, we identified 86 piDNM-containing genes forming convergent co-expression modules and intensive protein-protein interactions in at least two neuropsychiatric disorders. These cross-disorder genes carrying piDNMs could form interaction network centered on RNA binding proteins, suggesting a shared post-transcriptional etiology underlying these disorders. Our findings illustrate the significant contribution of piDNMs to four neuropsychiatric disorders, and lay emphasis on combining functional and network-based evidences to identify regulatory causes of genetic disorders.",

We assayed cfDNA isolated from 141 urine samples obtained from a cohort of 82 kidney transplant recipients by next-generation sequencing. We find that urinary cfDNA simultaneously informs about the composition of the bacterial and viral components of the microbiome, antimicrobial susceptibility, bacterial growth dynamics, kidney allograft injury, and the host response to infection. These different layers of information are accessible from a single assay and individually agree with corresponding clinical tests based on quantitative PCR, conventional bacterial culture, and urinalysis. In addition, cfDNA reveals the frequent occurrence of pathologies that remain undiagnosed in conventional diagnostic workups. Our work identifies urinary cfDNA as a highly versatile tool to monitor infections of the urinary tract.",

    "abstract": "Prestimulus subsequent memory effects (preSMEs) - differences in neural activity elicited by a task cue at encoding that are predictive of later memory performance - are thought to reflect differential engagement of preparatory processes that benefit episodic memory encoding. We investigated age differences in preSMEs indexed by differences in ERP amplitude just prior to the onset of a study item. Young and older adults incidentally encoded words for a subsequent memory test. Each study word was preceded by a task cue that signaled the judgment to perform on the word. Words were presented for either a short (300 ms) or a long (1000 ms) duration with the aim of placing differential benefits on engaging preparatory processes initiated by the task cue. ERPs associated with subsequent successful and unsuccessful recollection, operationalized here by source memory accuracy, were estimated time-locked to the onset of the task cue. In a late time-window (1000-2000 ms following onset of the cue), young adults demonstrated frontally distributed preSMEs for both the short and the long study durations, albeit with opposite polarities in the two conditions. This finding suggests that preSMEs in young adults are sensitive to perceived task demands. Although older adults showed no evidence of preSMEs in the same late time window, significant preSMEs were observed in an earlier time window (500-1000 ms) that were invariant with study duration. These results are broadly consistent with the proposal that older adults differ from their younger counterparts in how they engage preparatory processes during memory encoding.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for advances in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma (EWS), an aggressive childhood tumor with possible neuroectodermal origin. Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC) can revert aberrant epigenetic states and reduce growth in different experimental cancer types. Here, we investigated whether the potent HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate (NaB) has the ability to reprogram EWS cells towards a more differentiated state and affect their growth and survival. Exposure of two EWS cell lines to NaB resulted in rapid and potent inhibition of HDAC activity (1 h, IC50 1.5 mM) and a significant arrest of cell cycle progression (72 h, IC50 0.68-0.76 mM), marked by G0/G1 accumulation. Delayed cell proliferation and reduced colony formation ability were observed in EWS cells after long-term culture. NaB-induced effects included suppression of cell proliferation accompanied by reduced transcriptional expression of the EWS-FLI1 fusion oncogene, decreased expression of key survival and pluripotency-associated genes, and re-expression of the differentiation neuronal marker {superscript 2}III-tubulin. Finally, NaB reduced c-MYC levels and impaired survival in putative EWS cancer stem cells. Our findings support the use of HDAC inhibition as a strategy to impair cell growth and survival and to reprogram EWS tumors towards differentiation. These results are consistent with our previous studies indicating that HDis can inhibit the growth and modulate differentiation of cells from other types of childhood pediatric tumors possibly originating from neural stem cells.",

    "abstract": "AimPhylogeographic studies of temperate forest taxa often infer complex histories involving population subdivision into distinct refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, temperate forests may have been broadly distributed in southeastern North America during the LGM. We investigate genome-wide genetic structure in two widespread eastern North America tree species to determine if range expansion from a contiguous area or from genetically isolated refugia better explains the postglacial history of trees and forests from this region.\\n\\nLocationEastern North America (ENA).\\n\\nTaxaBitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis (Wangenh.) K.Koch) and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata (Mill.) K.Koch).\\n\\nMethodsGenetic diversity and differentiation indices were calculated from >1,000 nuclear SNP loci genotyped in ca. 180 individuals per species sampled across ENA. Genetic structure was investigated using principle component analysis and genetic clustering algorithms. As an additional tool for inference, areas of suitable habitat during the LGM were predicted using species distribution models (SDMs).\\n\\nResultsPopulations across all latitudes showed similar levels of genetic diversity. Most genetic variation was weakly differentiated across ENA, with the exception of an outlier population of Carya ovata in Texas. Genetic structure in each species exhibited an isolation-by-distance pattern. SDMs predicted high LGM habitat suitability over much of the southeastern United States.\\n\\nMain conclusionsBoth hickory species likely survived the LGM in a large region of continuous habitat and recolonized northern areas in a single expanding front that encountered few migration barriers. More complex scenarios, such as forest refugia, need not be invoked to explain genetic structure. The genetically distinct Texas population of Carya ovata could represent a separate glacial refugium, but other explanations are possible. Relative to that of other temperate forest regions, the phylogeographic history of ENA may have been exceptionally simple, involving a northward range shift but without well defined refugia.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila ether-a-go-go (eag) is the founding member of a large family of voltage-gated K+ channels, the KCNH family, which includes Kv10, 11 and 12, (Ganetzky et al. 1999). Concurrent binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to N-and C-terminal sites inhibits mammalian EAG1 channels at sub-micromolar Ca2+ concentrations (Schonherr et al. 2000), likely by causing pore constriction (Whicher and MacKinnon 2016). Although the Drosophila EAG channel was believed to be Ca2+-insensitive (Schonherr et al. 2000), both the N-and C-terminal sites are conserved. Here we show that Drosophila EAG is inhibited by high Ca2+ concentrations that are only present at plasma membrane Ca2+ channel microdomains. To test the role of this regulation in vivo, we engineered mutations that block CaM-binding to the major C-terminal site of the endogenous eag locus, disrupting Ca2+-dependent inhibition. eag CaMBD mutants have reduced evoked release from larval motor neuron presynaptic terminals and show decreased Ca2+ influx in stimulated adult projection neuron presynaptic terminals, consistent with an increase in K+ conductance. These results are predicted by a conductance-based multi-compartment model of the presynaptic terminal in which some fraction of EAG is localized to the Ca2+ channel microdomains that control neurotransmitter release. The reduction of release in the larval neuromuscular junction drives a compensatory increase in motor neuron somatic excitability. This misregulation of synaptic and somatic excitability has consequences for systems-level processes and leads to defects in associative memory formation in adults.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyRegulation of excitability is critical to tuning the nervous system for complex behaviors. We demonstrate here that the EAG family of voltage-gated K+ channels exhibit conserved gating by Ca2+/CaM. Disruption of this inhibition in Drosophila results in decreased evoked neurotransmitter release due to truncated Ca2+ influx in presynaptic terminals. In adults, disrupted Ca2+ dynamics cripples memory formation. These data demonstrate that the biophysical details of channels have important implications for cell function and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Recently we demonstrated that closed chromatin composed of Polycomb proteins and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation impedes CRISPR-mediated genome editing by blocking the accessibility of chromosomal DNA to spCas9/sgRNA. Editing efficiencies were higher in cells where the same reporter locus had not been repressed, thus we presume that silenced chromatin can be modified to generate a Cas9-accessible state. To test this idea, we exposed the locus to antagonists of Polycomb silencing: Gal4-p65, a targeted transcriptional activator, and UNC1999, a chemical inhibitor of the histone H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2. For both we observed loss of histone trimethylation. Only Gal4-p65 treatment increased target gene expression. Initial Gal4-p65 overexpression impedes Cas9 activity, while a 9-day recovery period leads to enhanced Cas9 efficiency up to 1000 bp from the Gal4 binding site. No enhancement was observed with UNC1999. These results demonstrate the strong influence of transcription-driven chromatin remodeling on CRISPR editing at closed chromatin.",

Currently, little is known about the principles dictating cell decision-making.

This is translated into a free-energy principle and I develop a statistical mechanics theory for cell decision-making. I exhibit the potential of LEUP in the case of cell migration. In particular, I calculate the dependence of cell locomotion force on the steady state distribution of adhesion receptors.

    "abstract": "Division of labour is a hallmark of eusocial insect colonies, with different groups of workers engaged in different tasks at the same time. Foraging is a task done by older workers in honey bee colonies. Foragers use the waggle dance behaviour to inform and recruit nest mates to food sources in the environment. The recruitment process incorporates information about the food reward, the colony food stores and the environmental food availability and plays a major role in ensuring efficient exploitation of the food sources available to the colony. However, the role that individual foragers play in driving recruitment is largely unexplored. We observed the dance activity of individual foragers from the same foraging group and showed that there are consistent inter-individual differences within a foraging group leading to a division of labour in the recruitment activity. Next, we studied the effect of changing social interactions on these individual differences. Removing foragers from the group led to an increase in the dance activity of the group of remaining foragers. This was mainly driven by an increase in the dance activity of certain individuals within the foraging groups. In contrast, allowing recruits to join the foraging group had a strong negative effect on the dance activity of all the individual foragers. Our study shows that there is a fine scale division of labour in the recruitment activity within foraging groups and that this is further regulated by changing social interactions. Thus, a complex interplay between individual differences and social interactions drive recruitment activity in honey bees.",

The point of the 2013 paper is that when there are three or more strategies the ordering can change as selection is increased. Wu et al [10] did numerical computations for fixed N. Here, we will instead let the strength of selection {beta} = c/N and let N [-&gt;] {infty} to obtain formulas for the invadability probabilities{phi} ij that determine the rankings. These formulas, which are integrals on [0, 1], are intractable calculus problems but can be easily evaluated numerically. Here, we concentrate on simple formulas for the ranking order when c is small or c is large. The results we have obtained for five concrete examples lead us to doubt the accuracy of insights that are derived in the small mutation limit for games with three strategies.",

    "abstract": "To infer brain source activation patterns under different cognitive tasks is an integral step to understand how our brain works. Traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) Source Imaging (ESI) methods usually do not distinguish task-related and spurious non-task-related sources that jointly generate EEG signals, which inevitably yield misleading reconstructed activation patterns. In this research, we argue that the task-related source signal intrinsically has a low-rank property, which is exploited to to infer the true task-related EEG sources location. Although the true task-related source signal is sparse and low-rank, the contribution of spurious sources scattering over the source space with intermittent activation patterns makes the actual source space lose the low-rank property. To reconstruct a low-rank true source, we propose a novel ESI model that involves a spatial low-rank representation and a temporal Laplacian graph regularization, the latter of which guarantees the temporal smoothness of the source signal and eliminate the spurious ones. To solve the proposed model, an augmented Lagrangian objective function is formulated and an algorithm in the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy with high effciency.",

Here we introduce an efficient way to produce three major blood cell types using a standardized differentiation protocol that starts with a single hematopoietic initiation step. This system is feeder-free, avoids EB-formation, starts with a hematopoietic initiation step based on a novel single cell-derived iPSC colony differentiation and produces multi-potential progenitors within 8-10 days. Followed by lineage-specific growth factor supplementation these cells can be matured into well characterized erythroid, megakaryoid and myeloid cells with high-purity, without transcription factor overexpression or any kind of pre-purification step. This standardized differentiation system provides a simple platform to produce specific blood cells in a reproducible manner for hematopoietic development studies, disease modelling, drug testing and the potential for future therapeutic applications.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIEfficient hematopoietic differentiation from single cell-derived iPSC colonies\\nC_LIO_LIReproducible feeder-free, monolayer differentiation system independent of iPSC line\\nC_LIO_LIProduction of erythroid, megakaryoid and myeloid cells with high-purity\\nC_LIO_LIPlatform for hematopoietic developmental research and future clinical application\\nC_LI",

We here developed a method, SECRiFY, to simultaneously assess the secretability of >105 protein fragments by two yeast species, S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris, using custom fragment libraries, surface display and a sequencing-based readout. Screening human proteome fragments with a median size of 50 - 100 amino acids, we generated datasets that enable datamining into protein features underlying secretability, revealing a striking role for intrinsic disorder and chain flexibility. SECRiFY is the first methodology that generates sufficient amounts of annotated data for advanced machine learning methods to deduce secretability predictors. The finding that secretability is indeed a learnable feature of protein sequences is of significant impact in the broad area of recombinant protein expression and de novo protein design.",

Antibiotics, when used appropriately, are effective; however, their overuse and misuse has led to the rise of antibiotic resistance worldwide. Thus, there are renewed efforts into the development of phage therapy. Due to the drawbacks of EPEC in vivo models, a surrogate is the mouse-restricted gut pathgoen Citrobacter rodentium. In this study, two new phages CrRp3 and CrRp10, which infect C. rodentium, were isolated and characterized. CrRp3 was found to be a new species within the genus Vectrevirus and CrRp10 is a new strain within the genus Tequatrovirus. Neither phage carries known genes associated with bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance, or lysogeny. CrRp3 and CrRp10 appear to have independently evolved from E. coli phages. CrRp3 appears to be the more  potent being 24x more likely to find a host cell and has a shorter lytic cycle, while CrRp10 at MOI 0.001 was able to maintain bacterial density below the limit of detection after 18 h. We found that hypoxia (5% O2 and 5% CO2) inhibited CrRp3 ability to reverse exponential bacterial growth. It is unclear whether the subtle characteristic differences between CrRp3 and CrRp10 will influence treatment efficacy in future phage therapy in vivo investigations.",

Circovirus sequences are frequently recovered in metagenomic investigations, indicating that these viruses are widespread, yet they remain relatively poorly understood. Endogenous circoviral elements (CVe) are DNA sequences derived from circoviruses that occur in vertebrate genomes. CVe can provide unique, retrospective information about the biology and evolution of circoviruses. In this study, we screened 362 vertebrate genome assemblies in silico to generate a catalog of CVe loci. We identified a total of 179 CVe sequences, most of which have not been reported previously. We show that these CVe loci reflect at least 19 distinct germline integration events. We determine the structure of CVe loci, identifying some that show evidence of potential functionalization. We also identify orthologous copies of CVe in snakes, fish, birds, and mammals, allowing us to add new calibrations to the timeline of circovirus evolution. Finally, we observed that some ancient CVe group robustly with contemporary circoviruses in phylogenies, with all sequences within these groups being derived from the same host class or order, implying a hitherto underappreciated stability in circovirus-host relationships. The openly available dataset constructed in this investigation provides new insights into circovirus evolution, and can be used to facilitate further studies of circoviruses and CVe.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Mutant allele frequency distributions in cancer samples have been used to estimate intratumoral heterogeneity and its implications for patient survival. However, mutation calls are sensitive to the calling algorithm. It remains unknown whether the relationship of heterogeneity and clinical outcome is robust to these variations. To resolve this question, we studied the robustness of allele frequency distributions to the mutation callers MuTect, SomaticSniper, and VarScan in 4722 cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We observed discrepancies among the results, particularly a pronounced difference between allele frequency distributions called by VarScan and SomaticSniper. Survival analysis showed little robust predictive power for heterogeneity as measured by Mutant-Allele Tumor Heterogeneity (MATH) score, with the exception of uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. However, we found that variations in mutant allele frequencies were mediated by variations in copy number. Our results indicate that the clinical predictions associated with MATH score are primarily caused by copy number aberrations that alter mutant allele frequencies. Finally, we present a mathematical model of linear tumor evolution demonstrating why MATH score is insufficient for distinguishing different scenarios of tumor growth. Our findings elucidate the importance of allele frequency distributions as a measure for tumor heterogeneity and their prognostic role.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly  simplify a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulations entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySexually reproducing organisms are related to the others in their species by the complex web of parent-offspring relationships that constitute the pedigree. In this paper, we describe a way to record all of these relationships, as well as how genetic material is passed down through the pedigree, during a forwards-time population genetic simulation. To make effective use of this information, we describe both efficient storage methods for this embellished pedigree as well as a way to remove all information that is irrelevant to the genetic history of a given set of individuals, which dramatically reduces the required amount of storage space. Storing this information allows us to produce whole-genome sequence from simulations of large populations in which we have not explicitly recorded new genomic mutations; we find that this results in computational run times of up to 50 times faster than simulations forced to explicitly carry along that information.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive disease, affecting children and adults. Treatments1-6 show high response rates but have debilitating effects and carry risk of relapse5,7,8. Previous work implicated NOTCH1 and other oncogenes1,2,9-20. However, direct inhibition of these pathways affects healthy tissues and cancer alike. Here, we demonstrate that ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7)21-32 controls leukemia growth by stabilizing the levels of the NOTCH1 and JMJD3 demethylase. USP7 is overexpressed T-ALL and is transcriptionally regulated by NOTCH1. In turn, USP7 controls NOTCH1 through deubiquitination. USP7 is bound to oncogenic targets and controls gene expression through H2B ubiquitination and H3K27me3 changes via stabilization of NOTCH1 and JMJD3. We also show that USP7 and NOTCH1 bind T-ALL superenhancers, and USP7 inhibition alters associated gene activity. These results provide a new model for deubiquitinase activity through recruitment to oncogenic chromatin loci and regulation of both oncogenic transcription factors and chromatin marks to promote leukemia. USP7 inhibition33 significantly blocked T-ALL cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our studies also show that USP7 is upregulated in the aggressive high-risk cases of T-ALL and suggest that USP7 expression might be a prognostic marker in ALL and its inhibition could be a therapeutic tool against aggressive leukemia.",

Recreational vessels are recognised as an important vector of non-indigenous species translocation, particularly the secondary translocation of species domestically.\\n\\nThis paper reports on a novel application of multilevel modelling and multiple imputation to biomass samples gathered from the hull and other external surfaces of recreational yachts and fishing vessels in order to quantify the relationship between the wet biomass of biofouling and vessel-level characteristics. Unsurprisingly, we find that the number of days since the vessel was last cleaned was strongly related to the wet weight of biomass. The number of days since the vessel was last used was also related to the wet weight of biomass, yet differed depending on the vessel type. Similarly, the median number of trips undertaken by the vessel was related to the wet weight of biomass, and varied according to the type of antifouling paint used by the vessel. The relationship between vessel size, as measured by hull surface area, and wet weight biomass per sample unit area was not significant.\\n\\nIn order to reduce the international and domestic spread of invasive species, small vessel owners should use an appropriate type of antifouling paint that suits their vessels operational profile, and be encouraged to maintain a maintenance",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are widely used to treat infections in humans. However, the impact of antibiotic use on host cells is understudied. We have identified a novel antiviral effect of commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotics. We show that mucosal application of aminoglycosides increased host resistance to a broad range of viral infections including herpes simplex viruses, influenza A virus and Zika virus. Aminoglycoside treatment also reduced viral replication in primary human cells. This antiviral activity was independent of the microbiota as aminoglycoside treatment protected germ-free mice. Microarray analysis uncovered a marked upregulation of transcripts for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following aminoglycoside application. ISG induction was mediated by TLR3, and required TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-{beta} (TRIF), signaling adaptor, and interferon regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, transcription factors that promote ISG expression. XCR1+ dendritic cells, which uniquely express TLR3, were recruited to the vaginal mucosa upon aminoglycoside treatment and were required for ISG induction. These results highlight an unexpected ability of aminoglycoside antibiotics to confer broad antiviral resistance in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate decoding methods applied to neuroimaging data have become the standard in cognitive neuroscience for unravelling statistical dependencies between brain activation patterns and experimental conditions. The current challenge is to demonstrate that information decoded as such by the experimenter is in fact used by the brain itself to guide behaviour. Here we demonstrate a promising approach to do so in the context of neural activation during object perception and categorisation behaviour. We first localised decodable information about visual objects in the human brain using a spatially-unbiased multivariate decoding analysis. We then related brain activation patterns to behaviour using a machine-learning based extension of signal detection theory. We show that while there is decodable information about visual category throughout the visual brain, only a subset of those representations predicted categorisation behaviour, located mainly in anterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of neuroimaging studies, highlight the importance of relating decoding results to behaviour, and suggest a suitable methodology towards this aim.",

The original implementation of the Potjans-Diesmann model was based on the NEST simulator and our goal here was to re-implement the model in the Brian 2 simulator and obtain the same results presented in the reference article. We did not replicate analyses that involve changes in the network structure. Our replicated network model presents activity dynamic patterns very similar to the ones observed in the original model, with comparisons made in terms of firing rates and synchrony and irregularity measures. In conclusion, the Potjans-Diesmann model was successfully replicated in a different platform than the one in which it was originally implemented.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders. The etiology of ET remains largely unexplained. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is likely to be of value in understanding a large proportion of ET with Mendelian and complex disease inheritance patterns. In ET families with Mendelian inheritance patterns, WGS may lead to gene identification where WES analysis failed to identify the causative variant due to incomplete coverage of the entire coding region of the genome. Alternatively, in ET families with complex disease inheritance patterns with gene x gene and gene x environment interactions enrichment of functional rare coding and non-coding variants may explain the heritability of ET. We performed WGS in eight ET families (n=40 individuals) enrolled in the Family Study of Essential Tremor. The analysis included filtering WGS data based on allele frequency in population databases, rare variant classification and association testing using the Mixed-Model Kernel Based Adaptive Cluster (MM-KBAC) test and prioritization of candidate genes identified within families using phenolyzer. WGS analysis identified candidate genes for ET in 5/8 (62.5%) of the families analyzed. WES analysis in a subset of these families in our previously published study failed to identify candidate genes. In one family, we identified a deleterious and damaging variant (c.1367G>A, p.(Arg456Gln)) in the candidate gene, CACNA1G, which encodes the pore forming subunit of T-type Ca(2+) channels, CaV3.1, and is expressed in various motor pathways and has been previously implicated in neuronal autorhythmicity and ET. Other candidate genes identified include SLIT3 (family D), which encodes an axon guidance molecule and in three families, phenolyzer prioritized genes that are associated with hereditary neuropathies (family A, KARS, family B, KIF5A and family F, NTRK1). This work has identified candidate genes and pathways for ET that can now be prioritized for functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is a fundamental feature of sexual reproduction, ensuring proper disjunction, preventing mutation accumulation and generating new allelic combinations upon which selection can act. However it is also mutagenic, and breaks up favourable allelic combinations previously built up by selection. Identifying the genetic drivers of recombination rate variation is a key step in understanding the causes and consequences of this variation, how lociassociated with recombination are evolving and how they affect the potential of a population to respond to selection. However, to date, few studies have examined the genetic architecture of recombination rate variation in natural populations. Here, we use pedigree data from -2,600 individuals genotyped at -38,000 SNPs to investigate the genetic architecture of individual autosomal recombination rate in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). Female red deer exhibited a higher mean and phenotypic variance in autosomal crossover counts (ACC). Animal models fitting genomic relatedness matrices showed that ACC was heritable in females (h2 = 0.12) but not in males. A regional heritability mapping approach showed that almost all heritable variation in female ACC was explained by a genomic region on deer linkage group 12 containing the candidate loci REC8 and RNF212B, with an additional region on linkage group 32 containing TOP2B approaching genome-wide significance. The REC8/RNF212B region and its paralogue RNF212 have been associated with recombination in cattle, mice, humans and sheep. Our findings suggest that mammalian recombination rates have a relatively conserved genetic architecture in both domesticated and wild systems, and provide a foundation for understanding the association between recombination lociand individual fitness within this population.",

    "abstract": "As humans age, their affective lives tend to become more positive and less negative. This phenomenon, known as the positivity effect (or positivity bias), occurs even as aging leads to declines in health and cognitive outcomes. Despite these well documented effects in humans, extent to which affective processes change in nonhuman animals, and in particular nonhuman primates - is unclear. As a first step towards developing a model for human affective aging in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we tested aged, surgically menopausal aged and middle-aged gonadally intact female rhesus monkeys on a classic index of affective reactivity in monkeys, the Human Intruder task. The Human Intruder task evaluates behavioral responses to varying levels of threat. Aged, surgically menopausal monkeys received hormone replacement therapy consisting of a cyclic estradiol regimen, or vehicle injections as a control. Average responsivity to threat did not vary by condition, but middle aged monkeys and aged monkeys on estradiol were more reactive to the most potent level of threat than to a moderate level of threat, replicating previously published results in other age groups and male monkeys. In contrast, aged monkeys not on estradiol did not show such calibration to threat level. These findings suggest that estrogen may be important for maintaining more youthful affective responding. They also illustrate the utility of behavioral assays of affective reactivity in nonhuman primate models of cognitive and reproductive aging in humans.",

There were no rare germline alleles or somatic mutations affecting proof-reading polymerase genes POLE or POLD1, however there was a predicted damaging mutation in the error prone replicative polymerase, POLK. The patients diagnostic leukemia transcriptome was depleted of rare and low-frequency germline alleles due to loss-of-heterozygosity, while somatic point mutations targeted low-frequency and common human alleles in proportions that offset this discrepancy.

    "abstract": "In the study of multi-host parasites, it is often found that host species contribute asymmetrically to parasite transmission, with cascading effects on parasite dynamics and overall community structure. Yet, identifying which of the host species contribute to parasite transmission and maintenance is a recurring challenge. Here, we approach this issue by taking advantage of natural variation in the community composition of host species. We studied the horizontally transmitted microsporidians Anostracospora rigaudi and Enterocytospora artemiae in a Southern French metacommunity of their brine shrimp hosts, Artemia franciscana and Artemia parthenogenetica. Within the metacommunity, patches can contain either or both of the Artemia host species, so that long-term prevalence data can provide a direct link between the presence of the two host species and the persistence of the two parasites. First, we show that the microsporidian A. rigaudi is a spillover parasite: it was unable to persist in the absence of its maintenance host A. parthenogenetica. This result was particularly striking in light of A. rigaudis high prevalence (in the field) and high infectivity (when tested in the lab) in both hosts. Moreover, A. parthenogeneticas seasonal presence imposed seasonality on the rate of spillover, causing cyclical pseudo-endemics in the spillover host A. franciscana. Second, while our prevalence data was sufficient to identify E. artemiae as either a spillover or a facultative multi-host parasite, we could not distinguish between the two possibilities. This study supports the importance of studying the community context of multi-host parasites, and demonstrates that in appropriate multi-host systems, sampling across a range of conditions and host communities can lead to clear conclusions about the drivers of parasite persistence.",

Computational cell identities are then used in downstream analysis, feature selection, and visualization. However, how can we examine if cell identities are accurately inferred? To this end, we introduce non-parametric methods to evaluate cell identities by testing cluster memberships of single cell samples in an unsupervised manner. We propose posterior inclusion probabilities for cluster memberships to select and visualize samples relevant to subpopulations. Beyond simulation studies, we examined two scRNA-seq data - a mixture of Jurkat and 293T cells and a large family of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrated probabilistic feature selection and improved t-SNE visualization. By learning uncertainty in clustering, the proposed methods enable rigorous testing of cell identities in scRNA-seq.",

As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (A{beta}42), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimers disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Despite inter-individual differences in cortical structure, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated a large degree of population-level consistency in age-related differences in brain morphology. The present study assessed how accurately an individual's age could be predicted by estimates of cortical morphology, comparing a variety of structural measures, including thickness, gyrification, and fractal dimensionality. Structural measures were calculated across up to seven different parcellation approaches, ranging from 1 region to 1000 regions. The age-prediction framework was trained using morphological measures obtained from T1-weighted MRI volumes collected from multiple sites, yielding a training dataset of 1056 healthy adults, aged 18-97. Age predictions were calculated using a machine-learning approach that incorporated non-linear differences over the lifespan. In two independent, held-out test samples, age predictions had a median error of 6-7 years. Age predictions were best when using a combination of cortical metrics, both thickness and fractal dimensionality. Overall, the results reveal that age-related differences in brain structure are systematic enough to enable reliable age prediction based on metrics of cortical morphology.",

    "abstract": "Amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) has been recently proposed as a possible solution to overcome the pronounced stimulation artifact encountered when recording brain activity during tACS. In theory, AM-tACS does not entail power at its modulating frequency, thus avoiding the problem of spectral overlap between brain signal of interest and stimulation artifact. However, the current study demonstrates how weak non-linear transfer characteristics inherent in stimulation and recording hardware can reintroduce spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency. The input-output transfer functions (TFs) of different stimulation setups were measured. The setups included basic recordings of signal-generator and stimulator outputs as well as M/EEG phantom measurements. 6th-degree polynomial regression models were fitted to model the input-output TFs of each setup. The resulting TF models were applied to digitally generated AM-tACS signals to predict the location of spurious artifacts in the spectrum. All four setups measured for the study exhibited low-frequency artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics when recording AM-tACS. Fitted TF models showed non-linear contributions significantly different from zero (all p < .05) and successfully predicted the frequency of artifacts observed in AM-signal recordings. Results suggest that even weak non-linearities of stimulation and recording hardware can lead to spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics. Thus, findings emphasize the need for more linear stimulation devices for AM-tACS and careful analysis procedures, which take into account these low-frequency artifacts to avoid confusion with effects of AM-tACS on the brain.",

    "abstract": "Several biochemical species are in organisms controlled in a pairwise manner i.e., two different species (e.g., hormone, enzyme, transporter protein) work to control the concentration of a third chemical species. Such pairs are often antagonistic, meaning that one of the controller species acts to increase whereas the other controller species acts to decrease the amount of the controlled species. How antagonistic systems interact to achieve regulation and to avoid competing against each other is not fully understood. An issue is how two antagonistic hormones can agree upon one common setpoint. We present here a new type of antagonistic regulatory system that has a single unique setpoint inherently defined by the system. The regulatory system controls the concentration of a chemical species with both integral and double integral action, achieving tight control. We show by the use of an analytical stability analysis, using the principle of vanishing perturbations, that the setpoint is asymptotically stable. Finally the prospect of treating the presented system as a part of a larger family of antagonistic regulatory systems with unique setpoints, integral and double integral action is discussed.",

MaREA finally allows to visualize the results in a graphical form directly on metabolic maps.

    "abstract": "Mounting an effective immune response against cancer requires the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells. Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Immunotherapies that boost the activity of effector T cells have shown a remarkable success in melanoma treatment. Patients, however, can develop resistance to such therapies by mechanisms that include the establishment of an immune suppressive tumour microenvironment. Understanding how metastatic melanoma cells suppress the immune system is vital to develop effective immunotherapies against this disease. In this study, we find that the innate immune cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are suppressed in metastatic melanoma. The Ig-CDR-based peptide C36L1 is able to restore macrophages and dendritic cells immunogenic functions and to inhibit metastatic growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that C36L1 interferes with the MIF-CD74 tumour-innate immune cells immunosuppressive signalling pathway and thereby restores an effective anti-tumour immune response. C36L1 directly binds to CD74 on macrophages and dendritic cells, disturbing CD74 structural dynamics and inhibiting MIF signalling through CD74. Our findings suggest that interfering with MIF-CD74 immunosuppressive signalling in macrophages and dendritic cells using peptide-based immunotherapy can restore the anti-tumour immune response in metastatic melanoma. Our study provides the rationale for further development of peptide-based therapies to restore the anti-tumour immune response.",

Activated downstream of pathogen recognition receptors, they regulate the expression of genes to help fighting infections as well as recruiting the adaptive immune system. NF-kB responds to a wide variety of signals, but the processes by which stimulus-specificity is attained remain unclear. Here, we characterized the response of one NF-kB member, RELA, to four stimuli mimicking infection in human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Comparing genome-wide RELA binding, we observed stimulus-specific sites, although most sites overlapped across stimuli. Specifically, the response to Poly I:C - mimicking viral dsRNA and signalling through TLR3 - induced a distinct RELA profile, binding in the vicinity of antiviral genes and correlating with corresponding gene expression. This group of binding sites was also enriched in Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) motifs and showed overlapping with IRFs binding sites. A novel NF-kB target, OASL was further validated and showed TLR3-specific activation. This work showed that some RELA DNA binding sites varied in activation response following different stimulations and that interaction with more specialized factors could help achieve this stimulus-specific activity. Our data provide a genomic view of regulated host response to different pathogen stimuli.",

Combining clarified IVT lysate with a click beetle luciferase reporter gene fused to untranslated regions of Pf histidine-rich proteins (hrp)-2 and 3, the HTP IVT assay accurately reports protein translation in a 384-well plate format using a standard spectrofluorometer. We validate the assay as effective in detecting compounds targeting the ribosome, ribosome co-factors (elongation factor 2) and cytosolic tRNA synthetases as well as its ability to find translation inhibitors in a blind screen using a high-density assay format amenable for high throughput. This demonstrates an ability to reconstitute the breadth of the parasite eukaryotic protein translation machinery in vitro and use it as a powerful platform for antimalarial drug discovery.",

Here, we show that NF2 is also regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) through interaction with evolutionarily conserved miRNA response elements (MREs) within its 3-untranslated region (3 UTR). Dual luciferase assays in HCT116 and A549 show downregulation of wild type NF2 by miR-92a via its 3UTR but not NF2-3UTR with mutated MRE. HCT116 cells transfected with miR-92a show significant downregulation of endogenous NF2 mRNA and protein levels, which were rescued by co-transfection of a target protector oligonucelotide specific for the miR-92a binding site within NF2-3UTR. MiR-92a overexpression in HCT116 and A549 resulted in increased migration and proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and altered F-actin organization compared to controls.

FAPs are currently identified using cell surface markers that do not distinguish between quiescent FAPs and FAPs actively engaged in the regenerative process. We have shown previously that FAPs are derived from cells that express the transcription factor Osr1 during development. Here we show that adult FAPs express Osr1 at low levels and frequency, however upon acute injury FAPs reactivate Osr1 expression in the injured tissue. Osr1+ FAPs are enriched in proliferating and apoptotic cells demonstrating that Osr1 identifies activated FAPs. In vivo genetic lineage tracing shows that Osr1+ activated FAPs return to the resident FAP pool after regeneration as well as contribute to adipocytes after glycerol-induced fatty degeneration.

    "abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, an evolutionarily conserved motif present in all eukaryotic cells, is involved in coordinating critical cell-fate decisions, regulating protein synthesis, and mediating learning and memory. While the steady-state behavior of the pathway stimulated by a time-invariant signal is relatively well-understood, we show using a computational model that it exhibits a rich repertoire of transient adaptive responses to changes in stimuli. When the signal is switched on, the response is characterized by long-lived modulations in frequency as well as amplitude. On withdrawing the stimulus, the activity decays over timescales much longer than that of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes, exhibiting reverberations characterized by repeated spiking in the activated MAPK concentration. The long-term persistence of such post-stimulus activity suggests that the cascade retains memory of the signal for a significant duration following its removal, even in the absence of any explicit feedback or cross-talk with other pathways. We find that the molecular mechanism underlying this behavior is related to the existence of distinct relaxation rates for the different cascade components. This results in the imbalance of fluxes between different layers of the cascade, with the repeated reuse of activated kinases as enzymes when they are released from sequestration in complexes leading to one or more spike events following the removal of the stimulus. The persistent adaptive response reported here, indicative of a cellular \\\"short-term\\\" memory, suggests that this ubiquitous signaling pathway plays an even more central role in information processing by eukaryotic cells.",

Apart from the end, the microtubule shaft is not considered to be dynamic. However recent evidence suggests that free dimers can be incorporated into the shaft of a microtubule damaged by mechanical stress. Here we explored whether dimer exchange was a core property of the microtubule lattice independently of any external constraint. We found that dimers can be removed from and incorporated into the lattice at sites along the microtubule shaft. Furthermore, we showed by experiment and by modeling that rapid dimer renewal requires structural defects in the lattice, which occur in fast growing microtubules. Hence long-lived microtubules have the capacity to self-renew despite their apparent stability and thereby can potentially regulate signaling pathways and structural rearrangements associated with tubulin-dimer exchange at sites along their entire length.",

    "abstract": "2.3.1The mammary gland is a complex organ, structured in a ramified epithelium supported by the stroma. The epitheliums functional unit is the bilayered acinus, made of a layer of luminal cells surrounded by a layer of basal cells mainly composed of myoepithelial cells. The aim of this study was to develop a reproducible and manipulable three-dimensional co-culture model of the bilayered acinus in vitro to study the interactions between the two layers. Two different combinations of cell lines were co-cultured in Matrigel: SCp2 and SCg6 mice cells, or MCF-12A and Hs 578Bst human cell lines. Cell ratios and Matrigel concentration were optimized. The resulting acini were analysed by confocal microscopy using epithelial (E-cadherin) and myoepithelial (-smooth muscle actin) markers. SCp2 and SCg6 cells formed distinct three-dimensional structures, whereas MCF-12A and Hs 578Bst cells formed some bilayered acini. This in vitro bilayered acini model will allow us to understand the role of interactions between luminal and myoepithelial cells in the normal breast development.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent multifactorial disease of women in their reproductive years characterized by a shift from the Lactobacillus spp. dominated microbial community towards a taxonomically diverse anaerobic community. For unknown reasons, some women do not respond to therapy. In our recent clinical study, out of 37 women diagnosed with BV, 31 were successfully treated with metronidazole, while 6 still had BV after treatment. To discover possible reasons for the lack of response in those patients, we performed a metatranscriptome analysis of their vaginal microbiota, comparing them to patients who responded. Seven out of 8 Cas genes of Gardnerella vaginalis were highly up-regulated in non-responding patients. Cas genes, in addition to protecting against phages, might be involved in DNA repair thus mitigating the bactericidal effect of DNA damaging agents like metronidazole. In the second part of our study, we analyzed the vaginal metatranscriptomes of four patients over three months and showed high in vivo expression of genes for pore-forming toxins in L. iners and of genes encoding enzymes for the production of hydrogen peroxide and D-lactate in L. crispatus.",

    "abstract": "Communication between brain regions is thought to be facilitated by the synchronization of oscillatory activity. Hence, large-scale functional networks within the brain may be estimated by measuring synchronicity between regions. Neurophysiological recordings, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), provide a direct measure of oscillatory neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution. In this paper, we describe a full data analysis pipeline for functional connectivity analysis based on dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) of MEG data. DICS is a beamforming technique in the frequency-domain that enables the study of the cortical sources of oscillatory activity and synchronization between brain regions. All the analysis steps, starting from the raw MEG data up to publication-ready group-level statistics and visualization, are discussed in depth, including methodological considerations, rules of thumb and tradeoffs. We start by computing cross-spectral density (CSD) matrices using a wavelet approach in several frequency bands (alpha, theta, beta, gamma). We then provide a way to create comparable source spaces across subjects and discuss the cortical mapping of spectral power. For connectivity analysis, we present a canonical computation of coherence that facilitates a stable estimation of all-to-all connectivity. Finally, we use group-level statistics to limit the network to cortical regions for which significant differences between experimental conditions are detected and produce vertex-and parcel-level visualizations of the different brain networks. Code examples using the MNE-Python package are provided at each step, guiding the reader through a complete analysis of the freely available openfMRI ds000117 \\\"familiar vs. unfamiliar vs. scrambled faces\\\" dataset. The goal is to educate both novice and experienced data analysts with the \\\"tricks of the trade\\\" necessary to successfully perform this type of analysis on their own data.",

    "abstract": "A recent policy change at Journal of Neuroscience (JN) has significantly increased editorial \\\"desk rejections\\\", reducing the number of papers that are considered for publication. Survey results from 130 scientists suggested that the new policy may have had a particularly large impact on studies that focused on human behavioral techniques. To quantify the effects of the new policy, we gathered data on all papers ever published in JN (~35,000), as well as all papers that had cited the JN papers (~2.7 million papers). We found that the recent change in editorial policy had disproportionately affected rejection rates of human behavioral papers: since 2015, the number of human behavioral papers as a proportion of all papers published in JN has seen a 30% decline. While there has been a long-term declining trend in the journals impact factor, we found that this declining impact factor was shared by both human behavioral papers as well as other papers in the journal. This suggested that whatever may have been the source of the declining impact factor at JN, this source was affecting the various areas of research equally. That is, it was unlikely that papers in any one field were responsible for the declining impact factor number at JN. Indeed, when impact was measured over the long-term, we found that the average human behavioral paper at JN consistently outperformed other papers, generating a significantly higher number of citations per year at 5 and 10 years post publication.",

    "abstract": "Distance determination in proteins and biomolecules using pulsed EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) techniques is becoming an increasingly popular and accessible technique. PELDOR (pulsed electron-electron double resonance), is a technique designed for distance determination over a nanoscopic scale. Here, ferric binding protein (Fbp) is used to demonstrate the practicability of this technique to Cu (II) Metalloproteins. PELDOR is usually applied to bi-radicals or endogenous radicals, and distance determination using pulsed EPR of metal containing centres in biomolecules has been restricted to relaxation experiments. PELDOR distance measurements between a Cu (II) ion and a nitroxide have previously only been reported for model compounds [1, 2].\\n\\nFbp as the name suggests usually, contains a Fe (III) ion centre. For the purposes of this investigation the Fe (III) ion was removed and replaced by a Cu (II) ion, after a nitroxide spin-label was added to the Fbp using of site directed spin-labelling (SDSL). PELDOR was then applied to measure the distance between the two centres.\\n\\nSimulation methods were then employed to fully investigate these data and allow a quantitative interpretation of the copper nitroxide PELDOR data. The observed PELDOR time traces were analysed using DEER analysis[3].",

    "abstract": "O_LICities support unique and valuable ecological communities, but understanding urban wildlife is limited due to the difficulties of assessing biodiversity. Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of assessing habitats, where biotic sound measured from audio recordings is used as a proxy for biodiversity. However, existing algorithms for measuring biotic sound have been shown to be biased by non-biotic sounds in recordings, typical of urban environments.\\nC_LIO_LIWe develop CityNet, a deep learning system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to measure audible biotic (CityBioNet) and anthropogenic (CityAnthroNet) acoustic activity in cities. The CNNs were trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. Using a held-out test dataset, we compare the precision and recall of CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet separately to the best available alternative algorithms: four acoustic indices (AIs): Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Bioacoustic Index, and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and a state-of-the-art bird call detection CNN (bulbul). We also compare the effect of non-biotic sounds on the predictions of CityBioNet and bulbul. Finally we apply CityNet to describe acoustic patterns of the urban soundscape in two sites along an urbanisation gradient.\\nC_LIO_LICityBioNet was the best performing algorithm for measuring biotic activity in terms of precision and recall, followed by bulbul, while the AIs performed worst. CityAnthroNet outperformed the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, but by a smaller margin than CityBioNet achieved against the competing algorithms. The CityBioNet predictions were impacted by mechanical sounds, whereas air traffic and wind sounds influenced the bulbul predictions. Across an urbanisation gradient, we show that CityNet produced realistic daily patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity from real-world urban audio data.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing CityNet, it is possible to automatically measure biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in cities from audio recordings. If embedded within an autonomous sensing system, CityNet could produce environmental data for cites at large-scales and facilitate investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on wildlife. The algorithms, code and pre-trained models are made freely available in combination with two expert-annotated urban audio datasets to facilitate automated environmental surveillance in cities.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Treatment of medically intractable focal epilepsy (MIFE) by surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is often effective provided the EZ can be reliably identified. Even with the use of invasive recordings, the clinical differentiation between the EZ and normal brain areas can be quite challenging, mainly in patients without MRI detectable lesions. Consequently, despite relatively large brain regions being removed, surgical success rates barely reach 60-65%. Such variable and unfavorable outcomes associated with high morbidity rates are often caused by imprecise and/or inaccurate EZ localization. We developed a localization algorithm that uses network-based data analytics to process invasive EEG recordings. This network algorithm analyzes the centrality signatures of every contact electrode within the recording network and characterizes contacts into susceptible EZ based on the centrality trends over time. The algorithm was tested in a retrospective study that included 42 patients from four epilepsy centers. Our algorithm had higher agreement with EZ regions identified by clinicians for patients with successful surgical outcomes and less agreement for patients with failed outcomes. These findings suggest that network analytics and a network systems perspective of epilepsy may be useful in assisting clinicians in more accurately localizing the EZ.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEpilepsy is a disease that results in abnormal firing patterns in parts of the brain that comprise the epileptogenic network, known as the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Current methods to localize the EZ for surgical treatment often requires observations of hundreds of thousands of EEG data points measured from many electrodes implanted in a patients brain. In this paper, we used network science to show that EZ regions may exhibit specific network signatures before, during and after seizure events. Our algorithm computes the likelihood of each electrode being in the EZ and tends to agree more with clinicians during successful resections and less during failed surgeries. These results suggest that a networked analysis approach to EZ localization may be valuable in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "The Methyl-CpG-Binding Domain Protein family has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The Methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (Mbd2) binds methylated DNA and was shown to play an important role in cancer and immunity. Some evidence linked this protein to neurodevelopment. However, its exact role in neurodevelopment and brain function is mostly unknown.\n\nHere we show that Mbd2-deficiency in mice (Mbd2-/-) results in deficits in cognitive, social and emotional functions. Mbd2 binds regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in the hippocampus and loss of Mbd2 alters the expression of hundreds of genes with a robust down-regulation of neuronal gene pathways. Further, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found an altered DNA methylation pattern in regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in Mbd2-/- mice. Differentially expressed genes significantly overlap with gene-expression changes observed in brains of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals. Notably, down-regulated genes are significantly enriched for human ortholog ASD risk-genes. Observed hippocampal morphological abnormalities were similar to those found in individuals with ASD and ASD rodent models. Hippocampal Mbd2 knockdown partially recapitulates the behavioral phenotypes observed in Mbd2-/- mice.\n\nThese findings suggest Mbd2 is a novel epigenetic regulator of genes that are associated with ASD in humans. Mbd2 loss causes behavioral alterations that resemble those found in ASD individuals.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale whole cancer-genome sequencing projects have led to the identification of a handful of cis-regulatory driver mutations in cancer genomes. However, recent studies have demonstrated that very large cancer cohorts will be required in order to identify low frequency non-coding drivers. To further this endeavour, in this study, we performed highdepth sequencing across 95 colorectal cancers and matched normal samples using a unique target capture sequencing (TCS) assay focusing on over 35 megabases of gene regulatory elements. We first assessed coverage and variant detection capability from our TCS data, and compared this with a sample that was additionally whole-genome sequenced (WGS). TCS enabled substantially deeper sequencing and thus we detected 51% more somatic single nucleotide variants (n = 2,457) and 144% more somatic insertions and deletions (n = 39) by TCS than WGS. Variants obtained from TCS data were suitable for somatic mutational signature detection, enabling us to define the signatures associated with germline deleterious variants in MSH6 and MUTYH in samples within our cohort. Finally, we surveyed regulatory mutations to find putative drivers by assessing variant recurrence and function, identifying some regulatory variants that may influence oncogenesis. Our study demonstrates TCS to be a sequencing-efficient alternative to traditional WGS, enabling improved coverage and variant detection when seeking to identify variants at specific loci among larger cohorts. Interestingly, we found no candidate variants that have a clear driver function, suggesting that regulatory drivers may be rare in a colorectal cancer cohort of this size.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn recent years, some cancer research focus has turned towards the role of somatic mutations in the 98% of the genome that is non-coding. To investigate such mutations, we performed deep sequencing of regulatory regions and a selection of coding genes across 95 colorectal cancer and matched-normal samples. To determine the ability of our targeted deep sequencing methodology to accurately detect variants, we compared our results with those from a sample that was additionally whole-genome sequenced. We found target capture sequencing to enable greater sequencing depth, allowing the detection of 51% and 144% more somatic single nucleotide and insertion/deletion mutations, respectively. Our study here demonstrates target capture sequencing to be a useful approach for researchers seeking to identify variants at specific loci among larger cohorts. Our results also enabled the generation of mutational signatures, implicating deleterious germline single nucleotide variants in coding exons of MSH6 and MUTYH in samples within our cohort. Finally, we surveyed regulatory elements in search of somatic cancer driver mutations. We identified some regulatory variants that may influence oncogenesis, but found no candidate variants with clear driver function.

    "abstract": "In all domains of life, proteasomes are gated chambered proteases that require opening by activators in order to facilitate protein degradation. Twelve proteasome accessory factor E (PafE) monomers assemble into a single, dodecameric ring to promote proteolysis that is required for the full virulence of the human bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While the best characterized proteasome activators use ATP to deliver proteins into a proteasome, PafE does not require ATP. In order to understand the mechanism of PafE-mediated protein targeting and proteasome activation, we studied the interactions of PafE with native substrates, including a newly identified proteasome substrate, Rv3213c, and with proteasome core particles. We characterized the function of a highly conserved feature conserved in bacterial proteasome activator proteins: a glycine-glutamine-tyrosine-leucine or \\\"GQYL\\\" motif at their carboxyl-termini that is essential to stimulate proteolysis. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we found that the GQYL motif of PafE interacts with specific residues in the -subunits of the proteasome core particle to trigger gate opening and degradation. Finally, we found that PafE rings have 40-[A] openings lined with hydrophobic residues that form a chamber for capturing substrates prior to the onset of degradation. This result suggests PafE has a previously unrecognized chaperone activity. Collectively, our data provide new insights on the mechanistic understanding of ATP-independent proteasome degradation in bacteria.",

Phosphorylation of GMF{gamma} at tyrosine-104 by c-Abl directs activated N-WASP (pY256) to the leading edge, where it can promote protrusion extension. Non-phosphorylated GMF{gamma} guides N-WASP (pY256) to maturing focal adhesions to enhance further growth. Antagonizing this signaling pathway through knockdown or mutation of tyrosine-104 to its non-phosphorylated form attenuates migration, whereas the phospho-mimic mutant GMF{gamma} enhances migration, thus demonstrating c-Abl, GMF{gamma}, and activated N-WASP (pY256) as a critical signaling cascade for regulating migration in a primary human cell line.",

Here we demonstrate in Jurkat T cells and HEK293 cells that TMEM16F activation triggers large-scale surface membrane expansion in parallel with lipid scrambling. Following TMEM16F mediated scrambling and surface expansion, cells undergo extensive membrane shedding. The membrane compartment that expands the cell surface does not involve endoplasmic reticulum or acidified lysosomes. Surprisingly, T cells lacking TMEM16F expression not only fail to expand surface membrane, but instead rapidly internalize membrane via massive endocytosis (MEND). The T cell co-receptor PD-1 is selectively shed when TMEM16F triggers membrane expansion, while it is selectively internalized in the absence of TMEM16F. Its participation in this trafficking is determined by its single transmembrane domain. Thus, we establish a fundamental role for TMEM16F as a regulator of Ca2+-activated membrane trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Human vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are categorized into two groups; pro-stenotic (Type-I) and anti-stenotic (Type-II) ECs, and one of the master genes for a stress-induced \\\"Type-II-to-Type-I\\\" degeneration is Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5). Here we show that miR-10b is a crucial downstream mediator in RGS5-dependent degeneration. We also demonstrated the miR-10bhigh Type-I EC exosome has a trans effect which suppresses anti-proliferative abilities of Type-II ECs. Moreover, we found miR-10b-deficient mice showed a resistance to experimental atherosclerosis, where high-fat-high-cholesterol-diet-fed mice were subjected to partial carotid ligation. Furthermore, we determined the key target of miR-10b was Latent transforming growth factor-{beta} binding protein 1 (LTBP1), which is a regulator of TGF-{beta} signaling. Compatible with a commonly accepted view that TGF-{beta} creates the major growth-inhibitory signal against vascular smooth muscle cells, TGF-{beta} inhibitor treatments abolished anti-proliferative functions of Type-II ECs. Therefore, RGS5/miR-10b/LTBP1/TGF-{beta} axis plays a leading role in quality control of ECs.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for genome engineering in mycobacteria rely on relatively inefficient recombination systems that require the laborious construction of a long double-stranded DNA substrate for each desired modification. We combined two efficient recombination systems to produce a versatile method for high-throughput chromosomal engineering that obviates the need for the preparation of double-stranded DNA recombination substrates. A synthetic \\\"targeting oligonucleotide\\\" is incorporated into the chromosome via homologous recombination mediated by the phage Che9c RecT annelase. This oligo contains a site-specific recombination site for the directional Bxb1 integrase (Int), which allows the simultaneous integration of a \\\"payload plasmid\\\" that contains a cognate recombination site and selectable marker. The targeting oligo and payload plasmid are co-transformed into a RecT- and Int-expressing strain, and drug-resistant homologous recombinants are selected in a single step. A library of reusable target-independent payload plasmids is available to generate knockouts and promoter replacements, or to fuse the C-terminal-encoding regions of target genes with tags of various functionalities. This new system is called ORBIT (Oligo-mediated Recombineering followed by Bxb1 Integrase Targeting) and is ideally suited for the creation of libraries consisting of large numbers of deletions, insertions or fusions in a target bacterium. We demonstrate the utility of ORBIT by the construction of insertions or deletions in over 100 genes in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. The report describes the first genetic engineering technique for making selectable chromosomal fusions and deletions that does not require the construction of target- or modification-specific double-stranded DNA recombination substrates.",

    "abstract": "Determining the pathogenicity of human genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the only option. Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes will likely require generalizable, scalable assays. Here we describe Variant Abundance by Massively Parallel Sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance in a single experiment. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,595 single amino acid variants of two proteins, PTEN and TPMT, in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,079 PTEN and 805 TPMT single amino acid variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and our abundance data suggest that a PTEN variant accounting for ~10% of PTEN missense variants in melanomas functions via a dominant negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq can be applied to other genes, highlighting its potential as a generalizable assay for characterizing missense variants.",

    "abstract": "Exome-based panels (exome slices) are becoming the preferred diagnostic strategy in clinical laboratories, especially for genetically heterogeneous disorders. The advantages of this approach include enabling frequent updates to gene content without the need for re-designing, reflexing to exome analysis bioinformatically without requiring additional sequencing, and streamlining laboratory operation by using established exome kits and protocols. Despite their increasing use, there are currently no guidelines or appropriate resources to support their clinical implementation. Here, we highlight principles and important considerations for the clinical development and validation of exome-based panels, guided by clinical data from a diagnostic epilepsy panel using this approach. We also present a novel, publically accessible web-based resource, ExomeSlicer, and demonstrate its clinical utility in predicting gene-specific and exome-wide technically challenging regions that are not amenable to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), and that might significantly lead to increased post hoc Sanger fill in burden. Using this tool, we also characterize > 2000 low complexity, GC-rich and/or high homology, regions across the exome that can be a source of false positive or false negative variant calls thus potentially leading to misdiagnoses in tested patients.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen regulates diverse physiological effects and drives breast tumor progression by directly activating estrogen receptor  (ER). However, due to the stochastic nature of gene transcription and the resulting heterogeneous cellular response, it is important to investigate estrogen-stimulated gene expression profiles at the single-cell level in order to fully understand how ER regulates transcription in breast cancer cells. In this study, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis on ER-positive breast cancer cell lines following 17{beta}-estradiol stimulation. Overall, we observed robust gene expression diversity between individual cells. Moreover, we found over two thirds of the genes in breast cancer cells displayed a bimodal expression pattern, which caused averaging artifacts and masked the identification of potential estrogen-regulated genes. We overcame this issue by reconstructing a dynamic estrogen-responsive transcriptional network from discrete time points into a pseudotemporal continuum. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes derived from the pseudotemporal analysis showed an estrogen-stimulated metabolic switch that favored biosynthesis and cell proliferation but reduced estrogen degradation. In addition, we identified folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism as a novel estrogen-regulated pathway in breast cancer cells. Notably, estrogen stimulation reprogramed this pathway through the mitochondrial folate pathway to coordinately fuel polyamine and de novo purine synthesis. Finally, we showed AZIN1 and PPAT, key regulators in the above pathways, are direct ER target genes and essential for breast cancer cell survival and growth. In summary, our single-cell study illustrated a dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity in ER-positive breast cancer cells in response to estrogen stimulation and uncovered a novel mechanism of an estrogen-mediated metabolic switch.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic and acquired defenses against bacteriophages, including Restriction/Modification, CRISPR/Cas, and Toxin/Anti-toxin systems have been intensely studied, with profound scientific impacts. However, adaptive defenses against phage infection analogous to adaptive resistance to antimicrobials have yet to be described. To identify such mechanisms, we applied an RNAseq-based, comparative transcriptomics approach in different Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains after independent infection by a set of divergent virulent bacteriophages. A common host-mediated adaptive stress response to phages was identified that includes the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal, through which infected cells inform their neighbors of infection, and what may be a resistance mechanism that functions by reducing infection vigor. With host transcriptional machinery left intact, we also observe phage-mediated differential expression caused by phage-specific stresses and molecular mechanisms. These responses suggest the presence of a conserved Bacterial Adaptive Phage Response mechanism as a novel type of host defense mechanism, and which may explain transient forms of phage persistence.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPerceptual choices depend not only on the current sensory input, but also on the behavioral context. An important contextual factor is the history of ones own choices. Choice history often strongly biases perceptual decisions, and leaves traces in the activity of brain regions involved in decision processing. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. Models of perceptual choice construe decision formation as the accumulation of sensory evidence towards decision bounds. In this framework, it is commonly assumed that choice history signals shift the starting point of accumulation towards the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit bounded-accumulation decision models to behavioral data from perceptual choice tasks, and estimated bias parameters that depended on observers previous choices. Across multiple task protocols and sensory modalities, individual history biases in overt behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to bias the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention towards (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.",
