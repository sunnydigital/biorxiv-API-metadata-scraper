    "abstract": "Human behavior and cognition result from a complex pattern of interactions between brain regions. The flexible reconfiguration of these patterns enables behavioral adaptation, such as the acquisition of a new motor skill. Yet, the degree to which these reconfigurations depend on the brains baseline sensorimotor integration is far from understood. Here, we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in sensorimotor networks at baseline were predictive of individual differences in future learning. We analyzed functional MRI data from 19 participants prior to six weeks of training on a new motor skill. We found that visual-motor connectivity was inversely related to learning rate: sensorimotor autonomy at baseline corresponded to faster learning in the future. Using three additional scans, we found that visual-motor connectivity at baseline is a relatively stable individual trait. These results suggest that individual differences in motor skill learning can be predicted from sensorimotor autonomy at baseline prior to task execution.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISensorimotor autonomy at rest predicts faster motor learning in the future.\\nC_LIO_LIConnection between calcarine and superior precentral sulci form strongest predictor.\\nC_LIO_LISensorimotor autonomy is a relatively stable individual trait.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cortical entrainment of the auditory cortex to the broad-band temporal envelope of a speech signal is crucial for speech comprehension. This entrainment results in phases of high and low neural excitability which structure and decode the incoming speech signal. Entrainment to speech is strongest in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz), the average frequency of the speech envelope. If a speech signal is degraded, for example masked by irrelevant information such as noise, entrainment to the speech envelope is weaker and speech intelligibility declines.\\n\\nBesides perceptually evoked cortical entrainment, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain neural oscillations by applying an electric signal to the brain. Accordingly, tACS-induced entrainment in auditory cortex has been shown to improve auditory perception. The aim of the current study was to externally modulate speech intelligibility by means of tACS such that the electric current corresponds to the envelope of the presented speech stream.\\n\\nParticipants performed the Oldenburg sentence test with sentences presented in noise in combination with tACS. Critically, the time lag between sentence presentation and tACS was manipulated from 0 to 250 ms in 50-ms steps (auditory stimuli were simultaneous to or preceded tACS).\\n\\nFirst, we were able to show that envelope-tACS modulated sentence comprehension such that on average sentence comprehension at the time lag of the best performance was significantly better than sentence comprehension of the worst performance. Second, sentence comprehension across time lags was modulated sinusoidally.\\n\\nIn sum, envelope tACS modulates intelligibility of speech in noise presumably by enhancing (time lag with in-phase stimulation) and disrupting (time lag with out-of-phase stimulation) cortical entrainment to the speech envelope in auditory cortex.",

Here we show that when cellular states are described using a Boolean network model, one can exactly simulate the dynamics of non-interacting, highly heterogeneous populations directly, without having to model the various subpopulations. This strategy captures even the rarest outcomes of the model with no sampling error. Our method can incorporate heterogeneity in both cell state and, by augmenting the model, the underlying rules of the network as well (i.e. mutations). We demonstrate our method by using it to simulate a heterogeneous population of Boolean networks modeling the T-cell receptor, spanning ~ 1020 distinct cellular states and mutational profiles.",

Specifically, we present a comprehensive, survey-based analysis of the structural properties of small {beta}-barrels (SBBs). We first consider the defining characteristics of the SBB fold, as well as the various systems of nomenclature used to describe it. In order to begin elucidating how such vast functional diversity is achieved by a relatively simple protein domain, we then explore the anatomy of the SBB fold and some of its representative structural variants. Many types of SBB proteins assemble into cyclic oligomers that act as the biologically-functional entity. These oligomers exhibit a great deal of plasticity even at the quaternary structural level--including homomeric and heteromeric assemblies, rings of variable subunit stoichiometries (pentamer, hexamer, etc.), as well as higher-order oligomers (e.g., double-rings) and fibrillar polymers. We conclude with three themes that emerge from the SBBs unique structure{leftrightarrow}function versatility.",

    "abstract": "A profile comparison method with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is one of the most accurate alignment methods. Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficient are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear that these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. At least, by definition, these functions cannot capture non-linear relationships between profiles. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile comparison method than the existing ones. Firstly we implemented a new derivative free neural network by combining the conventional neural network with evolutionary strategy optimization method. Next, using the framework, the scoring function was optimized for aligning remote sequence pairs. Nepal, the pairwise profile aligner with the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision, compared to aligners with the existing functions. Nepal improved alignment quality because of adaptation to remote sequence alignment and increasing the expressive power of similarity score. The novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. With our scoring function, the performance of homology detection and/or multiple sequence alignment for remote homologous sequences would be further improved.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100046). The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa witnessed considerable efforts to obtain viral genomic data as the epidemic was unfolding. If such data can be deployed in real-time, molecular epidemiological investigations could play a role in complementing contact tracing undertaken by public health agencies. Analysing the EBOV genomes accumulated to date can also deliver insights into epidemic dynamics. Such analyses have been shown that metapopulation dynamics were critical for EBOV dispersal between rural and urban areas during the epidemic, but the implications for specific intervention scenarios remain unclear. Here, we address this issue using a collection of phylodynamic approaches. We show that long-distance dispersal events (between administrative areas >250 km apart) were not crucial for epidemic expansion and that preventing viral lineage movement to any given administrative area would, in most cases, have had little impact. However, urban areas - specifically those encompassing the three capital cities and their suburbs - were critical in attracting and further disseminating the virus: preventing viral lineage movement to all three simultaneously would have contained epidemic size by two-thirds. Using continuous phylogeographic reconstructions we estimate a distance kernel for EBOV spread and reveal considerable heterogeneity in dispersal velocity through time. We also show that announcements of border closures were followed by a significant but transient effect on international virus dispersal. By quantifying the hypothetical impact of different intervention strategies as well as the impact of barriers on dispersal frequency, our study illustrates how phylodynamic analyses can help to address specific epidemiological and outbreak control questions.",

    "abstract": "Dimorphic fungal pathogens cause a significant human disease burden and unlike most fungal pathogens affect immunocompetent hosts. To examine the origin of virulence of these fungal pathogens, we compared genomes of classic systemic, opportunistic, and non-pathogenic species, including Emmonsia and two basal branching, non-pathogenic species in the Ajellomycetaceae, Helicocarpus griseus and Polytolypa hystricis. We found that gene families related to plant degradation, secondary metabolites synthesis, and amino acid and lipid metabolism are retained in H. griseus and P. hystricis. While genes involved in the virulence of dimorphic pathogenic fungi are conserved in saprophytes, changes in the copy number of proteases, kinases and transcription factors in systemic dimorphic relative to non-dimorphic species may have aided the evolution of specialized gene regulatory programs to rapidly adapt to higher temperatures and new nutritional environments. Notably, both of the basal branching, non-pathogenic species appear homothallic, with both mating type locus idiomorphs fused at a single locus, whereas all related pathogenic species are heterothallic. These differences revealed that independent changes in nutrient acquisition capacity have occurred in the Onygenaceae and Ajellomycetaceae, and underlie how the dimorphic pathogens have adapted to the human host and decreased their capacity for growth in environmental niches.",

    "abstract": "Iron is essential for growth and development of Chlamydia. Its long-term starvation in cultured mammalian cells leads to production of aberrant non-infectious chlamydial forms, also known as persistence. Immediate transcriptional responses to iron limitation have not been characterized, leaving a knowledge gap of how Chlamydia regulates its response to changes in iron availability. We used the fast-chelating agent 2,2-Bipyridyl (BPDL) to homogeneously starve Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 of iron, starting at 6 or 12h post-infection. Immediate transcriptional responses were monitored after only 3 or 6h of BPDL-treatment, well before formation of aberrant Chlamydia. The first genome-wide transcriptional response of C. trachomatis to iron-starvation was subsequently determined utilizing RNA-sequencing. Only 7% and 8% of the genome was differentially expressed in response to iron-starvation at early and mid-stages of development, respectively. Biological pathway analysis revealed an overarching theme. Synthesis of macromolecular precursors (deoxynucleotides, amino acids, charged tRNAs, and acetyl-coA) was up-regulated, while energy-expensive processes (ABC transport and translation) were down-regulated. A large fraction of differentially down-regulated genes are involved in translation, including ribosome assembly, initiation and termination factors, which could be analogous to the translation down-regulation triggered by stress in other prokaryotes during stringent responses. Additionally, transcriptional up-regulation of DNA repair, oxidative stress, and tryptophan salvage genes reveals a possible coordination of responses to multiple antimicrobial and immunological insults. These responses of replicative-phase Chlamydia to iron-starvation indicate a prioritization of survival over replication, enabling the pathogen to \\\"stock the pantry\\\" with ingredients needed for rapid growth once optimal iron levels are restored.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBy utilizing an experimental approach that monitors the immediate global response of Chlamydia trachomatis to iron-starvation, clues to long-standing questions in Chlamydia biology are revealed, including how Chlamydia adapts to this stress. We determined that this pathogen initiates a transcriptional program that prioritizes replenishment of nutrient stores over replication, possibly in preparation for rapid growth once optimal iron levels are restored. Transcription of genes for biosynthesis of metabolic precursors was generally up-regulated, while those involved in multiple steps of translation were down-regulated. We also observed an increase in transcription of genes involved in DNA repair and neutralizing oxidative stress, indicating that Chlamydia employs an \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" strategy. Its small genome limits its ability to tailor a specific response to a particular stress. Therefore, the \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" strategy may be the most efficient way of surviving within the host, where the pathogen likely encounters multiple simultaneous immunological and nutritional insults.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormones auxin and cytokinin influence the development and maintenance of plant stem cell niches. Although barley (Hordeum vulgare) is the fourth most abundant cereal crop plant, the knowledge about these important phytohormones in regard to the root and shoot stem cell niche in barley is still negligible. In this study, we analyse the influence of auxin and cytokinin on the barley root meristem and present reporter lines to describe the auxin and cytokinin signalling output. Application of high concentrations of auxin and cytokinin to barley seedlings had a negative influence on barley root and meristem growth. The expression of the cytokinin reporter TCSn revealed that cytokinin signalling mostly takes place in the stele cells proximal to the QC and in the differentiated root cap cells, but can additionally be activated in the root stem cell niche by cytokinin application. Analysing signalling targets of auxin showed that a homologue of AtPLT1, HvPLT1, is expressed in a similar way as AtPLT1 in Arabidopsis, in particular in the QC and the surrounding cells. Furthermore, a homologue of the auxin PIN transporters PIN1, HvPIN1, was expressed in the root and the shoot meristem and polarly localizes to the plasma membrane. Its expression is regulated by cytokinin and the intracellular localisation is affected by BFA. With this study, we provide a valuable tool set of fluorescent barley reporter lines for auxin and cytokinin.",

    "abstract": "The in-vitro fabrication of hierarchical biological systems such as human vasculature, which are made up of two or more cell types with intricate co-culture architectures, is by far one of the most complicated challenges that tissue engineers have faced. Here, we introduce a versatile method to create multi-layered, cell-laden hydrogel microstructures with coaxial geometries and heterogeneous mechanical and biological properties. The technique can be used to build in-vitro vascular networks that are fully embedded in hydrogels of physiologically realistic mechanical stiffness. Our technique produces free-standing 3D structures, eliminating rigid polymeric surfaces from the vicinity of cells and allowing layers of multiple cell types to be defined with tailored extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and stiffness, and in direct contact with each other. We demonstrate co-axial geometries with diameters ranging from 200-2000 m and layer thicknesses as small as 50-200 {micro}m in agarose- collagen (AC) composite hydrogels. Coaxial geometries with such fine feature sizes are beyond the capabilities of most bioprinting techniques. A potential application of such a structure is to simulate vascular networks in the brain with endothelial cells surrounded by multiple layers of pericytes and other glial cells. For this purpose, the composition and mechanical properties of the composite AC hydrogels have been optimized for cell viability and biological performance of endothelial and glial cell types in both 2D and 3D culture modes. Multi-layered vascular constructs with an endothelial layer surrounded by layers of glial cells have been fabricated. This prototype in-vitro model resembles vascular geometries and opens the way for complex multi-luminal blood vessels to be fabricated.",

Unlike the MYCOTB plate, on which UKMYC5 is based, the plate included two new (bedaquiline and delamanid) and two repurposed (clofazimine and linezolid) compounds. UKMYC5 plates were tested by seven laboratories on four continents using a panel of 19 external quality assessment (EQA) strains, including H37Rv. To assess the optimal combination of reading method and incubation time, MICs were measured from each plate by two readers using three methods (mirrored-box, microscope and Vizion Digital viewing system) after 7, 10, 14 and 21 days incubation. In addition, all EQA strains were whole-genome sequenced and phenotypically characterized by 7H10/7H11 agar proportion method (APM) and MGIT960. We conclude that the UKMYC5 plate is optimally read using the Vizion system after 14 days incubation, achieving an inter-reader agreement of 97.9% and intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibilities of 95.6% and 93.1%, respectively. The mirrored-box had similar reproducibilities. Strains classified as resistant by APM, MGIT960 or the presence of mutations known to confer resistance consistently record elevated MICs compared with those strains classified as susceptible. Finally, the UKMYC5 plate records intermediate MICs for one strain which the APM measured MICs close the applied critical concentration, providing early evidence that the UKMYC5 plate can quantitatively measure the magnitude of resistance to anti-TB compounds due to specific genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "A recent policy change at Journal of Neuroscience (JN) has significantly increased editorial \\\"desk rejections\\\", reducing the number of papers that are considered for publication. Survey results from 130 scientists suggested that the new policy may have had a particularly large impact on studies that focused on human behavioral techniques. To quantify the effects of the new policy, we gathered data on all papers ever published in JN (~35,000), as well as all papers that had cited the JN papers (~2.7 million papers). We found that the recent change in editorial policy had disproportionately affected rejection rates of human behavioral papers: since 2015, the number of human behavioral papers as a proportion of all papers published in JN has seen a 30% decline. While there has been a long-term declining trend in the journals impact factor, we found that this declining impact factor was shared by both human behavioral papers as well as other papers in the journal. This suggested that whatever may have been the source of the declining impact factor at JN, this source was affecting the various areas of research equally. That is, it was unlikely that papers in any one field were responsible for the declining impact factor number at JN. Indeed, when impact was measured over the long-term, we found that the average human behavioral paper at JN consistently outperformed other papers, generating a significantly higher number of citations per year at 5 and 10 years post publication.",

    "abstract": "Copy number gain of the PHGDH gene that encodes the first enzyme of the serine biosynthesis pathway is found in some human cancers, including a subset of melanomas. In order to study the effect of increased PHGDH expression in tissues in vivo, we generated mice harboring a PHGDHtetO allele that allows tissue-specific, doxycycline-inducible PHGDH expression. Tissues and cells derived from PHGDHtetO mice exhibit increased serine biosynthesis. Histological examination of skin tissue from PHGDHtetO mice reveals the presence of melanin granules in anagen II hair follicles, despite the fact that melanin synthesis is normally closely coupled to the hair follicle cycle and does not begin until later in the cycle. This phenotype occurs in the absence of any global change in hair follicle cycle timing. The inappropriate presence of melanin early in the hair follicle cycle following PHGDH expression is also accompanied by increased melanocyte abundance in anagen II skin. Together, these data support a model in which PHGDH expression affects melanocyte proliferation and/or differentiation and may provide insight into how PHGDH expression impacts normal melanocyte biology to promote melanoma.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe significance behind copy number gain of PHGDH in human cancers is unclear. In this study, we generate a mouse model that mimics PHGDH gene copy number gain and characterize its effect on normal tissues. Increased PHGDH expression yields a phenotype of aberrant melanin production, which indicates that PHGDH expression may play a role in normal melanocyte biology. This result may provide insight into why PHGDH copy number gain is observed in melanoma more frequently than in most other tumor types.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes organize in complex networks through connections by gap junction channels that are regulated by extra- and intracellular signals. Calcium signals generated in individual cells, can propagate across these networks in the form of intercellular calcium waves, mediated by diffusion of second messengers molecules such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The mechanisms underpinning the large variety of spatiotemporal patterns of propagation of astrocytic calcium waves however remain a matter of investigation. In the last decade, awareness has grown on the morphological diversity of astrocytes as well as their connections in networks, which seem dependent on the brain area, developmental stage, and the ultrastructure of the associated neuropile. It is speculated that this diversity underpins an equal functional variety but the current experimental techniques are limited in supporting this hypothesis because they do not allow to resolve the exact connectivity of astrocyte networks in the brain. With this aim we present a general framework to model intercellular calcium wave propagation in astrocyte networks and use it to specifically investigate how different network topologies could influence shape, frequency and propagation of these waves.",

    "abstract": "Timely identification of a cows reproduction status is essential to minimize fertilityrelated losses on dairy farms. This includes optimal estrus detection, pregnancy diagnosis and the timely recognition of early embryonic death and ovarian problems. On farm milk progesterone (P4) analysis could indicate all of these fertility events simultaneously. However, milk P4 measurements are subject to a large variability both in terms of measurement errors and absolute values between cycles. In this study, an innovative monitoring system based on milk P4 using the principles of synergistic control is presented. Instead of using filtering techniques and fixed thresholds, the present system employs an individually updated online model to describe the P4 profile, combined with a statistical process control chart to identify the cows fertility status. The inputs for the latter are the residuals of the online model, corrected for the concentration-dependent variability which is typical for milk P4 measurements. The objective of this paper is to present the developed methodology and give an indication of its use on farm. To this end, the system was validated on the P4 profiles of 38 dairy cows. The positive predictive value for luteolysis followed by estrus was 100%, meaning that the monitoring system picked up all estrous periods identified by the experts. Pregnancy or embryonic mortality was characterized by the absence or detection of luteolysis following an insemination, respectively. For thirteen cows, no luteolysis was detected by the system within the 25-32 days after insemination, indicating pregnancy, which was confirmed later by rectal palpation. It was also shown that the system is able to cope with deviating P4 profiles having prolonged follicular or luteal phases, which may suggest the occurrence of cysts. Future research is recommended for optimizing sampling frequency, prediction of the optimal insemination window and the establishment of rules to detect problems based on deviating P4 patterns.\\n\\nINTERPRETIVE SUMMARY. Progestrone-based online fertility monitoring. Adriaens.Milk progesterone based monitoring systems can be valuable for indicating fertility events in dairy cows, as the evolution of the milk progesterone levels can be related to acyclicity, estrus, pregnancy, and ovarian problems. We developed a system to translate raw progesterone measurements into clear information for the farmer, based on a mathematical model and a statistical control chart. In this way, a detailed image of a cows reproduction status on-farm can be obtained and fertility-related losses minimized.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPartially methylated domains, PMDs, are extended regions in the genome exhibiting a reduced average DNA-methylation level. PMDs cover gene-poor and transcriptionally inactive regions and tend to be heterochromatic. Here, we present a first comprehensive comparative analysis of PMDs across more than 190 WGBS methylomes of human and mouse cells providing a deep insight into structural and functional features associated with PMDs.\\n\\nResultsPMDs are ubiquitous signatures covering up to 75% of the genome in human and mouse cells irrespective of their tissue or cell origin. Additionally, each cell type comes with a distinct set of specific PMDs, and genes expressed in such PMDs show a strong cell type effect. Demethylation strength varies in PMDs with a tendency towards a more pronounced effect in differentiating and replicating cells. The strongest demethylation is observed in highly proliferating and immortal cancer cell lines. A decrease of DNA-methylation within PMDs tends to be linked to an increase in heterochromatic histone marks and a decrease of gene expressions. Characteristic combinations of heterochromatic signatures in PMDs are linked to domains of early, middle and late DNA-replication.\\n\\nConclusionPMDs are prominent signatures of long-range epigenomic organization. Integrative analysis identifies PMDs as important general, lineage- and cell-type specific topological features. PMD changes are hallmarks of cell differentiation. Demethylation of PMDs combined with increased heterochromatic marks is a feature linked to enhanced cell proliferation. In combination with broad histone marks PMDs demarcate distinct domains of late DNA-replication.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is an essential part of many (patho)physiological processes in the body, including keratinocyte re-epithelialization of healing wounds. Recent interest in the mechanobiology of tissues suggests that physical forces and mechanical cues from the wound bed (in addition to biochemical signals) may also play an important role in the healing process. Previously, we explored this possibility and found that polyacrylamide (PA) gel stiffness affected primary human keratinocyte behavior and that mechanical deformations in soft (~1.2 kPA) PA gels produced by neighboring cells appeared to influence the process of de novo epithelial sheet formation. In order to clearly demonstrate that keratinocytes do respond to such deformations, we conducted a series of experiments where we observed the response of single keratinocytes to a prescribed local substrate deformation that mimicked a neighboring cell or evolving multicellular aggregate via a servo-controlled microneedle. We also examined the effect of adding either Y27632, a rho kinase inhibitor, or blebbistatin, a non-muscle myosin II inhibitor, on the response of the cells to PA gel deformations. The results of this study indicate that keratinocytes do sense and respond to mechanical signals comparable to those that originate from substrate displacements imposed by neighboring cells, a finding that could have important implications for the process of keratinocyte re-epithelialization that takes place during normal and pathologic wound healing. Furthermore, the Rho/ROCK pathway and the engagement of NM II are both essential to the observed process of substrate deformation-directed keratinocyte migration.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes, the main microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) of metazoan cells, contain an older  mother and a younger  daughter centriole. Stem cells either inherit the mother or daughter centriole-containing centrosome, providing a possible mechanism for biased delivery of cell fate determinants. However, the dynamics and mechanisms regulating centrosome asymmetry and biased centrosome segregation are unclear. Using 3D-Structured Illumination Microscopy (3D-SIM) and live cell imaging we show that in fly neural stem cells (neuroblasts) the mitotic kinase Polo and its centriolar protein substrate Centrobin (Cnb) dynamically relocalize from the mother to the daughter centriole during mitosis. This mechanism generates a centrosome, containing two molecularly distinct centrioles by telophase. Cnbs timely relocalization is regulated by Polo-mediated phosphorylation whereas Polos daughter centriole enrichment requires both Wdr62 and Cnb. Based on optogenetic protein mislocalization experiments we propose that the establishment of centriole asymmetry in mitosis primes biased interphase MTOC activity, necessary for correct spindle orientation.",

    "abstract": "As humans alter habitats and move themselves and their commensal animals around the globe they change the disease risk for themselves, their commensal animals and wildlife. Bartonella bacteria are prevalent in many mammalian taxa, responsible for numerous human infections and presumed to be an important emerging group of zoonoses. Understanding how this genus has evolved and passed between host taxa in the past can reveal not only how current patterns were established but identify potential mechanisms for future cross-species transmission. We analyzed patterns of Bartonella transmission and likely sources of spillover using the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes assembled, 860 unique genotypes of Bartonella globally. We provide support for the hypothesis that this pathogenic genus originated as an environmental bacterium before becoming an insect commensal and finally vertebrate pathogen. We show that rodents and domestic animals serve as the reservoirs or at least key proximate host for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. We also find evidence of exchange of Bartonella between domestic animals and wildlife and between domestic animals, likely due to increased contact between all groups. Bartonella is a useful infection for tracing potential zoonoses and demonstrates another major impact of humans on the planet. Care should be taken to avoid contact between humans, domestic animals and wildlife to protect the health of all.",

    "abstract": "In diverse bacteria, proper cellular physiology requires the utilization of protein- or membrane-bound compartments that afford specific metabolic capabilities. One such compartment is the light-harvesting intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) of purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB). Here we reveal that ICMs are subject to differential spatial organization among PNSB. We visualized ICMs in live cells of fourteen PNSB species by exploiting the natural autofluorescence of the photosynthetic machinery. We then quantitatively characterized ICM localization using automated computational analysis of autofluorescence patterns within single cells across the population. Our studies revealed that ICMs are localized in distinct subcellular patterns that differ between species; some PNSB elaborate ICMs throughout the cell, while others spatially restrict ICM to varying degrees. The most highly-restricted ICMs were localized in a specific pattern corresponding to progression of cell growth and division. An identical pattern of ICM restriction was conserved across at least two genera. Phylogenetic and phenotypic comparisons established that ICM localization and ICM architecture are not strictly interdependent and that neither trait fully correlates with the evolutionary relatedness of the species. This discovery of new diversity in bacterial cell organization has implications for understanding both the mechanisms underpinning spatial arrangement of bacterial compartments and the potential benefits of adopting different spatiotemporal patterns.",

C. glabrata displays high resistance to common azole antifungals, which necessitates new treatments. In this investigation, we identified five C. glabrata deletion mutants ({Delta}ada2, {Delta}bas1, {Delta}hir3,{Delta} ino2 and{Delta} met31) from a library of 196 transcription factor mutants that were unable to grow and activate an immune response in Drosophila larvae. This highlighted the importance of these transcription factors in C. glabrata infectivity. Further ex vivo investigation into these mutants revealed the requirement of C. glabrata ADA2 for oxidative stress tolerance. We confirmed this observation in vivo whereby growth of the C. glabrata {Delta}ada2 strain was permitted only in flies with suppressed production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, overexpression of ADA2 promoted C. glabrata replication in infected wild type larvae resulting in larval killing. We propose that ADA2 orchestrates the response of C. glabrata against ROS-mediated immune defences during infection. With the need to find alternative antifungal treatment for C. glabrata infections, genes required for survival in the host environment, such as ADA2, provide promising potential targets.",

    "abstract": "The shape of extracellularly recorded action potentials is a product of several variables, such as the biophysical and anatomical properties of the neuron and the relative position of the electrode. This allows for isolating spikes of different neurons recorded in the same channel into clusters based on waveform features. However, correctly classifying spike waveforms into their underlying neuronal sources remains a main challenge. This process, called spike sorting, typically consists of two steps: (1) extracting relevant waveform features (e.g., height, width), and (2) clustering them into non-overlapping groups believed to correspond to different neurons. In this study, we explored the performance of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in these two steps. We extracted relevant waveform features using a combination of common techniques (e.g., principal components and wavelets) and GMM fitting parameters (e.g., standard deviations and peak distances). Then, we developed an approach to perform unsupervised clustering using GMMs, which estimates cluster properties in a data-driven way. Our results show that the proposed GMM-based framework outperforms previously established methods when using realistic simulations of extracellular spikes and actual extracellular recordings to evaluate sorting performance. We also discuss potentially better techniques for feature extraction than the widely used principal components. Finally, we provide a friendly graphical user interface in MATLAB to run our algorithm, which allows for manual adjustment of the automatic results.",

    "abstract": "While the advantage of screening vast databases of molecules to cover greater molecular diversity is often mentioned, in reality, only a few studies have been published demonstrating inhibitor discovery by screening more than a million compounds for features that mimic a known three-dimensional ligand. Two factors contribute: the general difficulty of discovering potent inhibitors, and the lack of free, user-friendly software to incorporate project-specific knowledge and user hypotheses into 3D ligand-based screening. The Screenlamp modular toolkit presented here was developed with these needs in mind. We show Screenlamps ability to screen more than 12 million commercially available molecules and identify potent in vivo inhibitors of a G protein-coupled bile acid receptor within the first year of a discovery project. This pheromone receptor governs sea lamprey reproductive behavior, and to our knowledge, this project is the first to establish the efficacy of computational screening in discovering lead compounds for aquatic invasive species control. Significant enhancement in activity came from selecting compounds based on one of the hypotheses: that matching two distal oxygen groups in the three-dimensional structure of the pheromone is crucial for activity. Six of the 15 most active compounds met these criteria. A second hypothesis - that presence of an alkyl sulfate side chain results in high activity - identified another 6 compounds in the top 10, demonstrating the significant benefits of hypothesis-driven screening.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe use of the new genomic technologies has led to major advances in control of several arboviruses of medical importance such as Dengue. However, the development of tools and resources available for vectors of non-zoonotic arboviruses remains neglected. Biting midges of the genus Culicoides transmit some of the most important arboviruses of wildlife and livestock worldwide, with a global impact on economic productivity, health and welfare. The absence of a suitable reference genome has hindered genomic analyses to date in this important genus of vectors. In the present study, the genome of Culicoides sonorensis, a vector of bluetongue virus (BTV) in the USA, has been sequenced to provide the first reference genome for these vectors. In this study, we also report the use of the reference genome to perform initial transcriptomic analyses of vector competence for BTV.\\n\\nResultsOur analyses reveal that the genome is 197.4 Mb, assembled in 7,974 scaffolds. Its annotation using the transcriptomic data generated in this study and in a previous study has identified 15,629 genes. Gene expression analyses of C. sonorensis females infected with BTV performed in this study revealed 165 genes that were differentially expressed between vector competent and refractory females. Two candidate genes, glutathione S-transferase (gst) and the antiviral helicase ski2, previously recognized as involved in vector competence for BTV in C. sonorensis (gst) and repressing dsRNA virus propagation (ski2), were confirmed in this study.\\n\\nConclusionsThe reference genome of C. sonorensis has enabled preliminary analyses of the gene expression profiles of vector competent and refractory individuals. The genome and transcriptomes generated in this study provide suitable tools for future research on arbovirus transmission. These provide a significant resource for these vector lineage, which diverged from other major Dipteran vector families over 200 million years ago. The genome will be a valuable source of comparative data for other important Dipteran vector families including mosquitoes (Culicidae) and sandflies (Psychodidae), and yield potential targets for transgenic modification in vector control and functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Activation of TMEM16F, a Ca2+ -dependent ion channel and lipid scramblase, causes massive surface membrane expansion in multiple cell types by unresolved mechanisms. We describe here that membrane expansion reflects opening of deeply invaginating surface membrane compartments when anionic phospholipids are lost from the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet. Compartments that open contain vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) and can open with as little as one micromolar free Cai2+. Cationic peptides that sequester anionic phospholipids open the compartments from the cytoplasmic side without Ca2+. Monovalent cations facilitate membrane expansion via coupled permeation with anionic phospholipids through TMEM16F. When monovalent cation concentrations are reduced, membrane expansion can be reversed by changing ion gradients and membrane voltage. Depolarization closes the compartments by generating inward cation gradients through TMEM16F that promote influx of anionic phospholipids. In summary, TMEM16F-mediated membrane expansion likely does not reflect exocytosis but rather the relaxation of constrictions that close surface membrane invaginations.\\n\\nSummaryThe surface membrane of diverse cell types can be remodeled by opening and closing surface invaginations that are held shut by proteins that bind negatively charged lipids and constrict the orifices of these compartments.",

Small molecule CCR5 antagonists exist, including the approved antiretroviral drug maraviroc, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are in development. Repositioning of drugs and targets into new disease areas can accelerate the availability of new therapies and substantially reduce costs. As it has been shown that drug targets with genetic evidence supporting their involvement in the disease are more likely to be successful in clinical development, using genetic association studies to identify new target repurposing opportunities could be fruitful. Here we investigate the potential of perturbation of the CCL3L1-CCR5 axis as treatment for respiratory disease. Europeans typically carry between 0 and 5 copies of CCL3L1 and this multi-allelic variation is not detected by widely used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism studies. We directly measured the complex structural variation of CCL3L1 using the Paralogue Ratio Test (PRT) and imputed (with validation) CCR5del32 genotypes in 5,000 individuals from UK Biobank, selected from the extremes of the lung function distribution, and analysed DNA and RNAseq data for CCL3L1 from the 1000 Genomes Project. We confirmed the gene dosage effect of CCL3L1 copy number on CCL3L1 mRNA expression levels. We found no evidence for association of CCL3L1 copy number or CCR5del32 genotype with lung function suggesting that repositioning CCR5 antagonists is unlikely to be successful for the treatment of airflow obstruction.",

    "abstract": "Human infants, apes and capuchins have been found to engage in intuitive statistics, generating predictions from populations to samples based on proportional information. This suggests that statistical reasoning might depend on some core knowledge that is shared with other species. Here, we investigated whether such intuitive statistical reasoning is also present in a species of Old World monkeys, to aid in the reconstruction of the evolution of this capacity. In a series of 7 test conditions, 11 long-tailed macaques were offered different pairs of populations containing varying proportions of preferred vs. neutral food items. One population always contained a higher proportion of preferred items than the other. An experimenter simultaneously drew one item out of each population, hid them in her fists and presented them to the monkey to choose. Results revealed that at least one individual seemed to make systematic population-to-sample inferences and consistently chose the sample from the population with the more favorable distribution of preferred vs. neutral food items. While it is not clear whether she used relative or absolute quantities of food, she seemed to understand the difference between a correct choice and a favorable draw and thus some basic principles of intuitive statistics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMassive growth in the amount of research data and computational analysis has led to increased utilization of pipeline managers in biomedical computational research. However, each of more than 100 such managers uses its own way to describe pipelines, leading to difficulty porting workflows to different environments and therefore poor reproducibility of computational studies. For this reason, the Common Workflow Language (CWL) was recently introduced as a specification for platform-independent workflow description, and work began to transition existing pipelines and workflow managers to CWL.\\n\\nFindingsHere, we present CWL-Airflow, an extension for the Apache Airflow pipeline manager supporting CWL. CWL-Airflow utilizes CWL v1.0 specification and can be used to run workflows on standalone MacOS/Linux servers, on clusters, or on a variety of cloud platforms. A sample CWL pipeline for processing of ChIP-Seq data is provided.\\n\\nConclusionsCWL-Airflow will provide users with the features of a fully-fledged pipeline manager and an ability to execute CWL workflows anywhere Airflow can run--from a laptop to cluster or cloud environment.\\n\\nAvailabilityCWL-Airflow is available under Apache license v.2 and can be downloaded from https://barski-lab.github.io/cwl-airflow, http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2669582, RRID: SCR_017196.",

    "abstract": "After 15 years of the Lenski experiment one of twelve Escherichia coli populations evolved the ability to utilize an abundant but previously untapped carbon source, citrate. Mutations responsible for the appearance of rudimentary citrate utilization (Cit+ phenotype) and for refining this ability have been characterized. However, the complete nature of the genetic and/or ecological events that set the stage for this key innovation remain unknown. We found that there was a slight fitness benefit for introducing an activated citT cassette that mimics the mutation causing Cit+ into the ancestor of the evolution experiment and strains isolated from the population close to when it evolved. However, there was no benefit or even a large deleterious effect in intermediate strains. We conclude that achieving Cit+ was contingent on both an evolutionary trajectory that maintained a potentiated genetic state and the slowing rate of adaptation in this population late in the experiment.",

    "abstract": "Sexual interactions play an important role in the evolution of reproductive isolation, with important consequences for speciation. Theoretical studies have focused on the evolution of mate preferences in each sex separately. However, mounting empirical evidence suggests that premating isolation often involves mutual mate choice. Here, using a population genetic model, we investigate how female and male mate choice coevolve under a phenotype matching rule and how this affects reproductive isolation. We show that the evolution of female preferences increases the mating success of males with reciprocal preferences, favouring mutual mate choice. However, the evolution of male preferences weakens indirect selection on female preferences and, with weak genetic drift, the coevolution of female and male mate choice leads to periodic episodes of random mating with increased hybridization (deterministic  preference cycling triggered by stochasticity). Thus, counterintuitively, the process of establishing premating isolation proves rather fragile if both male and female mate choice contribute to assortative mating.",

    "abstract": "There is urgent need to develop novel treatment strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance. Collateral sensitivity (CS), where resistance to one antimicrobial increases susceptibility to other drugs, is a uniquely promising strategy that enables selection against resistance during treatment. However, using CS-informed therapy depends on conserved CS networks across genetically diverse bacterial strains. We examined CS conservation in 10 clinical strains of E. coli resistant to four clinically relevant antibiotics. Collateral susceptibilities of these 40 resistant mutants were then determined against a panel of 16 antibiotics. Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrate that resistance mechanisms, in particular efflux-related mutations, as well as relative fitness were principal contributors to collateral changes. Moreover, collateral responses shifted the mutant selection window suggesting that CS-informed therapies could affect evolutionary trajectories of antimicrobial resistance. Our data allow optimism for CS-informed therapy and further suggest that early detection of resistance mechanisms is important to accurately predict collateral antimicrobial responses.",

Three putative integral membrane proteins (FliP/FliQ/FliR) are suggested to form the core of an export gate in the inner membrane, but their structure, assembly and location within the final nanomachine remain unclear. We here present the structure of this complex at 4.2 [A] by cryo-electron microscopy. None of the subunits adopt canonical integral membrane protein topologies and common helix-turn-helix structural elements allow them to form a helical assembly with 5:4:1 stoichiometry. Fitting of the structure into reconstructions of intact secretion systems localize the export gate as a core component of the periplasmic portion of the machinery, and cross-linking experiments confirm this observation. This study thereby identifies the export gate as a key element of the secretion channel and implies that it primes the helical architecture of the components assembling downstream.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe core of the T3SS export gate forms a supra-membrane helical assembly",

    "abstract": "During threat assessment, the early detection of danger is highly adaptive, yet the fast orientation towards safety is also key to survival. The present study aimed to explore how the human brain searches for safety by manipulating subjects attentional set to cues associated with shock probability. Subjects were asked to judge random dots motion (RDM) direction and could be shocked for incorrect responses (RDM task) while keeping alert in detecting the shock probability cues (cue detection task). In contrast to the safe condition, where subjects searched for cues associated with no shock probability, incorrect responses to  dangerous+ (D+) cues would increase the shock probability and correct responses to  dangerous- (D-) cues would decrease shock probability. In the RDM task, results showed that relative to the D+, the safe attentional set resulted in stronger activation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a core region involved in flexible threat assessment and safety signalling. The vmPFC was also recruited by the D-compared to the D + attentional set. In the cue detection task, shorter response times and greater accuracy were observed for D+ compared to D- and safe cues. Correspondingly, at the neural level D+ cues induced increased activity in the frontoparietal attention network including the inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus. Overall, our findings demonstrate that attentional set for searching safety recruits the vmPFC, while detection of threat elicits activity in the frontoparietal attention network, suggesting a new role for these regions in human defensive survival circuitry.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhile early detection of threat is highly adaptive, the fast orientation towards safety is also key to survival. However, little is known about neural mechanisms underlying attentional set to safety. Using a novel dots motion paradigm combined with fMRI, we explored how human brain prepares for safety searching by manipulating subjects attentional set to cues associated with shock probability. Relative to the dangerous attentional set associated with increasing shock probability, the safe attentional set resulted in stronger activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a core region involved in flexible threat assessment and safety signalling, suggesting a new role for this region in human defensive survival system in encoding stimuli with survival significance.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in neuroscience is to longitudinally monitor whole brain activity across multiple spatial scales in the same animal. Functional UltraSound (fUS) is an emerging technology that offers images of cerebral blood volume over large brain portions. Here we show for the first time its capability to resolve the functional organization of sensory systems at multiple scales in awake animals, both within structures by precisely mapping sensory responses, and between structures by elucidating the connectivity scheme of top-down projections. We demonstrate that fUS provides stable (over days), yet rapid, highly-resolved 3D tonotopic maps in the auditory pathway of awake ferrets, with unprecedented sharp functional resolution (100m). This was performed in four different brain regions, including small (1-2mm3 size), subcortical (8mm deep) and previously undescribed structures in the ferret. Furthermore, we used fUS to map longdistance projections from frontal cortex, a key source of sensory response modulation, to auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Birdsong is a complex vocal communication signal, and like humans, birds need to discriminate between similar sequences of sound with different meanings. The caudal mesopallium (CM) is a cortical-level auditory area implicated in song discrimination. CM neurons respond sparsely to conspecific song and are tolerant of production variability. Intracellular recordings in CM have identified a diversity of intrinsic membrane dynamics, which could contribute to the emergence of these higher-order functional properties. We investigated this hypothesis using a novel linear-dynamical cascade model that incorporated detailed biophysical dynamics to simulate auditory responses to birdsong. Neuron models that included a low-threshold potassium current present in a subset of CM neurons showed increased selectivity and coding efficiency relative to models without this current. These results demonstrate the impact of intrinsic dynamics on sensory coding and the importance of including the biophysical characteristics of neural populations in simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "The steroid hormone testosterone (T) has been suggested to influence reactive aggression upon its action on the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a key brain region for threat detection. However, it is unclear whether T modulates resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the BLA, and whether this predicts subsequent aggressive behavior. Aggressive interactions themselves, which often induce changes in T concentrations, could further alter BLA rsFC, but this too remains untested. Here we investigated the effect of endogenous T on rsFC of the BLA at baseline as well as after an aggressive encounter, and whether this related to behavioral aggression in healthy young women (n=39). Pre-scan T was negatively correlated with basal rsFC between BLA and left superior temporal gyrus (STG), which in turn predicted increased aggression. BLA-STG coupling at rest might thus underlie hostile readiness in low-T women. In addition, coupling between the BLA and the right superior parietal lobule (SPL), a brain region involved in higher-order perceptual processes, was reduced in aggressive participants. On the other hand, post-task increases in rsFC between BLA and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) were linked to reduced aggression, consistent with the established notion that the mOFC regulates amygdala activity in order to curb aggressive impulses. Finally, competition-induced changes in T were associated with increased coupling between the BLA and the right lateral OFC, but this effect was unrelated to aggression. We thus identified connectivity patterns that prospectively predict aggression in women, and showed how aggressive interactions in turn impact these neural systems.",

Visual adaptation, an example of such an effect, has been hypothesized to improve stimulus discrimination by decorrelating responses across a set of neural units. While a central theoretical model, behavioral and neural evidence for this theory is limited and inconclusive. Here, we use a parametric 3D shape-space to test whether adaptation decorrelates shape representations in humans. In a behavioral experiment with 20 subjects, we find that adaptation to a shape class improves discrimination of subsequently presented stimuli with similar features. In a BOLD fMRI experiment with 10 subjects we observe that adaptation to a shape class decorrelates the multivariate representations of subsequently presented stimuli with similar features in object-selective cortex. These results support the long-standing proposal that adaptation improves perceptual discrimination and decorrelates neural representations, offering insights into potential underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which brain responses differ across varying cognitive demands is referred to as \\\"neural differentiation,\\\" and greater neural differentiation has been associated with better cognitive performance in older adults. An emerging approach has examined within-person neural differentiation using moment-to-moment brain signal variability. A number of studies have found that brain signal variability differs by cognitive state; however, the factors that cause signal variability to rise or fall on a given task remain understudied. We hypothesized that top performers would modulate signal variability according to the complexity of sensory input, upregulating variability when processing more feature-rich stimuli. In the current study, 46 older adults passively viewed face stimuli and house stimuli during fMRI. Low-level analyses of our stimuli showed that house images were more feature-rich than faces, and subsequent computational modelling of ventral visual stream responses (HMAX) revealed that houses were more feature-rich especially in V1/V2-like model layers. Notably, we then found that participants exhibiting greater face-to-house upregulation of brain signal variability in V1/V2 (higher for house relative to face stimuli) also exhibited more accurate, faster, and more consistent behavioral performance on a battery of offline visuo-cognitive tasks. Further, control models revealed that face-house modulation of mean brain signal was relatively insensitive to offline cognition, providing further evidence for the importance of brain signal variability for understanding human behavior. We conclude that the ability to align brain signal variability to the complexity of perceptual input may mark heightened trait-level behavioral performance in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Modern medicine and an increasingly complex environment contribute to exposure of humans to a large number of chemical compounds, that can potentially be toxic. Although widely used, compound testing in animals has important limitations. In vitro testing provides a promising alternative. However, because of the relative inaccessibility and fragmentation of available data, the in vitro approach largely underperforms its potential. The aim of this study is to investigate how available public online resources (tools and databases) support accessing and distribution of in vitro compound data. We examined 19 public online resources, mapped their features, and evaluated their usability with a set of four model compounds (aspirin, rosiglitazone, valproic acid, and tamoxifen). By investigating compound names and identifiers, we observed extensive variation and inconsistencies in available resources: the synonyms were different, compounds structural identifiers (InChI, InChIKey, SMILES and IUPAC systematic name) underperformed in omics databases, identification of compound related metadata (e.g. concentrations used in the experiments) from omics experiments was complex and none of the available resources clearly distinguished between in vivo and in vitro data. In addition, we estimated accessibility of selected public resources using computational queries. Only a few public resources provided access to compound-related data using semantic web technology. The general quality of experiment annotations created further difficulties in identifying data of interest. Therefore, we identified several standardized ontologies with potential to provide an increased accuracy for extensive data retrieval of in vitro compound data. Furthermore, using the examples of our model compounds, we provide recommendations on the use of ontologies by suggesting specific ontology terms to annotate in vitro experimental data when being published.",

X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis coupled to activity assays reveal a water-mediated hydrogen bond network linking the T0070907 pyridyl group to Arg288 that is essential for inverse agonism. NMR spectroscopy reveals that PPAR{gamma} exchanges between two long-lived conformations when bound to T0070907 but not GW9662, including a conformation that prepopulates a corepressor-bound state, priming PPAR{gamma} for high affinity corepressor binding. Our findings demonstrate that ligand engagement of Arg288 may provide new routes for developing PPAR{gamma} inverse agonist.",

    "abstract": "Some evidence suggests that there may be a limited \\\"window of opportunity\\\" for beneficial effects of hormone therapy on physiology after menopause in women. We tested, in aged, surgically menopausal (ovariectomized) rhesus monkeys, whether the timing of cyclic estradiol (E2) treatment impacted its effect on cognitive function. Monkeys were assigned to one of four treatment conditions after ovariectomy: either vehicle or E2 treatment for the duration of the protocol, vehicle for the first 2 years of the protocol followed by E2 for the remainder (delayed treatment), or E2 for the first year of the protocol followed by vehicle for the remainder (withdrawn treatment). Delayed treatment addressed the hypothesis that E2 treatment initiated more than 2 years after ovariectomy would have a reduced effect on cognitive function. Withdrawn treatment mirrors current clinical advice to women to use hormone therapy in the initial post-menopausal period then discontinue it. Two periods of cognitive testing assessed treatment effects on cognition over time. E2 treatment predominantly affected a prefrontal cortex-dependent test of spatiotemporal working memory (delayed response). Monkeys with delayed E2 treatment improved in delayed response performance over time, whereas vehicle-treated monkeys declined. Monkeys with withdrawn E2 treatment maintained their performance across assessments, as did monkeys treated with E2 across the entire protocol. These findings suggest that a \\\"window of opportunity\\\" for hormone treatment after cessation of ovarian function, if present in nonhuman primates, lasts longer than 2 years. It also supports the notion that beneficial effects of hormone therapy may persist after discontinuation of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Organisms use environmental cues for directed navigation. Depending on the sensory modality and complexity of the involved sensory organs, different types of information may be processed. Understanding the basic logic behind navigational decisions critically depends on the complexity of the nervous system. Due to the comparably simple organization of the nervous system of the fruit fly larva, it stands as a powerful model to study decision-making processes that underlie directed navigation. Here, we formulate a stochastic method based on biased Markov chains to model the behavioral basis of negative phototaxis. We have quantitatively measured phototaxis in response to defined sensory inputs. We find that larvae make navigational decisions by taking into account both light intensities and its spatial gradients, and our model allows us to quantify how larvae minimize their exposure to light intensity and at the same time maximize their distance to the source of light. The response to the light field is a non-linear response and saturates above an intensity threshold. Our mathematical model simulates and predicts larval behavioral dynamics only using light intensity and directionality as input parameters. Moreover, it allows us to evaluate the relative importance of these two factors governing visual navigation. The model has been validated with experimental biological data yielding insight into the strategy that larvae use to achieve their goal with respect to the navigational cue of light, paving the way for future work to study the role of the different neuronal components in this mechanism.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNavigational decision-making is a complex process during which the nervous system is able to decipher external input through molecular and cellular mechanisms to produce a spatially-coordinated behavioral output. Drosophila larvae provide an excellent model to understand these decision-making mechanisms as we can measure the behavioral output (larval navigation) in response to quantifiable external input (different light conditions). We have performed experiments to quantify larval light avoidance in order to subsequently design a mathematical model that quantitatively reproduces larval behavior. Our results allow us to characterize the relative importance of light intensity and directionality and yield insight into the neural algorithms used in the decision-making mechanism of larval phototaxis.",

Here, we develop a detailed mechanistic model of gene expression and resource allocation, which when simplified to a tractable level of complexity, allows the rational design of translational resource allocation controllers. Analysis of this model reveals a fundamental design trade-off; that reducing coupling acts to decrease gene expression. Through a sensitivity analysis of the experimentally tuneable controller parameters, we identify how each controller design parameter affects the overall closed-loop behaviour of the system, leading to a detailed set of design guidelines for optimally managing this trade-off. Based on our designs, we evaluated a number of alternative potential experimental implementations of the proposed system using commonly available biological components. Finally, we show that the controller is capable of dynamically allocating ribosomes as needed to restore modularity in a number of more complex synthetic circuits, such as the repressilator, and activation cascades composed of multiple interacting modules.",

These are: the pentose phosphate pathway coupled with reductive biosynthesis, and overall transamination capacity, including the synthesis of glutamate/glutamine. These provides the cofactors or substrates that enhance subsequent rate-limiting reactions in the synthesis of costly amino acids, and nucleotides, which are also induced in a methionine dependent manner. This thereby results in a biochemical cascade establishing an overall anabolic program. For this methionine mediated anabolic program leading to proliferation, cells co-opt a \\\"starvation stress response\\\" regulator, Gcn4p.

RNA-seq, while generally used to measure gene expression, can potentially also be used for identification of somatic mutations. However there has been little systematic evaluation of the utility of RNA-seq for identifying somatic mutations. Here, we develop and evaluate a pipeline for processing RNA-seq data from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors in order to identify somatic mutations. The pipeline entails the use of the STAR aligner 2-pass procedure jointly with MuTect2 from GATK to detect somatic variants. Variants identified from RNA-seq data were evaluated by comparison against the COSMIC and dbSNP databases, and also compared to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing. We also estimated the putative functional impact of coding variants in the most frequently mutated genes in GBM. Interestingly, variants identified by RNA-seq alone showed better representation of GBM-related mutations cataloged by COSMIC. RNA-seq-only data substantially outperformed the ability of WES to reveal potentially new somatic mutations in known GBM-related pathways, and allowed us to build a high-quality set of somatic mutations common to exome and RNA-seq calls. Using RNA-seq data in parallel with WES data to detect somatic mutations in cancer genomes can thus broaden the scope of discoveries and lend additional support to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing alone.",

Local and hormonal neuromodulation and sensory inputs onto these central pattern generating circuits play a significant role in the animals responses to perturbations, but are usually lost or removed during in vitro studies. To examine simultaneously the in vivo motor output of the heart and pyloric rhythms, we used photoplethysmography (PPG). In the population measured (n = 49), the heart rhythm frequencies ranged from 0.3-2.3 Hz. The pyloric rhythms varied from 0.2-1.6 Hz. During multiple hour-long recordings, many animals held at control temperature showed strong inhibitory bouts in which the heart decreased in frequency or become quiescent and the pyloric rhythm also decreased in frequency. Many animals show significant coherence in frequency between the rhythms at the frequency of the heart rhythm. We measured the simultaneous responses of the rhythms to temperature ramps by heating or cooling the saline bath while recording both the heart and pyloric muscle movements. Q10s, critical temperatures (temperatures at which function is compromised), and changes in frequency were calculated for each of the rhythms tested. The heart rhythm was more robust to high temperature than the pyloric rhythm.",

This is mediated, for the majority of proteins, by the highly conserved Sec machinery. The bacterial translocon - SecYMKEG - resides in the plasma membrane, where translocation is driven through rounds of ATP hydrolysis by the cytoplasmic SecA ATPase, and the proton motive force (PMF). We have used single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) alongside a combination of confocal and total internal reflection microscopy to gain access to SecY pore dynamics and translocation kinetics on timescales spanning milliseconds to minutes. This allows us to dissect and characterise the translocation process in unprecedented detail. We show that SecA, signal sequence, pre-protein and ATP hydrolysis each have important and specific roles in unlocking and opening the Sec channel, priming it for transport. After channel opening, translocation proceeds in two phases: an initiation phase independent of substrate length, and a length-dependent transport phase with an intrinsic translocation rate of ~ 40 amino acids per second for the model pre-protein substrate proOmpA. The initiation and translocation phases are both coupled to ATP hydrolysis while termination is ATP-independent. Distributions of translocation rates reflect the stochastic nature of the translocation process and are consistent with the recently proposed Brownian ratchet model [Allen et al. doi: 10.7554/eLife.15598]. The results allow us unparalleled access to the kinetics of the complex reaction and provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanism of protein secretion.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration refers to the ability of cells to translocate across a substrate or through a matrix. To achieve net movement requires spatiotemporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Computational approaches are neceary to identify and quantify the regulatory mechanisms that generate directed cell movement. To address this need, we developed computational tools, based on stochastic modeling, to analyze time series data for the position of randomly migrating cells. Our approach allows parameters that characterize cell movement to be efficiently estimated from time series data. We applied our methods to analyze the random migration of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFS). Our analysis revealed that these cells exist in two distinct states of migration characterized by differences in cell speed and persistence. Further analysis revealed that the Rho-family GTPase RhoG plays a role in establishing these two states. An important feature of our computational approach is that it provides a method for predicting the current migration state of an individual cell from time series data. Using this feature, we demonstrate that HeLa cells also exhibit two states of migration, and that these states correlate with differences in the spatial distribution of active Rac1.",

    "abstract": "In birds, exposure to testosterone during embryonic development can suppress immune function; however, it is unclear whether this is caused by direct stimulation of androgen receptors. Estradiol is synthesized from testosterone by the enzyme aromatase, and this conversion is a necessary step in many signaling pathways that are ostensibly testosterone-dependent. Many lines of evidence in mammals indicate that estradiol can affect immune function. We tested the hypothesis that immunosuppressive effects of avian in ovo testosterone exposure are mediated by conversion to estradiol by aromatase, using Fadrozole to inhibit aromatization of endogenous testosterone during a crucial period of embryonic immune system development in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus). We then measured total IgY antibody count, response to PHA challenge, mass of thymus and bursa of Fabricius, and plasma testosterone post-hatch on days 3 and 18. We predicted that if immunomodulation by testosterone is dependent on aromatization, then Fadrozole treatment would lead to elevated immune activity by inhibiting estrogen production. Conversely, if testosterone inhibits immune function directly by binding to androgen receptors, then Fadrozole treatment would likely not alter immune function. Fadrozole treated birds had decreased day 3 plasma IgY antibody titers but there was a strong trend towards increased day 18 thymic mass. Furthermore, Fadrozole treatment generated a positive relationship between testosterone and thymic mass in males, and tended to increase day 18 IgY levels for a given bursal mass in females. There was no effect on PHA response, bursal mass, or plasma testosterone at either age. Overall, Fadrozole treated birds tended to have elevated indicators of immune function, implicating aromatization as a relevant pathway through which developmental exposure to testosterone can affect immunity.",

Using ammonium monooxygenase alpha subunit gene as biomarker, the AOA communities were obviously segregated with water depth, except the upwelling regions. Besides, the AOA communities in the euphotic zones are more heterogeneous than in the mesopelagic zones (MPZs). Overall, water column A clade (WCA) distributes more evenly and widely in the euphotic zone and MPZs, while water column B clade (WCB) and SCM-like clade mainly distribute in MPZ and high latitude waters, respectively. At fine-scale genetic diversity, SCM1-like and 2 WCA subclades showed distinctive niche separation of distributional pattern. The AOA subclades were further divided into ecological significant taxonomic units (ESTUs), which were delineated from the distribution pattern of their corresponding subclades. For examples, ESTUs of WCA have different correlation with depth, nitrate to silicate ratio and salinity; SCM1-like-A was negatively correlated with irradiation; the other SCM-like ESTUs preferred low temperature and high nutrient conditions, etc. Our study provides new insight to the genetic diversity of AOA in global scale and its connections with environmental factors.",

We performed a genome-wide association study in over 92,000 individuals of European descent and identified 44 loci associated with PR interval (34 novel). Examination of the 44 loci revealed known and novel biological processes involved in cardiac atrial electrical activity, and genes in these loci were highly over-represented in several cardiac disease processes. Nearly half of the 61 independent index variants in the 44 loci were associated with atrial or blood transcript expression levels, or were in high linkage disequilibrium with one or more missense variants. Cardiac regulatory regions of the genome as measured by cardiac DNA hypersensitivity sites were enriched for variants associated with PR interval, compared to non-cardiac regulatory regions. Joint analyses combining PR interval with heart rate, QRS interval, and atrial fibrillation identified additional new pleiotropic loci. The majority of associations discovered in European-descent populations were also present in African-American populations. Meta-analysis examining over 105,000 individuals of African and European descent identified additional novel PR loci. These additional analyses identified another 13 novel loci.

BCL9 proteins and their Pygopus (Pygo) co-factors can participate in canonical Wnt signaling via binding to {beta}-catenin. Nonetheless, their contributions to vertebrate heart development remain uncharted. Here, combining zebrafish and mouse genetics, we document tissue-specific functions in canonical Wnt signaling for BCL9 and Pygo proteins during heart development. In a CRISPR-Cas9-based genotype-phenotype association screen, we uncovered that zebrafish mutants for bcl9 and pygo genes largely retain {beta}-catenin activity, yet develop cardiac malformations. In mouse, both systemic and lineage-specific loss of the Pygo-BCL9-{beta}-catenin complex caused heart defects with outflow tract malformations, aberrant cardiac septation and valve formation, and compact myocardium hypoplasia. Mechanistically, these phenotypes coincide with transcriptional deregulation during heart patterning, and Pygo2 associates with {beta}-catenin at cis-regulatory regions of cardiac genes. Taken together, our results establish BCL9 and Pygo as tissue-specific {beta}-catenin co-factors during vertebrate heart development. Our results further implicate alterations in BCL9 and BCL9L in human CHDs as possibly causative.",

This increased adaptive potential of allopolyploids can be particularly relevant for plant pathogens in their quest for host immune response evasion. Allodiploidization likely caused the shift in host range of the fungal pathogen plant Verticillium longisporum, as V. longisporum mainly infects Brassicaceae plants in contrast to haploid Verticillium spp. In this study, we investigated the allodiploid genome structure of V. longisporum and its evolution in the hybridization aftermath. The nuclear genome of V. longisporum displays a mosaic structure, as numerous contigs consists of sections of both parental origins. V. longisporum encountered extensive genome rearrangements, whereas the contribution of gene conversion is negligible. Thus, the mosaic genome structure mainly resulted from genomic rearrangements between parental chromosome sets. Furthermore, a mosaic structure was also found in the mitochondrial genome, demonstrating its bi-parental inheritance. In conclusion, the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of V. longisporum parents interacted dynamically in the hybridization aftermath. Conceivably, novel combinations of DNA sequence of different parental origin facilitated genome stability after hybridization and consecutive niche adaptation of V. longisporum.",

Here we show that spike-timing induced receptive field plasticity of individual visual cortex neurons in vivo is anchored by increases in synaptic strength of identified spines, and is accompanied by a novel decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene Arc. Similar changes accompany recovery of eye-specific responses following monocular deprivation. These findings demonstrate that Hebbian strengthening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses, in dendrites with heterogeneous synaptic inputs, co-operatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryArc-mediated local synaptic plasticity regulates reorganization of synaptic responses on dendritic stretches to mediate functional plasticity of neuronal responses in vivo.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of such bias remain unknown. While characterizing a mouse model for loss of the signaling scaffold coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A), which is mutated in ID and ASD, we identified biochemical and behavioral differences between males and females, and explored whether CC2D1A controls male-specific intracellular signaling.\\n\\nMethodsCC2D1A is known to regulate phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). We tested for activation PDE4D and downstream signaling molecules such as CREB in the hippocampus of Cc2d1a-deficient mice. We then performed behavioral studies in females to analyze learning and memory, social interactions, anxiety and hyperactivity. Finally, we targeted PDE4D activation with a PDE4D inhibitor to define how changes in PDE4D and CREB activity affect behavior in males and females.\\n\\nResultsWe found that in Cc2d1a-deficient males PDE4D is hyperactive leading to a reduction in CREB signaling, but this molecular deficit is not present in females. Cc2d1a-deficient females only show impairment in novel object recognition, and no other cognitive and social deficits that have been found in males. Restoring PDE4D activity using an inhibitor rescues male-specific cognitive deficits, but has no effect on females.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings show that CC2D1A regulates intracellular signaling in a male-specific manner in the hippocampus leading to male-specific behavioral deficits. We propose that male-specific signaling mechanisms are involved in establishing sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Indeed, survival rates for heart failure are worse than many common cancers and have not improved over time. Tadalafil is a clinically relevant drug that blocks phosphodiesterase 5 with high specificity and is used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using a sheep model of advanced heart failure, we show that tadalafil treatment results in a marked improvement in symptom-free survival, reverses transverse tubule loss and restore cardiac myocyte systolic calcium transient amplitude and the hearts chronotropic and contractile response to catecholamines. These effects are independent of changes in myocardial cGMP content and are associated with upregulation of both monomeric and dimerized forms of protein kinase G and of the cGMP hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase 2 and 3. We propose that the molecular switch for the loss of transverse tubules in heart failure and their restoration following tadalafil treatment involves the BAR domain protein Amphiphysin II (BIN1) and the restoration of catecholamine sensitivity is through reductions in G-protein receptor kinase 2, protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A abundance following phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "In this modern, data-driven age, governments, funders and publishers expect greater transparency and reuse of research data, as well as greater access to and preservation of the data that supports research findings. Community-developed standards, such as those for the identification1 and reporting2 of data, underpin reproducible and reusable research, aid scholarly publishing, and drive both the discovery and evolution of scientific practice. The number of these standardization efforts, driven by large organizations or at the grass root level, has been on the rise since the early 2000s. Thousands of community-developed standards are available (across all disciplines), many of which have been created and/or implemented by several thousand data repositories. Nevertheless, their uptake by the research community, however, has been slow and uneven. This is mainly because investigators lack incentives to follow and adopt standards. The situation is exacerbated if standards are not promptly implemented by databases, repositories and other research tools, or endorsed by infrastructures. Furthermore, the fragmentation of community efforts results in the development of arbitrarily different, incompatible standards. In turn, this leads to standards becoming rapidly obsolete in fast-evolving research areas.\\n\\nAs with any other digital object, standards, databases and repositories are dynamic in nature, with a  life cycle that encompasses formulation, development and maintenance; their status in this cycle may vary depending on the level of activity of the developing group or community. There is an urgent need for a service that enhances the information available on the evolving constellation of heterogeneous standards, databases and repositories, guides users in the selection of these resources, and that works with developers and maintainers of these resources to foster collaboration and promote harmonization. Such an informative and educational service is vital to reduce the knowledge gap among those involved in producing, managing, serving, curating, preserving, publishing or regulating data. A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, standards organizations, infrastructure providers and scholarly publishers-- both national and domain-specific as well global and general organizations-- have come together as a community, representing the core adopters, advisory board members, and/or key collaborators of the FAIRsharing resource.

Alternatively, dysregulation of these mechanisms contributes to extreme inflammation, deleterious tissue damage and impaired healing in various diseases. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a prototypical family of PRRs that may be powerful anti-inflammatory targets if agents can be designed that antagonize their harmful effects while preserving host defense functions. This requires an understanding of the complex interactions and consequences of targeting the TLR-mediated pathways as well as technologies to analyze and interpret these, which will then allow the simulation of perturbations targeting specific pathway components, predict potential outcomes and identify safe and effective therapeutic targets.\\n\\nResultsWe constructed a multiscale mathematical model that spans the tissue and intracellular scales, and captures the consequences of targeting various regulatory components of injury-induced TLR4 signal transduction on potential pro-inflammatory or pro-healing outcomes. We applied known interactions to simulate how inactivation of specific regulatory nodes affects dynamics in the context of injury and to predict phenotypes of potential therapeutic interventions. We propose rules to link model behavior to qualitative estimates of pro-inflammatory signal activation, macrophage infiltration, production of reactive oxygen species and resolution. We tested the validity of the model by assessing its ability to reproduce published data not used in its construction.\\n\\nConclusionsThese studies will enable us to form a conceptual framework focusing on TLR4-mediated ischemic repair to assess potential molecular targets that can be utilized therapeutically to improve efficacy and safety in treating ischemic/inflammatory injury.",

    "abstract": "REM Behavior Disorder (RBD) is now recognized as the prodromal stage of -synucleinopathies such as Parkinsons disease (PD). In this paper, we describe deep learning models for diagnosis/prognosis derived from a few minutes of eyes-closed resting electroencephalography data (EEG) collected from idiopathic RBD patients (n=121) and healthy controls (HC, n=91). A few years after the EEG acquisition (4 {+/-} 2 years), a subset of the RBD patients eventually developed either PD (n=14) or Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=13), while the rest remained idiopathic. We describe first a simple convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a five-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG spectrograms. We treat the data as in audio or image classification problems where deep networks have proven highly successful by exploiting compositional and translationally invariant features in the data. For comparison, we study an even simpler deep recurrent neural network using three stacked Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) cells or gated-recurrent unit (GRU) cells--with very similar results. The performance of these networks typically reaches 80% ({+/-}1%) classification accuracy in the balanced HC vs. PD-outcome classification problem. In particular, using data from a single EEG channel we obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 87% ({+/-}1%) while avoiding spectral feature selection. The trained classifier can also be used to generate synthetic spectrograms to study what spectrogram features are relevant for classification, pointing to the presence of theta band bursts and a decrease of power in the alpha band in future PD or DLB patients compared to HCs. We conclude that deep networks may provide a key tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets and enable the delivery of new biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDelirium affects 25% of older inpatients and is associated with long-term cognitive impairment and future dementia. However, no population studies have systematically ascertained cognitive function before, cognitive deficits during, and cognitive impairment after delirium. Therefore, there is a need to address the following question: does delirium, and its features (including severity, duration, and presumed aetiologies), predict long-term cognitive impairment, independent of cognitive impairment at baseline?\\n\\nMethodsThe Delirium and Population Health Informatics Cohort (DELPHIC) study is an observational population-based cohort study based in the London Borough of Camden. It is recruiting 2000 individuals aged [&ge;]70 years and prospectively following them for two years, including daily ascertainment of all inpatient episodes for delirium. Daily inpatient assessments include the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, the Observational Scale for Level of Arousal, and the Hierarchical Assessment of Balance and Mobility. Data on delirium aetiology is also collected. The primary outcome is the change in the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status at two years.\\n\\nDiscussionDELPHIC is the first population sample to assess older persons before, during and after hospitalisation. The cumulative incidence of delirium in the general population aged [&ge;]70 will be described. DELPHIC offers the opportunity to quantify the impact of delirium on cognitive and functional outcomes. Overall, DELPHIC will provide a real-time public health observatory whereby information from primary, secondary, intermediate and social care can be integrated to understand how acute illness is linked to health and social care outcomes.",
