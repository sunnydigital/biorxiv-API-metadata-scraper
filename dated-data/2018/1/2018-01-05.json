    "abstract": "In this work, mate choice is modeled by means of the abstract concept of mutual mating propensity. This only assumes that different type of couples can have different mating success. The model is adequate for any population where mating occurs among distinct types. There is no extra assumption about particular mating scheme or preference model. The concept of mutual mating propensity permits to express the observed change in the mating phenotypes as the gain in information with respect to random mating. The obtained expression is a form of the Price equation in which the mapping between ancestral and descendant population is substituted by a mapping between random mating and non random mating population.\\n\\nAt the same time, this framework provides the connection between mate choice and the exact mathematical partition of the choice effects, namely sexual isolation, sexual selection and a mixed effect. The sexual selection component is the sum of the intra-sexual male and female selection.\\n\\nThe proposed framework helps to unveil previously hidden invariants. For example, if the mutual preference between partner types is multiplicative there is no sexual isolation (inter-sexual selection) effect on the frequencies, i.e. the only possible effect of mate choice is intra-sexual selection. On the contrary, whatever the contribution of each partner to the mutual preference, if it comes as a non-multiplicative factor, there is at least an inter-sexual selection detectable effect.\\n\\nThis new view over the mate choice problem, permits to develop general mating propensity models and to make predictions of the mate choice effects that may emerge from such models. This possibility opens up the way for setting a general theory of model fitting and multimodel inference for mate choice.\\n\\nThus, it is suggested that the proposed framework, by describing mate choice as the flow of information due to non-random mating, provides a new important setting for exploring different mating models and their consequences.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic datasets contain billions of protein sequences that could greatly enhance large-scale functional annotation and structure prediction. Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of million of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 hours on a single server to 50% sequence identity, > 1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases. (Open-source software and Metaclust database: https://mmseqs.org/).",

We analyzed de novo variants (DNV) in 6753 parent-offspring trios ascertained for different NDD. In the subset of 1942 individuals with NDD with epilepsy, we identified 33 genes with a significant excess of DNV, of which SNAP25 and GABRB2 had previously only limited evidence for disease association. Joint analysis of all individuals with NDD also implicated CACNA1E as a novel disease gene. Comparing NDD with and without epilepsy, we found missense DNV, DNV in specific genes, age of recruitment and severity of intellectual disability to be associated with epilepsy. We further demonstrate to what extent our results impact current genetic testing as well as treatment, emphasizing the benefit of accurate genetic diagnosis in NDD with epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Human neuroscience research faces several challenges with regards to reproducibility. While scientists are generally aware that data sharing is an important component of reproducible research, it is not always clear how to usefully share data in a manner that allows other labs to understand and reproduce published findings. Here we describe a new open source tool, AFQ-Browser, that builds an interactive website as a companion to a published diffusion MRI study. Because AFQ-browser is portable -- it runs in any modern web-browser -- it can facilitate transparency and data sharing. Moreover, by leveraging new web-visualization technologies to create linked views between different dimensions of a diffusion MRI dataset (anatomy, quantitative diffusion metrics, subject metadata), AFQ-Browser facilitates exploratory data analysis, fueling new scientific discoveries based on previously published datasets. In an era where Big Data is playing an increasingly prominent role in scientific discovery, so will browser-based tools for exploring high-dimensional datasets, communicating scientific discoveries, sharing and aggregating data across labs, and publishing data alongside manuscripts.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCopy number variation is an important and abundant source of variation in the human genome, which has been associated with a number of diseases, especially cancer. Massively parallel next-generation sequencing allows copy number profiling with fine resolution. Such efforts, however, have met with mixed successes, with setbacks arising partly from the lack of reliable analytical methods to meet the diverse and unique challenges arising from the myriad experimental designs and study goals in genetic studies. In cancer genomics, detection of somatic copy number changes and profiling of allele-specific copy number (ASCN) are complicated by experimental biases and artifacts as well as normal cell contamination and cancer subclone admixture. Furthermore, careful statistical modeling is warranted to reconstruct tumor phylogeny by both somatic ASCN changes and single nucleotide variants. Here we describe a flexible computational pipeline, MARATHON, which integrates multiple related statistical software for copy number profiling and downstream analyses in disease genetic studies.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationMARATHON is publicly available at https://github.com/yuchaojiang/MARATHON.\\n\\nContactyuchaoj@email.unc.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of evolutionary biology is to identify key evolutionary transitions that correspond with shifts in speciation and extinction rates. Stochastic character mapping has become the primary method used to infer the timing, nature, and number of character state transitions along the branches of a phylogeny. The method is widely employed for standard substitution models of character evolution. However, current approaches cannot be used for models that specifically test the association of character state transitions with shifts in diversification rates such as state-dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) models. Here we introduce a new stochastic character mapping algorithm that overcomes these limitations, and apply it to study mating system evolution over a time-calibrated phylogeny of the plant family Onagraceae. Utilizing a hidden state SSE model we tested the association of the loss of self-incompatibility with shifts in diversification rates. We found that self-compatible lineages have higher extinction rates and lower net-diversification rates compared to self-incompatible lineages. Furthermore, these results provide empirical evidence for the \\\"senescing\\\" diversification rates predicted in highly selfing lineages: our mapped character histories show that the loss of self-incompatibility is followed by a short-term spike in speciation rates, which declines after a time lag of several million years resulting in negative net-diversification. Lineages that have long been self-compatible, such as Fuchsia and Clarkia, are in a previously unrecognized and ongoing evolutionary decline. Our results demonstrate that stochastic character mapping of SSE models is a powerful tool for examining the timing and nature of both character state transitions and shifts in diversification rates over the phylogeny.",

This is partly because currently available laboratory and in silico tools have not been calibrated to accurately identify all subspecies of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc). We here present the first such tool, SNPs to Identify TB ( SNP-IT). Applying SNP-IT to a collection of clinical genomes from a UK reference laboratory, we demonstrate an unexpectedly high number of M. orygis isolates. These are seen at a similar rate to M. bovis which attracts much health protection resource and yet M. orygis cases have not been previously described in the UK. From an international perspective it is possible that M. orygis is an underestimated zoonosis. As whole genome sequencing is increasingly integrated into the clinical setting, accurate subspecies identification with SNP-IT will allow the clinical phenotype, host range and transmission mechanisms of subspecies of the Mtbc to be studied in greater detail.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a recently discovered signaling molecule important for the survival of Firmicutes, a large bacterial group that includes notable pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. However, the exact role of this molecule has not been identified. dacA, the S. aureus gene encoding the diadenylate cyclase enzyme required for c-di-AMP production, cannot be deleted when bacterial cells are grown in rich medium, indicating that c-di-AMP is required for growth in this condition. Here, we report that an S. aureus dacA mutant can be generated in chemically defined medium. Consistent with previous findings, this mutant had a severe growth defect when cultured in rich medium. Using this growth defect in rich medium, we selected for suppressor strains with improved growth to identify c-di-AMP-requiring pathways. Mutations bypassing the essentiality of dacA were identified in alsT and opuD, encoding a predicted amino acid and osmolyte transporter, the latter of which we show here to be the main glycine betaine-uptake system in S. aureus. Inactivation of these transporters likely prevents the excessive osmolyte and amino acid accumulation in the cell, providing further evidence for a key role of c-di-AMP in osmotic regulation. Suppressor mutations were also obtained in hepS, hemB, ctaA and qoxB, coding for proteins required for respiration. Furthermore, we show that dacA is dispensable for growth in anaerobic conditions. Together, these finding reveal an essential role for the c-di-AMP signaling network in aerobic, but not anaerobic, respiration in S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "Change points in the dynamics of animal abundances have extensively been recorded in historical time series records. Little attention has been paid to the theoretical dynamic consequences of such change-points. Here we propose a change-point model of stochastic population dynamics. This investigation embodies a shift of attention from the problem of detecting when a change will occur, to another non-trivial puzzle: using ecological theory to understand and predict the post-breakpoint behavior of the population dynamics. The proposed model and the explicit expressions derived here predict and quantify how density dependence modulates the influence of the pre-breakpoint parameters into the post-breakpoint dynamics. Time series transitioning from one stationary distribution to another contain information about where the process was before the change-point, where is it heading and how long it will take to transition, and here this information is explicitly stated. Importantly, our results provide a direct connection of the strength of density dependence with theoretical properties of dynamic systems, such as the concept of resilience. Finally, we illustrate how to harness such information through maximum likelihood estimation for state-space models, and test the model robustness to widely different forms of compensatory dynamics. The model can be used to estimate important quantities in the theory and practice of population recovery.",

In the preclinical development of therapeutics for narcolepsy, efficacy tests are hindered by the lack of a non-EEG/EMG based translational test of symptom severity. The current methods study offers proof-of-principle that PiezoSleep (noninvasive, unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring of gross body movement, together with respiration patterns during behavioral quiescence), can be used to determine sleep/wake as applicable to the development of wake-promoting therapeutics. First, the translational wake-maintenance score (WMS, the ratio of time during the first half of the dark period spent in long wake bouts to short sleep bouts) of the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen was introduced as a means by which to rank narcoleptic orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type mice by sleep/wake fragmentation severity. Accuracy of the WMS to detect narcoleptic phenotypes were determined in genotype-confirmed orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type colony mates. The WMS was used to identify the most highly symptomatic mice for resource-intensive EEG/EMG studies for further analysis of specific arousal states. Second, PiezoSleep was demonstrated for use in high-throughput screening of wake-promoting compounds using modafinil in orexin/ataxin-3 and wild type mice.\\n\\nResultsThe WMS detected a narcoleptic phenotype with 89% sensitivity, 92% specificity and 98% positive predictive value. A 15-fold difference in WMS differentiated wild type littermates from the most severely affected orexin/ataxin-3 mice. Follow-up EEG/EMG study indicated 82% of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice with the lowest wake-maintenance scores met or exceeded the cataplexy-occurrence threshold ([&ge;] 3 bouts) for inclusion in therapeutic efficacy studies. In the PiezoSleep dose-response study, the ED50 for wake-promotion by modafinil was approximately 50 mg/kg in both genotypes. Using unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring, the efficacy of wake-promoting compounds can be determined in a 5-arm study with 60 mice in less than one week--a fraction of the time compared to EEG/EMG studies.\\n\\nConclusionsThe WMS on the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen quantifies the inability to sustain wakefulness and provides an accurate measure of the narcoleptic phenotype in mice.

We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a population of descending neurons, we found, that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multivariate fMRI analysis stress the importance of information inherent to voxel patterns. Key to interpreting these patterns is estimating the underlying dimensionality of neural representations. Dimensions may correspond to psychological dimensions, such as length and orientation, or involve other coding schemes. Unfortunately, the noise structure of fMRI data inflates dimensionality estimates and thus makes it difficult to assess the true underlying dimensionality of a pattern. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach to identify brain regions that carry reliable task-modulated signal and to derive an estimate of the signals functional dimensionality. We combined singular value decomposition with cross-validation to find the best low-dimensional projection of a pattern of voxel-responses at a single-subject level. Goodness of the low-dimensional reconstruction is measured as Pearson correlation with a test set, which allows to test for significance of the low-dimensional reconstruction across participants. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we derive the best estimate and associated uncertainty of underlying dimensionality across participants. We validated our method on simulated data of varying underlying dimensionality, showing that recovered dimensionalities match closely true dimensionalities. We then applied our method to three published fMRI data sets all involving processing of visual stimuli. The results highlight three possible applications of estimating the functional dimensionality of neural data. Firstly, it can aid evaluation of model-based analyses by revealing which areas express reliable, task-modulated signal that could be missed by specific models. Secondly, it can reveal functional differences across brain regions. Thirdly, knowing the functional dimensionality allows assessing task-related differences in the complexity of neural patterns.",

RNNs are biologically plausible models of neural circuits that learn to incorporate relevant temporal context without the need to make complicated assumptions about the use of prior information to predict the current state. When decoding animal position from spike counts in 1D and 2D-environments, we show that the RNN consistently outperforms a standard Bayesian model with flat priors. In addition, we also conducted a set of sensitivity analysis on the RNN decoder to determine which neurons and sections of firing fields were the most influential. We found that the application of RNNs to neural data allowed flexible integration of temporal context, yielding improved accuracy relative to a commonly used Bayesian approach and opens new avenues for exploration of the neural code.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBeing able to accurately self-localize is critical for most motile organisms. In mammals, place cells in the hippocampus appear to be a central component of the brain network responsible for this ability. In this work we recorded the activity of a population of hippocampal neurons from freely moving rodents and carried out neural decoding to determine the animals locations. We found that a machine learning approach using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allowed us to predict the rodents true positions more accurately than a standard Bayesian method with flat priors. The RNNs are able to take into account past neural activity without making assumptions about the statistics of neuronal firing. Further, by analyzing the representations learned by the network we were able to determine which neurons, and which aspects of their activity, contributed most strongly to the accurate decoding.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system has proven to be a powerful tool for genome editing, allowing for the precise modification of specific DNA sequences within a cell. Many efforts are currently underway to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the therapeutic correction of human genetic diseases. The most widely used homologs of the Cas9 protein are derived from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). Based on the fact that these two bacterial species cause infections in the human population at high frequencies, we looked for the presence of pre-existing adaptive immune responses to their respective Cas9 homologs, SaCas9 (S. aureus homolog of Cas9) and SpCas9 (S. pyogenes homolog of Cas9). To determine the presence of anti-Cas9 antibodies, we probed for the two homologs using human serum and were able to detect antibodies against both, with 79% of donors staining against SaCas9 and 65% of donors staining against SpCas9. Upon investigating the presence of antigen-specific T-cells against the two homologs in human peripheral blood, we found anti-SaCas9 T-cells in 46% of donors. Upon isolating, expanding, and conducting antigen re-stimulation experiments on several of these donors anti-SaCas9 T-cells, we observed an SaCas9-specific response confirming that these T-cells were antigen-specific. We were unable to detect antigen-specific T-cells against SpCas9, although the sensitivity of the assay precludes us from concluding that such T-cells do not exist. Together, this data demonstrates that there are pre-existing humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses to Cas9 in humans, a factor which must be taken into account as the CRISPR-Cas9 system moves forward into clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of HIV is known to occur by two mechanisms in vivo: the free virus pathway, where viral particles bud off an infected cell before attaching to an uninfected cell, and the cell-cell pathway, where infected cells form virological synapses through close contact with an uninfected cell. It has also been shown that HIV replication includes a positive feedback loop controlled by the viral protein Tat, which may act as a stochastic switch in determining whether an infected cell enters latency. In this paper, we introduce a simple mathematical model of HIV replication containing both the free virus and cell-cell pathways. Using this model, we demonstrate that the high multiplicity of infection in cell-cell transmission results in a suppression of latent infection, and that this modulation of latency through balancing the two transmission mechanisms can provide an evolutionary benefit to the virus. This benefit increases with decreasing overall viral fitness, which may provide a within-host evolutionary pressure toward more cell-cell transmission in late-stage HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "As a unique photosynthetic product in brown algae, mannitol exhibits high synthesis and accumulation in Saccharina japonica. Mannitol acts as a carbon-storage compound and is an osmoprotectant, imparting increased tolerance to osmotic stress. However, the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms in macroalgae have not been studied. Analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data has shown that mannitol metabolism in S. japonica is a circular pathway composed of four steps. In this study, one S. japonica mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (M1PDH2) and two mannitol-1-phosphatase (M1Pase) proteins were recombinantly expressed to analysis enzyme biochemical properties. RNA sequencing and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the gene expression patterns of mannitol metabolism in different generations, tissues, sexes, and abiotic stresses. Our findings revealed insights into the mannitol synthesis pathways in brown algae. All genes were constitutively expressed in all samples, allowing maintenance of basic mannitol anabolism and dynamic maintenance of the \\\"saccharide pool\\\" in vivo as the main storage and antistress mechanism. Enzyme assays confirmed that the recombinant proteins produced mannitol, with the specific activity of SjaM1Pase1 being 1.8-4831 times that of other algal enzymes. Combined with the transcriptional analysis, SjaM1Pase1 was shown to be the dominant gene of mannitol metabolism. Mannitol metabolism genes in multicellular filamentous (gametophyte) and large parenchyma thallus (sporophyte) generations had different expression levels and responded differently under environmental stresses (hyposaline and hyperthermia) in gametophytes and sporophytes. The considerable variation in enzyme characteristics and expression of mannitol synthesis genes suggest their important ecophysiological significance in the evolution of complex systems (filamentous and thallus) and environmental adaptation of Laminariales.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the brain controls behavior requires observing and manipulating neural activity in awake behaving animals. Neuronal firing is timed at millisecond precision. Therefore, to decipher temporal coding, it is necessary to monitor and control animal behavior at the same level of temporal accuracy. However, it is technically challenging to deliver sensory stimuli and reinforcers as well as to read the behavioral responses they elicit with millisecond precision. Presently available commercial systems often excel in specific aspects of behavior control, but they do not provide a customizable environment allowing flexible experimental design while maintaining high standards for temporal control necessary for interpreting neuronal activity. Moreover, delay measurements of stimulus and reinforcement delivery are largely unavailable. We combined microcontroller-based behavior control with a sound delivery system for playing complex acoustic stimuli, fast solenoid valves for precisely timed reinforcement delivery and a custom-built sound attenuated chamber using high-end industrial insulation materials. Together this setup provides a physical environment to train head-fixed animals, enables calibrated sound stimuli and precisely timed fluid and air puff presentation as reinforcers. We provide latency measurements for stimulus and reinforcement delivery and an algorithm to perform such measurements on other behavior control systems. Combined with electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations, the millisecond timing accuracy will help interpret temporally precise neural signals and behavioral changes. Additionally, since software and hardware provided here can be readily customized to achieve a large variety of paradigms, these solutions enable an unusually flexible design of rodent behavioral experiments.",

This nausea is likely the result of Pavlovian conditioning, where the previously neutral environment acquires conditioned properties, in this case conditioned nausea, because its association with feeling ill. To investigate this phenomenon under controlled conditions, we studied the acquisition of conditioned nausea using a distinct environment paired with an emetic drug in healthy young adults. We measured two indices of conditioning: i) conditioned place aversion, and ii) conditioned drug-like (nausea) responses. Healthy volunteers (N=32) first rated their preference for two testing rooms, and then underwent four conditioning sessions in which they received either syrup of ipecac (5 ml) or placebo. A Paired Group (PG; N=17) always received ipecac in their initially preferred room and placebo in the other, while an Unpaired Group (UG; N=15) received ipecac and placebo in both rooms. Conditioned responses were assessed with i) time spent in each room, ii) room liking and preference, and iii) feelings of nausea in each room. There was no evidence of conditioned place aversion as measured by either time spent or ratings of room liking. However, the PG did report a small increase in nausea in the ipecac-paired room. Although the conditioned responses in this study were not robust, this procedure is a first step towards studying conditioned aversive drug responses in humans, which will enable development of future studies to prevent or treat anticipatory nausea.",

    "abstract": "Migration of the neural crest lineage is critical to its physiological function. Mechanisms controlling neural crest migration are comparatively unknown, due to difficulties accessing this cell population in vivo. Here, we uncover novel requirements of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in regulating the neural crest. We demonstrate that GSK3 is tyrosine phosphorylated (pY) in neural crest cells and that this activation depends on anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a protein associated with neuroblastoma. Consistent with this, neuroblastoma cells with pathologically increased ALK activity express high levels of pY-GSK3 and migration of these cells can be inhibited by GSK3 or ALK blockade. In normal neural crest cells, loss of GSK3 leads to increased pFAK and misregulation of Rac1 and lamellipodin, key regulators of cell migration. Genetic reduction of GSK-3 results in failure of migration. All together, this work identifies a role for GSK3 in cell migration during neural crest development and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Current neurobiological models assign a central role to predictive processes calibrated to environmental statistics. Neuroimaging studies examining the encoding of stimulus uncertainty have relied almost exclusively on manipulations in which stimuli were presented in a single sensory modality, and further assumed that neural responses vary monotonically with uncertainty. This has left a gap in theoretical development with respect to two core issues: i) are there cross-modal brain systems that encode input uncertainty in way that generalizes across sensory modalities, and ii) are there brain systems that track input uncertainty in a non-monotonic fashion? We used multivariate pattern analysis to address these two issues using auditory, visual and audiovisual inputs. We found signatures of cross-modal encoding in frontoparietal, orbitofrontal, and association cortices using a searchlight cross-classification analysis where classifiers trained to discriminate levels of uncertainty in one modality were tested in another modality. Additionally, we found widespread systems encoding uncertainty non-monotonically using classifiers trained to discriminate intermediate levels of uncertainty from both the highest and lowest uncertainty levels. These findings comprise the first comprehensive report of cross-modal and non-monotonic neural sensitivity to statistical regularities in the environment, and suggest that conventional paradigms testing for monotonic responses to uncertainty in a single sensory modality may have limited generalizability.",

Here we introduce a new model, with a correction to Poisson statistics, which can accurately predict the regularity of neural spike trains in response to a repeated stimulus. The model has only two parameters, but can reproduce the observed variability in retinal recordings in various conditions. We show analytically why this approximation can work. In a model of the spike emitting process where a refractory period is assumed, we derive that our simple correction can well approximate the spike train statistics over a broad range of firing rates. Our model can be easily plugged to stimulus processing models, like Linear-nonlinear model or its generalizations, to replace the Poisson spike train hypothesis that is commonly assumed. It estimates the amount of information transmitted much more accurately than Poisson models in retinal recordings. Thanks to its simplicity this model has the potential to explain low variability in other areas.",

    "abstract": "Methionine (Met) is prone to oxidation and can be converted to Met sulfoxide (MetO), which exists as R- and S-diastereomers. MetO can be reduced back to Met by the ubiquitous methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) enzymes. Canonical MsrA and MsrB were shown as absolutely stereospecific for the reduction of S- and R-diastereomer, respectively. Recently, the molybdenum-containing protein MsrP, conserved in all gram-negative bacteria, was shown to be able to reduce MetO of periplasmic proteins without apparent stereospecificity in Escherichia coli. Here, we describe the substrate specificity of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides MsrP. Proteomics analysis coupled to enzymology approaches indicate that it reduces a broad spectrum of periplasmic oxidized proteins. Moreover, using model proteins, we demonstrated that RsMsrP preferentially reduces unfolded oxidized proteins and we confirmed that this enzyme, like its E. coli homolog, can reduce both R- and S-diastereomers of MetO with similar efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Release factors RF1 and RF2 promote hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA during translation termination. The GTPase RF3 promotes recycling of RF1 and RF2. Using single molecule FRET together with ensemble kinetics, we show that ribosome termination complexes that carry two factors, RF1-RF3 or RF2-RF3, are dynamic and fluctuate between non-rotated and rotated states, while each factor alone has its distinct signature on the ribosome dynamics and conformation. Dissociation of RF1 depends on peptide release and the presence of RF3, whereas RF2 can dissociate spontaneously. RF3 binds in the GTP-bound state and can rapidly dissociate without GTP hydrolysis from termination complex carrying RF1. GTP cleavage helps RF3 release from ribosomes stalled in the rotated state in the absence of RF1. Our data suggest how the stochastic assembly of the ribosome-RF1-RF3-GTP complex, peptide release, and ribosome fluctuations promote termination of protein synthesis and recycling of the release factors.",

    "abstract": "Combining anti-cancer drugs has the potential to increase treatment efficacy. Because patient responses to drug combinations are highly variable, predictive biomarkers of synergy are required to identify which patients are likely to benefit from a drug combination. To aid biomarker identification, the DREAM challenge consortium has recently released data from a screen containing 85 cell lines and 167 drug combinations. The main challenge of these data is the low sample size: per drug combination, a median of 14 cell lines have been screened. We found that widely used methods in single drug response prediction, such as Elastic Net regression per drug, are not predictive in this setting. Instead, we propose to use multi-task learning: training a single model simultaneously on all drug combinations, which we show results in increased predictive performance. In contrast to other multi-task learning approaches, our approach allows for the identification of biomarkers, by using a modified random forest variable importance score, which we illustrate using artificial data and the DREAM challenge data. Notably, we find that mutations in MYO15A are associated with synergy between ALK / IGFR dual inhibitors and PI3K pathway inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCombining drugs is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, it is often not known which patients will benefit from a particular drug combination. To identify patients that are likely to benefit, we need to identify biomarkers, such as mutations in the tumors DNA, that are associated with favorable response to the drug combination. In this work, we identified such biomarkers using the drug combination data released by the DREAM challenge consortium, which contain 85 tumor cell lines and 167 drug combinations. The main challenge of these data is the extremely low sample size: a median of 14 cell lines have been screened per drug combination. We found that traditional methods to identify biomarkers for monotherapy response, which analyze each drug separately, are not suitable in this low sample size setting. Instead, we used a technique called multi-task learning to jointly analyze all drug combinations in a single statistical model. In contrast to existing multi-task learning algorithms, which are black-box methods, our method allows for the identification of biomarkers. Notably, we find that, in a subset of breast cancer cell lines, MYO15A mutations associate with response to the combination of ALK / IGFR dual inhibitors and PI3K pathway inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Compiling the catalogue of genes actively involved in tumorigenesis (known as cancer drivers) is an ongoing endeavor, with profound implications to the understanding of tumorigenesis and treatment of the disease. An abundance of computational methods have been developed to screening the genome for candidate driver genes based on genomic data of somatic mutations in tumors. Most methods rely on detecting genes displaying excessive mutation rates compared to some background model. This approach is susceptible to false discoveries, due to its sensitivity to the assumptions of the background model, such as the need to account for hyper-mutated samples, cancer types and genomic loci. We present a fundamentally different approach. Instead of focusing on the number of mutations, we examine their content, and their expected effects on the functions of genes. We use a machine-learning model to predict functional effect scores of somatic mutations. For each gene, we compare the distribution of observed effect scores with the distribution expected at random, and report genes showing significant bias. By applying our framework on the ~20k protein-coding human genes, we detected 593 genes showing significant bias towards harmful mutations in the context of cancer. In contrast, we found only 6 significant genes biased in the opposite direction. The list of 593 genes, constructed without any prior knowledge of their role in cancer, shows an overwhelming overlap with known cancer driver genes, but also highlights many overlooked genes. These overlooked genes are promising candidates for novel cancer drivers. Our model is generic and is not restricted to the context of cancer. Applying the same framework to data of human-population genetic variation reveals the opposite trend. Unlike cancer, which is dominated by a bias towards harmful mutations, long-term evolution in healthy individuals results a bias towards less harmful mutations. The underlying assumptions of our framework are minimal, making it ideal for analyzing genetic data in search of genes subjected to positive or negative selection. It is fully open sourced and available for installation and use. Our framework presents a substantial development towards the application of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in genetic studies.",

Here, we report an oncogenic role of Naa10p in promoting metastasis of osteosarcomas. Higher NAA10 transcripts were observed in metastatic osteosarcoma tissues compared to non-metastatic tissues and were also correlated with a worse prognosis of patients. Knockdown and overexpression of Naa10p in osteosarcoma cells respectively led to decreased and increased cell migratory/invasive abilities. Re-expression of Naa10p, but not an enzymatically inactive mutant, relieved suppression of the invasive ability in vitro and metastasis in vivo imposed by Naa10p-knockdown. According to protease array screening, we identified that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 was responsible for the Naa10p-induced invasive phenotype. Naa10p was directly associated with MMP-2 protein through its acetyltransferase domain and maintained MMP-2 protein stability via NatA complex activity. MMP-2 expression levels were also significantly correlated with Naa10p levels in osteosarcoma tissues. These results reveal a novel function of Naa10p in the regulation of cell invasiveness by preventing MMP-2 protein degradation that is crucial during osteosarcoma metastasis.",

Rock pigeons (Columba livia) are fundamentally one of four color pattern phenotypes, in decreasing order of melanism: T-check, checker, bar (ancestral), or barless. Using whole-genome scans, we identified NDP as a candidate gene for this variation. Allele-specific expression differences in NDP indicate cis-regulatory differences between ancestral and melanistic alleles. Sequence comparisons suggest that derived alleles originated in the speckled pigeon (Columba guinea), providing a striking example of introgression of alleles that are favored by breeders and are potentially advantageous in the wild. In contrast, barless rock pigeons have an increased incidence of vision defects and, like two human families with hereditary blindness, carry start-codon mutations in NDP.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGiant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of vasculitis affecting elderly people. It is one of the few true ophthalmic emergencies. GCA is a heterogenous disease, symptoms and signs are variable thereby making it challenging to diagnose and often delaying diagnosis. A temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard to test for GCA, and there are currently no specific biochemical markers to categorize or aid diagnosis of the disease. We aimed to identify a less invasive method to confirm the diagnosis of GCA, as well as to ascertain clinically relevant predictive biomarkers by studying the transcriptome of purified peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in patients with GCA.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe recruited 16 patients with histological evidence of GCA at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (RVEEH), Melbourne, Australia, and aimed to collect blood samples at six time points: acute phase, 2-3 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after clinical diagnosis. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were positively selected at each time point through magnetic-assisted cell sorting (MACS). RNA was extracted from all 195 collected samples for subsequent RNA sequencing. The expression profiles of patients were compared to those of 16 age-matched controls. Over the 12-month study period, polynomial modelling analyses identified 179 and 4 statistically significant transcripts with altered expression profiles (FDR < 0.05) between cases and controls in CD4+ and CD8+ populations, respectively. In CD8+ cells, we identified two transcripts that remained differentially expressed after 12 months, namely SGTB, associated with neuronal apoptosis, and FCGR3A, which has been found in association with Takayasu arteritis (TA), another large vessel vasculitis. We detected genes that correlate with both symptoms and biochemical markers used in the acute setting for predicting long-term prognosis. 15 genes were shared across 3 phenotypes in CD4 and 16 across CD8 cells. In CD8, IL32 was common to 5 phenotypes: a history of Polymyalgia Rheumatica, both visual disturbance and raised neutrophils at the time of presentation, bilateral blindness and death within 12 months. Altered IL32 gene expression could provide risk evaluation of GCA diagnosis at the time of presentation and give an indication of prognosis, which may influence management.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first longitudinal gene expression study undertaken to identify robust transcriptomic biomarkers of GCA. Our results show cell type-specific transcript expression profiles, novel gene-phenotype associations, and uncover important biological pathways for this disease. These data significantly enhance the current knowledge of relevant biomarkers, their association with clinical prognostic markers, as well as potential candidates for detecting disease activity in whole blood samples. In the acute phase, the gene-phenotype relationships we have identified could provide insight to potential disease severity and as such guide us in initiating appropriate patient management.",

    "abstract": "Marine algae have an extraordinary ability to absorb halogens which provide algae with an inorganic antioxidant impacting atmospheric chemistry. Although brown algal Laminariales species are the most efficient iodine accumulators among all living systems, and Saccharina japonica is the primary material used for iodine extraction, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of these species have not been fully documented. In this study, a functional genomics analysis of the algal vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (vHPO) gene family was conducted; there genes can introduce halogen atoms into organic compounds. The comprehensive analyses regarding the bioinformatics and phylogenetics of novel genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data of 21 Rhodophyta and 19 Ochrophyta marine algal species revealed that brown algal vHPOs have two gene types, vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase (vBPO) and vanadium-dependent iodoperoxidase (vIPO), with secondary endosymbiotic host origin. The enzyme activity of S. japonica vBPO and vIPO were verified for the first time and were quite stable in a wide range of temperature and pH values. However, the specific activity and optimal conditions were considerably different between vBPO and vIPO. The transcript expression analysis in different S. japonica tissues (including rhizoids), generations (sporophytes and gametophytes), sexes (male and female), and stress conditions (hyposaline and hyperthermia) also showed great differences between vBPOs and vIPOs. Most of the vBPOs were constitutively expressed with higher expression dose, which may be responsible for basal halogen metabolism. On the contrary, vIPOs mainly showed specific expression, which may be involved in tissue differentiation, generation differentiation, sex differentiation, and stress regulation. Comprehensive analysis of gene family evolution, enzyme biochemical characteristics, and complex transcriptional mechanisms were conducive to the environmental adaptation and sophisticated system evolution of Laminariales. The successful bromination of small-molecule compound substrate by SjavBPO provided high activity and efficient enzymatic tools for artificial synthesis of halogenated compounds.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is known to be pivotal for spatial memory but emerging evidence suggests its contribution to temporal memories as well. However, it is not clear how the hippocampus represents time and how it synchronizes spatial and temporal presentations into a coherent memory. We assessed the specific role of hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations and their interaction in short-term timing of motor reactions. Rats were trained to maintain lever pressing for 2.5 s and then to quickly release the lever and retrieve water reward from a nearby water port guided by a cue light. In essence, this task allows observation of hippocampal rhythms during timed anticipation when no overt movements take place. Then we implanted wire electrodes to five hippocampal layers for recording local field potentials during the task. Consistent with earlier reports, theta showed a declining trend during the lever press. We also found that fast-gamma declined in tandem with theta while slow-gamma showed an opposite trend. Theta-phase to gamma-amplitude cross-frequency coupling measured with modulation index (MI) varied significantly between the three task phases. Interestingly, also changes in MI were opposite for fast- and slow-gamma. The MI was also related to the task performance, so that during omission trials the MI for fast-gamma in CA1 was smaller than during trials with premature lever release. In addition, the MI in dentate hilus was higher during all error trials than during correctly performed trials. Collectively, these data suggest an important role of synchronization of hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms to timing of cued motor reactions.",

    "abstract": "Humans and animals can flexibly switch rules to generate appropriate motor commands; for example, actions can be flexibly produced toward a sensory stimulus (e.g., pro-saccade or pro-reaching) or away from a sensory stimulus (e.g., anti-saccade or anti-reaching). Distinct neural activities are related to pro- and anti-movement actions; however, the effects of switching rules on motor learning are unclear. Here, we study the effect of switching rules on motor learning using pro- and anti-arm-reaching movements and a visuomotor rotation task. Although previous results support the perfect availability of learning effects under the same required movements, we show that the learning effects trained in pro-reaching movements are partially rather than perfectly available in anti-reaching movements even under the same required movement direction between those two conditions. The partial transfer is independent of the difference in the visual cue, the cognitive demand, and the actual movement direction between the pro- and anti-reaching movements. We further demonstrate that the availability of learning effects trained with pro-reaching movements is partial not only in anti-reaching movements but in reaching movements with other rules and the availability of learning effects trained with anti-reaching movements is also partial in pro-reaching movements. We thus conclude that the switching rule causes the availability of learning effects to be partial rather than perfect even under same planned movements.\\n\\nNew & Noteworthy\\n\\nMost motor learning experiments supported the involvement of planned movement directions in motor learning; the learning effects trained in a movement direction can be available at movement directions close to the trained one.

    "abstract": "Humans are capable of integrating social contextual information into decision-making processes to adjust their attitudes towards inequity. This context-dependency emerges both when individual is better off (i.e. advantageous inequity) and worse off (i.e. disadvantageous inequity) than others. It is not clear however, whether the context-dependent processing of advantageous and disadvantageous inequity rely on dissociable or shared neural mechanisms. Here, by combining an interpersonal interactive game that gave rise to interpersonal guilt and different versions of the dictator games that enabled us to characterize individual weights on aversion to advantageous and disadvantageous inequity, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the two forms of inequity aversion in the interpersonal guilt context. In each round, participants played a dot-estimation task with an anonymous co-player. The co-players received pain stimulation with 50% probability when anyone responded incorrectly. At the end of each round, participants completed a dictator game, which determined payoffs of him/herself and the co-player. Both computational model-based and model-free analyses demonstrated that when inflicting pain upon co-players (i.e., the guilt context), participants cared more about advantageous inequity and became less sensitive to disadvantageous inequity, compared with other social contexts. The contextual effects on two forms of inequity aversion are uncorrelated with each other at the behavioral level. Neuroimaging results revealed that the context-dependent representation of inequity aversion exhibited a spatial gradient in activity within the insula, with anterior parts predominantly involved in the aversion to advantageous inequity and posterior parts predominantly involved in the aversion to disadvantageous inequity. The dissociable mechanisms underlying the two forms of inequity aversion are further supported by the involvement of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in advantageous inequity processing, and the involvement of right amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in disadvantageous inequity processing. These results extended our understanding of decision-making processes involving inequity and the social functions of inequity aversion.",

    "abstract": "The output arm of the sleep homeostat in Drosophila is a group of neurons with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFSB) of the central complex in the brain. However, neurons that regulate the sleep homeostat remain poorly understood. Using neurogenetic approaches combined with ex vivo Ca2+ imaging, we identify two groups of sleep-regulatory neurons that modulate the activity of the sleep homeostat in an opposing fashion. The sleep-promoting neurons activate the sleep homeostat with glutamate, whereas the arousal-promoting neurons down-regulate the sleep homeostat output with dopamine. Co-activating these two inputs leads to frequent shifts between sleep and wake states. We also show that dFSB sleep homeostat neurons release the neurotransmitter GABA that inhibits octopaminergic arousal neurons. Taken together, we suggest coordinated neuronal activity of sleep- and arousal-promoting neurons is essential for stabilizing sleep/wake states.",

    "abstract": "Biological effects of hormones in both plants and animals are based on high-affrnity interaction with cognate receptors resulting in their activation. The signal of cytokinins, classical plant hormones, is perceived in Arabidopsis by three homologous membrane receptors: AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1/AHK4. To study the cytokinin-receptor interaction, we used 25 derivatives of potent cytokinin N6-benzyladenine (BA) with substituents in the purine heterocycle and/or in the side chain. The study was focused primarily on individual cytokinin receptors from Arabidopsis. The main in planta assay system was based on Arabidopsis double mutants retaining only one isoform of cytokinin receptors and harboring cytokinin-sensitive reporter gene. Classical cytokinin biotest with Amaranthus seedlings was used as an additional biotest. In parallel, the binding of ligands to individual cytokinin receptors was assessed in the in vitro test system. Quantitative comparison of results of different assays confirmed the partial similarity of ligand-binding properties of receptor isoforms. Substituents at positions 8 and 9 of adenine moiety, elongated linker up to 4 methylene units, replacement of N6 by sulfur or oxygen, resulted in suppression of cytokinin activity of the derivative towards all receptors. Introduction of a halogen into position 2 of adenine moiety, on the contrary, often increased the ligand activity, especially toward AHK3. Features both common and distinctive of cytokinin receptors in Arabidopsis and Amaranthus were revealed, highlighting species specificity of the cytokinin perception apparatus. Correlations between extent of compound binding to a receptor in vitro and its ability to activate the same receptor in planta were evaluated for each AHK protein. Interaction patterns between individual receptors and ligands were rationalized by structure analysis and molecular docking in sensory modules of AHK receptors. The best correlation between docking scores and specific binding was observed for AHK3. In addition, receptor-specific ligands have been discovered with unique properties to predominantly activate or block distinct cytokinin receptors. These ligands are promising for practical application and as molecular tools in the study of the cytokinin perception by plant cells.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/241281_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (85K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fef3f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143a10eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102d62corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13b1db1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Individual cytokinin receptors from Arabidopsis were assayed in planta, in vitro and in silico with 25 different 6-benzyladenine derivatives, new receptor-specific cytokinins were revealed.",

The genus Fornasinius Bertoloni was established in 1853 by Giuseppe Bertoloni to receive a taxon that was sufficiently distinct from the known representatives of the genus Goliathus Lamarck to merit a different placement. In spite of their large size and showy appearance, the members of the genus Fornasinius are poorly known. Here, the type species of the genus, F. fornasini Bertoloni, 1853 (type locality: Mozambique), is identified and re-described. It has emerged that F. fornasini Bertoloni has been misidentified after its original description and that only a few specimens are known of this species. F. fornasini sensu auct. (nec Bertoloni) is instead referable to another taxon, F. hauseri Kraatz, 1896 sp. bon., of which three subspecies can be distinguished: F. hauseri s. str., from south-central Kenya and possibly Cameroon; F. hauseri ssp. hirthi Preiss, 1904 stat. rev., from the Lake Victoria region and northern Tanzania; and a new subspecies to be described from south-east Democratic Republic of the Congo.",

Here we show that a normal diffusion of replication fork components towards localized potential replication origins (p-oris) can more simply account for the I(t) universal bell shape, as a consequence of a competition between the origin firing time and the time needed to replicate DNA separating two neighboring p-oris. We predict the I(t) maximal value to be the product of the replication fork speed with the squared p-ori density. We show that this relation is robustly observed in simulations and in experimental data for several eukaryotes. Our work underlines that fork-component recycling and potential origins localization are sufficient spatial ingredients to explain the universality of DNA replication kinetics.",

    "abstract": "Safe delivery of CRISPR/Cas endonucleases remains one of the major barriers to the widespread application of in vivo genome editing including the anticipatory treatment of monogenic retinal diseases. We previously reported the utility of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated CRISPR/Cas genome editing in the retina; however, with this type of viral delivery system, active endonucleases will remain in the retina for an extended period, making genotoxicity a significant consideration in clinical applications. To address this issue, we have designed a self-destructing \\\"kamikaze\\\" CRISPR/Cas system that disrupts the Cas enzyme itself following expression. Four guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), after in situ validation, the selected sgRNAs were cloned into a dual AAV vector. One construct was used to deliver SpCas9 and the other delivered sgRNAs directed against SpCas9 and the target locus (yellow fluorescent protein, YFP), in the presence of mCherry. Both constructs were packaged into AAV2 vector and intravitreally administered in C57BL/6 and Thy1-YFP transgenic mice. After 8 weeks the expression of SpCas9, the efficacy of YFP gene disruption was quantified. A reduction of SpCas9 mRNA was found in retinas treated with AAV2-mediated-YFP/SpCas9 targeting CRISPR/Cas compared to those treated with YFP targeting CRISPR/Cas alone. We also show that AAV2-mediated delivery of YFP/SpCas9 targeting CRISPR/Cas significantly reduced the number of YFP fluorescent cells among mCherry-expressing cells (~85.5% reduction compared to LacZ/SpCas9 targeting CRISPR/Cas) in transfected retina of Thy1-YFP transgenic mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that a self-destructive \\\"kamikaze\\\" CRISPR/Cas system can be used as a robust tool for refined genome editing in the retina, without compromising on-target efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Hi-C and capture Hi-C (CHi-C) are used to map physical contacts between chromatin regions in cell nuclei using high-throughput sequencing. Analysis typically proceeds considering the evidence for contacts between each possible pair of fragments independent from other pairs. This can produce long runs of fragments which appear to all make contact with the same baited fragment of interest. We hypothesised that these long runs could result from a smaller subset of direct contacts and propose a new method, based on a Bayesian sparse variable selection approach, which attempts to fine map these direct contacts.\\n\\nOur model is conceptually novel, exploiting the spatial pattern of counts in CHi-C data, and prioritises fragments with biological properties that would be expected of true contacts. For bait fragments corresponding to gene promoters, we identify contact fragments with active chromatin and contacts that correspond to edges found in previously defined enhancer-target networks; conversely, for intergenic bait fragments, we identify contact fragments corresponding to promoters for genes expressed in that cell type. We show that long runs of apparently co-contacting fragments can typically be explained using a subset of direct contacts consisting of < 10% of the number in the full run, suggesting that greater resolution can be extracted from existing datasets. Our results appear largely complementary to the those from a per-fragment analytical approach, suggesting that they provide an additional level of interpretation that may be used to increase resolution for mapping direct contacts in CHi-C experiments.",

Although diet is among the most powerful available tools for affecting the health of humans and their relationship with their microbiota, investigation into the effects of diet on CDI has been limited. Here, we show in mice that the consumption of microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary plant polysaccharides has a significant impact on CDI.

Here, we focus on the function of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor in the mouse adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) which generates olfactory bulb neurons. We find that OTX2 secreted by choroid plexus is transferred to supporting cells of the V-SVZ and rostral migratory stream. Deletion of Otx2 in choroid plexus affects neuroblast migration and reduces the number of olfactory bulb newborn neurons. Adult neurogenesis was also decreased by expressing secreted single-chain antibodies to sequester OTX2 in the cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating the importance of non-cell autonomous OTX2. We show that OTX2 activity modifies extracellular matrix components and signaling molecules produced by supporting astrocytes.

It has been hypothesized that, under some circumstances, this can result in the pre-activation of specific lexico-semantic representations. We asked whether such representationally specific semantic pre-activation can be detected in the brain ahead of encountering bottom-up input. We measured MEG activity as participants read highly constraining sentences in which the final word could be predicted. We found that both spatial and temporal patterns of the brain activity prior to the onset of this word were more similar when the same words were predicted than when different words were predicted. This pre-activation was transient and engaged a left inferior and medial temporal region. These results suggest that unique spatial patterns of neural activity associated with the pre-activation of distributed semantic representations can be detected prior to the appearance of new sensory input, and that the left inferior and medial temporal regions may play a role in temporally binding such representations, giving rise to specific lexico-semantic predictions.",

However, the effectiveness of such targeted treatments is often hampered by innate or acquired resistance due to feedbacks, crosstalks or network adaptations in response to drug treatment. Addressing this problem requires an understanding of these networks and how they differ between cells with different oncogenic mutations or between sensitive and resistant cells. Here, we present Comparative Network Reconstruction (CNR), a computational method to reconstruct signaling networks based on incomplete perturbation data, and to identify which edges differ quantitatively between two or more signalling networks. Prior knowledge about network topology is not required but can straightforwardly be incorporated. We extensively tested our approach using simulated data and applied it to perturbation data from a BRAF mutant cell line that developed resistance to BRAF inhibition. Comparing the reconstructed networks of sensitive and resistant cells suggests that the resistance mechanism involves re-establishing wildtype MAPK signaling, possibly through an alternative RAF-isoform.",

The main method for studying these models mathematically has been the computation of generating functions by solving hyperbolic partial differential equations. Here, we analyze these models using a probabilistic approach similar to the one Durrett and Moseley [7] used to study branching process models of cancer. This more intuitive approach leads to simpler formulas and new insights into the behavior of these models. Unfortunately, the examples we consider suggest that fitting multi-stage models has very little power to make inferences about the number of stages unless parameters are constrained to take on realistic values.",

    "abstract": "In the face of the biodiversity crisis, it is argued that we should prioritize species in order to capture high functional diversity (FD). Because species traits often reflect shared evolutionary history, many researchers have advocated for a \\\"phylogenetic gambit\\\": maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD) should indirectly capture FD. For the first time, we empirically test this gambit using data from >15,000 vertebrate species and ecologically-relevant traits. Maximizing PD results in an average gain of 18% of FD relative to random choice. However, this average gain hides the fact that in over 1/3 of the comparisons, maximum PD sets contain less FD than randomly chosen sets of species. These results suggest that, while maximizing PD protection can help to protect FD, it represents a risky strategy.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipFM, MP, MC, SD, GVDR, RG, AOM, CT and WP conceived the design of the study.

    "abstract": "Acoustic sampling methods are becoming increasingly important in biological monitoring. Sound attenuation is one of the most important dynamics affecting the utility of bioacoustic data as it directly affects the probability of detection of individuals from bioacoustic arrays and especially the localization of acoustic signals necessary in telemetry studies. Therefore, models of sound attenuation are necessary to make efficient use of bioacoustic data in ecological monitoring and assessment applications. Models of attenuation in widespread use are based on Euclidean distance between source and sensor, which is justified under spherical attenuation of sound waves in homogeneous environments. In some applications there are efforts to evaluate the detection range of sensors in response to local environmental characteristics at the sensor or at sentinel source locations with known environmental characteristics. However, attenuation is a function of the total environment between source and sensor, not just their locations. In this paper I develop a model of signal attenuation based on a non-Euclidean cost-weighted distance metric which contains resistance parameters that relate to environmental heterogeneity in the vicinity of an array. Importantly, these parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood using experimental data from an array of fixed sources, thus allowing investigators who use bioacoustic methods to devise explicit models of sound attenuation in situ. In addition, drawing on analogy with classes of models known as spatial capture-recapture, I show that parameters of the non-Euclidean model of attenuation can be estimated when source locations are unknown. Thus, the models can be applied to real field studies which require localization of signals in heterogeneous environments.",

Changes in gene expression, whether dynamic or evolved, are an important way in which environmental responses are mediated; however, much is still unknown about how the molecular networks underlying plastic phenotypes evolve. Here, we compare transcriptional responses to acute heat stress among four populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei--one selected to withstand heat stress, one selected under oxidative stress, an unselected control, and the ancestral population. We used a weighted gene coexpression network analysis within these lines to identify transcriptional modules, which are sets of genes that respond similarly to stress via plastic responses, evolutionary responses, or both. The transcriptional response to acute heat stress is dominated by a plastic response that is shared in the ancestor and all evolved populations. However, we also identified several modules that respond to artificial selection by (1) changing the baseline level of expression, (2) altering the magnitude of the plastic response, or (3) a combination of the two. Our findings reveal that while it is possible to perturb the nature of the transcriptional response network with short bouts of intense selection, the overall structure of transcriptional plasticity is dominated by inherent, ancestral regulatory systems.",

    "abstract": "During pregnancy, the placenta protects the fetus against the maternal immune response, as well as bacterial and viral pathogens. Bacterial pathogens that have evolved specific mechanisms of breaching this barrier, such as Listeria monocytogenes, present a unique opportunity for learning how the placenta carries out its protective function. We previously identified the L. monocytogenes protein Internalin P (InlP) as a secreted virulence factor critical for placental infection (1). Here, we show that InlP, but not the highly similar L. monocytogenes internalin Lmo2027, binds to human afadin (encoded by AF-6), a protein associated with cell-cell junctions. A crystal structure of InlP reveals several unique features, including an extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a distinctive Ca2+-binding site. Despite afadins involvement in the formation of cell-cell junctions, MDCK epithelial cells expressing InlP displayed a decrease in the magnitude of the traction stresses they could exert on deformable substrates, similar to the decrease in traction exhibited by AF-6 knock-out MDCK cells. L. monocytogenes {Delta}inlP mutants were deficient in their ability to form actin-rich protrusions from the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers, a necessary step in the crossing of such monolayers (transcytosis). A similar phenotype was observed for bacteria expressing an internal in-frame deletion in inlP (inlP DLRR5) that specifically disrupts its interaction with afadin. However, afadin deletion in the host cells did not rescue the transcytosis defect. We conclude that secreted InlP targets cytosolic afadin to specifically promote L. monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection.",

    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) oxidation is one of Earths major biogeochemical processes, key to weathering, soil formation, water quality, and corrosion. However, our understanding of microbial contribution is limited by incomplete knowledge of microbial iron oxidation mechanisms, particularly in neutrophilic iron-oxidizers. The genomes of many, diverse iron-oxidizers encode a homolog to an outer-membrane cytochrome (Cyc2) shown to oxidize iron in two acidophiles. Phylogenetic analyses show Cyc2 sequences from neutrophiles cluster together, suggesting a common function, though this function has not been verified in these organisms. Therefore, we investigated the iron oxidase function of heterologously expressed Cyc2 from a neutrophilic iron-oxidizer Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1. Cyc2PV-1 is capable of oxidizing iron, and its redox potential is 208 {+/-} 20 mV, consistent with the ability to accept electrons from Fe2+ at neutral pH. These results support the hypothesis that Cyc2 functions as an iron oxidase in neutrophilic iron-oxidizing organisms. Sequence analysis and modeling reveal the entire Cyc2 family share a unique fused cytochrome-porin structure, with a defining consensus motif in the cytochrome region. Based on structural analyses, we predict that the monoheme cytochrome Cyc2 specifically oxidizes dissolved Fe2+, in contrast to multiheme iron oxidases, which may oxidize solid Fe(II). With our results, there is now functional validation for diverse representatives of Cyc2 sequences. We present a comprehensive Cyc2 phylogenetic tree and offer a roadmap for identifying cyc2/Cyc2 homologs and interpreting their function. The occurrence of cyc2 in many genomes beyond known iron-oxidizers presents the possibility that microbial iron oxidation may be a widespread metabolism.\n\nImportanceIron is practically ubiquitous across Earths environments, central to both life and geochemical processes, which depend heavily on the redox state of iron. Although iron oxidation, or \"rusting,\" can occur abiotically at near neutral pH, we find neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) are widespread, including in aquifers, sediments, hydrothermal vents, pipes, and water treatment systems. FeOB produce highly reactive Fe(III) oxyhydroxides that bind a variety of nutrients and toxins, thus these microbes are likely a controlling force in iron and other biogeochemical cycles. There has been mounting evidence that Cyc2 functions as an iron oxidase in neutrophiles, but definitive proof of its function has long eluded us. This work provides conclusive biochemical evidence of iron oxidation by Cyc2 from neutrophiles. Cyc2 is common to a wide variety of iron-oxidizers, including acidophilic and phototrophic iron-oxidizers, suggesting that this fused cytochrome-porin structure is especially well-adapted for iron oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Microbes frequently rely on metabolites excreted by other bacterial species, but little is known about how this cross-feeding influences the effect of antibiotics. We hypothesized that when species rely on each other for essential metabolites, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for all species will drop to that of the \\\"weakest link\\\" - the species least resistant in monoculture. We tested this hypothesis in an obligate cross-feeding system that was engineered between Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Methylobacterium extorquens. The effect of tetracycline and ampicillin were tested on both liquid and solid media. In all cases, resistant species were inhibited at significantly lower antibiotic concentrations in the cross-feeding community than in monoculture or a competitive community. However, deviation from the \\\"weakest link\\\" hypothesis was also observed in cross-feeding communities apparently as result of changes in the timing of growth and cross-protection. Comparable results were also observed in a clinically relevant system involving facultative cross-feeding between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an anaerobic consortium found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa was inhibited by lower concentrations of ampicillin when cross-feeding than when grown in isolation. These results suggest that cross-feeding significantly alters tolerance to antibiotics in a variety of systems.",

    "abstract": "Correlations in sensory neural networks have both extrinsic and intrinsic origins. Extrinsic or stimulus correlations arise from shared inputs to the network, and thus depend strongly on the stimulus ensemble. Intrinsic or noise correlations reflect biophysical mechanisms of interactions between neurons, which are expected to be robust to changes of the stimulus ensemble. Despite the importance of this distinction for understanding how sensory networks encode information collectively, no method exists to reliably separate intrinsic interactions from extrinsic correlations in neural activity data, limiting our ability to build predictive models of the network response. In this paper we introduce a general strategy to infer population models of interacting neurons that collectively encode stimulus information. The key to disentangling intrinsic from extrinsic correlations is to infer the couplings between neurons separately from the encoding model, and to combine the two using corrections calculated in a mean-field approximation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on retinal recordings. The same coupling network is inferred from responses to radically different stimulus ensembles, showing that these couplings indeed reflect stimulus-independent interactions between neurons. The inferred model predicts accurately the collective response of retinal ganglion cell populations as a function of the stimulus.",

By comparing the performances of Maximum Entropy models at predicting neural activity in wakefulness and deep sleep, we identify the dominant interactions between neurons in each brain state. We find that during wakefulness, dominant functional interactions are pairwise while during sleep, interactions are population-wide. In particular, inhibitory neurons are shown to be strongly tuned to the inhibitory population. This shows that Maximum Entropy models can be useful to analyze data-sets with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and can reveal the role of inhibitory neurons in organizing coherent dynamics in cerebral cortex.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous multislice (SMS) acquisition can be used to decrease the time between acquisition of fMRI volumes, which can increase sensitivity by facilitating the removal of higher-frequency artifacts and boosting effective sample size. The technique requires an additional processing step in which the slices are separated, or unaliased, to recover the whole brain volume. However, this may result in signal \\\"leakage\\\" between aliased locations, i.e., slice \\\"leakage,\\\" and lead to spurious activation (decreased specificity). SMS can also lead to noise amplification, which can reduce the benefits of decreased repetition time. In this study, we evaluate the original slice-GRAPPA (no leak block) reconstruction algorithm and acquisition scenarios used in the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP), as well as split slice-GRAPPA (leak block). In addition to slice leakage, signal leakage can result from spatial smoothing, i.e., smoothing leakage, which leads to inflated regions of activation. Previous studies have generally found that SMS acquisition results in higher test statistics and/or a greater number of activated voxels. Here, we use simulations to disentangle this phenomenon into true positives (sensitivity) and false positives (decreased specificity). Slice leakage was greatly decreased by split slice-GRAPPA. Noise amplification was decreased by using moderate acceleration factors (AF = 4). We examined slice leakage in unprocessed fMRI motor task data from the HCP, which used the original slice-GRAPPA. When data were smoothed, we found evidence of slice leakage in some, but not all, subjects. We also found evidence of SMS noise amplification in unprocessed task and processed resting-state HCP data.",

In both tasks, reward and punishment differentially affected PMC functional connectivity. On the SRTT, participants trained with reward showed an increase in functional connectivity between PMC and cerebellum as well as PMC and striatum, while participants trained with punishment showed an increase in functional connectivity between PMC and medial temporal lobe connectivity. After training on the FTT, subjects trained with control and reward showed increases in PMC connectivity with parietal and temporal cortices after training, while subjects trained with punishment showed increased PMC connectivity with ventral striatum. While the results from the two experiments overlapped in some areas, including ventral pallidum, temporal lobe, and cerebellum, these regions showed diverging patterns of results across the two tasks for the different feedback conditions. These findings suggest that reward and punishment strongly influence spontaneous brain activity after training, and that the regions implicated depend on the task learned.",

    "abstract": "Energy homeostasis depends on behavior to predictively regulate metabolic states within narrow bounds. Here we review three theories of homeostatic control and ask how they provide insight into the circuitry underlying energy homeostasis. We offer two contributions. First, we detail how control theory and reinforcement learning are applied to homeostatic control. We show how these schemes rest on implausible assumptions; either via circular definitions, unprincipled drive functions, or by ignoring environmental volatility. We argue active inference can elude these shortcomings while retaining important features of each model. Second, we review the neural basis of energetic control. We focus on a subset of arcuate subpopulations that project directly to, and are thus in a privileged position to opponently modulate, dopaminergic cells as a function of energetic predictions over a spectrum of time horizons. We discuss how this can be interpreted under these theories, and how this can resolve paradoxes that have arisen. We propose this circuit constitutes a homeostatic-reward interface that underwrites the conjoint optimisation of physiological and behavioural homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods have provided new insights into the network organization of the human brain. Studies of brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease or depression have adapted tools from graph theory to characterize differences between healthy and patient populations. Here, we conducted a review of clinical network neuroscience, summarizing methodological details from 106 RSFC studies. Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses. Fourth, some studies tested hypotheses at one level of the graph without a clear neurobiological rationale or considering how findings at one level (e.g., global topology) are contextualized by another (e.g., modular structure). Based on these themes, we conducted network simulations to demonstrate the impact of specific methodological decisions on case-control comparisons. Finally, we offer suggestions for promoting convergence across clinical studies in order to facilitate progress in this important field.",

    "abstract": "Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature (the extracellular action potential, EAP) generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. Soma-dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic electric fields recorded in the brain.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe studied the consequences of the action potential (AP) initiation site on the extracellular signatures of APs. We show that: (1) at the time of AP initiation the action initial segment (AIS) forms a dipole with the soma, (2) the width but not (3) amplitude of the extracellular AP generated by this dipole increases with the soma-AIS distance. This may help to monitor dynamic changes in the AIS position in experimental in vivo recordings.",

    "abstract": "The auditory neural code is resilient to acoustic variability and capable of recognizing sounds amongst competing sound sources, yet, the transformations enabling noise robust abilities are largely unknown. We report that a hierarchical spiking neural network (HSNN) trained to maximize word recognition accuracy in noise and multiple talkers approaches near human-level performance. Intriguingly, comparisons with data from auditory nerve, midbrain, thalamus and cortex reveals that the organization and nonlinear transformations of the optimal network predict several properties of the ascending auditory pathway including a sequential loss of temporal resolution, increasing sparseness and selectivity. The optimal organizational scheme is critical for noise robustness since an identical network arranged to enable high information transfer does not predict auditory pathway organization and has substantially poorer performance. Furthermore, conventional linear and nonlinear receptive field-based models fail to achieve similar noise robust performance. The findings suggest that the auditory pathway hierarchy and its sequential nonlinear feature extraction computations may form a near optimal code capable of efficiently detecting sounds in noise impoverished conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plants adapt to changes in their environment by regulating transcription and chromatin organization. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z and the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase BRAHMA have overlapping roles in positively and negatively regulating environmentally responsive genes in Arabidopsis, but the extent of this overlap was uncharacterized. Both have been associated with various changes in nucleosome positioning and stability in different contexts, but their specific roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization need further characterization. We show that H2A.Z and BRM act both cooperatively and antagonistically to contribute directly to transcriptional repression and activation of genes involved in development and response to environmental stimuli. We identified 8 classes of genes that show distinct relationships between H2A.Z and BRM and their roles in transcription. We found that H2A.Z contributes to a range of different nucleosome properties, while BRM stabilizes nucleosomes where it binds and destabilizes and/or repositions flanking nucleosomes. H2A.Z and BRM contribute to +1 nucleosome destabilization, especially where they coordinately regulate transcription. We also found that at genes regulated by both BRM and H2A.Z, both factors overlap with the binding sites of light-regulated transcription factors PIF4, PIF5, and FRS9, and that some of the FRS9 binding sites are dependent on H2A.Z and BRM for accessibility. Collectively, we comprehensively characterized the antagonistic and cooperative contributions of H2A.Z and BRM to transcriptional regulation, and illuminated their interrelated roles in chromatin organization. The variability observed in their individual functions implies that both BRM and H2A.Z have more context-specific roles within diverse chromatin environments than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as a powerful tool for targeted genome editing in plants and beyond. Double-strand breaks induced by the Cas9 enzyme are repaired by the cells own repair machinery either by the non-homologous end joining pathway or by homologous recombination. While the first repair mechanism results in random mutations at the double-strand break site, homologous recombination uses the genetic information from a highly homologous repair template as blueprint for repair of the break. By offering an artificial repair template, this pathway can be exploited to introduce specific changes at a site of choice in the genome. However, frequencies of double-strand break repair by homologous recombination are very low. In this study, we compared two methods that have been reported to enhance frequencies of homologous recombination in plants. The first method boosts the repair template availability through the formation of viral replicons, the second method makes use of an in planta gene targeting approach. Additionally, we comparatively applied a nickase instead of a nuclease for target strand priming. To allow easy, visual detection of homologous recombination events, we aimed at restoring trichome formation in a glabrous Arabidopsis mutant by repairing a defective glabrous1 gene. Using this efficient visual marker, we were able to regenerate plants repaired by homologous recombination at frequencies of 0.12% using the in planta gene targeting approach, while both approaches using viral replicons did not yield any trichome-bearing plants.",

    "abstract": "We propose a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methodology for the analysis of distributed and Big Data in the framework of the Medical Informatics Platform (MIP) of the Human Brain Project (HBP). MLR is a very versatile model, and is considered one of the workhorses for estimating dependences between clinical, neuropsychological and neurophysiological variables in the field of neuroimaging. One of the main concepts behind MIP is to federate data, which is stored locally in geographically distributed sites (hospitals, customized databases, etc.) around the world. We restrain from using a unique federation node for two main reasons: first the maintenance of data privacy, and second the efficiency in management of big volumes of data in terms of latency and storage resources needed in the federation node. Considering these conditions and the distributed nature of data, MLR cannot be estimated in the classical way, which raises the necessity of modifications of the standard algorithms. We use the Bayesian formalism that provides the armamentarium necessary to implement the MLR methodology for distributed Big Data. It allows us to account for the heterogeneity of the possible mechanisms that explain data sets across sites expressed through different models of explanatory variables. This approach enables the integration of highly heterogeneous data coming from different subjects and hospitals across the globe. Additionally, it offers general and sophisticated ways, which are extendable to other statistical models, to suit high-dimensional and distributed multimodal data. This work forms part of a series of papers related to the methodological developments embedded in the MIP.",
