    "abstract": "Elevated prefrontal cortex activity is often observed in healthy older adults despite declines in their memory and other cognitive functions. According to one view, this activity reflects a compensatory functional posterior-to-anterior shift, which contributes to maintenance of cognitive performance when posterior cortical function is impaired. Alternatively, the increased prefrontal activity may be less efficient or less specific, owing to structural and neurochemical changes accompanying aging. These accounts are difficult to distinguish on the basis of average activity levels within brain regions. Instead, we used a novel model-based multivariate analysis technique, applied to two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets from an adult-lifespan human sample (N=123 and N=115; approximately half female). Standard analysis replicated the age-related increase in average prefrontal activation, but multivariate tests revealed that this activity did not carry additional information. The results contradict the hypothesis of a compensatory posterior-to-anterior shift. Instead, they suggest that the increased prefrontal activation reflects reduced efficiency or specificity, rather than compensation.\\n\\nSignificance statementFunctional brain imaging studies have often shown increased activity in prefrontal brain regions in older adults. This has been proposed to reflect a compensatory shift to greater reliance on prefrontal cortex, helping to maintain cognitive function. Alternatively, activity may become less specific as people age. This is a key question in the neuroscience of aging. In this study, we used novel tests of how different brain regions contribute to long- and short-term memory. We found increased activity in prefrontal cortex in older adults, but this activity carried less information about memory outcomes than activity in visual regions. These findings are relevant for understanding why cognitive abilities decline with age, suggesting that optimal function depends on successful brain maintenance rather than compensation.",

    "abstract": "How individuals move through their environment dictates which other individuals they encounter, determining their social and reproductive interactions and the extent to which they experience sexual selection. Specifically, females rarely have the option of mating with all males in a population--they can only choose among the males they encounter. Further, quantifying phenotypic differences between the males that females encounter and those that sire females offspring lends insight into how social and reproductive interactions shape male phenotypes. We used an explicitly spatiotemporal Markov chain model to estimate the number of potential mates of Anolis sagrei lizards from their movement behavior, and used genetic paternity assignments to quantify sexual selection on males. Females frequently encountered and mated with multiple males, offering ample opportunity for female mate choice. Sexual selection favored males that were bigger and moved over larger areas, though the effect of body size cannot be disentangled from last-male precedence. Our approach corroborates some patterns of sexual selection previously hypothesized in anoles based on describing them as territorial, whereas other results, including female multiple mating itself, are at odds with territorial polygyny, offering insight into discrepancies in other taxa between behavioral and genetic descriptions of mating systems.",

    "abstract": "Rather than being a homogenous diffusion-dominated structure, biological membranes can exhibit areas with distinct composition and characteristics commonly termed as lipid domains. Arguably the most comprehensively studied examples in bacteria are domains formed by cardiolipin, which have been functionally linked to protein targeting, cell division process, and mode of action of membrane targeting antimicrobials. Cardiolipin domains were originally identified in the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli based on preferential staining by the fluorescent membrane dye nonyl acridine orange (NAO), and later reported to exist also in other Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. Recently, the lipid-specificity of NAO has been questioned based on studies conducted in E. coli. This prompted us to re-analyse cardiolipin domains also in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. Here we show that logarithmically growing B. subtilis does not form microscopically detectable cardiolipin-specific lipid domains, and that NAO is not a specific stain for cardiolipin in this organism.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Promoters are the key drivers of gene expression and are largely responsible for the regulation of cellular responses to time and environment. In E. coli, decades of studies have revealed most, if not all, of the sequence elements necessary to encode promoter function. Despite our knowledge of these motifs, it is still not possible to predict the strength and regulation of a promoter from primary sequence alone. Here we develop a novel multiplexed assay to study promoter function in E. coli by building a site-specific genomic recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) system that allows for the facile construction and testing of large libraries of genetic designs integrated into precise genomic locations. We build and test a library of 10,898 {sigma}70 promoter variants consisting of all combinations of a set of eight -35 elements, eight -10 elements, three UP elements, eight spacers, and eight backgrounds. We find that the -35 and -10 sequence elements can explain approximately 74% of the variance in promoter strength within our dataset using a simple log-linear statistical model. Simple neural network models explain greater than 95% of the variance in our dataset by capturing nonlinear interactions with the spacer, background, and UP elements.",

    "abstract": "Premature birth increases the risk of developing neurocognitive and neurobe-havioural disorders. The mechanisms of altered brain development causing these disorders are yet unknown. Studying the morphology and function of the brain during maturation provides us not only with a better understanding of normal development, but may help us to identify causes of abnormal development and their consequences. A particular difficulty is to distinguish abnormal patterns of neurodevelopment from normal variation. The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) seeks to create a detailed four-dimensional (4D) connectome of early life. This connectome may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. As part of this project, more than a thousand healthy fetal and neonatal brains will be scanned in vivo. This requires computational methods which scale well to larger data sets. We propose a novel groupwise method for the construction of a spatio-temporal model of mean morphology from cross-sectional brain scans at different gestational ages. This model scales linearly with the number of images and thus improves upon methods used to build existing public neonatal atlases, which derive correspondence between all pairs of images. By jointly estimating mean shape and longitudinal change, the atlas created with our method overcomes temporal inconsistencies, which are encountered when mean shape and intensity images are constructed separately for each time point. Using this approach, we have constructed a spatio-temporal atlas from 275 healthy neonates between 35 and 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). The resulting atlas qualitatively preserves cortical details significantly better than publicly available atlases. This is moreover confirmed by a number of quantitative measures of the quality of the spatial normalisation and sharpness of the resulting template brain images.",

E-cadherin complexes play a pivotal role in this process by providing persistent cell adhesion and by transmitting mechanical tension. In this context, it is unclear how mechanical forces affect E-cadherin adhesion and junction dynamics.\\n\\nDuring Drosophila embryo axis elongation, Myosin-II activity in the apico-medial and junctional cortex generates mechanical forces to drive junction remodeling. Here we report that the ratio between Vinculin and E-cadherin intensities acts as a ratiometric readout for these mechanical forces (load) at E-cadherin complexes. Medial Myosin-II loads E-cadherin complexes on all junctions, exerts tensile forces, and increases levels of E-cadherin. Junctional Myosin-II, on the other hand, biases the distribution of load between junctions of the same cell, exerts shear forces, and decreases the levels of E-cadherin. This work suggests distinct effects of tensile versus shear stresses on E-cadherin adhesion.",

Nevertheless, the effect of Hsp90 inhibition is still not understood at the molecular level, preventing a truly rational drug design. Here we report on the effect of the most prominent drug candidates, namely radicicol, geldanamycin, derivatives of purine and novobiocin, on Hsp90s characteristic conformational dynamics and the binding of three interaction partners. Unexpectedly, the global opening and closing transitions are hardly affected by Hsp90 inhibitors. Instead, the conformational equilibrium, as well as the associated kinetic rate constants remain almost untouched. Moreover, we find no significant changes in the binding of the cochaperones Aha1 and p23 nor of the model substrate {Delta}131{Delta}. This holds true for both, competitive and allosteric inhibitors. Therefore, direct inhibition mechanisms, affecting only one molecular interaction, are unlikely. Based on our results, we speculate that the inhibitory action observed in vivo is caused by a combination of subtle effects, which can be used in the search for novel Hsp90 inhibition mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Predicting residue-residue contacts between interacting proteins is an important problem in bioinformatics. The growing wealth of sequence data can be used to infer these contacts through correlated mutation analysis on multiple sequence alignments of interacting homologs of the proteins of interest. This requires correct identification of pairs of interacting proteins for many species, in order to avoid introducing noise (i.e. non-interacting sequences) in the analysis that will decrease predictive performance. We have designed Ouroboros, a novel algorithm to reduce such noise in intermolecular contact prediction. Our method iterates between weighting proteins according to how likely they are to interact based on the correlated mutations signal, and predicting correlated mutations based on the weighted sequence alignment. We show that this approach accurately discriminates between protein interaction versus noninteraction and simultaneously improves the prediction of intermolecular contact residues compared to a naive application of correlated mutation analysis. Furthermore, the method relaxes the assumption of one-to-one interaction of previous approaches, allowing for the study of many-to-many interactions.

Advances of the next-generation sequencing technologies open up new opportunities to assemble full-length haplotypes.

    "abstract": "MotivationMicrobial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems, ranging from the human body to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsk-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87.

    "abstract": "The high-order chromatin structure plays a non-negligible role in gene regulation. However, the mechanism for the formation of different chromatin structures in different cells and the sequence dependence of this process remain to be elucidated. As the nucleotide distributions in human and mouse genomes are highly uneven, we identified CGI forest and prairie genomic domains based on CGI density, which better segregates genomic elements along the genome than GC content. The genome is then divided into two sequentially, epigenetically, and transcriptionally distinct regions. These two types of megabase-sized domains spatially segregate, but to a different extent in different cell types. Overall, the forests and prairies gradually segregate from each other in development, differentiation, and senescence. The multi-scale forest-prairie spatial intermingling is cell-type specific and increases in differentiation, thus helps define the cell identity. We propose that the phase separation of the 1D mosaic sequence in space, serving as a potential driving force, together with cell type specific epigenetic marks and transcription factors, shapes the chromatin structure in different cell types and renders them distinct genomic properties. The mosaicity of the genome manifested in terms of alternative forests and prairies of a species could be related to its biological processes such as differentiation, aging and body temperature control.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal rearrangements, including translocations, are early and essential events in the formation of many tumors. Previous studies that defined the genetic requirements for rearrangement formation have identified differences between murine and human cells, most notably in the role of classical- and alternative-nonhomologous end joining factors (NHEJ). We reported that poly(ADP)ribose polymerase 3 (PARP3) promotes chromosomal rearrangements induced by endonucleases in multiple human cell types. In contrast to c-NHEJ factors, we show here that Parp3 also promotes rearrangements in murine cells, including translocations in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), class switch recombination in primary B cells and inversions in tail fibroblasts that generate Eml4-Alk fusions. In mESCs, Parp3-deficient cells had shorter deletion lengths at translocation junctions. This was corroborated using next-generation sequencing of Eml4-Alk junctions in tail fibroblasts and is consistent with a role for Parp3 in promoting the processing of DNA double-strand breaks. We confirmed a previous report that Parp1 also promotes rearrangement formation. In contrast with Parp3, rearrangement junctions in the absence of Parp1 had longer deletion lengths, suggesting Parp1 may suppress DSB processing. Together, these data indicate that Parp3 and Parp1 promote rearrangements with distinct phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The desire to explain how synaptic plasticity arises from interactions between ions, proteins and other signalling molecules has propelled the development of biophysical models of molecular pathways in hippocampal, striatal and cerebellar synapses. The experimental data underpinning such models is typically obtained from low-throughput, hypothesis-driven experiments. We used high-throughput proteomic data and bioinformatics datasets to assess the coverage of biophysical models.\\n\\nTo determine which molecules have been modelled, we surveyed biophysical models of synaptic plasticity, identifying which proteins are involved in each model. We were able to map 4.2% of previously reported synaptic proteins to entities in biophysical models. Linking the modelled protein list to Gene Ontology terms shows that modelled proteins are focused on functions such as calmodulin binding, cellular responses to glucagon stimulus, G-alpha signalling and DARPP-32 events.\\n\\nWe cross-linked the set of modelled proteins with sets of genes associated with common neurological diseases. We find some examples of disease-associated molecules that are well represented in models, such as voltage-dependent calcium channel family (CACNA1C), dopamine D1 receptor, and glutamate ionotropic NMDA type 2A and 2B receptors. Many other disease-associated genes have not been included in models of synaptic plasticity, for example catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO A. By incorporating pathway enrichment results, we identify LAMTOR, a gene uniquely associated with Schizophrenia, which is closely linked to the MAPK pathway found in some models.\\n\\nOur analysis provides a map of how molecular pathways underpinning neurological diseases relate to synaptic biophysical models that can in turn be used to explore how these molecular events might bridge scales into cellular processes and beyond. The map illustrates disease areas where biophysical models have good coverage as well as domain gaps that require significant further research.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe 100 billion neurons in the human brain are connected by a billion trillion structures called synapses. Each synapse contains hundreds of different proteins. Some proteins sense the activity of the neurons connecting the synapse. Depending on what they sense, the proteins in the synapse are rearranged and new proteins are synthesised. This changes how strongly the synapse influences its target neuron, and underlies learning and memory. Scientists build computational models to reason about the complex interactions between proteins. Here we list the proteins that have been included in computational models to date. For good reasons, models do not always specify proteins precisely, so to make the list we had to translate the names used for proteins in models to gene names, which are used to identify proteins. Our translation could be used to label computational models in the future. We found that the list of modelled proteins contains only 4.2% of proteins associated with synapses, suggesting more proteins should be added to models. We used lists of genes associated with neurological diseases to suggest proteins to include in future models.",

    "abstract": "Plant-microbe interactions are great model systems to study co-evolutionary dynamics across multiple timescales, ranging from multimillion year macroevolution to extremely rapid evolutionary adaptations. However, mechanistic research on plant-microbe interactions has often been conducted with little consideration of the insights that can be gained from evolutionary concepts and methods. Conversely, evolutionary research has rarely integrated the diverse range of molecular mechanisms and models that continue to emerge from the molecular plant-microbe interactions field. These trends are changing. In recent years, the incipient field of evolutionary molecular plant-microbe interactions (EvoMPMI) has emerged to bridge the gap between mechanistic molecular research and evolutionary approaches. Here, we report on recent advances in EvoMPMI. In particular, we highlight new systems to study microbe interactions with early diverging land plants, and new findings from studies of adaptive evolution in pathogens and plants. By linking mechanistic and evolutionary research, EvoMPMI promises to add a new dimension to our understanding of plant-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "How random fluctuations impact on biological systems and what is their relationship with complexity and energetic cooperativity are challenging questions that are far from being elucidated. Using the stochastic differential equation formalism, we studied analytically the effect of fluctuations on a series of oligomerization processes, in which several molecules of the same or different species interact to form complexes, without interaction with the environment. The conservation of the total number of molecules within the systems imposes constraints on the stochastic quantities, among which the negativity of the covariances and the vanishing of the determinant of the covariance matrix. The intrinsic noise on the number of molecules of each species is represented by the Fano factor, defined as the variance to mean ratio. At the equilibrium steady states, the sum of the Fano factors of all molecular species is equal to the rank of the system, independently of the parameters. The Fano factors of the individual molecular species are, however, parameter dependent. We found that when the free energy cooperativity of the reactions increases, the intrinsic noise on the oligomeric product decreases, and is compensated by a higher noise on the monomeric reactants and/or intermediate states. The noise reduction is moreover more pronounced for higher complexity systems, involving oligomers of higher degrees.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlatform-specific error profiles necessitate confirmatory studies where predictions made on data generated using one technology are additionally verified by processing the same samples on an orthogonal technology. In disciplines that rely heavily on high-throughput data generation, such as genomics, reducing the impact of false positive and false negative rates in results is a top priority. However, verifying all predictions can be costly and redundant, and testing a subset of findings is often used to estimate the true error profile. To determine how to create subsets of predictions for validation that maximize inference of global error profiles, we developed Valection, a software program that implements multiple strategies for the selection of verification candidates.\\n\\nResultsTo evaluate these selection strategies, we obtained 261 sets of somatic mutation calls from a single-nucleotide variant caller benchmarking challenge where 21 teams competed on whole-genome sequencing datasets of three computationally-simulated tumours. By using synthetic data, we had complete ground truth of the tumours mutations and, therefore, we were able to accurately determine how estimates from the selected subset of verification candidates compared to the complete prediction set. We found that selection strategy performance depends on several verification study characteristics. In particular the verification budget of the experiment (i.e. how many candidates can be selected) is shown to influence estimates.\\n\\nConclusionsThe Valection framework is flexible, allowing for the implementation of additional selection algorithms in the future. Its applicability extends to any discipline that relies on experimental verification and will benefit from the optimization of verification candidate selection.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is one of the most important nosocomial pathogens world-wide, being responsible for frequent hospital outbreaks and causing sepsis and multi-organ infections with a high mortality rate and frequent hospital outbreaks. The most prevalent and widely disseminated lineage of K. pneumoniae is clonal group 258 (CG258), which includes the highly resistant \\\"high-risk\\\" genotypes ST258 and ST11. Recent studies revealed that very large recombination events have occurred during the recent emergence of Kp lineages. A striking example is provided by ST258, which has undergone a recombination event that replaced over 1 Mb of the genome with DNA from an unrelated Kp donor. Although several examples of this phenomenon have been documented in Kp and other bacterial species, the significance of these very large recombination events for the emergence of either hyper-virulent or resistant clones remains unclear. Here we present an analysis of 834 Kp genomes that provides data on the frequency of these very large recombination events (defined as those involving >100Kb), their distribution within the genome, and the dynamics of gene flow within the Kp population. We note that very large recombination events occur frequently, and in multiple lineages, and that the majority of recombinational exchanges are clustered within two overlapping genomic regions, which result to be involved by recombination events with different frequencies. Our results also indicate that certain non-CG258 lineages are more likely to act as donors to CG258 recipients than others. Furthermore, comparison of gene content in CG258 and non-CG258 strains agrees with this pattern, suggesting that the success of a large recombination depends on gene composition in the exchanged genomic portion.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryKlebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, a major cause of deadly infections and outbreaks in hospitals worldwide. This bacterium is able to exchange large genomic portions (up to a fourth of the entire genome) within a single recombination event. Indeed, the most epidemiologically important Kp clone, is actually a hybrid which emerged after a > 1Mb recombination event. In this work, we investigated how recombinations affected the evolution of the most studied Kp Clonal Group, CG258. We found that large recombinations occurred frequently during Kp evolution, and occurred preferentially in a well-delimited genomic region. Furthermore, we found that four epidemiologically important clones emerged after large recombinations. We identified the donors of several large recombinations: despite many Kp lineages acted as donors during CG258 evolution, two of them have been involved more frequently. We hypothesize that the observed pattern of donors-recipients in recombinations, and the presence of a large recombinogenic region in Kp genome, could be related to gene composition. Indeed, genomic analyses showed a pattern compatible with this hypothesis, suggesting that gene content can represent a main factor in the success of a large recombination.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by recognizing and binding to specific DNA promoter sequences. In higher eukaryotes, it remains unclear how the duration of TF binding to DNA relates to downstream transcriptional output. Here, we address this question for the transcriptional activator NF-{kappa}B (p65), by live-cell single molecule imaging of TF-DNA binding kinetics and genome-wide quantification of p65-mediated transcription. We used mutants of p65, perturbing either the DNA binding domain (DBD) or the protein-protein transactivation domain (TAD). We found that p65-DNA binding time was predominantly determined by its DBD and directly correlated with its transcriptional output as long as the TAD is intact. Surprisingly, mutation or deletion of the TAD did not modify p65-DNA binding stability, suggesting that the p65 TAD generally contributes neither to the assembly of an \\\"enhanceosome,\\\" nor to the active removal of p65 from putative specific binding sites. However, TAD removal did reduce p65-mediated transcriptional activation, indicating that protein-protein interactions act to translate the long-lived p65-DNA binding into productive transcription.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo control transcription of a certain gene or a group of genes, both eukaryotes and prokaryotes express specialized proteins, transcription factors (TFs). During gene activation, TFs bind gene promotor sequences to recruit the transcriptional machinery including DNA polymerase II. TFs are often multi-subunit proteins containing a DNA-binding domain (DBD) as well as a protein-protein interaction interface. It was suggested that the duration of a TF-DNA binding event 1) depends on these two subunits and 2) dictates the outcome, i.e. the amount of mRNA produced from an activated gene. We set out to address these hypotheses using the transcriptional activator NF-{kappa}B (p65) as well as a number of mutants affecting different functional subunits. Using a combination of live-cell microscopy and RNA sequencing, we show that p65 DNA-binding time indeed correlates with the transcriptional output, but that this relationship depends on, and hence can be uncoupled by altering, the protein-protein interaction capacity. Our results suggest that, while p65 DNA binding times are dominated by the DBD, a transcriptional output can only be achieved with a functional protein-protein interaction subunit.",

However, the mechanisms underlying EV production in Gram-positive bacteria are poorly understood. We purified and characterized EVs from a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate (USA300) and investigated mechanisms underlying EV production. Native EVs contained 165 proteins, including cytosolic, surface, and secreted proteins, autolysins, and numerous cytolysins. Staphylococcal alpha-type phenol-soluble modulins (surfactant-like peptides) promoted EV biogenesis, presumably by acting at the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas peptidoglycan crosslinking and autolysin activity were found to increase EV production by altering the permeability of the staphylococcal cell wall. To address the immunogenicity of EVs, we created engineered EVs (eng-EVs) by expressing detoxified proteins HlaH35L and LukE in EVs generated from a nontoxic S. aureus {Delta}agr{Delta}spa mutant. Eng-EVs exhibited no cytotoxicity in vitro, and mice immunized with the eng-EVs produced toxin-neutralizing antibodies and showed reduced lethality in a mouse sepsis model. Our study reveals novel mechanisms underlying S. aureus EV production and highlights the usefulness of EVs as a novel S. aureus vaccine platform.",
