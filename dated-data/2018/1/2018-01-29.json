    "abstract": "Alcohol-based hand rubs are international pillars of hospital infection control, restricting transmission of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Despite this success, health care infections caused by Enterococcus faecium (Efm) - another multidrug resistant pathogen - are increasing. We tested alcohol tolerance of 139 hospital Efm isolates, obtained between 1997 and 2015 and found Efm post-2010 were 10-fold more tolerant to alcohol killing than older isolates. Using a mouse infection control model, we then showed that alcohol tolerant Efm resisted standard 70% isopropanol surface disinfection and led to gastrointestinal colonization significantly more often than alcohol sensitive Efm. We next looked for bacterial genomic signatures of adaptation. Tolerant Efm have independently accumulated mutations modifying genes involved in carbohydrate uptake and metabolism. Mutagenesis confirmed their roles in isopropanol tolerance. These findings suggest bacterial adaptation and complicate infection control recommendations. Additional policies and procedures to prevent Efm spread are required.",

With a boom in non-model organism genomics, there is a pressing need to bring these methods to communities without access to such data. Here we present RADpainter, a new program designed to infer the coancestry matrix from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) data. We combine this program together with a previously published MCMC clustering algorithm into fineRADstructure - a complete, easy to use, and fast population inference package for RADseq data (https://github.com/millanek/fineRADstructure).

    "abstract": "The Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) is widely used to test for associations between a phenotype and a set of genetic variants, that are usually rare. Evaluating tail probabilities or quantiles of the null distribution for SKAT requires computing the eigenvalues of a matrix related to the genotype covariance between markers. Extracting the full set of eigenvalues of this matrix (an n x n matrix, for n subjects) has computational complexity proportional to n3. As SKAT is often used when n > 104, this step becomes a major bottleneck in its use in practice. We therefore propose fastSKAT, a new computationally-inexpensive but accurate approximations to the tail probabilities, in which the k largest eigenvalues of a weighted genotype covariance matrix or the largest singular values of a weighted genotype matrix are extracted, and a single term based on the Satterthwaite approximation is used for the remaining eigenval-ues. While the method is not particularly sensitive to the choice of k, we also describe how to choose its value, and show how fastSKAT can automatically alert users to the rare cases where the choice may affect results. As well as providing faster implementation of SKAT, the new method also enables entirely new applications of SKAT, that were not possible before; we give examples grouping variants by topologically assisted domains, and comparing chromosome-wide association by class of histone marker.",

It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.",

However, it is not known whether such redundant synaptic connections provide any functional benefit. Here, we show that redundant synaptic connections enable near-optimal learning in cooperation with synaptic rewiring. By constructing a simple dendritic neuron model, we demonstrate that with multisynaptic connections, synaptic plasticity approximates a sample-based Bayesian filtering algorithm known as particle filtering, and wiring plasticity implements its resampling process. The derived synaptic plasticity rule accounts for many experimental observations, including the dendritic position dependence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The proposed framework is applicable to detailed single neuron models, and also to recurrent circuit models. Our study provides a novel conceptual framework for synaptic plasticity and rewiring.",

In sepsis syndrome, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key sensor for signaling the presence of Gram-negative bacteria. Its expression and activity, along with its intracellular trafficking rates shift the equilibrium between the pro- and anti-inflammatory downstream signaling cascades, leading to either the physiological resolution of the bacterial stimulation or to sepsis. We hypothesize that the initial tlr4 expression in patients diagnosed with sepsis and TLR4 dynamic concentration changes on the cell membrane or intracellularly, dictates how the sepsis syndrome is initiated. Using a set of three differential equations, we defined the TLR4 flux between relevant cell organelles. We obtained three different regions in the phase space: 1. a limit-cycle describing unstimulated physiological oscillations, 2. a fixed-point attractor resulting from moderate LPS stimulation that is resolved and 3. a double-attractor resulting from sustained LPS stimulation that leads to sepsis. We tested the models against hospital data of sepsis patients and we correctly evaluate the clinical outcome of these patients.",

    "abstract": "The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) is both a threat to global food security and a model for plant pathology. Molecular pathologists need an accurate understanding of the origins and line of descent of M. oryzae populations, to identify the genetic and functional bases of pathogen adaptation, and to guide the development of more effective control strategies. We used a whole-genome sequence analysis of samples from different times and places to infer details about the genetic makeup of M. oryzae from a global collection of isolates. Analyses of population structure identified six lineages within M. oryzae, including two pandemic on japonica and indica rice, respectively, and four lineages with more restricted distributions. Tip-dating calibration indicated that M. oryzae lineages separated about a millenium ago, long after the initial domestication of rice. The major lineage endemic to continental Southeast Asia displayed signatures of sexual recombination and evidence of DNA acquisition from multiple lineages. Tests for weak natural selection revealed that the pandemic spread of clonal lineages entailed an evolutionary  cost, in terms of the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Our findings reveal the coexistence of multiple endemic and pandemic lineages with contrasting population and genetic characteristics within a widely distributed pathogen.\\n\\nImportanceThe rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) is a textbook example of a rapidly adapting pathogen, and is responsible for one of the most damaging diseases of rice. Improvements in our understanding of Magnaporthe oryzae diversity and evolution are required, to guide the development of more effective control strategies. We used genome sequencing data for samples from around the world to infer the evolutionary history of M. oryzae. We found that M. oryzae diversified about a thousand years ago ago, separating into six main lineages: two pandemic on japonica and indica rice, respectively, and four with more restricted distributions. We also found that a lineage endemic to continental Southeast Asia displayed signatures of sexual recombination and the acquisition of genetic material from multiple lineages. This work provides a population-level genomic framework for defining molecular markers for the control of rice blast and investigations of the molecular basis of differences in pathogenicity between M. oryzae lineages.",

    "abstract": "Foliar uptake of water from the surface of leaves is common when rainfall is scarce and non-meteoric water such as dew or fog is more abundant. However, many species in more mesic environments have hydrophobic leaves that do not allow the plant to uptake water. Unlike foliar uptake, all species can benefit from dew- or fog-induced transpiration suppression, but despite its ubiquity, transpiration suppression has so far never been quantified. Here, we investigate the effect of dew-induced transpiration suppression on the water balance and the isotope composition of leaves via a series of experiments. Characteristically hydrophobic leaves of a tropical plant, Colocasia esculenta, are misted with isotopically enriched water to reproduce dew deposition. This species does not uptake water from the surface of its leaves. We measure leaf water isotopes and water potential and find that misted leaves exhibit a higher water potential (p < 0.05) and a more depleted water isotope composition than dry leaves (p < 0.001), suggesting a ~30% decrease in transpiration rate (p < 0.001) compared to control leaves. We propose three possible mechanisms governing the interaction of water droplets with leaf energy balance: increase in albedo from the presence of dew droplets, decrease in leaf temperature from the evaporation of dew, and local decrease in vapor pressure deficit. Comparing previous studies on foliar uptake to our results, we conclude that transpiration suppression has an effect of similar amplitude, yet opposite sign to foliar uptake on leaf water isotopes.",

    "abstract": "Treatment strategies for dominantly inherited disorders typically involve silencing or ablating the pathogenic allele. CRISPR/Cas nucleases have shown promise in allele-specific knockout approaches when the dominant allele creates unique protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) that can lead to allele restricted targeting. Here, we present a spacer-mediated allele-specific knockout approach that utilizes both SpCas9 variants and truncated single guide RNAs (trusgRNAs) to achieve efficient discrimination of a single-nucleotide mutation in rhodopsin (Rho)-P23H mice, a model of dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP). We found that approximately 45% of the mutant P23H allele was edited at DNA level, and that the relative RNA expression of wild-type Rho was about 2.8 times more than that of mutant Rho in treated retinas. Furthermore, the progression of photoreceptor cell degeneration in outer nuclear layer was significantly delayed in treated regions of the Rho-P23H retinas at five weeks of age. Our proof-of-concept study therefore outlines a general strategy that could potentially be expanded to examine the therapeutic benefit of allele-specific gene editing approach to treat human P23H patient. Our study also extends allele-specific editing strategies beyond discrimination within the PAM sites, with potentially broad applicability to other dominant diseases.",

Unfortunately, the correlations between different motional modes are poorly captured by discrete ensemble representations. Here, we present new ways to both represent and visualize correlated interdomain motions. Interdomain motions are determined directly from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), represented as a continuous conformational distribution, and visualized using the disk-on-sphere (DoS) representation. Using the DoS representation, features of interdomain motions, including correlations, are intuitively visualized. The representation works especially well for multidomain systems with broad conformational distributions. This analysis also can be extended to multiple probability density modes, using a Bingham mixture model. We use this new paradigm to study the interdomain motions of staphylococcal protein A, which is a key virulence factor contributing to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. We capture the smooth transitions between important states and demonstrate the utility of continuous distribution functions for computing components of binding thermodynamics. Such insights allow the dissection the dynamic structural components of functionally important intermolecular interactions.",

    "abstract": "Complexity is a fundamental attribute of life. Complex systems are made of parts that together perform functions that a single component, or subsets containing individual components, cannot. Examples of complex molecular systems include protein structures such as the F1Fo-ATPase, the ribosome, or the flagellar motor: each one of these structures requires most or all of its components to function properly. Given the ubiquity of complex systems in the biosphere, understanding the evolution of complexity is central to biology. At the molecular level, operons are a classic example of a complex system. An operons genes are co-transcribed under the control of a single promoter to a polycistronic mRNA molecule, and the operons gene products often form molecular complexes or metabolic pathways. With the large number of complete bacterial genomes available, we now have the opportunity to explore the evolution of these complex entities, by identifying possible intermediate states of operons. In this work, we developed a maximum parsimony algorithm to reconstruct ancestral operon states, and show a simple vertical evolution model of how operons may evolve from the individual component genes. We describe several ancestral states that are plausible functional intermediate forms leading to the full operon.

    "abstract": "Multiple promoters and inhibitors mediate angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and these factors represent potential targets for impeding vessel growth in tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor targeted in anti-angiogenic cancer therapies. In addition, thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a major endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, and TSP1 mimetics are being developed as an alternative type of anti-angiogenic agent. The combination of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, and ABT-510, a TSP1 mimetic, has been tested in clinical trials to treat advanced solid tumors. However, the patients responses are highly variable and show disappointing outcomes. To obtain mechanistic insight into the effects of this combination anti-angiogenic therapy, we have constructed a novel whole-body systems biology model including the VEGF and TSP1 reaction networks. Using this molecular-detailed model, we investigated how the combination anti-angiogenic therapy changes the amounts of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic complexes in cancer patients. We particularly focus on answering the question of how the effect of the combination therapy is influenced by tumor receptor expression, one aspect of patient-to-patient variability. Overall, this model complements the clinical administration of combination anti-angiogenic therapy, highlights the role of tumor receptor variability in the heterogeneous responses to anti-angiogenic therapy, and identifies the tumor receptor profiles that correlate with a high likelihood of a positive response to the combination therapy. Our model provides novel understanding of the VEGF-TSP1 balance in cancer patients at the systems-level and could be further used to optimize combination anti-angiogenic therapy.",

    "abstract": "The Bayesian model of confidence posits that confidence is the observers posterior probability that the decision is correct. It has been proposed that researchers can gain evidence in favor of the Bayesian model by deriving qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence, i.e., patterns that one would expect to see if an observer was Bayesian, and looking for those signatures in human or animal data. We examine two proposed qualitative signatures, showing that their derivations contain hidden assumptions that limit their applicability, and that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for Bayesian confidence. One signature is an average confidence of 0.75 for trials with neutral evidence. This signature only holds when class-conditioned stimulus distributions do not overlap and internal noise is very low. Another signature is that, as stimulus magnitude increases, confidence increases on correct trials but decreases on incorrect trials. This signature is also dependent on stimulus distribution type. There is an alternative form of this signature that has been applied in the literature; we find no indication that it is expected under Bayesian confidence, which resolves an ostensible discrepancy. We conclude that, to determine the nature of the computations underlying confidence reports, there may be no shortcut to quantitative model comparison.",

    "abstract": "Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase, PhaC, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of PHA, a type of bioplastics with huge potential to replace conventional petroleum-based plastics. While two PhaC structures have been determined recently, the exact mechanism remains unclear partly due to the absence of a tunnel for product passage. The PhaC from Aquitalea sp. USM4, PhaCAq, was characterised and showed a Km of 394 {micro}M and a kcat of 476.4 s-1 on the 3HB-CoA substrate. A model based on the structure of the closely related PhaC from Cupriavidus necator, PhaCCn revealed a three-branched tunnel at the dimeric interface. Two of the branches open to the solvent and serve as the putative routes for substrate entrance and product exit, while the third branch is elongated in a PhaC1 model from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating a function of accommodating the hydroxyalkanoate (HA) moiety of the HA-CoA substrate. Docking of the two tetrahedral intermediates formed during catalysis suggests a PHA elongation mechanism that requires the HA moiety of the ligand to rotate ~180{degrees}. Both classes I and II PhaCs share a common mechanism for polymer elongation, and substrate specificity is determined in part by a bulky Phe/Tyr/Trp residue in the third branch in class I, which is conserved as Ala in class II to create room for longer substrates. The PhaCAq model provides fresh insights into a general PhaC mechanism, pinpointing key residues for potential engineering of PhaCs with desirable characteristics.",

Significantly increased mALFF clusters were found in bilateral PAC and HAC of THL-NC1 maps and in the left inferior colliculus and right HAC of TNH-NC2 maps. Thus, subgroups of tinnitus with and without hearing impairment might exhibit different homeostatic plasticity in the central auditory system. mALFF values of aberrant active clusters in the central auditory system are partly associated with specific clinical tinnitus characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) increasingly has been implicated in normal brain physiology, as well as in neuropsychiatric disorders. The a7-nAChR primarily is located in cerebral cortex and sub-cortical regions, compared to the 4{beta}2 nAChR subtype that has a more subcortical distribution. The highly cortical distribution suggests a role of a7-nAChR in cognition. We expanded the first-in-human PET imaging of 7-nAChR with [18F]ASEM from five to 21 healthy non-smoking volunteers and added preliminary evidence of binding in six male patients with schizophrenia. Study aims included 1) confirmation of test-retest reproducibility of [18F]ASEM binding in normal volunteers, 2) demonstration of specificity of [18F]ASEM binding by competition with DMXB-A, an 7-nAChR partial agonist previously tested in clinical trials of patients with schizophrenia, 3) estimation of [18F]ASEM binding potentials and 7-nAChR density in vivo in humans, and 4) 7-nAChR binding in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy volunteers.\\n\\nTest-retest PET confirmed reproducibility (>90%) (variability [&le;] 7%) of [18F]ASEM volume of distribution (VO_SCPLOWTC_SCPLOW) estimates in healthy volunteers. Repeated sessions of PET in five healthy subjects included baseline and effect of inhibition after oral administration of 150 mg DMXB-A. From reduction of binding potentials, we estimated the dose-dependent occupancy of 7-nAChR by DMXB-A at 17-49% for plasma concentrations at 60-200 nM DMXB-A. In agreement with evidence post-mortem, 7-nAChR density (Bmax) averaged 0.67-0.82 nM and inhibitor affinity constant (KO_SCPLOWIC_SCPLOW) averaged 170-385 nM. Median VO_SCPLOWTC_SCPLOW in a feasibility study of six patients with schizophrenia was lower than in healthy volunteers in cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. Mann-Whitney test identified cingulate cortex and hippocampus as regions with significantly lower median VO_SCPLOWTC_SCPLOW in patients than in healthy volunteers when a single outlier patient was excluded from analysis (P = 0.02, corrected for multiple comparisons).",

    "abstract": "REM Behavior Disorder (RBD) is now recognized as the prodromal stage of -synucleinopathies such as Parkinsons disease (PD). In this paper, we describe deep learning models for diagnosis/prognosis derived from a few minutes of eyes-closed resting electroencephalography data (EEG) collected from idiopathic RBD patients (n=121) and healthy controls (HC, n=91). A few years after the EEG acquisition (4 {+/-} 2 years), a subset of the RBD patients eventually developed either PD (n=14) or Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=13), while the rest remained idiopathic. We describe first a simple convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a five-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG spectrograms. We treat the data as in audio or image classification problems where deep networks have proven highly successful by exploiting compositional and translationally invariant features in the data. For comparison, we study an even simpler deep recurrent neural network using three stacked Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) cells or gated-recurrent unit (GRU) cells--with very similar results. The performance of these networks typically reaches 80% ({+/-}1%) classification accuracy in the balanced HC vs. PD-outcome classification problem. In particular, using data from a single EEG channel we obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 87% ({+/-}1%) while avoiding spectral feature selection. The trained classifier can also be used to generate synthetic spectrograms to study what spectrogram features are relevant for classification, pointing to the presence of theta band bursts and a decrease of power in the alpha band in future PD or DLB patients compared to HCs. We conclude that deep networks may provide a key tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets and enable the delivery of new biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Culture-based methods to measure Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used by beach administrators to inform whether bacteria levels represent an elevated risk to swimmers. Since results take up to 12 hours, statistical models are used to forecast bacteria levels in lieu of test results; however they underestimate days with elevated fecal indicator bacteria levels. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests return results within 3 hours but are 2 to 5 times more expensive than culture-based methods. This paper presents a prediction model which uses limited deployments of qPCR tested sites with inter-beach correlation to predict when bacteria will exceed acceptable thresholds. The model can be used to inform management decisions on when to warn residents or close beaches due to exposure to the bacteria. Using data from Chicago collected between 2006 and 2016, the model proposed in this paper increased sensitivity from 3.4 percent to 11.2 percent-a 230 percent increase. We find that the correlation between beaches are substantial enough to provide higher levels of precision and sensitivity to predictive models. Thus, limited deployments of qPCR testing can be used to deliver better predictions for beach administrators at lower cost and less complexity.",

Regulated changes in mRNA degradation rates can accelerate reprogramming by clearing or stabilizing extant transcripts. Here, we measured mRNA stability using 4-thiouracil labeling in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during a nitrogen upshift and found that 78 mRNAs are subject to destabilization. These transcripts include Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR) and carbon metabolism mRNAs, suggesting that mRNA destabilization is a mechanism for targeted reprogramming. To explore the molecular basis of destabilization we implemented a SortSeq approach to screen using the pooled deletion collection library for trans factors that mediate rapid GAP1 mRNA repression. We combined low-input multiplexed Barcode sequencing with branched-DNA single-molecule mRNA FISH and Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BFF) to identify that the Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex and general mRNA decay machinery are important for GAP1 mRNA clearance. We also find that the decapping modulator SCD6, translation factor eIF4G2, and the 5 UTR of GAP1 are important for this repression, suggesting that translational control may impact the post-transcriptional fate of mRNAs in response to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge when imaging whole biomedical specimens is how to quickly obtain massive cellular information over a large field of view (FOV). Here, we report a sub-voxel light-sheet microscopy (SLSM) method enabling high-throughput volumetric imaging of mesoscale specimens at cellular-resolution. A non-axial, continuous scanning strategy is used to rapidly acquire a stack of large-FOV images with three-dimensional (3-D) nanoscale shifts encoded. Then by adopting a sub-voxel-resolving procedure, the SLSM method models these low-resolution, cross-correlated images in the spatial domain and iteratively recovers a 3-D image with improved resolution throughout the sample. This technique can surpass the optical limit of a conventional light-sheet microscope by more than three times, with high acquisition speeds of gigavoxels per minute. As demonstrated by quick reconstruction (minutes to hours) of various samples, e.g., 3-D cultured cells, an intact mouse heart, mouse brain, and live zebrafish embryo, the SLSM method presents a high-throughput way to circumvent the tradeoff between intoto mapping of large-scale tissue (>100 mm3) and isotropic imaging of single-cell (~1-m resolution). It also eliminates the need of complicated mechanical stitching or precisely modulated illumination, using a simple light-sheet setup and fast graphics-processing-unit (GPU)-based computation to achieve high-throughput, high-resolution 3-D microscopy, which could be tailored for a wide range of biomedical applications in pathology, histology, neuroscience, etc.",

We captured the dynamics of constricting mitochondria in mammalian cells using live-cell structured illumination microscopy (SIM). By analyzing the diameters of tubules that emerge from mitochondria and implementing a fluorescence lifetime-based mitochondrial membrane tension sensor, we discovered that mitochondria are indeed under tension. Under perturbations that reduce mitochondrial tension, constrictions initiate at the same rate, but are less likely to divide. We propose a model based on our estimates of mitochondrial membrane tension and bending energy in living cells which accounts for the observed probability distribution for mitochondrial constrictions to divide.",

    "abstract": "Although cortical bone strength depends on optimal bone composition, the influences of standard therapeutic agents for osteoporosis on bone mineral accrual in cortical bone are not understood. This study compared effects on cortical bone composition of two current therapeutic approaches for osteoporosis: the anti-resorptive bisphosphonate alendronate (ALN), and anabolic intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH). The experimental anti-resorptive cathepsin K inhibitor, odanacatib (ODN) which inhibits resorption without inhibiting bone formation, was also tested.\\n\\nTo determine effects of these agents on Haversian remodeling and mineral accrual, we compared ALN (100g/kg/2xweek), PTH(1-34) (15g/kg, 5x/week) and ODN (7.5M/day) administered for 10 months commencing 6 months after ovariectomy (OVX) in skeletally mature rabbits by histomorphometry. We used synchrotron-based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (sFTIRM), coupled to fluorochrome labelling, to measure maturation of the cortical matrix in situ at both endocortical and intracortical sites of bone formation.\\n\\nPTH and ODN, but not ALN, treatment increased bone toughness, and PTH treatment stimulated bone formation, not only on endocortical and periosteal bone, but also in intracortical pores. In Sham and OVX rabbits, normal matrix maturation was observed at both endocortical and intracortical sites including: mineral accrual (increasing mineral:matrix), carbonate substitution (carbonate:mineral) and collagen molecular compaction (amide I:II) in situ in endocortical and intracortical bone. ALN treatment reduced bone formation on these surfaces. In ALN-treated bone, while intracortical bone matured normally, endocortical bone did not show a significant increase in mineral:matrix. ODN treatment resulted in slower mineral accrual and limited carbonate substitution. While PTH-treatment did not modify matrix maturation in endocortical bone, the initial stages of mineral accrual were slower in intracortical bone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, these three classes of therapy have differing effects on both bone formation, and the process of bone matrix maturation. ALN suppresses bone formation, and the normal process of matrix maturation in endocortical bone. ODN does not suppress bone formation, but limits mineral accrual. PTH stimulates bone formation, and the matrix formed matures normally in endocortical bone. The ability of PTH treatment to stimulate bone formation in intracortical bone may provide a novel additional mechanism by which PTH increases bone strength.",

Transgenerational inheritance of RNA interference phenotypes in Caenorhabditis elegans provides an excellent model to study this phenomenon, and whilst studies have implicated both chromatin modifications and small RNA pathways in heritable silencing their relative contributions remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that the histone methyltransferases SET-25 and SET-32 are required for the establishment of a transgenerational silencing signal but not for long-term maintenance of this signal between subsequent generations, suggesting that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a multi-step process with distinct genetic requirements for establishment and maintenance of heritable silencing. Furthermore, small RNA sequencing reveals that the abundance of secondary siRNAs (thought to be the effector molecules of heritable silencing) does not correlate with silencing phenotypes. Together, our results suggest that the current mechanistic models of epigenetic inheritance are incomplete.",

    "abstract": "Startle responses triggered by aversive stimuli including predators are widespread across animals. These coordinated whole-body actions require the rapid and simultaneous activation of a large number of muscles. Here we study a startle response in a planktonic larva to understand the whole-body circuit implementation of the behavior. Upon encountering water vibrations, larvae of the annelid Platynereis close their locomotor cilia and simultaneously contract the body and raise the parapodia. The startle response is mediated by collar receptor neurons expressing the polycystins PKD1-1 and PKD2-1. CRISPR-generated PKD1-1 and PKD2-1 mutant larvae do not startle and fall prey to a copepod predator at a higher rate. Reconstruction of the whole-body connectome of the collar-receptor-cell circuitry revealed converging feedforward circuits to the ciliary bands and muscles. The wiring diagram suggests circuit mechanisms for the intersegmental and left-right coordination of the response. Our results reveal how polycystin-mediated mechanosensation can trigger a coordinated whole-body effector response involved in predator avoidance.\\n\\nShort SummaryThe neuronal circuitry of the Platynereis startle response links polycystin-dependent hydrodynamic sensors to muscle and ciliary effector cells",

    "abstract": "Olfactory receptor usage is highly non-uniform, with some receptor types being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. We propose an explanation for this striking fact: the receptor distribution is tuned to maximally represent information about the olfactory environment in a little-studied regime of efficient coding that is sensitive to the global context of correlated sensor responses. This model predicts further that in mammals, where olfactory sensory neurons are replaced regularly, receptor abundances should continuously adapt to odor statistics. Indeed, experiments have found such changes in response to olfactory experience. These changes are mysteriously context-dependent, with increased exposure to odorants leading variously to increased, decreased or unchanged abundances of activated receptors. We show that efficient coding theory predicts precisely such a context-dependence when sensors are correlated. Finally, we demonstrate simple dynamical rules for neural birth and death processes that might provide a mechanism for receptor abundances to adapt optimally.",

In widely used methods such as hierarchical clustering (HC) and consensus clustering (CC), expression profiles of all genes are often used to assess similarity between samples for clustering. These methods output sample clusters, but are not able to provide information about which gene sets (functions) contribute most to the clustering. So interpretability of their results is limited. We hypothesized that integrating prior knowledge of annotated biological processes would not only achieve satisfying clustering performance but also, more importantly, enable potential biological interpretation of clusters.\\n\\nResultsHere we report ClusterMine, a novel approach that identifies clusters by assessing functional similarity between samples through integrating known annotated gene sets, e.g., in Gene Ontology. In addition to outputting cluster membership of each sample as conventional approaches do, it outputs gene sets that are most likely to contribute to the clustering, a feature facilitating biological interpretation. Using three cancer datasets, two single cell RNA-sequencing based cell differentiation datasets, one cell cycle dataset and two datasets of cells of different tissue origins, we found that ClusterMine achieved similar or better clustering performance and that top-scored gene sets prioritized by ClusterMine are biologically relevant.\\n\\nImplementation and availabilityClusterMine is implemented as an R package and is freely available at: www.genemine.org/clustermine.php\\n\\nContactjxwang@csu.edu.cn\\n\\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Finding a fast and cheap way to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the bacterial infections is critical for efficient diagnostics and treatment. An important step towards understanding these mechanisms is discovering bacterial effectors, the proteins secreted into the host through one of the six common secretion system types. Unfortunately, current effector prediction methods are designed to specifically target one of three secretion systems, and no accurate \\\"secretion system-agnostic\\\" method is available.\\n\\nHere, we present PREFFECTOR, a computational feature-based approach to discover effectors in Gram-negative bacteria without prior knowledge on bacterial secretion system(s) or cryptic secretion signals. Our approach was first evaluated using several assessment protocols on a manually curated, balanced dataset of experimentally determined effectors across all six secretion systems as well as non-effector proteins. The evaluation revealed high accuracy of the top performing classifiers in PREFFECTOR, with the small false positive discovery rate across all six secretion systems. Our method was also applied to four bacteria that had limited knowledge on virulence factors or secreted effectors. PREFFECTOR web-server is freely available at: http://korkinlab.org/preffector.",

However, few strategies have been elaborated to rationally modulate drug residence time and thereby to integrate this key property into the drug development process. Here, we show that the interaction between a halogen moiety on an inhibitor and an aromatic residue in the target protein can significantly increase inhibitor residence time. By using the interaction of the serine/threonine kinase haspin with 5-iodotubercidin (5-iTU) derivatives as a model for an archetypal active state (type I) kinase-inhibitor binding mode, we demonstrate that inhibitor residence times markedly increase with the size and polarizability of the halogen atom. This key interaction is dependent on the interactions with an aromatic residue in the gate keeper position and we observe this interaction in other kinases with an aromatic gate keeper residue. We provide a detailed mechanistic characterization of the halogen-aromatic {pi} interactions in the haspin-inhibitor complexes by means of kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural measurements along with binding energy calculations. Since halogens are frequently used in drugs and aromatic residues are often present in the binding sites of proteins, our results provide a compelling rationale for introducing aromatic-halogen interactions to prolong drug-target residence times.",

We employed the photolabile Ca2+ chelator o-nitrophenyl EGTA to induce bursts of intracellular free Ca2+ by laser photolysis. Ca2+ bursts appear within seconds and are restricted to individual target cells. Cell contraction reliably followed within a minute, to about half of the cross-sectional area. Increased Ca2+ levels and contraction were reversible and the target cells further participated in tissue morphogenesis. Cell contractions are paralleled with non-muscle myosin-II accumulation in the apico-medial cortex, indicating that Ca2+ bursts trigger non-muscle myosin II activation. Our approach can be easily adapted to many experimental systems and species, as no specific genetic elements are required and a widely used reagent is employed.",

    "abstract": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques now allow relatively easy and affordable sequencing of large portions of the genome, even for non-model organisms. Many phylogenetic studies reduce costs by focusing their sequencing efforts on a selected set of targeted loci, commonly enriched using sequence capture. The advantage of this approach is that it recovers a consistent set of loci, each with high sequencing depth, which leads to more confidence in the assembly of target sequences. High sequencing depth can also be used to identify phylogenetically informative allelic variation within sequenced individuals, but allele sequences are infrequently assembled in phylogenetic studies.\\n\\nInstead, many scientists perform their phylogenetic analyses using contig sequences which result from the de novo assembly of sequencing reads into contigs containing only canonical nucleobases, and this may reduce both statistical power and phylogenetic accuracy. Here, we develop an easy-to-use pipeline to recover allele sequences from sequence capture data, and we use simulated and empirical data to demonstrate the utility of integrating these allele sequences to analyses performed under the Multispecies Coalescent (MSC) model. Our empirical analyses of Ultraconserved Element (UCE) locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last three million years. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species, and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences.",

These signals can help the opponent to estimate the correct distance, thus they can promote honest signalling of intentions. Here I show that ranging signals that help the estimation of distance between opponents can be evolutionarily stable.

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota influences several biological functions including immune response. Inflammatory bowel disease is favourably influenced by consumption of several dietary natural plant products such as pomegranate, walnuts and berries containing polyphenolic compounds such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid. The gut microbiota metabolises ellagic acid leading to formation of bioactive urolithins A, B, C and D. Urolithin A (UA) is the most active and effective gut metabolite and acts as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agent. However, how gut metabolite UA affects the function of immune cells remained incompletely understood. T cell proliferation is stimulated by store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) resulting from stimulation of Orai1 by STIM1/STIM2. We show here that treatment of murine CD4+ T cells with UA (10 {micro}M, 3 days) significantly blunted SOCE in CD4+ T cells, an effect paralleled by significant downregulation of Orai1 and STIM1/2 transcript levels and protein abundance. UA treatment further increased miR-10a-5p abundance in CD4+ T cells in a dose dependent fashion. Overexpression of miR-10a-5p significantly decreased STIM1/2 and Orai1 mRNA and protein levels as well as SOCE in CD4+ T cells. UA further decreased CD4+ T cell proliferation. Thus, bacterial metabolite UA up-regulates miR-10a-5p thus interfering with Orai1/STIM1/STIM2 expression, store operated Ca2+ entry and proliferation of murine CD4+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "The Rhesus macaque is a valuable preclinical animal model to estimate vaccine effectiveness, and is also important for understanding antibody maturation and B-cell repertoire evolution responding to vaccination; however, incomplete mapping of rhesus immunoglobulin germline genes hinders the research efforts. To address this deficiency, we sequenced B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of 75 India Rhesus macaques. Using a bioinformatic method that has been validated with BCR repertoire analysis of three human donors, we were able to infer rhesus Variable (V) and Joint(J) germline alleles, identifying a total of 122 V and 20 J germline alleles. Importantly, 91 V and 13 J alleles were novel, and 40 V and 13 J genes were found at a novel genome region that has not been previously recorded. The novelty of these newly identified alleles was supported by two observations. Firstly, 50 V and 5 J novel alleles were observed in whole genome sequencing data of 10 Rhesus macaques. Secondly, using alignment reference including the novel alleles, the mutation rate of rearranged repertoires was significant declined in 9 other irrelevant samples, and all our identified novel V and J alleles were 100% identity mapped by rearranged repertoire data. These newly identified novel alleles, along with previous reported alleles, provide an important reference for future investigations of rhesus immune repertoire evolution, in response to vaccination or infection. In addition, the method outlined in our study offered an example to future efforts in identifying novel immunoglobulin alleles.",

    "abstract": "Alkenes are industrially important platform chemicals with broad applications. In this study, we report a microbial conversion route for direct biosynthesis of medium and long chain terminal alkenes from fermentable sugars by harnessing a novel P450 fatty acid (FA) decarboxylase from Macrococcus caseolyticus (OleTMC). We first characterized OleTMC and demonstrated its in vitro H2O2-independent activities towards linear and saturated C10:0-C18:0 FAs, with the highest activity for C16:0 and C18:0 FAs. Combining protein homology modeling, in silico residue mutation analysis, and docking simulation with direct experimental evidence, we elucidated the underlying mechanism for governing the observed substrate preference of OleTMC, which depends on the size of FA binding pocket, not the catalytic site. Next, we engineered the terminal alkene biosynthesis pathway, consisting of an engineered E. coli thioesterase (TesA*) and OleTMC, and introduced this pathway into E. coli for direct terminal alkene biosynthesis from glucose. The recombinant strain E. coli EcNN101 produced a total of 17.78 {+/-} 0.63 mg/L odd-chain terminal alkenes, comprising of 0.9% {+/-} 0.5% C11 alkene, 12.7% {+/-} 2.2% C13 alkene, 82.7% {+/-} 1.7% C15 alkene, and 3.7% {+/-} 0.8% C17 alkene, and a yield of 0.87 {+/-} 0.03 (mg/g) on glucose after 48 h in baffled shake flasks. To improve the terminal alkene production, we identified and overcame the electron transfer limitation in OleTMC, by introducing a two-component redox system, consisting of a putidaredoxin reductase CamA and a putidaredoxin CamB from Pseudomonas putida, into EcNN101, and demonstrated the terminal alkene production increased [~]2.8 fold after 48 h. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the function of P450 FA decarboxylases and helps guide future protein and metabolic engineering for enhanced microbial production of target designer alkenes in a recombinant host.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic inheritance contributes fundamentally to transgenerational physiology and fitness. Mechanistic understanding of RNA-mediated chromatin modification and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, which in C. elegans can be triggered by exogenous double-stranded RNA (exo-dsRNA) or facilitated by endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs), has mainly been limited to the post-initiation phases of silencing. Indeed, the dynamic process by which nuclear RNAi engages a transcriptionally active target, before the repressive state is stably established, remains largely a mystery. Here we found that the onset of exo-dsRNA-induced nuclear RNAi is a transgenerational process, and that establishment requires SET-32, one of the three putative histone methyltransferases (HMTs) that are required for H3K9me3 deposition at the nuclear RNAi targets. We also performed multigenerational whole-genome analyses to examine the establishment of silencing at endogenous targets of germline nuclear RNAi. The nuclear Argonaute protein HRDE-1 is essential for the maintenance of nuclear RNAi. Repairing a loss-of-function mutation in hrde-1 by CRISPR restored the silencing of endogenous targets in animals carrying wild type set-32. However, for numerous endogenous targets, repairing the hrde-1 mutation in a set-32;hrde-1 double mutant failed to restore their silencing states in up to 20 generations after the hrde-1 repair, using a similar genome editing approach. We found that despite a prominent role in the establishment of silencing, however, set-32 is completely dispensable for the maintenance of silencing once HRDE-1-dependent gene repression is established. Our study indicates that: 1) establishment and maintenance of siRNA-guided transcriptional repression are two distinct processes with different genetic requirements; and 2) the rate-limiting step of the establishment phase is a transgenerational, chromatin-based process. In addition, our study reveals a novel paradigm in which a heterochromatin factor primarily functions to promote the establishment of transgenerational silencing, expanding mechanistic understanding of the well-recognized role of heterochromatin in epigenetic maintenance.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that many proteins start to fold cotranslationally, before the entire polypeptide chain has been synthesized on the ribosome. One class of proteins that a priori would seem particularly prone to cotranslational folding is repeat proteins, i.e., proteins that are built from an array of nearly identical sequence repeats. However, while the folding of repeat proteins has been studied extensively in vitro with purified proteins, only a handful of studies have addressed the issue of cotranslational folding of repeat proteins. Here, we have determined the structure and studied the cotranslational folding of a {beta}-helix pentarepeat protein from the human pathogen Clostridium botulinum - a homolog of the Fluoroquinolone Resistance Protein MfpA - using an assay in which the SecM translational arrest peptide serves as a force sensor to detect folding events. We find that cotranslational folding of a segment corresponding to the first four of the eight {beta}-helix coils in the protein produces enough force to release ribosome stalling, and that folding starts when this unit is ~35 residues away from the P-site, near the distal end of the ribosome exit tunnel. An additional folding transition is seen when the whole PENT moiety emerges from the exit tunnel. The early cotranslational formation of a folded unit may be important to avoid misfolding events in vivo, and may reflect the minimal size of a stable {beta}-helix since it is structurally homologous to the smallest known {beta}-helix protein, a four-coil protein that is stable in solution.",

    "abstract": "Copy-number changes generate phenotypic variability in health and disease. Whether organisms protect against copy-number changes is largely unknown. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae monitors the copy number of its ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rapidly responds to copy-number loss with the clonal amplification of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) from chromosomal repeats. ERC production is proportional to repeat loss and reaches a dynamic steady state that responds to the addition of exogenous rDNA copies. ERC levels are also modulated by RNAPI activity and diet, suggesting that rDNA copy number is calibrated against the cellular demand for rRNA. Lastly, we show that ERCs reinsert into the genome in a dosage-dependent manner, indicating that they provide a reservoir for ultimately increasing rDNA array length. Our results reveal a DNA-based mechanism for rapidly restoring copy number in response to catastrophic gene loss that shares fundamental features with unscheduled copy-number amplifications in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Localizing human brain functions is a long-standing goal in systems neuroscience. Towards this goal, neuroimaging studies have traditionally used volume-based smoothing, registered data to volume-based standard spaces, and reported results relative to volume-based parcellations. A novel 360-area surface-based cortical parcellation was recently generated using multimodal data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and a volume-based version of this parcellation has frequently been requested for use with traditional volume-based analyses. However, given the major methodological differences between traditional volumetric and HCP-style processing, the utility and interpretability of such an altered parcellation must first be established. By starting from automatically generated individual-subject parcellations and processing them with different methodological approaches, we show that traditional processing steps, especially volume-based smoothing and registration, substantially degrade cortical area localization when compared to surface-based approaches. We also show that surface-based registration using features closely tied to cortical areas, rather than to folding patterns alone, improves the alignment of areas, and that the benefits of high resolution acquisitions are largely unexploited by traditional volume-based methods. Quantitatively, we show that the most common version of the traditional approach has spatial localization that is only 35% as good as the best surface-based method as assessed with two objective measures (peak areal probabilities and  captured area fraction for maximum probability maps). Finally, we demonstrate that substantial challenges exist when attempting to accurately represent volume-based group analysis results on the surface, which has important implications for the interpretability of studies, both past and future, that use these volume-based methods.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMost human brain imaging studies have traditionally used low-resolution images, inaccurate methods of cross-subject alignment, and extensive blurring. Recently, a high-resolution approach with more accurate alignment and minimized blurring was used by the Human Connectome Project to generate a multi-modal map of human cortical areas in hundreds of individuals. Starting from this data, we systematically compared these two approaches, showing that the traditional approach is nearly three times worse than the HCPs improved approach in two objective measures of spatial localization of cortical areas. Further, we demonstrate considerable challenges in comparing data across the two approaches, and, as a result, argue that there is an urgent need for the field to adopt more accurate methods of data acquisition and analysis.",

    "abstract": "The transition from childhood to adolescence is marked by distinct changes in behavior, including how one values waiting for a large reward compared to receiving an immediate, yet smaller, reward. While previous research has emphasized the relationship between this preference and age, it is also proposed that this behavior is related to circuitry between valuation and cognitive control systems. In this study, we examined how age and intrinsic functional connectivity strength within and between these neural systems relate to changes in discounting behavior across the transition into adolescence. We used mixed-effects modeling and linear regression to assess the contributions of age and connectivity strength in predicting discounting behavior. First, we identified relevant connections in a longitudinal sample of 64 individuals who completed MRI scans and behavioral assessments 2-3 times across ages 7-15 years (137 scans). We then repeated the analysis in a separate, cross-sectional, sample of 84 individuals (7-13 years). Both samples showed an age-related increase in preference for waiting for larger rewards. Connectivity strength within and between valuation and cognitive control systems accounted for further variance not explained by age. These results suggest that individual differences in functional neural organization can account for behavioral changes typically associated with age.",

    "abstract": "Understanding sensory processing relies on establishing a consistent relationship between the stimulus space, its neural representation, and perceptual quality. In olfaction, the difficulty in establishing these links lies partly in the complexity of the underlying odor input space and perceptual responses. Based on the recently proposed primacy code for concentration invariant odor identity representation and a few assumptions, we have developed a theoretical framework for mapping the odor input space to the response properties of olfactory receptors. We analyze a geometrical structure containing odor representations in a multidimensional space of receptor affinities and describe its low-dimensional implementation, the primacy hull. We propose the implications of the primacy hull for the structure of feedforward connectivity in early olfactory networks. We test the predictions of our theory by comparing the existing receptor-ligand affinity and connectivity data obtained in the fruit fly olfactory system. We find that the Kenyon cells of the insect mushroom body integrate inputs from the high-affinity (primacy) sets of olfactory receptors in agreement with the primacy theory.",

A total of fourteen repetitive sequences were used as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the aim of identifying inter- and intra-species polymorphisms. The (AG)12 and 4P6 probes only produced hybridization signals in wheat, the BAC7 probe only hybridized to the centromeric region of H. vulgare, and the pSc119.2 probe hybridized to both wheat and H. chilense, but not to H. vulgare.

Probes pAs1, pTa535, pTa71, CCS1 and CRW were much conserved, showing no significant polymorphism among the genotypes studied. Probes GAA, (AAC)5, (CTA)5, HvT01 and pTa794 produced the most different hybridization pattern. We identified large polymorphisms in the three accessions of H. chilense studied, supporting the proposal of the existence of different groups inside H. chilense species.

Here, we used polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test for genetic overlap between nsCL/P and seven biologically relevant facial phenotypes. Where evidence was found of genetic overlap, we used bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to test the hypothesis that genetic liability to nsCL/P is causally related to implicated facial phenotypes. Across 5,804 individuals of European ancestry from two studies, we found strong evidence, using PRS, of genetic overlap between nsCL/P and philtrum width; a 1 S.D. increase in nsCL/P PRS was associated with a 0.10 mm decrease in philtrum width (95% C.I. 0.054, 0.146; P = 0.00002). Follow-up MR analyses supported a causal relationship; genetic variants for nsCL/P homogeneously cause decreased philtrum width. In addition to the primary analysis, we also identified two novel risk loci for philtrum width at 5q22.2 and 7p15.2 in our Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of 6,136 individuals.

Recent studies have demonstrated constitutive I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in the epithelial cells of mouse skin and eyes, possibly reflecting the activation of TLRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In this context, another mucosal surface, the lung epithelium, may not be as actively exposed to the external environment as the skin and the conjunctiva, especially since the lower lung airways are typically conceived to be sterile. Whether I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in the lungs is constitutive or induced remains largely unexplored. This is especially important since I{kappa}B{zeta} has been shown to promote the expression of protective cytokine and antimicrobial peptide responses, supporting a role for I{kappa}B{zeta} in lung host defense. We hence evaluated I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in airway epithelia of both humans and mice using immunostaining with antiserum raised against recombinant I{kappa}B{zeta} in our laboratory. We observed positive signal in the nuclei of ciliated epithelial cells lining the central airways. Airway cells of gnotobiotic mice also stained positive, suggesting that I{kappa}B{zeta} expression does not require induction by bacterial PAMPs. Unexpectedly, we also observed staining in the lung epithelia of I{kappa}B{zeta} knockout mice, indicating possible false positive signals from our immunohistochemistry experiments. In this context, 2D gel analysis followed by mass spectrometry revealed that our I{kappa}B{zeta} antiserum also detected a nuclear protein lamin B1. Nevertheless, immunoblotting tissue homogenates from gnotobiotic mouse lungs and primary human airway epithelial cells showed the appropriate 86 kDa band for I{kappa}B{zeta}. Together, these results demonstrate constitutive I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in airway epithelium, suggesting that lung epithelial cells may depend upon I{kappa}B{zeta} expression for airway protection.",

    "abstract": "Translation errors limit the accuracy of information transmission from DNA to proteins. Selective pressures shape the way cells produce their proteins: the translation machinery and the mRNA sequences it decodes co-evolved to ensure that translation proceeds fast and accurately in a wide range of environmental conditions. Our understanding of the causes of amino acid misincorporations and of their effect on the evolution of protein sequences is largely hindered by the lack of experimental methods to observe errors at the full proteome level. Here, we systematically detect and quantify errors in entire proteomes from mass spectrometry data. Following HPLC MS-MS data acquisition, we identify E. coli and S. cerevisiae peptides whose mass and fragment ion spectrum are consistent with that of a peptide bearing a single amino acid substitution, and verify that such spectrum cannot result from a post-translational modification. Our analyses confirm that most substitutions occur due to codon-to-anticodon mispairing within the ribosome. Patterns of errors due to mispairing were similar in bacteria and yeast, suggesting that the error spectrum is chemically constrained. Treating E. coli cells with a drug known to affect ribosomal proofreading increased the error rates due to mispairing at the wobble codon position. Starving bacteria for serine resulted in specific patterns of substitutions reflecting the amino acid deficiency. Overall, translation errors tend to occur at positions that are less evolutionarily conserved, and that minimally affect protein energetic stability, indicating that they are selected against. Genome wide ribosome density data suggest that errors occur at sites where ribosome velocity is relatively high, supporting the notion of a trade-off between speed and accuracy as predicted by proofreading theories. Together our results reveal a mechanistic basis for ribosome errors in translation.",

However, addressing this issue is challenging because it involves cell synchronization, which evokes stress responses which, in turn, affect translation rates.

First, synchrony in different cell-cycle phases was obtained involving the same stress, by using temperature-sensitive mutants. Second, translation and DNA content were measured by flow cytometry in exponentially growing, single cells. We found no major variation in global translation rates through the cell cycle in either fission-yeast or mammalian cells. We also measured phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2, an event thought to downregulate global translation in mitosis. In contrast with the prevailing view, eIF2 phosphorylation correlated poorly with downregulation of general translation and ectopically induced eIF2 phosphorylation inhibited general translation only at high levels.",

To establish causality, we increased sensorimotor cortex excitability during adaptation, using transcranial direct current stimulation. As predicted, this increased retention. Inter-individual variance in the stimulation-induced E:I increase predicted the computational change, which predicted the memory gain. These relations did not hold, and memory was unchanged, with stimulation applied before adaptation. This cognitive state dependent effect was modulated by the BDNF val66met genetic polymorphism. Memory was enhanced by stimulation in Val/Val carriers only, implicating a mechanistic role for activity-dependent BDNF secretion. Sensorimotor cortex E:I causally determines the time constant of memory persistence, explaining phenotypic variation in adaptation decay.",

    "abstract": "'Superagers' are older adults who, despite their advanced age, maintain youthful memory. Previous morphometry studies revealed multiple default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions whose cortical thickness is preserved in superagers and correlates with memory performance. In this study, we examined the intrinsic functional connectivity within DMN and SN in 41 young (24.5 {+/-} 3.6 years old) and 40 elderly adults (66.9 {+/-} 5.5 years old). As in prior studies, superaging was defined as youthful performance on a memory recall task, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Participants underwent a resting state fMRI scan and performed a separate visual-verbal recognition memory task. As predicted, within both DMN and SN, superagers had stronger connectivity compared to typical older adults and similar connectivity compared to young adults. Superagers also performed similarly to young adults and better than typical older adults on the recognition task, demonstrating youthful episodic memory that generalized across memory tasks. Stronger connectivity within each network independently predicted better performance on both the CVLT and recognition task in older adults. Variation in intrinsic connectivity explained unique variance in memory performance, above and beyond preserved neuroanatomy. A post-hoc analysis revealed that DMN and SN nodes were more strongly inversely correlated in superagers than in typical older adults but were similarly correlated in superagers and young adults. Stronger between-network inverse correlations also predicted better memory performance in the entire sample of older adults. These results extend our understanding of the neural basis of superaging as a model of successful aging.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAlternative splice site selection is inherently competitive and the probability of a given splice site to be used also depends strongly on the strength of neighboring sites. Here we present a new model named Competitive Splice Site Model (COSSMO), which explicitly models these competitive effects and predict the PSI distribution over any number of putative splice sites. We model an alternative splicing event as the choice of a 3 acceptor site conditional on a fixed upstream 5 donor site, or the choice of a 5 donor site conditional on a fixed 3 acceptor site. We build four different architectures that use convolutional layers, communication layers, LSTMS, and residual networks, respectively, to learn relevant motifs from sequence alone. We also construct a new dataset from genome annotations and RNA-Seq read data that we use to train our model.\\n\\nResultsCOSSMO is able to predict the most frequently used splice site with an accuracy of 70% on unseen test data, and achieve an R2 of 60% in modeling the PSI distribution. We visualize the motifs that COSSMO learns from sequence and show that COSSMO recognizes the consensus splice site sequences as well as many known splicing factors with high specificity.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur dataset is available from http://cossmo.deepgenomics.com.\\n\\nContactfrey@deepgenomics.com\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Attention can bias visual perception by modulating the neuronal activity of visual areas. However, little is known if blindness can reshape the intrinsic functional organisation within the attention networks and between the attention and visual networks. A voxel-wise network-based functional connectivity strengthen mapping analysis was proposed to thirty congenitally, thirty early and thirty late blind subjects, and thirty sighted controls. Both the blind and sighted subjects exhibited similar spatial distributions of the intrinsic dorsal (DAN) and ventral (VAN) attention networks. Moreover, compared to the sighted controls, the blind subjects showed increased functional coupling within the DAN, and between the DAN and VAN, and between the attention sub-networks and visual areas, suggesting an increased information communication by visual deprivation. However, the onset age of blindness had little impact on the functional coupling of the attention network, indicating that non-visual sensory experience is enough for driving the development of intrinsic functional organization of the attention network. Finally, a positive correlation was identified between the duration of blindness and the functional coupling of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus with the visual network, representing an experience-dependent reorganisation after visual deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Emotionally expressive music and dance occur together across the world. This may be because features shared across the senses are represented the same way even in different sensory brain areas, putting music and movement in directly comparable terms. These shared representations may arise from a general need to identify environmentally relevant combinations of sensory features, particularly those that communicate emotion. To test the hypothesis that visual and auditory brain areas share a representational structure, we created music and animation stimuli with crossmodally matched features expressing a range of emotions. Participants confirmed that each emotion corresponded to a set of features shared across music and movement. A subset of participants viewed both music and animation during brain scanning, revealing that representations in auditory and visual brain areas were similar to one another. This shared representation captured not only simple stimulus features, but also combinations of features associated with emotion judgments. The posterior superior temporal cortex represented both music and movement using this same structure, suggesting supramodal abstraction of sensory content. Further exploratory analysis revealed that early visual cortex used this shared representational structure even when stimuli were presented auditorily. We propose that crossmodally shared representations support mutually reinforcing dynamics across auditory and visual brain areas, facilitating crossmodal comparison. These shared representations may help explain why emotions are so readily perceived and why some dynamic emotional expressions can generalize across cultural contexts.",

    "abstract": "Solanum sisymbriifolium, also known as \\\"Litchi Tomato\\\" or \\\"Sticky Nightshade,\\\" is an undomesticated and poorly researched plant related to potato and tomato. Unlike the latter species, S. sisymbriifolium induces eggs of the cyst nematode, Globodera pallida, to hatch and migrate into its roots, but then arrests further nematode maturation. In order to provide researchers with a partial blueprint of its genetic make-up so that the mechanism of this response might be identified, we used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing to compile a high quality de novo transcriptome of 41,189 unigenes drawn from individually sequenced bud, root, stem, and leaf RNA populations. Functional annotation and BUSCO analysis showed that this transcriptome was surprisingly complete, even though it represented genes expressed at a single time point. By sequencing the 4 organ libraries separately, we found we could get a reliable snapshot of transcript distributions in each organ. A divergent site analysis of the merged transcriptome indicated that this species might have undergone a recent genome duplication and re-diploidization. Further analysis indicated that the plant then retained a disproportionate number of genes associated with photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism in comparison to genes with characteristics of R-proteins or involved in secondary metabolism. The former processes may have given S. sisymbriifolium a bigger competitive advantage than the latter did.",

    "abstract": "We develop a robust coarse-grained model for single and double stranded DNA by representing each nucleotide by three interaction sites (TIS) located at the centers of mass of sugar, phosphate, and base. The resulting TIS model includes base-stacking, hydrogen bond, and electrostatic interactions as well as bond-stretching and bond angle potentials that account for the polymeric nature of DNA. The choices of force constants for stretching and the bending potentials were guided by a Boltzmann inversion procedure using a large representative set of DNA structures extracted from the Protein Data Bank. Some of the parameters in the stacking interactions were calculated using a learning procedure, which ensured that the experimentally measured melting temperatures of dimers are faithfully reproduced. Without any further adjustments, the calculations based on the TIS model reproduces the experimentally measured salt and sequence dependence of the size of single stranded DNA (ssDNA), as well as the persistence lengths of poly(dA) and poly(dT) chains. Interestingly, upon application of mechanical force the extension of poly(dA) exhibits a plateau, which we trace to the formation of stacked helical domains. In contrast, the force-extension curve (FEC) of poly(dT) is entropic in origin, and could be described by a standard polymer model. We also show that the persistence length of double stranded DNA, formed from two complementary ssDNAs with one hundred and thirty base pairs, is consistent with the prediction based on the worm-like chain. The persistence length, which decreases with increasing salt concentration, is in accord with the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory intended for stiff polyelectrolyte chains near the rod limit. The range of applications, which did not require adjusting any parameter after the initial construction based solely on PDB structures and melting profiles of dimers, attests to the transferability and robustness of the TIS model for ssDNA and dsDNA.",

    "abstract": "Many experiments show that the numbers of mRNA and protein are proportional to the cell volume in growing cells. However, models of stochastic gene expression often assume constant transcription rate per gene and constant translation rate per mRNA, which are incompatible with these experiments. Here, we construct a minimal gene expression model to fill this gap. Assuming ribosomes and RNA polymerases are limiting in gene expression, we find that (1) because the ribosomes translate all proteins, the concentrations of proteins and mRNAs are regulated in an exponentially growing cell volume; (2) the competition between genes for the RNA polymerases makes the transcription rate independent of the genome number. Furthermore, by extending the model to situations in which DNA (mRNA) can be saturated by RNA polymerases (ribosomes) and becomes limiting, we predict a transition from exponential to linear growth of cell volume as the protein-to-DNA ratio increases.",

We identified 31 candidates that were required for cell proliferation in two NSCLC lines, among which the E2 ubiquitin conjugase CDC34 represented the most significant one. CDC34 was elevated in tumor tissues in 67 of 102 (65.7%) NSCLCs, and smokers had higher CDC34 than nonsmokers. The expression of CDC34 was inversely associated with overall survival of the patients. Forced expression of CDC34 promoted, whereas knockdown of CDC34 inhibited lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. CDC34 bound EGFR and competed with E3 ligase c-Cbl to inhibit the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of EGFR. In EGFR-L858R and EGFR-T790M/Del(exon 19)-driven lung cancer in mice, knockdown of CDC34 by lentivirus mediated transfection of short hairpin RNA significantly inhibited tumor formation. These results demonstrate that an E2 enzyme is capable of competing with E3 ligase to inhibit ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of oncoprotein substrate, and CDC34 represents an attractive therapeutic target for NSCLCs with or without drug-resistant EGFR mutations.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation therapies using All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) are highly efficient at treating Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), a minor subtype of Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AML). However, their efficacy, if any, is very limited in the case of non-APL AMLs. We report here that the inhibition of SUMOylation, a post-translational modification related to ubiquitinylation, restores the pro-differentiation and anti-proliferative activities of retinoids in non-APL AMLs. Controlled inhibition of SUMOylation with pharmacological inhibitors (2-D08 or anacardic acid), or via overexpression of SENP desumoylases, strongly enhances the ATRA-induced expression of key genes involved in differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis in non-APL AML cells. This activates ATRA-induced terminal myeloid differentiation and reduces cell proliferation and viability, including in AML cells resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. Conversely, enhancement of SUMOylation by overexpressing the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 dampens the expression of ATRA-responsive genes and prevents differentiation. Thus, inhibition of the SUMO pathway is a promising strategy to sensitize non-APL AML patients to retinoids and improve the treatment of this poor prognosis cancer, which has not significantly changed over the past 40 years.",

However, whether cell division in HSCs precedes differentiation is unclear. To this end, we used an HSC cell tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice to assess simultaneously divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs in vivo. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid progenitors, restricted megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (PreMEs) and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors (PreMegs), without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with expression of lineage-specific genes that manifested as functional differences between HSCs and restricted progenitors. Thus, HSC fate decisions appear to be uncoupled from physical cell division. Our results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells. Our data, together with separate findings from embryonic stem cells, suggest that cell division and fate choice are independent processes in pluripotent and multipotent stem cells.",

Damage-induced long non-coding RNAs (dilncRNAs) are transcribed from broken DNA ends and contribute to DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. Here we show that dilncRNAs play a role in DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR) by contributing to the recruitment of the HR proteins BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, without affecting DNA-end resection. In S/G2-phase cells, dilncRNAs pair to the resected DNA ends and form DNA:RNA hybrids, which are recognized by BRCA1 and promote its recruitment to DSBs. We also show that RNase H2 is in a complex with the HR proteins BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2, and RAD51, and that it localizes to DSBs in the S/G2 cell-cycle phase. BRCA2 controls DNA:RNA hybrid levels at DSBs by mediating RNase H2 recruitment and, therefore, hybrids degradation. These results demonstrate that regulated DNA:RNA hybrid levels at DSBs contribute to HR-mediated repair.",

We predicted that 43% of HARs have variants with large opposing effects on chromatin state and 14% on neurodevelopmental enhancer activity. This pattern, consistent with compensatory evolution, was confirmed using massively parallel reporter assays in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells. The species-specific enhancer activity of assayed HARs was accurately predicted from the presence and absence of transcription factor footprints in each species. Despite these striking cis effects, activity of a given HAR sequence was nearly identical in human and chimpanzee cells. These findings suggest that HARs did not evolve to compensate for changes in the trans environment but instead altered their ability to bind factors present in both species. Thus, ML prioritized variants with functional effects on human neurodevelopment and revealed an unexpected reason why HARs may have evolved so rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneously detecting CRISPR-based perturbations and induced transcriptional changes in the same cell is a powerful approach to unraveling genome function. Several lentiviral approaches have been developed, some of which rely on the detection of distally located genetic barcodes as an indirect proxy of sgRNA identity. Since barcodes are often several kilobases from their corresponding sgRNAs, viral recombination-mediated swapping of barcodes and sgRNAs is feasible. Using a self-circularization-based sgRNA-barcode library preparation protocol, we estimate the recombination rate to be ~50% and we trace this phenomenon to the pooled viral packaging step. Recombination is random, and decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the assay. Our results suggest that alternative approaches can increase the throughput and sensitivity of single-cell perturbation assays.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in diverse cancers. Germline PTEN mutations are also associated with a range of clinical outcomes, including PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To empower new insights into PTEN function and clinically relevant genotype-phenotype relationships, we systematically evaluated the effect of PTEN mutations on lipid phosphatase activity in vivo. Using a massively parallel approach that leverages an artificial humanized yeast model, we derived high-confidence estimates of functional impact for 7,244 single amino acid PTEN variants (86% of possible). These data uncovered novel insights into PTEN protein structure, biochemistry, and mutation tolerance. Variant functional scores can reliably discriminate likely pathogenic from benign alleles. Further, 32% of ClinVar unclassified missense variants are phosphatase deficient in our assay, supporting their reclassification. ASD associated mutations generally had less severe fitness scores relative to PHTS associated mutations (p = 7.16x10-5) and a higher fraction of hypomorphic mutations, arguing for continued genotype-phenotype studies in larger clinical datasets that can further leverage these rich functional data.",

    "abstract": "Several groups recently reported coupling CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations and single cell RNA-seq as a potentially powerful approach for forward genetics. Here we demonstrate that vector designs for such screens that rely on cis linkage of guides and distally located barcodes suffer from swapping of intended guide-barcode associations at rates approaching 50% due to template switching during lentivirus production, greatly reducing sensitivity. We optimize a published strategy, CROP-seq, that instead uses a Pol II transcribed copy of the sgRNA sequence itself, doubling the rate at which guides are assigned to cells to 94%. We confirm this strategy performs robustly and further explore experimental best practices for CRISPR/Cas9-based single cell molecular screens.",

    "abstract": "Complex physiological functionality is often the outcome of multiple interacting cell-types, yet mechanistically how a large number of trait-associated genes yield a single multi-cellular network governing the phenotype has not been well defined. Individuals immune-cellular profiles at homeostasis show high heritability and inter-individual variation with functional and clinical implications. We profiled immune cellular variation by mass-cytometry in 55 genetically diverse mouse strains. We identify 788 genes associated with cellular homeostasis, supporting a polygenic model where 52% of genes correspond to core homeostatic functions whose genetic variants suffice to predict phenotype. Trait genes form a multi-cellular network architecture showing increased functional complexity over evolutionary timescales for shared regulation to all cells, specialized cell-specific programs, and between-cell synchronization. Contrasting to human studies suggests the regulatory network expands with environmental exposure history. Our findings shed light on the origin of immune-cellular variation and regulatory architectures that may generalize to other environmentally sensitive systems.",

    "abstract": "Many research questions in visual perception involve determining whether stimulus properties are represented and processed independently. In visual neuroscience, there is great interest in determining whether important object dimensions are represented independently in the brain. For example, theories of face recognition have proposed either completely or partially independent processing of identity and emotional expression. Unfortunately, most previous research has only vaguely defined what is meant by \\\"independence,\\\" which hinders its precise quantification and testing. This article develops a new quantitative framework that links signal detection theory from psychophysics and encoding models from computational neuroscience, focusing on a special form of independence defined in the psychophysics literature: perceptual separability. The new theory allowed us, for the first time, to precisely define separability of neural representations and to theoretically link behavioral and brain measures of separability. The framework formally specifies the relation between these different levels of perceptual and brain representation, providing the tools for a truly integrative research approach. In particular, the theory identifies exactly what valid inferences can be made about independent encoding of stimulus dimensions from the results of multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data and psychophysical studies. In addition, commonly used operational tests of independence are re-interpreted within this new theoretical framework, providing insights on their correct use and interpretation. Finally, we apply this new framework to the study of separability of brain representations of face identity and emotional expression (neutral/sad) in a human fMRI study with male and female participants.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA common question in vision research is whether certain stimulus properties, like face identity and expression, are represented and processed independently.

    "abstract": "2.Bud dormancy and cold hardiness are critical adaptations for surviving winter cold stress for temperate perennial plant species, with shifting temperature-based responses during the winter. The objective of this study was to uncover the relationship between dormancy transition (chilling requirement) and temperature on the loss of cold hardiness and budbreak. Dormant cuttings of Vitis vinifera, V. aestivalis, V. amurensis, and V. riparia were examined to determine the relationship between chilling requirement and temperature on rate of deacclimation (kdeacc). Differential thermal analysis was used to determine kdeacc using mean low temperature exotherms. Effect of chill was evaluated as the deacclimation potential ({psi}deacc), which was the change in kdeacc due to chill accumulation. Budbreak was also evaluated in fully chilled buds at different temperatures. Results indicate that {psi}deacc varies dependent on dormancy state, following a logarithmic response to chill accumulation. The effect of temperature on kdeacc was exponential at low and logarithmic at high temperatures. The combination of {psi}deacc and kdeacc resulted in good prediction of deacclimation. Budbreak phenology was also explained by differences in kdeacc. Deacclimation rates can be used as a quantitative determinant of dormancy transition and budbreak, and to refine models predicting effects of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine is an emerging paradigm that requires realistic, mechanistic models capturing the complexity of the human body. We present two comprehensive molecular to physiological-level, gender-specific whole-body metabolism (WBM) reconstructions, named Harvey, in recognition of William Harvey, and Harvetta. These validated, knowledge-based WBM reconstructions capture the metabolism of 20 organs, six sex organs, six blood cells, the gastrointestinal lumen, systemic blood circulation, and the blood-brain barrier. They represent 99% of the human body weight, when excluding the weight of the skeleton. Harvey and Harvetta can be parameterized based on physiological, dietary, and omics data. They correctly predict inter-organ metabolic cycles, basal metabolic rates, and energy use. We demonstrate the integration of microbiome data thereby allowing the assessment of individual-specific, organ-level modulation of host metabolism by the gut microbiota. The WBM reconstructions and the individual organ reconstructions are available under http://vmh.life. Harvey and Harvetta represent a pivotal step towards virtual physiological humans.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGene expression changes over time in response to perturbations. These changes are coordinated into functional modules via regulatory interactions. The genes within a functional module are expected to be differentially expressed in a manner coherent with their regulatory network. This perspective presents a promising approach to increase power to detect differential signals as well as for describing regulated modules from a mechanistic point of view.\\n\\nResultsWe present an effective procedure for identifying differentially activated subnetworks in molecular interaction networks. Differential gene expression coherent with the regulatory nature of the network is identified. Sequentially controlling error on genes and links results in more efficient inference. By focusing on local inference, our method is ignorant of the global topology, and as a result equally effective on exponential and scale-free networks. We apply our procedure both to systematically simulated data, comparing its performance to alternative methods, and to the transcription regulatory network in the context of particle-induced pulmonary inflammation, recapitulating and proposing additional candidates to some previously obtained results.\\n\\nContactstephen.rush@oru.se, dirk.repsilber@oru.se",
