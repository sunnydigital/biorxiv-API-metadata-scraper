    "abstract": "Deep learning, which describes a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data rich, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems--patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients--and discuss whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem. Furthermore, the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning powering changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of peroxisome proliferation is integral to the peroxisomes many functions. A breakdown in the ability of cells to form peroxisomes is linked to many human health issues, including defense against infectious agents, cancer, aging, heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and forms the basis of a spectrum of peroxisomal genetic disorders that cause severe neuropathologies. The ER serves as a source for preperoxisomal vesicles (PPVs) that mature into peroxisomes during de novo peroxisome biogenesis and to support growth and division of existing peroxisomes. However, the mechanism of PPV formation and release from the ER remains poorly understood. Here we show that the evolutionarily ancient endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III are peroxisome biogenesis factors that function to cleave PPVs budding from the ER into the cytosol. Using comprehensive morphological and genetic assays of peroxisome formation and function we find that absence of ESCRT-III proteins impedes de novo peroxisome formation and results in an aberrant peroxisome population in vivo. Using a cell-free PPV budding assay we show that ESCRT-III proteins Vps20 and Snf7 are required to release PPVs from the ER. ESCRT-III is therefore a positive effector of membrane scission for vesicles budding both away from and towards the cytosol, a finding that has important implications for the evolutionary timing of emergence of peroxisomes and the rest of the internal membrane architecture of the eukaryotic cell.",

    "abstract": "1We developed Convis, a Python simulation toolbox for large scale neural populations which offers arbitrary receptive fields by 3D convolutions executed on a graphics card. The resulting software proves to be flexible and easily extensible in Python, while building on the PyTorch library [32], which was previously used successfully in deep learning applications, for just-in-time optimization and compilation of the model onto CPU or GPU architectures. An alternative implementation based on Theano [33] is also available, although not fully supported.\\n\\nThrough automatic differentiation, any parameter of a specified model can be optimized to approach a desired output which is a significant improvement over e.g. Monte Carlo or particle optimizations without gradients. We show that a number of models including even complex non-linearities such as contrast gain control and spiking mechanisms can be implemented easily.\\n\\nWe show in this paper that we can in particular recreate the simulation results of a popular retina simulation software VirtualRetina [35], with the added benefit of providing (1) arbitrary linear filters instead of the product of Gaussian and exponential filters and (2) optimization routines utilizing the gradients of the model. We demonstrate the utility of 3d convolution filters with a simple direction selective filter. Also we show that it is possible to optimize the input for a certain goal, rather than the parameters, which can aid the design of experiments as well as closed-loop online stimulus generation. Yet, Convis is more than a retina simulator. For instance it can also predict the response of V1 orientation selective cells.\\n\\nConvis is open source under the GPL-3.0 license and available from https://github.com/jahuth/convis/ with documentation at https://jahuth.github.io/convis/.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioural addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behaviour. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighing during decision-making. Healthy controls (n = 21) and pathological gamblers (n = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind, counter-balanced, design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e. they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although in the placebo condition, gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision-making.\\n\\nSignificance statementDopamine has been implicated in risky decision-making and gambling addiction, but the exact mechanisms underlying this influence remain partly elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that dopamine modulates subjective probability weighting, by examining the effect of a dopaminergic drug on risk-taking behaviour, both in healthy individuals and pathological gamblers. We found that selectively blocking dopamine D2/D3 receptors diminished the typically observed distortion of winning probabilities, characterized by an overweighting of low probabilities and underweighting of high probabilities. This made participants more linear in their subjective estimation of probabilities, and thus more rational in their decision-making behaviour. Healthy participants and pathological gamblers did not differ in their risk-taking behaviour, except in the placebo condition in which gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that the conscious perception of a masked stimulus is impaired in schizophrenia, while unconscious bottom-up processing of the same stimulus, as assessed by subliminal priming, can be preserved. Here, we test this postulated dissociation between intact bottom-up and impaired top-down processing and evaluate its brain mechanisms using high-density recordings of event-related potentials. Sixteen patients with schizophrenia and sixteen controls were exposed to peripheral digits with various degrees of visibility, under conditions of either focused attention or distraction by another task. In the distraction condition, the brain activity evoked by masked digits was drastically reduced in both groups, but early bottom-up visual activation could still be detected and did not differ between patients and controls. By contrast, under focused top-down attention, a major impairment was observed: in patients, contrary to controls, the late non-linear ignition associated with the P3 component was reduced. Interestingly, the patients showed an essentially normal attentional amplification of the PI and N2 components. These results suggest that some but not all top-down attentional amplification processes are impaired in schizophrenia, while bottom-up processing seems to be preserved.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute proteins (Agos) are present in all domains of life. While the physiological function of eukaryotic Agos in regulating gene expression is well documented, the biological roles of many of their prokaryotic counterparts remain enigmatic. In some bacteria, Agos are associated with CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) loci and use non-canonical 5-hydroxyled guide RNAs (gRNAs) for nucleic acid targeting. Here we show that using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as the 5 nucleotide of gRNAs stabilizes in vitro reconstituted CRISPR-associated Marinitoga piezophila Argonaute-gRNA complexes (MpAgo RNPs) and significantly improves their specificity and affinity for RNA targets. Using reconstituted MpAgo RNPs with 5-BrdU modified gRNAs, we mapped the seed region of the gRNA, and identified the nucleotides of the gRNA that play the most significant role in targeting specificity. We also show that these MpAgo RNPs can be programmed to distinguish between substrates that differ by a single nucleotide, using permutations at the 6th and 7th positions in the gRNA. Using these specificity features, we employed MpAgo RNPs to detect specific Adenosine to Inosine edited RNAs in a complex mixture. These findings broaden our mechanistic understanding of the interactions of Argonautes with guide and substrate RNAs, and demonstrate that MpAgo RNPs with 5-BrdU modified gRNAs can be used as a highly-specific RNA-targeting platform to probe RNA biology.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEArgonaute proteins are present in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. They play an important role in a wide range of biological processes, from transcriptional and translational gene expression regulation to defense against viruses and silencing of mobile genetic elements. Here we present mechanistic insights into the interactions of the CRISPR-associated Marinitoga piezophila Argonaute (MpAgo) with its guide RNA (gRNA) and RNA substrates. By modifying the 5-nucleotide of the gRNA, we demonstrate that MpAgo-gRNA complexes (RNPs) are easily programmable, have high affinity to fully complementary RNA substrates, and can discriminate by over 300 fold between substrates that differ by only a single nucleotide. These MpAgo RNPs should be useful for probing endogenous RNAs in living cells.",

The identifica-tion of at-risk subjects yet showing no dementia symptoms but who will later convert to AD can be crucial for the effective treatment of AD. For this, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is expected to play a crucial role. During recent years, several Machine Learning (ML) approaches to AD-conversion prediction have been proposed using different types of MRI features. However, few studies comparing these different feature representations exist, and the existing ones do not allow to make definite conclusions. We evaluated the performance of various types of MRI features for the conversion prediction: voxel-based features extracted based on voxel-based morphometry, hippocampus volumes, volumes of the entorhinal cortex, and a set of regional volumetric, surface area, and cortical thickness measures across the brain. Regional features consistently yielded the best performance over two classifiers (Support Vector Machines and Regularized Logistic Regression), and two datasets studied. However, the performance difference to other features was not statistically significant. There was a consis-tent trend of age correction improving the classification performance, but the improvement reached statistical significance only rarely.",

    "abstract": "The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.",

However, metabolic syndrome is mediated by a dysregulation of adiposity and therefore it is critical to study adipose tissue in order to understand the effects of this syndrome on epigenomes. To determine if natural variation in DNA methylation was associated with metabolic syndrome traits, we profiled global methylation levels in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. We measured association between 32 clinical traits related to diabetes and obesity in 201 people from the Metabolic Syndrome In Men cohort. We performed epigenome-wide association studies between DNA methylation levels and traits, and identified associations for 13 clinical traits in 21 loci. We prioritized candidate genes in these loci using eQTL, and identified 18 high confidence candidate genes, including known and novel genes associated with diabetes and obesity traits. Using methylation deconvolution, we examined which cell types may be mediating the associations, and concluded that most of the loci we identified were specific to adipocytes. We determined whether the abundance of cell types varies with metabolic traits, and found that macrophages increased in abundance with the severity of metabolic syndrome traits. Finally, we developed a DNA methylation based biomarker to assess type II diabetes risk in adipose tissue. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that profiling DNA methylation in adipose tissue is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular effects of metabolic syndrome on adipose tissue, and can be used in conjunction with traditional genetic analyses to further characterize this disorder.",

In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing and DNA methylation sequencing were performed to dissect the expression landscape of 14,264 Ogye protein-coding and 6900 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes along with DNA methylation landscape in twenty different Ogye tissues. About 75% of Ogye lncRNAs showed tissue-specific expression whereas about 45% of protein-coding genes did. For some genes, the tissue-specific expression levels were inversely correlated with DNA methylation levels in their promoters. About 39% of the tissue-specific lncRNAs displayed functional association with proximal or distal protein-coding genes. In particular, heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2)-associated lncRNAs were discovered to be functionally linked to protein-coding genes that are specifically expressed in black skin tissues, tended to be more syntenically conserved in mammals, and were differentially expressed in black tissues relative to white tissues. Our results not only facilitate understanding how the non-coding genome regulates unique phenotypes but also should be of use for future genomic breeding of chickens.",

However, the anti-tumorigenic effect and clinical benefit are only transient, and tumors are prone to treatment resistance and relapse. To elucidate mechanistic insights into drug resistance, we have established an in vitro cellular model of MAPK inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma. The cellular model evolved in response to clinical dosage of BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, PLX4032. We profiled transcriptomic changes using RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR arrays. Pathways of melanogenesis, MAPK signaling, cell cycle, and metabolism were significantly enriched among the set of differentially expressed genes of vemurafenib-resistant cells vs control. The transcriptomic changes were validated in two distinct melanoma models, SK-MEL-28 and A375. Both cell lines have activating BRAF mutations and display metastatic potential. Downregulation of tumor suppressors and negative MAPK regulators, dual specific phosphatases, reengages mitogenic signaling. Upregulation of growth factors or cytokine receptors triggers signaling pathways circumventing BRAF blockage. Changes in amino acid and one-carbon metabolism support cellular proliferation despite MAPK inhibitor treatment. In addition, an upregulation of pigmentation in inhibitor resistant melanoma cells was observed. Cellular pathways utilized during inhibitor resistance promoted melanogenesis, a pathway which partially overlaps with MAPK signaling. Upstream regulator analysis suggested gene expression changes of forkhead box and hypoxia inducible factor family transcription factors. The established cellular models offer mechanistic insight into cellular changes and therapeutic targets under inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma. At a systems biology level, the MAPK pathway undergoes major rewiring while acquiring inhibitor resistance. The outcome of this transcriptional plasticity is selection for a set of transcriptional master regulators, which circumvent upstream targeted kinases and provide alternative routes of mitogenic activation. A fine-woven network of redundant signals maintains similar effector genes allowing for tumor cell survival and malignant progression in therapy resistant cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious research shows that men often receive more research funding than women, but does not provide empirical evidence as to why this occurs. In 2014, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) created a natural experiment by dividing all investigator-initiated funding into two new grant programs: one with and one without an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed application success among 23,918 grant applications from 7,093 unique principal investigators in a 5-year natural experiment across all investigator-initiated CIHR grant programs in 2011-2016. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to account for multiple applications by the same applicant and an interaction term between each principal investigators self-reported sex and grant programs to compare success rates between male and female applicants under different review criteria.\\n\\nResultsThe overall grant success rate across all competitions was 15.8%. After adjusting for age and research domain, the predicted probability of funding success in traditional programs was 0.9 percentage points higher for male than for female principal investigators (OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.854-1.022). In the new program focused on the proposed science, the gap was 0.9 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.794-1.229). In the new program with an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator, the gap was 4.0 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.705, 95% CI 0.519- 0.960).\\n\\nInterpretationThis study suggests gender gaps in grant funding are attributable to less favourable assessments of women as principal investigators, not differences in assessments of the quality of science led by women. We propose ways for funders to avoid allowing gender bias to influence research funding.\\n\\nFundingThis study was unfunded.",

Similarly, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) undergo spatially organized fate specification on micropatterned surfaces. Since in vivo validation is not possible for the human, we developed a mouse PSC micropattern system and, with direct comparisons to mouse embryos, reveal the robust specification of distinct regional identities. BMP, WNT, ACTIVIN and FGF directed mouse epiblast-like cells to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and radially pattern posterior mesoderm fates. Conversely, WNT, ACTIVIN and FGF patterned anterior identities, including definitive endoderm. By contrast, epiblast stem cells, a developmentally advanced state, only specified anterior identities, but without patterning. The mouse micropattern system offers a robust scalable method to generate regionalized cell types present in vivo, resolve how signals promote distinct identities and generate patterns, and compare mechanisms operating in vivo and in vitro and across species.",

The present study aimed to investigate the anticancer effects of 5-hydroxy-4-nitro-7-propionyloxy-genistein (HNPG) and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism. The inhibitory effects of cell viability of HNPG were detected using MTT assay, flat plate clone formation method and Transwell assay. The distribution of cell cycle was analyzed using FCM method. The morphological alteration, root-mean-squared roughness (Rq), average roughness (Ra), Young's modulus and adhesive force were measured by AFM. qRT-PCR and western blotting analysis were used to explore the possible molecular mechanism. It was found that HNPG presented with dramatic activity against JEC cells in vitro, inhibited the proliferation and colony formation, attenuated invasion and migration ability, arrested cell cycle in G1 phase in dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, cell body shrunk and pseudopod structure retracted, Rq and Ra reduced, Young's modulus and adhesive force increased, accompanied by {beta}-catenin, C-myc, Cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9 down-regulated. In summary, HNPG may be a novel candidate for chemotherapeutic drug.",

Additionally, we discovered a tight coupling between lineage resemblance and proliferation among malignantly transformed cells. Glioma cells that resemble oligodendrocyte progenitors, which proliferate in the brain, are often found in the cell cycle. Conversely, glioma cells that resemble astrocytes, neuroblasts, and oligodendrocytes, which are non-proliferative in the brain, are generally non-cycling in tumors.\\n\\nConclusionsThese studies reveal a relationship between cellular identity and proliferation in HGG and distinct population structures that reflects the extent of neural and non-neural lineage resemblance among malignantly transformed cells.",

Though antibodies can be raised against antigens with diverse structures, shapes, and sizes, it is unclear why some are more effective at triggering antibody-dependent phagocytosis than others. Here we quantitatively define an antigen height threshold that regulates phagocytosis of both engineered and cancer-specific antigens by macrophages. Using a reconstituted model of antibody-opsonized target cells, we find that phagocytosis is dramatically impaired for antigens that position antibodies >10 nm from the target surface. Increasing antigen height allows for co-localization of Fc receptors and the inhibitory phosphatase CD45 at the cell-cell interface, which reduces Fc receptor phosphorylation, and inhibits phagocytosis. Our work shows that close contact between macrophage and target cell is a requirement for efficient phagocytosis, suggesting that therapeutic antibodies should target short antigens in order to trigger Fc receptor activation through size-dependent physical segregation.",

    "abstract": "Culture-based methods to measure Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used by beach administrators to inform whether bacteria levels represent an elevated risk to swimmers. Since results take up to 12 hours, statistical models are used to forecast bacteria levels in lieu of test results; however they underestimate days with elevated fecal indicator bacteria levels. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests return results within 3 hours but are 2 to 5 times more expensive than culture-based methods. This paper presents a prediction model which uses limited deployments of qPCR tested sites with inter-beach correlation to predict when bacteria will exceed acceptable thresholds. The model can be used to inform management decisions on when to warn residents or close beaches due to exposure to the bacteria. Using data from Chicago collected between 2006 and 2016, the model proposed in this paper increased sensitivity from 3.4 percent to 11.2 percent-a 230 percent increase. We find that the correlation between beaches are substantial enough to provide higher levels of precision and sensitivity to predictive models. Thus, limited deployments of qPCR testing can be used to deliver better predictions for beach administrators at lower cost and less complexity.",

By catalyzing the first, rate-limiting step in the synthesis of serine from glucose, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) controls flux through the biosynthetic pathway for this important amino acid and represents a putative target in oncology. To discover inhibitors of PHGDH, a coupled biochemical assay was developed and optimized to enable high-throughput screening for inhibitors of human PHGDH. Feedback inhibition was minimized by coupling PHGDH activity to two downstream enzymes (PSAT1 and PSPH), providing a significant improvement in enzymatic turnover. Further coupling of NADH to a diaphorase/resazurin system enabled a red-shifted detection readout, minimizing interference due to compound autofluorescence. With this protocol, over 400,000 small molecules were screened for PHGDH inhibition, and following hit validation and triage work, a piperazine-1-thiourea was identified. Following rounds of medicinal chemistry and SAR exploration, two probes (NCT-502 and NCT-503) were identified. These molecules demonstrated improved target activity and encouraging ADME properties, enabling both in vitro and in vivo assessment of the biological importance of PHGDH, and its role in the fate of serine in PHGDH-dependent cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Sister chromatid cohesion on chromosome arms is essential for the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I while it is dispensable for sister chromatid separation during mitosis. It was assumed that, unlike the situation in mitosis, chromosome arms retain cohesion prior to onset of anaphase-I. Paradoxically, reduced immunostaining signals of meiosis-specific cohesin, including the kleisin Rec8, from the chromosomes were observed during late prophase-I of budding yeast. This decrease is seen in the absence of Rec8 cleavage and depends on condensin-mediated recruitment of Polo-like kinase (PLK/Cdc5). In this study, we confirmed that this release indeed accompanies the dissociation of acetylated Smc3 as well as Rec8 from meiotic chromosomes during late prophase-I. This release requires, in addition to PLK, the cohesin regulator, Wapl (Rad61/Wpl1 in yeast), and Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK). Meiosis-specific phosphorylation of Rad61/Wpl1 and Rec8 by PLK and DDK collaboratively promote this release. This process is similar to the vertebrate \\\"prophase\\\" pathway for cohesin release during G2 phase and pro-metaphase. In yeast, meiotic cohesin release coincides with PLK-dependent compaction of chromosomes in late meiotic prophase-I. We suggest that yeast uses this highly regulated cleavage-independent pathway to remove cohesin during late prophase-I to facilitate morphogenesis of condensed metaphase-I chromosomes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn meiosis the life and health of future generations is decided upon. Any failure in chromosome segregation has a detrimental impact. Therefore, it is currently believed that the physical connections between homologous chromosomes are maintained by meiotic cohesin with exceptional stability. Indeed, it was shown that cohesive cohesin does not show an appreciable turnover during long periods in oocyte development. In this context, it was long assumed but not properly investigated, that the prophase pathway for cohesin release would be specific to mitotic cells and will be safely suppressed during meiosis so as not to endanger the valuable chromosome connections. However, a previous study on budding yeast meiosis suggests the presence of cleavage-independent pathway of cohesin release during late prophase-I. In the work presented here we confirmed that the prophase pathway is not suppressed during meiosis, at least in budding yeast and showed that this cleavage-independent release is regulated by meiosis-specific phosphorylation of two cohesin subunits, Rec8 and Rad61(Wapl) by two cell-cycle regulators, PLK and DDK. Our results suggest that late meiotic prophase-I actively controls cohesin dynamics on meiotic chromosomes for chromosome segregation.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian evolutionary history, Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) achieved astonishing success by adapting to an aquatic environment. One unique characteristic of cetaceans, contributing to this adaptive success, is efficient lipid utilization. Here we report comparative genetic analysis of aquatic and terrestrial Cetartiodactyla using 144 genes associated with lipid metabolism. We analyzed mutation rate, amino acid substitution, and metabolic pathways using genetic data publicly available. Our test detected 18 positively selected genes in Cetacea compared to 13 in Bovidae with little overlap between the lineages. We identified lineage-specific patterns of amino acid substitutions and functional domain that were mutually exclusive between cetaceans and bovids, supporting divergent evolution of lipid metabolism since the divergence of these taxa from a common ancestor. Moreover, a pathway analysis showed that the identified genes in cetaceans were associated with lipid digestion, lipid storage, and energy producing pathways. This study emphasizes the evolutionary context of lipid metabolism modification of cetaceans and provides a foundation for future studies of elucidating the adapted biological mechanisms of cetacean lipid metabolism and a framework for incorporating ecological context into studies aimed at investigating adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "PIWI proteins and a specific class of small non-coding RNAs, termed Piwi interacting RNAs (piRNAs), suppress transposon activity in animals on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, thus protecting genomes from detrimental insertion mutagenesis. While in vertebrates the PIWI/piRNA system appears to be restricted to the germline, somatic expression of piRNAs directed against transposons is widespread in arthropods, likely representing the ancestral state for this phylum. Here, we show that somatic expression of PIWI genes and piRNAs directed against transposons is conserved in mollusks, suggesting that somatic PIWI/piRNA expression was already realized in an early bilaterian ancestor. We further describe lineage specific adaptations regarding transposon composition of piRNA clusters and show that different piRNA clusters are dynamically expressed during oyster development. Finally, bioinformatics analyses suggest that different populations of piRNAs participate in the ping-pong amplification loop in a tissue specific manner.",

Understanding of the ICR sequence organization is critical to accurate localization of disease-associated abnormalities including Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes. Previous studies established that the ICR of the H19 - IGF2 imprinted domain included several repeated DNA segments. Using BLAST, BLAT, and Clustal Omega, I conducted detailed sequence comparisons to evaluate the annotation of the unique-repeats upstream of the H19 transcription start site (TSS) and to investigate the extent of similarities among the various repeats. Initial analyses confirmed the existence of two DNA segments consisting of two types of repeats (A and B). However, I find that one of the repeats (B7) is unlikely to be a partial repeat. I provide the genomic positions of the various repeats in the build hg19 of the human genome. I also evaluated the previously predicted CTCF sites (1 to 7) in the context of the ENCODE data: including the positions of DNase I HS clusters and results of ChIP assays. My evaluations did not support the existence of CTCF site 5. Furthermore, the ENCODE data revealed a previously unknown chromatin boundary (consisting of CTCF, RAD21, and SMC3), in a CpG island (CpG27) between the A1 repeat and the H19 TSS. Furthermore, a sequence within this boundary corresponds to a newly discovered CTCF site (I named it CTCF site 8). My discovery of this chromatin boundary in CpG27 entails mechanistic implications.",

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is the most abundant microRNA in hepatocytes and is a central player in liver biology and disease. However, little is known about the role of miR-122 in hepatocyte innate immunity. Herein, we show that restoring miR-122 levels in hepatoma cells markedly increased the activation of both type III and type I interferons (IFNs) in response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA or poly(I:C). We determined that miR-122 promotes IFN production through down-regulating the tyrosine (Tyr705) phosphorylation of STAT3. We show that STAT3 represses IFN activation by inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which is rate-limiting for maximal IFN expression, especially type III IFNs. Through large-scale screening, we identified that miR-122 targets MERTK, FGFR1 and IGF1R, three oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases that directly promote STAT3 phosphorylation. These findings reveal a previously unknown role for miR-122 in hepatic immunity and indicate a new potential strategy for treating hepatic infections through targeting STAT3.",

Here, we report that both cell autonomous and non-autonomous neuronal death are triggered by the production of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (cdsRNA) from a regulated, disarticulated transgene in the setting of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. CdsRNA is a pathogen associated molecular pattern that induces IFN-I in many cell types. Transfection of a dsRNA mimetic into cultured human neurons also induces IFN-I signaling and cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Direct relevance to human disease is found in neurons of ALS-FTD patients carrying C9ORF72 intronic hexanucleotide expansions; cdsRNA isolated from these tissues is comprised of repeat sequences. Together, these findings implicate cdsRNA generated from genomic sequences in neurons as a trigger for sterile, viral-mimetic IFN-I induction and propagated neuronal death within in a neural circuit in the aging nervous system.",

    "abstract": "By altering the dynamics of DNA replication and repair, alternative ploidy states may experience different rates and types of new mutations, leading to divergent evolutionary outcomes. We report the first direct comparison of the genome-wide spectrum of spontaneous mutations arising in haploid and diploid forms of the budding yeast. Characterizing the number, types, locations, and effects of thousands of mutations revealed that haploids were more prone to single-nucleotide and mitochondrial mutations, while larger structural changes were more common in diploids. Mutations were more likely to be detrimental in diploids, even after accounting for the large impact of structural changes, contrary to the prediction that diploidy masks the effects of recessive alleles. Haploidy is expected to reduce the opportunity for conservative DNA repair involving homologous chromosomes, increasing the insertion-deletion rate, but we found little support for this idea. Instead, haploids were more susceptible to particular single-nucleotide mutations in late-replicating genomic regions, resulting in a ploidy difference in the spectrum of substitutions. In diploids we detect mutation rate variation among chromosomes in association with centromere location, a finding that is supported by published polymorphism data. Diploids are Saccharomyces cerevisiae not simply doubled haploids; instead, our results predict that the spectrum of spontaneous mutations will substantially shape the dynamics of genome evolution in haploid and diploid populations.",

We previously reported that BDNF derived from promoters I and II is highly expressed in hypothalamus and is critical for regulating aggression in male mice. Here we report that BDNF loss from these promoters causes reduced sexual receptivity and impaired maternal care in female mice, which is concomitant with decreased oxytocin (Oxt) expression during development. We identify a novel link between BDNF signaling, oxytocin, and maternal behavior by demonstrating that ablation of TrkB selectively in OXT neurons partially recapitulates maternal care impairments observed in BDNF-deficient females. Using translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-sequencing we define a molecular profile for OXT neurons and delineate how BDNF signaling impacts gene pathways critical for structural and functional plasticity. Our findings highlight BDNF as a modulator of sexually-dimorphic hypothalamic circuits that govern female-typical behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Despite strong interest over many years, the usage of quantitative trait loci in plant breeding has often failed to live up to expectations. A key weak point in the utilisation of QTLs is the \\\"quality\\\" of markers used during marker-assisted selection (MAS): unreliable markers result in variable outcomes, leading to a perception that MAS products fail to achieve reliable improvement. Most reports of markers used for MAS focus on markers derived from the mapping population. There are very few studies that examine the reliability of these markers in other genetic backgrounds, and critically, no metrics exist to describe and quantify this reliability. To improve the MAS process, this work proposes five core metrics that fully describe the reliability of a marker. These metrics give a comprehensive and quantitative measure of the ability of a marker to correctly classify germplasm as QTL[+]/[-], particularly against a background of high allelic diversity. Markers that score well on these metrics will have far higher reliability in breeding, and deficiencies in specific metrics give information on circumstances under which a marker may not be reliable. The metrics are applicable across different marker types and platforms, allowing an objective comparison of the performance of different markers irrespective of the platform. Evaluating markers using these metrics demonstrates that trait-specific markers consistently out-perform markers designed for other purposes. These metrics also provide a superb set of criteria for designing superior marker systems for a target QTL, enabling the selection of an optimal marker set before committing to design.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis has evolved repeatedly from the ancestral C3 state to generate a carbon concentrating mechanism that increases photosynthetic efficiency. This specialised form of photosynthesis is particularly common in the PACMAD clade of grasses, and is used by many of the worlds most productive crops. The C4 cycle is accomplished through cell-type specific accumulation of enzymes but cis-elements and transcription factors controlling C4 photosynthesis remain largely unknown. Using the NADP-Malic Enzyme (NADP-ME) gene as a model we aimed to better understand molecular mechanisms associated with the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Two basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors, ZmbHLH128 and ZmbHLH129, were shown to bind the C4 NADP-ME promoter from maize. These proteins form heterodimers and ZmbHLH129 impairs trans-activation by ZmbHLH128. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that a pair of cis-elements separated by a seven base pair spacer synergistically bind either ZmbHLH128 or ZmbHLH129. This pair of cis-elements is found in both C3 and C4 species of the PACMAD clade. Our analysis is consistent with this cis-element pair originating from a single motif present in the ancestral C3 state. We conclude that C4 photosynthesis has co-opted an ancient C3 regulatory code built on G-box recognition by bHLH to regulate the NADP-ME gene. More broadly, our findings also contribute to the understanding of gene regulatory networks controlling C4 photosynthesis.",

However, whether the genetic architecture underlying mating behavior divergence is related to the biogeographic history and the tempo and mode of speciation remains poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to infer the number, distribution, and effect size of mating song rhythm variation in the crickets Laupala eukolea and L. cerasina, which occur on different islands (Maui and Hawaii). We then compare these results with a similar study of an independently evolving species pair that diverged within the same island. Finally, we annotate the L. cerasina transcriptome and test whether QTL fall in functionally enriched genomic regions. We document a polygenic architecture behind song rhythm divergence in the inter-island species pair that is remarkably similar to that previously found for an intra-island species pair in the same genus. Importantly, QTL regions were significantly enriched for potential homologs of genes involved in pathways that may be modulating cricket song rhythm. These clusters of loci could constrain the spatial genomic distribution of genetic variation underlying cricket song variation and harbor several candidate genes that merit further study.",

We externally tested metaGRS, individually and in combination with available conventional risk factors, in 22,242 CAD cases and 460,387 non-cases from UK Biobank.\\n\\nFindingsIn UK Biobank, a standard deviation increase in metaGRS had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.71 (95% CI 1.68-1.73) for CAD, greater than any other externally tested genetic risk score. Individuals in the top 20% of the metaGRS distribution had a HR of 4.17 (95% CI 3.97-4.38) compared with those in the bottom 20%. The metaGRS had higher C-index (C=0.623, 95% CI 0.615-0.631) for incident CAD than any of four conventional factors (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and body mass index), and addition of the metaGRS to a model of conventional risk factors increased C-index by 3.7%.

This map provides an unprecedented resource to predict TFs responsible for metabolic transformation in patient-derived tumor samples, opening new opportunities in designing modulators of oncogenic TFs and in understanding disease etiology.",

    "abstract": "Soft tissues are biopolymeric materials, primarily made of collagen and water. These tissues have non-linear, anisotropic, and inelastic mechanical behaviors that are often categorized into viscoelastic behavior, plastic deformation, and damage. While tissues elastic and viscoelastic mechanical properties have been measured for decades, there is no comprehensive theoretical framework for modeling inelastic behaviors of these tissues that is based on their structure. To model the three major inelastic mechanical behaviors of soft tissue we formulated a structurally inspired continuum mechanics framework based on the energy of molecular bonds that break and reform in response to external loading (reactive bonds). In this framework, we employed the theory of internal state variables and kinetics of molecular bonds. The number fraction of bonds, their reference deformation gradient, and damage parameter were used as internal state variables that allowed for consistent modeling of all three of the inelastic behaviors of tissue by using the same sets of constitutive relations. Several numerical examples are provided that address practical problems in tissue mechanics, including the difference between plastic deformation and damage. This model can be used to identify relationships between tissues mechanical response to external loading and its biopolymeric structure.",

We describe extensive improvements to EffectorP, the first machine learning classifier for fungal effector prediction. EffectorP 2.0 is now trained on a larger set of effectors and utilizes a different approach based on an ensemble of classifiers trained on different subsets of negative data, offering different views on classification. EffectorP 2.0 achieves accuracy of 89%, compared to 82% for EffectorP 1.0 and 59.8% for a small size classifier. Important features for effector prediction appear to be protein size, protein net charge as well as the amino acids serine and cysteine. EffectorP 2.0 decreases the number of predicted effectors in secretomes of fungal plant symbionts and saprophytes by 40% when compared to EffectorP 1.0. However, EffectorP 1.0 retains value and combining EffectorP 1.0 and 2.0 results in a stringent classifier with low false positive rate of 9%. EffectorP 2.0 predicts significant enrichments of effectors in 12 out of 13 sets of infection-induced proteins from diverse fungal pathogens, whereas a small cysteine-rich classifier detects enrichment only in 7 out of 13. EffectorP 2.0 will fast-track prioritization of high-confidence effector candidates for functional validation and aid in improving our understanding of effector biology.

    "abstract": "The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), the type species of alphabaculoviruses, is an enveloped DNA virus that infects lepidopteran insects and is commonly known as a vector for protein expression and cell transduction. AcMNPV belongs to a diverse group of viral and bacterial pathogens that target the host cell actin cytoskeleton during infection. AcMNPV is unusual, however, in that it absolutely requires actin translocation into the nucleus early in infection, and actin polymerization within the nucleus late in infection coincident with viral replication. Of the six viral factors that are sufficient, when coexpressed, to induce the nuclear localization of actin, only AC102 is essential for viral replication and the nuclear accumulation of actin. We therefore sought to better understand the role of AC102 in actin mobilization in the nucleus early and late in infection. Although AC102 was thought to function early in infection, we found that AC102 is predominantly expressed as a late protein. In addition, we observed that AC102 is required for F-actin assembly in the nucleus during late infection, as well as for proper formation of viral replication structures and nucleocapsid morphogenesis. Finally, we found that AC102 is a nucleocapsid protein and a newly recognized member of a complex consisting of the viral proteins EC27, C42, and the actin polymerization protein P78/83. Taken together, our findings suggest that AC102 is necessary for nucleocapsid morphogenesis and actin assembly during late infection through its role as a component of the P78/83-C42-EC27-AC102 protein complex.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is an important biotechnological tool for protein expression and cell transduction, and related nucleopolyhedroviruses are also employed as environmentally benign insecticides. One impact of our work is to better understand the fundamental mechanisms through which AcMNPV exploits the cellular machinery of the host for replication, which may aid in the development of improved baculovirus-based research and industrial tools. Moreover, AcMNPVs ability to mobilize the host actin cytoskeleton within the cells nucleus during infection makes it a powerful cell biological tool. It is becoming increasingly clear that actin plays important roles in the cells nucleus, yet the regulation and function of nuclear actin is poorly understood. Our work to better understand how AcMNPV relocalizes and polymerizes actin within the nucleus may reveal fundamental mechanisms that govern nuclear actin regulation and function, even in the absence of viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a common feature of multicellularity and morphogenesis in bacteria. While cell death has been well documented when Streptomyces species switch from vegetative (nutrition) to aerial (reproduction) growth, lethal determinants are yet to be discovered to unveil the genetic basis of PCD in mycelial bacteria. In this work we used prodiginines of Streptomyces coelicolor as model to test the hypothesis that a bacterium uses  self-made antiproliferative DNA-damaging agents as toxins of their PCD process. Spatio-temporal visualisation of the autofluorescence of prodiginines reveals that their biosynthesis is triggered in the dying zone of the colony prior to morphological differentiation of the mycelium. A prodiginine nonproducer showed hyper-accumulation of viable filaments, with increased RNA and proteins synthesis when most of the mycelium of the wild-type strain was dead when prodiginine accumulated. Addition of a prodiginine synthesis inhibitor also strongly favoured viable over dead filaments. As self-toxicity has also been reported for other producers of DNA-damaging agents we propose that cytotoxic metabolites synthetized during the morphological transition of filamentous bacteria may be used to execute PCD.\\n\\nSignificance StatementActinobacteria are prolific producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity, but why these bacteria synthetize metabolites with this bioactivity has so far remained a mystery. Using prodiginines (PdGs) as model system, we revealed that the spatio-temporal synthesis of these molecules correlates to cell death of the producer Streptomyces coelicolor and that inhibition of their synthesis results in hyper-accumulation of viable filaments. Since PdGs potentiate death of S. coelicolor recurrently prior to morphological differentiation, this is a form of programmed cell death (PCD). Hence, next to weapons in competition between organisms or signals in inter- and intra-species communications, we propose a third role for secondary metabolites i.e., elements required for self-toxicity in PCD processes.",

Cerebral tau-related pathology first accumulates in the mesial temporal region, while amyloid-related pathology first appears in neocortex. The eventual distributions of these pathologies reflect their anatomical origins. An implication is that the cardinal pathologies might exert preferential effects on the structurofunctional brain changes observed in AD. We investigated this hypothesis in 39 patients with dementia of the Alzheimers type. Interrelationships were analysed between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of the cardinal pathologies, volumetric brain changes using magnetic resonance imaging, and brain metabolism using [18F]-FDG-PET. Amyloid-related pathology was preferentially associated with structurofunctional changes in the precuneus and lateral temporal regions. Tau-related pathology was not associated with changes in these regions. These findings support the hypothesis that tau- and amyloid-pathology exert differential effects on structurofunctional changes in the AD brain. These findings have implications for future therapeutic trials and hint at a more complex relationship between the cardinal pathologies and disruption of brain networks.",

One aspect of this system is a neural critic that determines reward expectations from neural activity. This critic is then used to update a BMI decoder towards an improved performance from the users perspective. Here we demonstrate the ability of a neural critic to classify trial reward value given activity from the primary motor cortex (M1), using neural features from single/multi units (SU/MU), and local field potentials (LFPs) with prediction accuracies up to 97% correct. A nonhuman primate subject conducted a cued center out reaching task, either manually, or observationally. The cue indicated the reward value of a trial. Features such as power spectral density (PSD) of the LFPs and spike-field coherence (SFC) between SU/MU and corresponding LFPs were calculated and used as inputs to several classifiers. We conclude that hybrid features of PSD and SFC show higher classification performance than PSD or SFC alone (accuracy was 92% for manual tasks, and 97% for observational). In the future, we will employ these hybrid features towards our autonomously updating BMI.",

There is emerging evidence that venous sinus stenting is an effective treatment. We use phase contrast cine MRI to observe changes in flow dynamics of multiple intracranial fluids and their response to different treatments in a patient with IIH. We quantified the following parameters at the level of the aqueduct of Sylvius and the cervical C2C3: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), arterial and venous flow; CSF velocity amplitude; artero-venous delay (AVD); artero-CSF delay and percentage of venous outflow normalized to total arterial inflow (tIJV/tA). Analyses were run before lumbar puncture (LP) (A), after LP (B), after medical therapy (C) and after venous stent placements deployed at two separate times (D and E). AVD and tIJV/tA improved only after CSF removal and after stent placements. CSF velocity amplitude remained elevated. Arterial flow profile showed a dramatic reduction after LP with improvement in mean venous flow. This report is the first to demonstrate interactive changes in intracranial fluid dynamics that occur before and after different therapeutic interventions in IIH. We discuss how increased intracranial venous blood could be \\\"tumoral\\\" in IIH and facilitating its outflow could be therapeutic.",

Here we exploit two natural experiments, perturbation of germline genetic variation associated with education which occurs at conception, known as Mendelian randomization, and a policy reform, the raising of the school leaving age in the UK in 1972.

Microbiome development occurs at multiple body sites, each with distinct community compositions and functions. Associations between microbiota at multiple sites represent an unexplored influence on the infant microbiome. Here, we examined co-occurrence patterns of gut and respiratory microbiota in pre- and full-term infants over the first year of life, a period critical to neonatal development and risk of respiratory diseases.\\n\\nResults: Gut and respiratory microbiota collected as longitudinal rectal, throat and nasal samples from 38 pre-term and 44 full-term infants were first clustered into community state types (CSTs) on the basis of their composition. Multiple methods were used to relate the occurrence of CSTs to several measures of infant maturity, including gestational age (GA) at birth, week of life (WOL), and post menstrual age (PMA: equal to GA plus WOL). Manifestation of CSTs followed one of three patterns with respect to infant maturity. First, chronological: independent of infant maturity (GA) at birth, and strongly associated with post-natal age (WOL). Second, idiosyncratic: primarily dependent on maturity (GA) at birth, with persistent differences in CST occurrence between pre- and full-term infants through the first year of life. Third, convergent: CSTs appear earlier in infants with greater maturity (GA) at birth, but after a sufficient post-natal interval their occurrence in pre-term infants reaches parity with full-term infants. The composition of CSTs was highly dissimilar between different body sites, but the CST of any one body site was highly predictive of the CSTs at other body sites. There were significant associations between the abundance of individual taxa at each body site and the CSTs of the other body sites, which persisted after stringent control for the non-linear effects of infant maturity. Significant canonical correlations exist between the microbiota composition at each pair of body sites, with the strongest correlations between more proximal locations.\\n\\nConclusion: Cross-body site associations of developing infant microbiota suggest the importance of research and clinical practices that focus on dynamic interactions between multiple microbial communities to elucidate and promote systemic microbiota development.",

    "abstract": "AimThe Andean uplift has played a major role shaping the current Neotropical biodiversity. However, in arthropods other than butterflies, little is known about how this geographic barrier has impacted species historical diversification. Here we examined the phylogeography of the widespread and color polymorphic spider Gasteracantha cancriformis to: (i) evaluate the effect of the northern Andean uplift on its divergence and, (ii) assess whether its diversification occurred in the presence of gene flow.\\n\\nLocationNorthern Andes and Brazil\\n\\nMethodsWe inferred phylogenetic relationships and divergence times in G. cancriformis using mitochondrial and nuclear data from 105 individuals in northern South America. Genetic diversity, divergence and population structure were quantified. We also compared multiple demographic scenarios for this species using a model-based approach (PHRAPL) to establish divergence with or without gene flow. Finally, we evaluated the association between genetic variation and color polymorphism.\\n\\nResultsBoth nuclear and mitochondrial data supported two well-differentiated clades, which correspond to populations occurring in opposite sides of the Eastern cordillera of the Colombian Andes. The splitting between these clades occurred in the early Pleistocene, around 2.13 million years ago (95% HPD = 0.98-3.93).\\n\\nDespite this vicariant event, there is shared genetic variation between the clades, which is better explained by a scenario of historical divergence in the face of gene flow. Color polymorphism was randomly scattered in both clades and is not statistically associated with the genetic variation studied here.\\n\\nMain ConclusionsThe final uplift of Eastern cordillera of the Colombian Andes was identified as the major force that shaped the diversification of G. cancriformis in Northern South America, resulting in a cis- and trans-Andean phylogeographic structure for the species. The divergence in the face of gene flow between cis- and trans-Andean populations found for this spider has been likely facilitated by the presence of low-elevation passes across the Eastern Colombian cordillera. Our work constitutes the first example where the Andean uplift coupled with gene flow influenced the evolutionary history of an arachnid lineage.",

    "abstract": "It has been widely accepted that the Finno-Ugric Hungarian language, originated from proto Uralic people, was brought into the Carpathian Basin by the Hungarian Conquerors. From the middle of the 19th century this view prevailed against the deep-rooted Hungarian Hun tradition, maintained in folk memory as well as in Hungarian and foreign written medieval sources, which claimed that Hungarians were kinsfolk of the Huns. In order to shed light on the genetic origin of the Conquerors we sequenced 102 mitogenomes from early Conqueror cemeteries and compared them to sequences of all available databases. We applied novel population genetic algorithms, named Shared Haplogroup Distance and MITOMIX, to reveal past admixture of maternal lineages. Phylogenetic and population genetic analysis indicated that more than one third of the Conqueror maternal lineages were derived from Central-Inner Asia and their most probable ultimate sources were the Asian Huns. The rest of the lineages most likely originated from the Bronze Age Potapovka-Poltavka-Srubnaya cultures of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, which area was part of the later European Hun empire. Our data give support to the Hungarian Hun tradition and provides indirect evidence for the genetic connection between Asian and European Huns. Available data imply that the Conquerors did not have a major contribution to the gene pool of the Carpathian Basin, raising doubts about the Conqueror origin of Hungarian language.",

    "abstract": "Ambient temperature is a critical environmental factor for all living organisms. It was likely an important selective force as modern humans recently colonized temperate and cold Eurasian environments. Nevertheless, as of yet we have limited evidence of local adaptation to ambient temperature in populations from those environments. To shed light on this question, we exploit the fact that humans are a cosmopolitan species that inhabits territories under a wide range of temperatures. Focusing on cold perception - which is central to thermoregulation and survival in cold environments-- we show evidence of recent local adaptation on TRPM8. This gene encodes for a cation channel that is, to date, the only temperature receptor known to mediate an endogenous response to moderate cold. The upstream variant rs10166942 shows extreme population differentiation, with frequencies that range from 5% in Nigeria to 88% in Finland (placing this SNP in the 0.02% tail of the FST empirical distribution). When all populations are jointly analysed, allele frequencies correlate with latitude and temperature beyond what can be explained by shared ancestry and population substructure. Using a Bayesian approach, we infer that the allele originated and evolved neutrally in Africa, while positive selection raised its frequency to different degrees in Eurasian populations, resulting in allele frequencies that follow a latitudinal cline. We infer strong positive selection, in agreement with ancient DNA showing high frequency of the allele in Europe 3,000 to 8,000 years ago. rs10166942 is important phenotypically because its ancestral allele is protective of migraine. This debilitating disorder varies in prevalence across human populations, with highest prevalence in individuals of European descent -precisely the population with the highest frequency of rs10166942 derived allele. We thus hypothesize that local adaptation on previously neutral standing variation may have contributed to the genetic differences that exist in the prevalence of migraine among human populations today.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySome human populations were likely under strong pressure to adapt biologically to cold climates during their colonization of non-African territories in the last 50,000 years. Such putative adaptations required genetic variation in genes that could mediate adaptive responses to cold. TRPM8 is potentially one such gene, being the only known receptor for the sensation of moderate cold temperature. We show that a likely regulatory genetic variant nearby TRPM8 has several signatures of positive selection rising its frequency in Eurasian populations during the last 25,000 years. While the genetic variant was and is rare in Africa, it is now common outside of Africa, with frequencies that strongly correlate with latitude and are highest in northern European populations. Interestingly, this same genetic variant has previously been strongly associated with migraine. This suggests that adaptation to cold has potentially contributed to the variation in migraine prevalence that exists among human groups today.",

    "abstract": "Certain human traits such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) and congenital anomalies (CAs) are believed to be primarily genetic in origin. With recent dramatic advances in genomic technologies, genome-wide surveys of cohorts of patients with ND/CAs for point mutations and structural variations have greatly advanced our understanding of their genetic etiologies1,2. However, even after whole genome sequencing (WGS), a substantial fraction of such disorders remain unexplained3. In contrast, the possibility that constitutive epigenetic variations (epivariations) might underlie such traits has not been well explored. We hypothesized that some cases of ND/CA are caused by aberrations of DNA methylation that lead to a dysregulation of normal genome function. By comparing DNA methylation profiles from 489 individuals with ND/CAs against 1,534 population controls, we identified epivariations as a frequent occurrence in the human genome. De novo epivariations were significantly enriched in cases when compared to controls. RNAseq data from population studies showed that epivariations often have an impact on gene expression comparable to loss-of-function mutations. Additionally, we detected and replicated an enrichment of rare sequence mutations overlapping CTCF binding sites close to epivariations. Thus, some epivariations occur secondary to cis-linked mutations in regulatory regions, providing a rationale for interpreting non-coding genetic variation. We propose that epivariations likely represent the causative genomic defect in 5-10% of patients with unexplained ND/CAs. This constitutes a yield comparable to CNV microarrays, and as such has significant diagnostic relevance.",

RSV infection reduces the ciliary beat frequency of the ciliated cells as of 4 days post infection, with complete ciliary dyskinesia observed by day 10. Treatment with RSV fusion inhibitors resulted in an antiviral effect only when added at the time of infection. In contrast, the use of replication inhibitors (both nucleoside and non-nucleosides) elicited a marked antiviral effect even when start of treatment was delayed until one or even three days after infection. Levels of the inflammation marker RANTES (mRNA) increased [~]200-fold in infected-untreated cultures (at three weeks post infection), but levels were comparable to those of uninfected cultures in the presence of PC-876, a RSV-replication inhibitor, demonstrating that an efficient antiviral treatment inhibits virus induced inflammation in this model. Overall, HuAEC offer a robust and physiologically relevant model to study RSV replication and to assess the efficacy of antiviral compounds.",

Here, we study how such a versatile opportunist, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, adapts to conditions inside and outside its model host Caenorhabditis elegans, and use phenotypic and genotypic screens to identify the mechanistic basis of virulence evolution. We found that virulence significantly dropped in unstructured environments both in the presence and absence of the host, but remained unchanged in spatially structured environments. Reduction of virulence was either driven by a substantial decline in the production of siderophores (in treatments without hosts) or toxins and proteases (in treatments with hosts). Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones revealed positive selection and parallel evolution across replicates, and showed an accumulation of mutations in regulator genes controlling virulence factor expression. Our study identifies the spatial structure of the non-host environment as a key driver of virulence evolution in an opportunistic pathogen.",

While most species of Atta cut dicots to incorporate into their fungus gardens, some species specialize on grasses. Here we examine the bacterial community associated with the fungus gardens of grass- and dicot-cutter ants to examine how changes in substrate input affect the bacterial community. We sequenced the metagenomes of 12 Atta fungus gardens, across four species of ants, with a total of 5.316 Gbp of sequence data. We show significant differences in the fungus garden bacterial community composition between dicot- and grass-cutter ants, with grass-cutter ants having lower diversity. Reflecting this difference in community composition, the bacterial functional profiles between the fungus gardens are significantly different. Specifically, grass-cutter ant fungus garden metagenomes are particularly enriched for genes responsible for amino acid, siderophore, and terpenoid biosynthesis while dicot-cutter ant fungus gardens metagenomes are enriched in genes involved in membrane transport. These differences in bacterial community composition and functional capacity show that different substrate inputs matter for fungus garden bacteria, and sheds light on the potential role of bacteria in mediating the ants transition to the use of a novel substrate.",

Generation of A{beta}Os has been recently recognized as a probable initiating event in Alzheimers disease (AD), leading to cognitive impairment. There is a translational gap in AD studies, with promising drugs developed based on work in rodent models failing in AD patients in clinical trials. Additionally, although women have a two-fold greater lifetime risk of developing AD compared to men, females have not been a focus of preclinical studies. Thus, we sought to develop a model of A{beta}O toxicity in female rhesus monkeys, to take advantage of the more highly differentiated cortical structure in this species as well as the similarities in the endocrine system between rhesus monkeys and humans.\\n\\nMethodsRepeated intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injections of A{beta}Os were performed in adult female rhesus monkeys. Controls were unoperated aged matched monkeys. High-resolution confocal microscopy and morphometric analysis of Alexa 568 (A568) filled neurons were used to evaluate synaptic, neuronal, and glial markers in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and hippocampus after A{beta}O injections. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue were also collected and analyzed for biomarkers of AD pathology, including: phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau), total Tau, A{beta}1-42, A{beta}1-40 and TNF- levels.\\n\\nResultsHere, we report that A{beta}O injection into the lateral ventricle of the brain induces loss of 37% of thin spines in targeted dlPFC neurons, an area highly vulnerable in AD and aging. Further, A{beta}Os associate with the synaptic marker PSD95, inducing loss of more than 60% of local excitatory synapses. A{beta}Os induce a robust neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus, far from the injection site, with numerous activated ameboid microglia and TNF- release. Finally, A{beta}Os increased CSF levels of A{beta}1-42, pTau Ser396 and pTau Ser199, but not A{beta}1-40 or total Tau.\\n\\nConclusionsThese initial findings from detailed quantitative analysis of effects of A{beta}O administration on synapses in a female nonhuman primate model are a very promising step toward understanding the mechanism of early AD pathogenesis in the primate brain, and may help develop an effective disease-modifying therapy of high relevance to womens health.",

    "abstract": "The development of fatigue elicits multiple adaptations from the neuromuscular system. Muscle synergies are common patterns of neuromuscular activation that have been proposed as the building blocks of human movement. We wanted to identify possible adaptations of muscle synergies to the development of fatigue in the upper limb. Recent studies have reported that synergy structure remains invariant during the development of fatigue, but these studies did not examine isolated synergies. We propose a novel approach to characterize synergy adaptations to fatigue by taking advantage of the spatial tuning of synergies. This approach allows improved identification of changes to individual synergies that might otherwise be confounded by changing contributions of overlapping synergies. To analyse upper limb synergies we applied non-negative matrix factorization to 14 EMG signals from muscles of 11 participants performing isometric contractions. A preliminary multidirectional task was used to identify synergy directional tuning. A subsequent fatiguing task was designed to fatigue the participants in their synergies preferred directions. Both tasks provided virtual reality feedback of the applied force direction and magnitude, and were performed at 40% of each participants maximal voluntary force. Five epochs were analysed throughout the fatiguing task to identify progressive changes of EMG amplitude, median frequency, synergy structure, and activation coefficients. Three to four synergies were sufficient to account for the variability contained in the original data. Synergy structure was conserved with fatigue, but interestingly synergy activation coefficients decreased on average by 24.5% with fatigue development. EMG amplitude did not change systematically with fatigue, whereas EMG median frequency consistently decreased across all muscles. These results support the notion of a neuromuscular modular organization as the building blocks of human movement, with adaptations to synergy recruitment occurring with fatigue. When synergy tuning properties are considered, the reduction of activation of muscle synergies may be a reliable marker to identify fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Dominantly-inherited Alzheimers disease is widely hoped to hold the key to developing interventions for sporadic late onset Alzheimers disease. We use emerging techniques in generative data-driven disease-progression modelling to characterise dominantly-inherited Alzheimers disease progression with unprecedented resolution, and without relying upon familial estimates of years until symptom onset (EYO). We retrospectively analysed biomarker data from the sixth data freeze of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network observational study, including measures of amyloid proteins and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, regional brain volumes and cortical thicknesses, brain glucose hypometabolism, and cognitive performance from the Mini-Mental State Examination (all adjusted for age, years of education, sex, and head size, as appropriate). Data included 338 participants with known mutation status (211 mutation carriers: 163 PSEN1; 17 PSEN2; and 31 APP) and a baseline visit (age 19-66; up to four visits each, 1{middle dot}1 {+/-} 1{middle dot}9 years in duration; spanning 30 years before, to 21 years after, parental age of symptom onset). We used an event-based model to estimate sequences of biomarker changes from baseline data across disease subtypes (mutation groups), and a differential-equation model to estimate biomarker trajectories from longitudinal data (up to 66 mutation carriers, all subtypes combined). The two models concur that biomarker abnormality proceeds as follows: amyloid deposition in cortical then sub-cortical regions (approximately 24{+/-}11 years before onset); CSF p-tau (17{+/-}8 years), tau and A{beta}42 changes; neurodegeneration first in the putamen and nucleus accumbens (up to 6 {+/-} 2 years); then cognitive decline (7 {+/-} 6 years), cerebral hypometabolism (4 {+/-} 4 years), and further regional neurodegeneration. Our models predicted symptom onset more accurately than EYO: root-mean-squared error of 1{middle dot}35 years versus 5{middle dot}54 years. The models reveal hidden detail on dominantly-inherited Alzheimers disease progression, as well as providing data-driven systems for fine-grained patient staging and prediction of symptom onset with great potential utility in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Light serves as an important environmental cue in regulating plant architecture. Previous work had demonstrated that both photoreceptor-mediated signaling and photosynthesis play a role in determining the orientation of plant organs. TILLER ANGLE CONTROL 1 (TAC1) was recently shown to function in setting the orientation of lateral branches in diverse plant species, but the degree to which it plays a role in light-mediated phenotypes is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that TAC1 expression was light dependent, as expression was lost under dark or far-red growth conditions, but did not display any clear diurnal rhythm. Loss of TAC1 in the dark was gradual, and experiments with photoreceptor mutants indicated this was not dependent upon Red/Far-Red or Blue light signaling, but partially required the signaling integrator CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHGENESIS 1 (COP1). Over-expression of TAC1 partially prevented the narrowing of branch angles in the dark or under Far-Red light. Treatment with the carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor Norflurazon or the PSII inhibitor DCMU led to loss of TAC1 expression similar to dark or far-red conditions, but surprisingly expression increased in response to the PSI inhibitor Paraquat. Our results indicate that TAC1 plays an important role in modulating plant architecture in response to photosynthetic signals.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTBranch angles narrow in darkness or under far-red light. This response is partially mediated by TAC1 which responds to photosynthetic signals, providing a key link between photosynthesis and plant architecture.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory and gene co-expression networks are powerful research tools for identifying biological signal within high-dimensional gene expression data. In recent years, research has focused on addressing shortcomings of these techniques with regard to the low signal-to-noise ratio, non-linear interactions and dataset dependent biases of published methods. Furthermore, it has been shown that aggregating networks from multiple methods provides improved results. Despite this, few usable and scalable software tools have been implemented to perform such best-practice analyses. Here, we present Seidr (stylized Seithr), a software toolkit designed to assist scientists in gene regulatory and gene co-expression network inference. Seidr creates community networks to reduce algorithmic bias and utilizes noise corrected network backboning to prune noisy edges in the networks.\n\nUsing benchmarks in real-world conditions across three eukaryotic model organisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that individual algorithms are biased toward functional evidence for certain gene-gene interactions. We further demonstrate that the community network is less biased, providing robust performance across different standards and comparisons for the model organisms.\n\nFinally, we apply Seidr to a network of drought stress in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Krast) as an example application in a non-model species. We demonstrate the use of a network inferred using Seidr for identifying key components, communities and suggesting gene function for non-annotated genes.",

    "abstract": "Cold-induced thermogenesis increases energy expenditure and can reduce body weight in mammals, so the genes involved in it are thought to be potential therapeutic targets for treating obesity and diabetes. In the quest for more effective therapies, a great deal of research has been conducted to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of cold-induced thermogenesis. Over the last decade, a large number of genes that can enhance or suppress cold-induced thermogenesis have been discovered, but a comprehensive list of these genes is lacking. To fill this gap, we examined all of the annotated human and mouse genes and curated those demonstrated to enhance or suppress cold-induced thermogenesis by in vivo or ex vivo experiments in mice. The results of this highly accurate and comprehensive annotation are hosted on a database called CITGeneDB, which includes a searchable web interface to facilitate broad public use. The database will be updated as new genes are found to enhance or suppress cold-induced thermogenesis. It is expected that CITGeneDB will be a valuable resource in future explorations of the molecular mechanism of cold-induced thermogenesis, helping pave the way for new obesity and diabetes treatments.

An early engineering version of TNscope was used in our submission to the most recent ICGC-DREAM Somatic Mutation calling challenge. In that challenge, TNscope is the leader in accuracy for SNVs, indels and SVs. To further improve variant calling accuracy, we combined the improvements in the variant caller with machine learning. We benchmarked TNscope using in-silico mixtures of well-characterized Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) samples. TNscope displays higher accuracy than the other benchmarked tools and the accuracy is substantially improved by the machine learning model.",

    "abstract": "Adult stem cells persist in mammalian tissues by entering a state of reversible arrest or quiescence associated with low transcription. Using cultured myoblasts and primary muscle stem cells, we show that RNA synthesis is strongly repressed in G0, returning within minutes of activation. We investigate the underlying mechanism and reveal a role for promoter-proximal RNAPol II pausing: by mapping global Pol II occupancy using ChIP-seq, in conjunction with RNA-seq to identify repressed transcriptional networks unique to G0. Strikingly, Pol II pausing is enhanced in G0 on genes encoding regulators of RNA biogenesis (Ncl, Rps24, Ctdp1), and release of pausing is critical for cell cycle re-entry. Finally, we uncover a novel, unexpected repressive role of the super-elongation complex component Aff4 in G0-specific stalling. We propose a model wherein Pol II pausing restrains transcription to maintain G0, preconfigures gene networks required for the G0-G1 transition, and sets the timing of their transcriptional activation.",

    "abstract": "SummaryAlphaMate is a flexible program that optimises selection, maintenance of genetic diversity, and mate allocation in breeding programs. It can be used in animal and cross- and self-pollinating plant populations. These populations can be subject to selective breeding or conservation management. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation of a valid mating plan that is solved with an evolutionary algorithm. A valid mating plan is defined by a combination of mating constraints (the number of matings, the maximal number of parents, the minimal/equal/maximal number of contributions per parent, or allowance for selfing) that are gender specific or generic. The optimisation can maximize genetic gain, minimize group coancestry, minimize inbreeding of individual matings, or maximize genetic gain for a given increase in group coancestry or inbreeding. Users provide a list of candidate individuals with associated gender and selection criteria information (if applicable) and coancestry matrix. Selection criteria and coancestry matrix can be based on pedigree or genome-wide markers. Additional individual or mating specific information can be included to enrich optimisation objectives. An example of rapid recurrent genomic selection in wheat demonstrates how AlphaMate can double the efficiency of converting genetic diversity into genetic gain compared to truncation selection. Another example demonstrates the use of genome editing to expand the gain-diversity frontier.\\n\\nAvailabilityExecutable versions of AlphaMate for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms are available at http://www.alpha-genes.roslin.ed.ac.uk/AlphaMate\\n\\nContactgregor.gorjanc@roslin.ed.ack.uk",

The zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model is used extensively to model many aspects of human-M. tuberculosis pathogenesis but has not been widely used to study the role of infection-induced lipid metabolism. We find mammalian mycobacterial infection-induced alterations in host Low Density Lipoprotein metabolism are conserved in the zebrafish model of mycobacterial pathogenesis. Depletion of LDLR, a key lipid metabolism node, decreased M. marinum burden, and corrected infection-induced altered lipid metabolism resulting in decreased LDL and reduced the rate of macrophage transformation into foam cells.

    "abstract": "Molecular mimicry is the formation of specific molecules by microbial pathogens to avoid recognition and attack by the immune system of the host. Several pathogenic Ascomycota and Zygomycota show such a behaviour by utilizing human complement factor H to hide in the blood stream. We call this type of mimicry molecular crypsis. Such a crypsis can reach a point where the immune system can no longer clearly distinguish between self and non-self cells. Thus, a trade-off between attacking disguised pathogens and erroneously attacking host cells has to be made, which can lead to autoreactivity. Based on signalling theory and protein-interaction modelling, we here present a mathematical model of molecular crypsis of pathogenic fungi using the example of Candida albicans. We tackle the question whether perfect crypsis is feasible, which would imply that protection of human cells by complement factors would be useless. The model identifies pathogen abundance relative to host cell abundance as the predominant factor influencing successful or unsuccessful molecular crypsis. If pathogen cells gain a (locally) quantitative advantage over host cells, even autoreactivity may occur. Our new model enables insights into the mechanisms of candidiasis-induced sepsis and complement associated autoimmune diseases.",

Using this approach, we identified a difference in the electrostatic recognition of substrates between the cytoplasmic Src-family tyrosine kinases Lck and c-Src. This divergence likely reflects the specialization of Lck to act in concert with the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 in T cell receptor signaling. The current understanding of substrate recognition by tyrosine kinases emphasizes the role of localization by non-catalytic domains, but our results point to the importance of direct recognition at the kinase active site in fine-tuning specificity. Our method provides a simple approach that leverages next-generation sequencing to readily map the specificity of any tyrosine kinase at the proteome level.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian adaptation to oxygen flux occurs at many levels, from shifts in cellular metabolism to physiological adaptations facilitated by the sympathetic nervous system and carotid body (CB). Interactions between differing forms of adaptive response to hypoxia, including transcriptional responses orchestrated by the Hypoxia Inducible transcription Factors (HIFs), are complex and clearly synergistic. We show here that there is an absolute developmental requirement for HIF-2a, one of the HIF isoforms, for growth and survival of oxygen sensitive glomus cells of the carotid body. The loss of these cells renders mice incapable of ventilatory responses to hypoxia, and this has striking effects on processes as diverse as arterial pressure regulation, exercise performance, and glucose homeostasis. We show that the expansion of the glomus cells is correlated with mTORC1 activation, and is functionally inhibited by rapamycin treatment. These findings demonstrate the central role played by HIF-2a in carotid body development, growth and function.",
