    "abstract": "Multiple nuclear markers provide genetic polymorphism data for molecular systematics and population genetic studies. They are especially required for the coalescent-based analyses that can be used to accurately estimate species trees and infer population demographic histories. However, in avian evolutionary studies, these powerful coalescent-based methods are hindered by the lack of a sufficient number of markers. In this study, we designed PCR primers to amplify 136 nuclear protein-coding loci (NPCLs) by scanning the published Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genomes. To test their utility, we amplified these loci in 41 bird species representing 23 Aves orders. The sixty-three best-performing NPCLs, based on high PCR success rates, were selected which had various mutation rates and were evenly distributed across 17 avian autosomal chromosomes and the Z chromosome. To test phylogenetic resolving power of these markers, we conducted a Neoavian phylogenies analysis using 63 concatenated NPCL markers derived from 48 whole genomes of birds. The resulting phylogenetic topology, to a large extent, is congruence with results resolved by previous whole genome data. To test the level of intraspecific polymorphism in these makers, we examined the genetic diversity in four populations of the Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) at 17 of NPCL markers chosen at random. Our results showed that these NPCL markers exhibited a level of polymorphism comparable with mitochondrial loci. Therefore, this set of pan-avian nuclear protein-coding loci has great potential to facilitate studies in avian phylogenetics and population genetics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCellular memory is a ubiquitous function of biological systems. By generating a sustained response to a transient inductive stimulus, often due to bistability, memory is central to the robust control of many important biological processes. However, our understanding of the origins of cellular memory remains incomplete. Stochastic fluctuations that are inherent to most biological systems have been shown to hamper memory function. Yet, how stochasticity changes the behavior of genetic circuits is generally not clear from a deterministic analysis of the network alone. Here, we apply deterministic rate equations, stochastic simulations, and theoretical analyses of Fokker-Planck equations to investigate how intrinsic noise affects the memory function in a mutual repression network.\\n\\nResultsWe find that the addition of negative autoregulation improves the persistence of memory in a small gene regulatory network by reducing stochastic fluctuations. Our theoretical analyses reveal that this improved memory function stems from an increased stability of the steady states of the system. Moreover, we show how the tuning of critical network parameters can further enhance memory.\\n\\nConclusionsOur work illuminates the power of stochastic and theoretical approaches to understanding biological circuits, and the importance of considering stochasticity to designing synthetic circuits with memory function.",

    "abstract": "Capicua (Cic) is a transcriptional repressor mutated in the brain cancer oligodendroglioma. Despite its cancer link, little is known of Cics function in the brain. Here, we investigated the relationship between Cic expression and cell type specification in the brain. Cic is strongly expressed in astrocytic and neuronal lineage cells but is more weakly expressed in stem cells and oligodendroglial lineage cells. Using a new conditional Cic knockout mouse, we show that forebrain-specific Cic deletion increases proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells. Furthermore, Cic loss biases neural stem cells toward glial lineage selection, expanding the pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). These proliferation and lineage selection effects in the developing brain are dependent on de-repression of Ets transcription factors. In patient-derived oligodendroglioma cells, CIC re-expression or ETV5 blockade decreases lineage bias, proliferation, self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Our results identify Cic is an important regulator of cell fate in neurodevelopment and oligodendroglioma, and suggest that its loss contributes to oligodendroglioma by promoting proliferation and an OPC-like identity via Ets overactivity.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that microplastic (MP) ingestion can lead to lower food intake and bioaccumulation of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in aquatic organisms. However, causal links between MP and contaminant levels in biota are poorly understood and in situ data are very limited. Here, we investigated whether HOC concentrations in herring muscle tissue (Clupea harengus membras) are related to MP ingestion using fish caught along the West coast of the Baltic Sea. The MP occurrence exhibited a large geographic variability, with MP found in 22.3% of the fish examined. The population average was 1.0 MP ind-1; however, when only individuals containing MP were considered, the average MP burden was 4.4 MP ind-1. We also found that MP burden decreased with reproductive stage of the fish but increased with its body size. To predict MP abundance in fish guts, we constructed a mass-balance model using literature data on MP in the water column and physiological rates on ingestion and gut evacuation for clupeids of a similar size. The model output was in agreement with the observed values, thus supporting the validity of the results. Contaminant concentrations in the muscle tissue were unrelated to the MP levels in fish, suggesting a lack of direct links between the levels of HOCs and MP ingestion. Thus, despite their ubiquity, MP are unlikely to have a measurable impact on food intake or the total body burden of hydrophobic contaminants in Baltic herring.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/363127v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4cb5b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2de3c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c58baborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@154b828_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Some forms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be the clinical precursor of severe dementia like Alzheimers disease (AD), while other types of MCI tend to remain stable over-time and do not progress to AD pathology. To choose an effective and personalized treatment for AD, we need to identify which MCI patients are at risk of developing AD and which are not.\\n\\nHere, we present a novel deep learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc layer for 3D separable convolutions, which aims at identifying those people with MCI who have a high likelihood of developing AD. Our deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 genotyping data as input measures. The most novel characteristics of our machine learning model compared to previous ones are as follows: 1) multi-tasking, in the sense that our deep learning model jointly learns to simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion, and AD vs healthy classification which facilitates the relevant feature extraction for prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier employs relatively few parameters compared to other deep learning architectures (we use ~550,000 network parameters, orders of magnitude lower than other network designs) without compromising network complexity and hence significantly limits data-overfitting; 3) both structural MRI images and warp field characteristics, which quantify the amount of volumetric change compared to the common template, were used as separate input streams to extract as much information as possible from the MRI data. All the analyses were performed on a subset of the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for a total of n=785 participants (192 AD, 409 MCI, and184 healthy controls (HC)).\\n\\nWe found that the most predictive combination of inputs included the structural MRI images and the demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data, while the warp field metric added little predictive value. We achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.925 with a 10-fold cross-validated accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 85% in classifying MCI patients who developed AD in three years time from those individuals showing stable MCI over the same time-period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest performance reported on a test set achieved in the literature using similar data. The same network provided an AUC of 1 and 100% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity when classifying NC from AD. We also demonstrated that our classification framework was robust to different co-registration templates and possibly irrelevant features / image sections.\\n\\nOur approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging modalities, such as PET, and a more diverse group of clinical data. The convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image dataset and gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis system targeting the prediction of any medical condition utilizing multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical data.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has considerably facilitated the generation of mouse knockout alleles, relieving many of the cumbersome and time-consuming steps of traditional mouse embryonic stem cell technology. However, the generation of conditional knockout alleles remains an important challenge. An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout alleles in mice using 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) (2sgRNA-2ssODN). We re-evaluated this method from a large data set generated from a consortium consisting of 17 transgenic core facilities or laboratories or programs across the world. The dataset constituted 17,887 microinjected or electroporated zygotes and 1,718 live born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice harbored 2 correct LoxP insertions in cis configuration indicating a very low efficiency of the method. To determine the factors required to successfully generate conditional alleles using the 2sgRNA-2ssODN approach, we performed a generalized linear regression model. We show that factors such as the concentration of the sgRNA, Cas9 protein or the distance between the placement of LoxP insertions were not predictive for the success of this technique. The major predictor affecting the methods success was the probability of simultaneously inserting intact proximal and distal LoxP sequences, without the loss of the DNA segment between the two sgRNA cleavage sites. Our analysis of a large data set indicates that the 2sgRNA-2ssODN method generates a large number of undesired alleles (>99%), and a very small number of desired alleles (<1%) requiring, on average 1,192 zygotes.",

    "abstract": "The resting-state brain is often considered a nonlinear dynamic system transitioning among multiple coexisting stable states. Despite the increasing number of studies on the multistability of the brain system, the processes of state transitions have rarely been systematically explored. Thus, we investigated the state transition processes of the human cerebral cortex system at rest by introducing a graph-theoretic analysis of the state transition network. The energy landscape analysis of brain state occurrences, estimated using the pairwise maximum entropy model for resting-state fMRI data, identified multiple local minima, some of which mediate multi-step transitions toward the global minimum. The state transition among local minima is clustered into two groups according to state transition rates and most inter-group state transitions were mediated by a hub transition state. The distance to the hub transition state determined the path length of the inter-group transition. The cortical system appeared to have redundancy in inter-group transitions when the hub transition state was removed. Such a hub-like organization of transition processes disappeared when the connectivity of the cortical system was altered from the resting-state configuration. In summary, the resting-state cerebral cortex has a well-organized architecture of state transitions among stable states, when evaluated by nonlinear systematic approach.",

It is currently unknown if these functions are carried out by subsets of microglia during different stages of development and adulthood or within specific brain regions. Here, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of microglia and related myeloid cells sorted from various regions of embryonic, postnatal, and adult mouse brains. We found that the majority of adult microglia with homeostatic signatures are remarkably similar in transcriptomes, regardless of brain region. By contrast, postnatal microglia represent a more heterogeneous population. We discovered that postnatal white matter-associated microglia (WAM) are strikingly different from microglia in other regions and express genes enriched in degenerative disease-associated microglia. These postnatal WAM have distinct amoeboid morphology, are metabolically active, and phagocytose newly formed oligodendrocytes. This scRNA-seq atlas will be a valuable resource for dissecting innate immune functions in health and disease.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMyeloid scRNA-seq atlas across brain regions and developmental stages\\nC_LIO_LILimited transcriptomic heterogeneity of homeostatic microglia in the adult brain\\nC_LIO_LIPhase-specific gene sets of proliferating microglia along cell cycle pseudotime\\nC_LIO_LIPhagocytic postnatal white matter-associated microglia sharing DAM gene signatures\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "To divide, Gram-negative bacterial cells must remodel their peptidoglycan cell wall to a smaller and smaller radius at the division site, but how this process occurs remains debated. While the tubulin homolog FtsZ is thought to generate a constrictive force, it has also been proposed that cell wall remodeling alone is sufficient to drive membrane constriction, possibly via a make-before-break mechanism in which new hoops of cell wall are made inside the existing hoops (make) before bonds in the existing wall are cleaved (break). Previously, we constructed software, REMODELER 1, to simulate cell wall remodeling in rod-shaped bacteria during growth. Here, we used this software as the basis for an expanded simulation system, REMODELER 2, which we used to explore different mechanistic models of cell wall division. We found that simply organizing the cell wall synthesis complexes at the midcell was not sufficient to cause wall invagination, even with the implementation of a make-before-break mechanism. Applying a constrictive force at the midcell could drive division if the force was sufficiently large to initially constrict the midcell into a compressed state before new hoops of relaxed cell wall were incorporated between existing hoops. Adding a make-before-break mechanism could drive division with a smaller constrictive force sufficient to bring the midcell peptidoglycan into a relaxed, but not necessarily compressed, state.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional organization of the genome plays an important role in gene regulation by enabling distal sequence elements to control the expression level of genes hundreds of kilobases away. Hi-C is a powerful genome-wide technique to measure the contact count of pairs of genomic loci needed to study three-dimensional organization. Due to experimental costs high resolution Hi-C datasets are available only for a handful of cell lines. Computational prediction of Hi-C contact counts can offer a scalable and inexpensive approach to examine three-dimensional genome organization across many cellular contexts. Here we present HiC-Reg, a novel approach to predict contact counts from one-dimensional regulatory signals such as epigenetic marks and regulatory protein binding. HiC-Reg exploits the signal from the region spanning two interacting regions and from across multiple cell lines to generalize to new contexts. Using existing feature importance measures and a new matrix factorization based approach, we found CTCF and chromatin marks, especially repressive and elongation marks, as important for predictive performance. Predicted counts from HiC-Reg identify topologically associated domains as well as significant interactions that are enriched for CTCF bi-directional motifs and agree well with interactions identified from complementary long-range interaction assays. Taken together, HiC-Reg provides a powerful framework to generate high-resolution profiles of contact counts that can be used to study individual locus level interactions as well as higher-order organizational units of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication is an important evolutionary process in plants. In contrast to other speciation mechanisms, polyploid species begin with substantial postzygotic reproductive isolation from progenitors while being sympatric with one or both. These nascent polyploid species often go extinct due to ecological and evolutionary genetic obstacles. Interestingly, polyploid species appear to quickly occupy different geographic distributions and ecological niches than their diploid progenitors. Using biogeographic data from polyploid and diploid species representing 49 genera of vascular plants, we tested whether climatic niches of polyploid species evolve faster than their diploid relatives. We found polyploid species often have less climatic overlap than expected with diploid progenitors. Consistent with this pattern, we estimated that the climatic niches of polyploid plants consistently evolved faster than the niches of diploid relatives. Our results indicate ecological niche differentiation is important for polyploid establishment, and suggest ecological differentiation is important for speciation processes more widely.\\n\\nStatement of AuthorshipAB and MS conceived of project, AB and NA generated the dataset, AB and HM performed analyses, AB and MS cowrote manuscript.\\n\\nData Accessibility StatementUpon acceptance all necessary R scripts, data, and files supporting the results will be archived on FigShare with the data DOI included at the end of the article.",

    "abstract": "Chilean Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations were established with individuals of both European and North American origins. These populations are expected to be highly genetically differentiated due to evolutionary history and poor gene flow between ancestral populations from different continents. The extent and decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) impacts the implementation of genome-wide association studies and genomic selection and provides relevant information about demographic processes of fish populations. We assessed the population structure and characterized the extent and decay of LD in three Chilean commercial populations of Atlantic salmon with North American (NAM), Scottish (SCO) and Norwegian (NOR) origin. A total of 151 animals were genotyped using a 159K SNP Axiom(R) myDesign Genotyping Array. A total of 40K, 113K and 136 K SNP markers were used for NAM, SCO and NOR populations, respectively. The principal component analysis explained 86.7% of the genetic diversity between populations, clearly discriminating between populations of North American and European origin, and also between European populations. Admixture analysis showed that the Scottish and North American populations likely come from one ancestral population, while the Norwegian population probably originated from more than one. NAM had the lowest effective size, followed by SCO and NOR. Large differences in the LD decay were observed between populations of North American and European origin. A r2 threshold of 0.2 was estimated for marker pairs separated by 8,000 Kb, 42 and 64 Kb in the NAM, NOR and SCO populations, respectively. In this study we show that this SNP panel can be used to detect association between markers and traits of interests and also to capture high-resolution information for genome-enabled predictions. Also, we suggest the feasibility to achieve higher prediction accuracies by using a small SNP data set as was used with the NAM population.",
