    "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a complementary approach for Mendelian disease diagnosis for patients in whom exome-sequencing is not informative. For both rare neuromuscular and mitochondrial disorders, its application has improved diagnostic rates. However, the generalizability of this approach to diverse Mendelian diseases has yet to be evaluated. We sequenced whole blood RNA from 56 cases with undiagnosed rare diseases spanning 11 diverse disease categories to evaluate the general application of RNA-seq to Mendelian disease diagnosis. We developed a robust approach to compare rare disease cases to existing large sets of RNA-seq controls (N=1,594 external and N=31 family-based controls) and demonstrated the substantial impacts of gene and variant filtering strategies on disease gene identification when combined with RNA-seq. Across our cohort, we observed that RNA-seq yields a 8.5% diagnostic rate. These diagnoses included diseases where blood would not intuitively reflect evidence of disease. We identified RARS2 as an under-expression outlier containing compound heterozygous pathogenic variants for an individual exhibiting profound global developmental delay, seizures, microcephaly, hypotonia, and progressive scoliosis. We also identified a new splicing junction in KCTD7 for an individual with global developmental delay, loss of milestones, tremors and seizures. Our study provides a broad evaluation of blood RNA-seq for the diagnosis of rare disease.",

    "abstract": "Most research laboratories abide by guidelines and mandates set by their research institution regarding the administration of analgesics to control pain during the postoperative period. Unfortunately, measuring pain originating from the head is difficult, making adequate decisions regarding pain control following stereotaxic surgery problematic. In addition, most postsurgical analgesia protocols require multiple injections over several days, which may cause stress and distress during a critical recovery period. Here we sought to 1) assess the degree of postoperative pain following craniotomy in mice, 2) compare the efficacy of three common rodent analgesics (carprofen, meloxicam and buprenorphine) for reducing this pain and 3) determine whether the route of administration (injected or self-administered through the water supply) influenced pain relief post-craniotomy. Using the mouse grimace scale (MGS), we found that injectable analgesics were significantly more effective at relieving post-craniotomy pain, however, both routes of administration decreased pain scores in the first 24 h post-surgery. Specifically, buprenorphine administered independently of administration route was the most effective at reducing MGS scores, however, female mice showed greater sensitivity to carprofen when administered through the water supply. Although it is necessary to provide laboratory animals with analgesics after an invasive procedure, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the degree of craniotomy-related pain in rodents and the efficacy of alternative routes of administration. Our study highlights the limitations of administering drugs through the water supply, even at doses that are considered to be higher than those currently recommended by most research institutions for treating pain of mild to moderate severity.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that expectations influence how we perceive the world. Yet the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Studies about the effects of prior expectations have focused so far on artificial contingencies between simple neutral cues and events. Real-world expectations are however often generated from complex associations between contexts and objects learned over a lifetime. Additionally, these expectations may contain some affective value and recent proposals present conflicting hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying affect in predictions. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate how object processing is influenced by realistic context-based expectations, and how affect impacts these expectations. First, we show that the precuneus, the inferotemporal cortex and the frontal cortex are more active during object recognition when expectations have been elicited a priori, irrespectively of their validity or their affective intensity. This result supports previous hypotheses according to which these brain areas integrate contextual expectations with object sensory information. Notably, these brain areas are different from those responsible for simultaneous context-object interactions, dissociating the two processes. Then, we show that early visual areas, on the contrary, are more active during object recognition when no prior expectation has been elicited by a context. Lastly, BOLD activity was shown to be enhanced in early visual areas when objects are less expected, but only when contexts are neutral; the reverse effect is observed when contexts are affective. This result supports the proposal that affect modulates the weighting of sensory information during predictions. Together, our results help elucidate the neural mechanisms of real-world expectations.",

    "abstract": "The precise regulation of synaptic integrity is critical for neuronal network connectivity and proper brain function. Essential aspects of the activity and localization of synaptic proteins are regulated by posttranslational modifications. S-palmitoylation is a reversible covalent modification of the cysteine with palmitate. It modulates affinity of the protein for cell membranes and membranous compartments. Intracellular palmitoylation dynamics are regulated by other posttranslational modifications, such as S-nitrosylation. Still unclear, however, are the ways in which this crosstalk is affected in brain pathology, such as stress-related disorders. Using a newly developed mass spectrometry-based approach (Palmitoylation And Nitrosylation Interplay Monitoring), we analyzed the endogenous S-palmitoylation and S-nitrosylation of postsynaptic density proteins at the level of specific single cysteines in a mouse model of chronic stress. Our results suggest that atypical mechanism of crosstalk between the S-palmitoylation and S-nitrosylation of synaptic proteins might be one of the major events associated with chronic stress disorders.",

Of 581 p53 SNPs, 420 SNPs are found to be missense or non-synonymous and 435 SNPs are in the 3 prime UTR and 112 SNPs are of every 5 prime UTR from which 16 non synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) as non-tolerable while PredictSNP package predicted 14 (taking consideration SNP colored green by two or more than 2 analyses is neutral). By concentrating on six bioinformatics tools of various dimensions a combined output is generated where 14 nsSNPs are prone to exert a deleterious effect. By using diverse SNP analysing tools we have found 5 missense SNPs in the 3 crucial amino acids position in the DNA binding domain. The underlying discoveries are fortified by I-Mutant and Project HOPE. The ExPASy-PROSITE tools characterized whether the mutations located in the functional part of the protein or not. This study provides a decisive outcome concluding the accessible SNPs information by recognizing the five harming nsSNPs: rs28934573 (S241F), rs11540652 (R248Q), rs121913342 (R248W), rs121913343 (R273C) and rs28934576 (R273H).

    "abstract": "Complex traits are known to be influenced by a combination of environmental factors and rare and common genetic variants. However, detection of such multivariate associations can be compromised by low statistical power and confounding by population structure. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) can account for correlations due to relatedness but have not been applicable in high-dimensional (HD) settings where the number of fixed effect predictors greatly exceeds the number of samples. False positives or false negatives can result from two-stage approaches, where the residuals estimated from a null model adjusted for the subjects relationship structure are sub-sequently used as the response in a standard penalized regression model. To overcome these challenges, we develop a general penalized LMM with a single random effect called ggmix for simultaneous SNP selection and adjustment for population structure in high dimensional prediction models. We develop a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection which is highly scalable, computationally efficient and has theoretical guarantees of convergence. Through simulations and three real data examples, we show that ggmix leads to more parsimonious models compared to the two-stage approach or principal component adjustment with better prediction accuracy. Our method performs well even in the presence of highly correlated markers, and when the causal SNPs are included in the kinship matrix. ggmix can be used to construct polygenic risk scores and select instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization studies. Our algorithms are available in an R package (https://github.com/greenwoodlab/ggmix).\n\n1 Author SummaryThis work addresses a recurring challenge in the analysis and interpretation of genetic association studies: which genetic variants can best predict and are independently associated with a given phenotype in the presence of population structure ? Not controlling confounding due to geographic population structure, family and/or cryptic relatedness can lead to spurious associations. Much of the existing research has therefore focused on modeling the association between a phenotype and a single genetic variant in a linear mixed model with a random effect. However, this univariate approach may miss true associations due to the stringent significance thresholds required to reduce the number of false positives and also ignores the correlations between markers. We propose an alternative method for fitting high-dimensional multivariable models, which selects SNPs that are independently associated with the phenotype while also accounting for population structure. We provide an efficient implementation of our algorithm and show through simulation studies and real data examples that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and controlling the false discovery rate.",

    "abstract": "In response to biotic stress, plants reshape their complement of lipids to produce suites of highly modified fatty acids that bear unusual chemical functionality. Despite their chemical complexity, proposed roles in pathogen defense and presence in crop plants, little is known about the biosynthesis of these decorated fatty acids. Falcarindiol is a prototypical member of a suite of acetylenic lipids from carrot, tomato, and celery that inhibits growth of several fungal strains and human cancer cell lines. Here we report a set of clustered genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that are required for the production of falcarindiol in leaves in response to treatment with an adapted fungal pathogen, Cladosporium fulvum. Our approach is based on correlation of untargeted transcriptomic and metabolomic data sets in order to rapidly identify a candidate biosynthetic pathway. By reconstituting the initial biosynthetic steps in a heterologous host (Nicotiana benthamiana) and generating stable transgenic pathway mutants in tomato, we demonstrate a direct role for three genes in the cluster in falcarindiol biosynthesis. This work reveals a mechanism by which plants sculpt their lipid pool in response to pathogens, and provides critical insight into the biochemistry of alkynyl lipid production.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA biosynthetic gene cluster for the production of falcarindiol, a highly modified antifungal oxylipin found in edible plants.",

    "abstract": "RNA-sequencing is most commonly used to measure gene expression, but it is possible to extract genotypic information from RNA-sequencing data, too. Point mutations and translocations can be detected when they occur in expressed genes, however, there are few software solutions to infer copy number information from RNA-sequencing data. This is because a genes expression is dictated by a number of variables, including, but not limited to, copy number variation. Here, we report new functionalities within the software package CNVkit that enable copy number inference from RNA-sequencing data. First, CNVkit removes technical variation in gene expression associated with GC-content and transcript length. Next, CNVkit assigns a weight, dictated by several variables, to each transcript with the net effect of preferentially inferring copy number from highly and stably expressed genes. We benchmarked our approach on 105 melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas project and observed a high degree of concordance (R = 0.739) between our estimates and those from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on the same samples. After initial configuration, the software requires few inputs, is able to process a batch of up to 100 samples in less than ten minutes, and can be used in conjunction with pre-existing features of CNVkit, including visualization tools. Overall, we present a rapid, user-friendly software solution to infer copy number information from gene expression data.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) monitored by mass spectrometry (MS) is a promising technique for rapidly fingerprinting structural and dynamical properties of proteins. The time dependent change in mass of any fragment of the polypeptide chain depends uniquely on the rate of exchange of its amide hydrogens but determining the latter from the former is generally not possible. Here we show that, if time-resolved measurements are available for a number of overlapping peptides that cover the whole sequence, rate constants for each amide hydrogen exchange (or equivalently, their protection factors) can be predicted. In most cases, the solution may not be unique, so a number of solutions have to be considered. Such analysis always provides meaningful constraints on protection factors and thus can be used in situations where obtaining more refined data is impractical, e.g., high throughput structure and interaction fingerprinting. It also provides a systematic way to improve data collection strategies in order to obtain unambiguous information at single residue level, e.g. for assessing protein structure predictions at atomistic level.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical cues into biochemical signals, is crucial for many biological processes in plants and animals1,2. In mammals, some mechanosensory processes such as touch sensation and vascular development are mediated by the PIEZO family of mechanically activated (MA) ion channels3-5. In plants, the impact of gravity or soil properties on root development, wind on stem growth, and turgor pressure on plant-cell size and shape are proposed to involve activation of MA ion channels6,7. Homologues of the bacterial MA channel MscS (MSLs) exist in plants, and MSL8 is shown to be involved in pollen hydration8; however, the identity of the MA channels required for most mechanotransduction processes in plants have remained elusive9. Here, we identify various members of the 15 OSCA proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana (previously reported as hyperosmolarity sensors10,11) as MA ion channels. Purification and reconstitution of OSCA1.2 in liposomes induced stretch-activated currents, suggesting that OSCAs are inherently mechanosensitive, pore-forming ion channels. This conclusion is confirmed by a high-resolution electron microscopy structure of OSCA1.2 described in a companion paper12. Beyond plants, we present evidence that fruit fly, mouse, and human TMEM63 family of proteins, homologues of OSCAs, induce MA currents when expressed in naive cells. Our results suggest that OSCA/TMEM63 proteins are the largest family of MA ion channels identified, and are conserved across eukaryotes. We anticipate that further characterization of OSCA isoforms which have diverse biophysical properties, will help gain substantial insight on the molecular mechanism of MA ion channel gating and permeation. OSCA1.1 mutant plants have impaired leaf and root growth under stress, potentially linking this ion channel to a mechanosensory role11. We expect future studies to uncover novel roles of OSCA/TMEM63 channels in mechanosensory processes across plants and animals.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomal enzyme deficiencies comprise a large group of genetic disorders that generally lack effective treatments. A potential treatment approach is to engineer the patients own hematopoietic system to express high levels of the deficient enzyme, thereby correcting the biochemical defect and halting disease progression. Here, we present an efficient ex vivo genome editing approach using CRISPR/Cas9 that targets the lysosomal enzyme iduronidase to the CCR5 safe harbor locus in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The modified cells secrete supra-endogenous enzyme levels, maintain long-term repopulation and multi-lineage differentiation potential, and can correct biochemical and phenotypic abnormalities in an immunocompromised mouse model of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Our studies provide support for the development of human, genome-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for the treatment of a multi-systemic lysosomal storage disorder. Our safe harbor approach constitutes a flexible platform for the expression of lysosomal enzymes, exemplifying a potential new paradigm for the treatment of these diseases.",
