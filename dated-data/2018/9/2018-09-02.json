    "abstract": "Selection is commonly described by assigning constant relative fitness values to genotypes. Yet population density is often regulated by crowding. Relative fitness may then depend on density, and selection can change density when it acts on a density-regulating trait. When strong density-dependent selection acts on a density-regulating trait, selection is no longer describable by density-independent relative fitnesses, even in demographically stable populations. These conditions are met in most previous models of density-dependent selection (e.g. \\\"K-selection\\\" in the logistic and Lotka-Volterra models), suggesting that density-independent relative fitnesses must be replaced with more ecologically explicit absolute fit-nesses unless selection is weak. Here we show that density-independent relative fitnesses can also accurately describe strong density-dependent selection under some conditions. We develop a novel model of density-regulated population growth with three ecologically intuitive traits: fecundity, mortality, and competitive ability. Our model, unlike the logistic or Lotka-Volterra, incorporates a density-dependent juvenile \\\"reproductive excess\\\", which largely decouples density-dependent selection from the regulation of density. We find that density-independent relative fitnesses accurately describe strong selection acting on any one trait, even fecundity, which is both density-regulating and subject to density-dependent selection. Pleiotropic interactions between these traits recovers the familiar K-selection behavior. In such cases, or when the population is maintained far from demographic equilibrium, our model offers a possible alternative to relative fitness.",

    "abstract": "Given the recent controversies in some neuroimaging statistical methods, we compare the most frequently used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analysis packages: AFNI, FSL and SPM, with regard to temporal autocorrelation modeling. This process, sometimes known as pre-whitening, is conducted in virtually all task fMRI studies. We employ eleven datasets containing 980 scans corresponding to different fMRI protocols and subject populations. Though autocorrelation modeling in AFNI is not perfect, its performance is much higher than the performance of autocorrelation modeling in FSL and SPM. The residual autocorrelated noise in FSL and SPM leads to heavily confounded first level results, particularly for low-frequency experimental designs. Our results show superior performance of SPMs alternative pre-whitening: FAST, over SPMs default. The reliability of task fMRI studies would increase with more accurate autocorrelation modeling. Furthermore, reliability could increase if the packages provided diagnostic plots. This way the investigator would be aware of pre-whitening problems.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe clinical distinction between vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a key step to elaborate a prognosis and formulate an appropriate medical plan for any patient suffering from disorders of consciousness (DoC). However, this assessment is often challenging and may require specialized expertise. In this study, we hypothesized that pooling subjective reports of the level of consciousness of a given patient across several nursing staff members can be used to clinically detect MCS.\\n\\nSetting and ParticipantsPatients referred for consciousness assessment were prospectively screened. MCS (target condition) was defined according to the best Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score (CRS-R) obtained from expert physicians (reference standard). \\\"DoC-feeling\\\" score consisted in the median value of multiple ratings of patients behavior observation pooled from multiple staff members during a week of hospitalisation (index test). Individual ratings were collected at the end of each shift using a 100mm visual analog scale, blinded from the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity metrics.\\n\\nResults692 ratings performed by 83 nursing staff members were collected from 47 patients. Twenty patients were in a UWS and 27 in a MCS. DoC-feeling scores obtained by pooling all individual ratings obtained for a given patient were significantly greater in MCS than in UWS patients (59.2 mm [IQR: 27.3-77.3] vs. 7.2 mm [IQR: 2.4-11.4]; p<0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.92 (95%CI: 0.84-0.99).\\n\\nConclusionsDoC-feeling capitalizes on the expertise of nursing staff to evaluate patients consciousness. Together with the CRS-R as well as with brain imaging, DoC-feeling might improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of DoC patients.\\n\\nStrengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe designed a new behavioural tool called \\\"DoC-feeling\\\" to help face the clinical challenge of the detection of Minimally Conscious State in patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DoC)\\nC_LIO_LI\\\"DoC-feeling score\\\" quantifies nursing staffs subjective perception of patients consciousness by pooling multiple assessments obtained from multiple caregivers (\\\"wisdom of the crowds\\\")\\nC_LIO_LIThis score which requires no particular training showed a very good accuracy when compared to the gold standard (repeated expert clinical assessment using the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R))\\nC_LIO_LIA validation in a separate cohort would help to determine its place in consciousness assessment\\nC_LIO_LIThis score should be tested not only against the CRS-R but also against brain-imaging techniques to test for its capacity to detect covert signs of consciousness\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "It is known that many driver nodes are required to control complex biological networks. Previous studies imply that O(N) driver nodes are required in both linear complex network and Boolean network models with N nodes if an arbitrary state is specified as the target. In this paper, we mathematically prove under a reasonable assumption that the expected number of driver nodes is only O(log2 N + log2 M) for controlling Boolean networks if the targets are restricted to attractors, where M is the number of attractors. Since it is expected that M is not very large in many practical networks, this is a significant improvement. This result is based on discovery of novel relationships between control problems on Boolean networks and the coupon collectors problem, a well-known concept in combinatorics. We also provide lower bounds of the number of driver nodes as well as simulation results using artificial and realistic network data, which support our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Finding the right combination of a fluorescent dye and a mounting medium is crucial for optimal microscopy of fixed samples. It was recently shown that Vectashield, one of the most commonly used mounting media for conventional microscopy, can also be applied to super-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). dSTORM utilizes conventional dyes and starts with samples in a fluorescent ON state. This helps identifying structures of interests. Subsequently, labelled samples are brought to blinking, which is necessary for localization of single molecules and reconstruction of super-resolution images. This is only possible with certain fluorescent dyes and imaging buffers. One of the most widely used dyes for dSTORM, Alexa Fluor (AF) 647, blinks in Vectashield. However, after adding Vectashield to our samples, we noticed that the fluorescence intensity of AF647 and its improved variant, AF647+, is quenched. Since structures of interest cannot be identified in quenched samples, loss of fluorescence intensity hinders imaging of AF647 in Vectashield. This has consequences for both conventional and dSTORM imaging. To overcome this, we provide: 1) a quantitative analysis of AF647 intensity in different imaging media, 2) practical advice on how to use Vectashield for dSTORM imaging of AF647 and AF647+.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular pathogens must egress from the host cell to continue their infectious cycle. Apicomplexans are a phylum of intracellular protozoans that have evolved members of the membrane attack complex and perforin (MACPF) family of pore forming proteins to disrupt cellular membranes for traversing cells during tissue migration or egress from a replicative vacuole following intracellular reproduction. Previous work showed that the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii secretes a perforin-like protein (TgPLP1) that contains a C-terminal Domain (CTD) which is necessary for efficient parasite egress. However, the structural basis for CTD membrane binding and egress competency remained unknown. Here, we present evidence that TgPLP1 CTD prefers binding lipids that are abundant in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Additionally, solving the high-resolution crystal structure of the TgPLP1 APC{beta} domain within the CTD reveals an unusual double-layered {beta}-prism fold that resembles only one other protein of known structure. Three direct repeat sequences comprise subdomains, with each constituting a wall of the {beta}-prism fold. One subdomain features a protruding hydrophobic loop with an exposed tryptophan at its tip. Spectrophotometric measurements of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence are consistent with insertion of the hydrophobic loop into a target membrane. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing we show that parasite strains bearing mutations in the hydrophobic loop, including alanine substitution of the tip tryptophan, are equally deficient in egress as a strain lacking TgPLP1 altogether. Taken together our findings suggest a crucial role for the hydrophobic loop in anchoring TgPLP1 to the membrane to support its cytolytic activity and egress function.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryToxoplasma gondii has a complex life cycle that involves active invasion of the host cell, the formation of a replicative compartment, and egress from the replicative niche. T. gondii encodes a pore-forming protein, TgPLP1, that contains a C-terminal domain that is crucial for efficient exit from both the parasite containing vacuole and the host cell. However, the mechanism by which TgPLP1 recognizes and binds to the appropriate membrane is unclear. Here we use a combination of biochemistry, structural biology, and parasitology to identify the a preference of TgPLP1 for specific lipids and show that a loop within the structure of the C-terminal domain inserts into the membrane and is necessary for egress from the parasite containing vacuole. Our study sheds light into the determinants of membrane binding in TgPLP1 which may inform the overall mechanism of pore formation in similar systems",

    "abstract": "Selective autophagy has emerged as an important mechanism by which eukaryotic cells control the abundance of specific proteins. This mechanism relies on cargo recruitment to autophagosomes by receptors that bind to both the ubiquitin-like AUTOPHAGY8 (ATG8) protein through ATG8 interacting motifs (AIMs) and to the cargo to be degraded. In plants, two autophagy cargo receptors, ATG8 Interacting Protein 1 (ATI1) and 2 (ATI2), were identified early on, but their molecular properties remain poorly understood. Here, we show that ATI1 and ATI2 are transmembrane proteins with long N-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The N-terminal IDRs contain the functional AIMs, and we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to directly observe the disorder-order transition of the AIM upon ATG8 binding. Our analyses also show that the IDRs of ATI1 and ATI2 are not equivalent, because ATI2 has properties of a fully disordered polypeptide, while ATI1 has properties consistent with a collapsed pre-molten globule-like conformation Interestingly, wild type ATI1 and ATI2 exist as distinct post-translationally modified forms. Specifically, different forms are detectable upon mutation of the AIM, suggesting that interaction of ATI1 and ATI2 to ATG8 is coupled to a change in their post-translational modification.",

    "abstract": "From invertebrates to humans, a defining feature of sleep is behavioral immobility(Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Hendricks et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2000). In mammals, diminished electromyographic (EMG) activity is a major criterion for both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. However, the relationship between sleep and motor control at the neuronal level remains poorly understood. Here we show that regions of the basal ganglia long known to be essential for motor suppression also play a key role in sleep generation. Optogenetic or chemogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) strongly increased both REM and NREM sleep, whereas their inactivation suppressed sleep and increased wakefulness. Analysis of natural home-cage behavior showed that mice transition sequentially through several behavioral states: locomotion, non-locomotor movement, quiet wakefulness, and sleep. Activation/inactivation of SNr neurons promoted/suppressed sleep by biasing the direction of progression through the natural behavioral sequence. Virus-mediated circuit tracing showed that SNr GABAergic neurons project to multiple wake-promoting monoaminergic cell groups in addition to the thalamus and mesencephalic locomotor region, and activating each projection promoted sleep. Within the thalamus, direct optogenetic inactivation of glutamatergic neurons is sufficient to enhance sleep, but the effect is largely restricted to the regions receiving SNr projection. Furthermore, a major source of excitatory inputs to the SNr is the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and activation of neurotensin-expressing glutamatergic neurons in the STN also promoted sleep. Together, these results demonstrate a key role of the STN-SNr basal ganglia pathway in sleep generation and reveal a novel circuit mechanism linking sleep and motor control.",
