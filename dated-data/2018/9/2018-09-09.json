    "abstract": "We present a simple model for coherent, spatially correlated chaos in a recurrent neural network. Networks of randomly connected neurons exhibit chaotic fluctuations and have been studied as a model for capturing the temporal variability of cortical activity. The dynamics generated by such networks, however, are spatially uncorrelated and do not generate coherent fluctuations, which are commonly observed across spatial scales of the neocortex. In our model we introduce a structured component of connectivity, in addition to random connections, which effectively embeds a feedforward structure via unidirectional coupling between a pair of orthogonal modes. Local fluctuations driven by the random connectivity are summed by an output mode and drive coherent activity along an input mode. The orthogonality between input and output mode preserves chaotic fluctuations even as coherence develops. In the regime of weak structured connectivity we apply a perturbative approach to solve the dynamic mean-field equations, showing that in this regime coherent fluctuations are driven passively by the chaos of local residual fluctuations. Strikingly, the chaotic dynamics are not subdued even by very strong structured connectivity if we add a row balance constraint on the random connectivity. In this regime the system displays longer time-scales and switching-like activity reminiscent of \\\"Up-Down\\\" states observed in cortical circuits. The level of coherence grows with increasing strength of structured connectivity until the dynamics are almost entirely constrained to a single spatial mode. We describe how in this regime the model achieves intermittent self-tuned criticality in which the coherent component of the dynamics self-adjusts to yield periods of slow chaos. Furthermore, we show how the dynamics depend qualitatively on the particular realization of the connectivity matrix: a complex leading eigenvalue can yield coherent oscillatory chaos while a real leading eigenvalue can yield chaos with broken symmetry. We examine the effects of network-size scaling and show that these results are not finite-size effects. Finally, we show that in the regime of weak structured connectivity, coherent chaos emerges also for a generalized structured connectivity with multiple input-output modes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeural activity observed in the neocortex is temporally variable, displaying irregular temporal fluctuations at every accessible level of measurement. Furthermore, these temporal fluctuations are often found to be spatially correlated whether at the scale of local measurements such as membrane potentials and spikes, or global measurements such as EEG and fMRI. A thriving field of study has developed models of recurrent networks which intrinsically generate irregular temporal variability, the paradigmatic example being networks of randomly connected rate neurons which exhibit chaotic dynamics. These models have been examined analytically and numerically in great detail, yet until now the intrinsic variability generated by these networks have been spatially uncorrelated, yielding no large-scale coherent fluctuations. Here we present a simple model of a recurrent network of firing-rate neurons that intrinsically generates spatially correlated activity yielding coherent fluctuations across the entire network. The model incorporates random connections and adds a structured component of connectivity that sums network activity over a spatial \\\"output\\\" mode and projects it back to the network along an orthogonal \\\"input\\\" mode. We show that this form of structured connectivity is a general mechanism for producing coherent chaos.",

    "abstract": "The patterns and mechanisms of collective decision making in humans and animals have attracted both empirical and theoretical attention. Of particular interest has been the variety of social feedback rules, and the extent to which these behavioural rules can be explained and predicted from theories of rational estimation and decision making. However, models that aim to model the full range of social information use have incorporated ad hoc departures from rational decision-making theory to explain the apparent stochasticity and variability of behaviour. In this paper I develop a model of social information use and collective decision making by fully rational agents that reveals how a wide range of apparently stochastic social decision rules emerge from fundamental information asymmetries both between individuals, and between the decision-makers and the observer of those decisions. As well as showing that rational decision making is consistent with empirical observations of collective behaviour, this model makes several testable predictions about how individuals make decisions in groups, and offers a valuable perspective on how we view sources of variability in animal, and human, behaviour.",

Sixteen swimmers from the Brazilian synchronized swimming team (2014) were divided into two groups GAP (Group High Power) (n = 9), with NP, LP, and FI (p<0.05) compared to GBP (Group Low Power) (n=7). Both groups performed a four-minute routine at competitive intensity.

Students t-test was used to analyze the intergroup differences of NP, LP, FI, maximum and lactic HR, and two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni was used to analyze HR and BL at 1, 3 and 5 minutes after activity with a significance of 5%. The FI of the GBP group was lower than that of the GAP group (P <0.05). The NP of the GBP group was higher than that of the GAP group (P <0.05). The maximum HR of the GBP group was equal to that of the GAP group (P> 0.05). The GBP group had better HR recovery than did the GAP group (P <0.05). BL had its lowest levels after 1 and 5 minutes of recovery in the GBP group when compared to the GAP group (P <0.05). The GBP groups FI was significantly lower than that of the GAP group, while NP was higher, and CR was better in the GBP group, indicating a relationship between a lower FI and higher NP and LP with CR and suggesting that muscular adaptations have an important influence on CR and BL removal.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex underlies our complex cognitive capabilities, yet we know little about the specific genetic loci influencing human cortical structure. To identify genetic variants, including structural variants, impacting cortical structure, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of brain MRI data from 51,662 individuals. We analysed the surface area and average thickness of the whole cortex and 34 regions with known functional specialisations. We identified 255 nominally significant loci (P [&le;] 5 x 10-8); 199 survived multiple testing correction (P [&le;] 8.3 x 10-10; 187 surface area; 12 thickness). We found significant enrichment for loci influencing total surface area within regulatory elements active during prenatal cortical development, supporting the radial unit hypothesis. Loci impacting regional surface area cluster near genes in Wnt signalling pathways, known to influence progenitor expansion and areal identity. Variation in cortical structure is genetically correlated with cognitive function, Parkinsons disease, insomnia, depression and ADHD.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCommon genetic variation is associated with inter-individual variation in the structure of the human cortex, both globally and within specific regions, and is shared with genetic risk factors for some neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are widely used for biomarkers and dose individualization in transcranial stimulation. The large variability of MEPs requires sophisticated methods of analysis to extract information fast and correctly. However, models of MEPs that represent their characteristic features are lacking. This work presents a statistical model that can simulate long sequences of individualized MEP amplitude data with properties matching experimental observations. The MEP model includes three sources of trial-to-trial variability to mimic excitability fluctuations, variability in the neural and muscular pathways, and physiological and measurement noise. It also generates virtual human subject data from statistics of population variability. All parameters are extracted as statistical distributions from experimental data from the literature. The model exhibits previously described features, such as stimulusintensity-dependent MEP amplitude distributions, including bimodal ones. The model can generate long sequences of test data for individual subjects with specified parameters or for subjects from a virtual population. The presented MEP model is the most detailed to date and can be used for the development and implementation of dosing and biomarker estimation algorithms for transcranial stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The molecular and cellular basis of novelty is a major open question in evolutionary biology. Until very recently, the vast majority of cellular phenomena were so difficult to sample that cross-species studies of biochemistry were rare and comparative analysis at the level of biochemical systems was almost impossible. Recent advances in systems biology are changing what is possible, however, and comparative phylogenetic methods that can handle this new data are wanted. Here, we introduce the term \\\"phylogenetic latent variable models\\\" (PLVMs, pronounced \\\"plums\\\") for a class of models that has recently been used to infer the evolution of cellular states from systems-level molecular data, and develop a new parameterization and fitting strategy that is useful for comparative inference of biochemical networks. We deploy this new framework to infer the ancestral states and evolutionary dynamics of protein-interaction networks by analyzing >16,000 predominantly metazoan co-fractionation and affinity-purification mass spectrometry experiments. Based on these data, we estimate ancestral interactions across unikonts, broadly recovering protein complexes involved in translation, transcription, proteostasis, transport, and membrane trafficking. Using these results, we predict an ancient core of the Commander complex made up of CCDC22, CCDC93, C16orf62, and DSCR3, with more recent additions of COMMD-containing proteins in tetrapods. We also use simulations to develop model fitting strategies and discuss future model developments.",

    "abstract": "Significant achievements have been made in the fMRI field by pooling statistical results from multiple studies (meta-analysis). More recently, fMRI standardization efforts have focused on enabling the joint analysis of raw fMRI data across studies (mega-analysis), with the hope of achieving more detailed insights. However, it has not been clear if such analyses in the EEG field are possible or equally fruitful. Here we present the results of a large-scale EEG mega-analysis using 18 studies from six sites representing several different experimental paradigms. We demonstrate that when meta-data are consistent across studies, both channel-level and source-level EEG mega-analysis are possible and can provide insights unavailable in single studies. The analysis uses a fully-automated processing pipeline to reduce line noise, interpolate noisy channels, perform robust referencing, remove eye-activity, and further identify outlier signals. We define several robust measures based on channel amplitude and dispersion to assess the comparability of data across studies and observe the effect of various processing steps on these measures. Using ICA-based dipolar sources, we also observe consistent differences in overall frequency baseline amplitudes across brain areas. For example, we observe higher alpha in posterior vs anterior regions and higher beta in temporal regions. We also detect consistent differences in the slope of the aperiodic portion of the EEG spectrum across brain areas. In a companion paper, we apply mega-analysis to assess commonalities in event-related EEG features across studies. The continuous raw and preprocessed data used in this analysis are available through the DataCatalog at https://cancta.net.",

Anticipating epidemic size ahead of season can contribute to preparedness and more targetted control and prevention of seasonal influenza.\\n\\nMethodsA recently developed process-based epidemiological model that incorporates evolutionary change of the virus and generates incidence forecasts for the H3N2 subtype ahead of the season, was previously validated by several statistical criteria, including an accurate real-time prediction for the 2016-2017 influenza season. With this model, a new forecast is generated here for the upcoming 2018-2019 season. The accuracy of predictions published for the 2017-2018 season is also retrospectively evaluated.\\n\\nResultsFor 2017-2018, the model correctly predicted the dominance of the H3N2 subtype and its higher than average incidence. Based on surveillance and sequence data up to June 2018, the new forecast for the upcoming 2018-2019 season indicates low levels for H3N2, and suggests an H1N1 dominant season with low incidence of influenza B.\\n\\nDiscussionReal-time forecasts, those generated with a model that was parameterized based on data preceding the predicted season, allows valuable evaluation of the approach. Anticipating the dominant subtype and the size of the upcoming epidemic ahead of season informs disease control.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite established clinical associations among major depression (MD), alcohol dependence (AD), and alcohol consumption (AC), the nature of the causal relationship between them is not completely understood.\\n\\nMethodsThis study was conducted using genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (MD: 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls; AD: 10,206 cases and 28,480 controls) and UK Biobank (AC-Frequency: from \\\"daily or almost daily\\\" to \\\"never\\\", 438,308 individuals; AC-Quantity: total units of alcohol per week, 307,098 individuals). Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses were applied to investigate shared genetic mechanisms (horizontal pleiotropy) and causal relationships (mediated pleiotropy) among these traits.\\n\\nOutcomesPositive genetic correlation was observed between MD and AD (rgMD-AD=+0.47, P=6.6x10-10). AC-Quantity showed positive genetic correlation with both AD (rgAD-AC-Quantity=+0.75, P=1.8x10-14) and MD (rgMD-AC-Quantity=+0.14, P=2.9x10-7), while there was negative correlation of AC-Frequency with MD (rgMD-AC-Frequency=-0.17, P=1.5x10-10) and a non-significant result with AD. MR analyses confirmed the presence of pleiotropy among these traits. However, the MD-AD results reflect a mediated-pleiotropy mechanism (i.e., causal relationship) with a causal role of MD on AD (beta=0.28, P=1.29x10-6) that does not appear to be biased by confounding such as horizontal pleiotropy. No evidence of reverse causation was observed as the AD genetic instrument did not show a causal effect on MD.\\n\\nInterpretationResults support a causal role for MD on AD based on genetic datasets including thousands of individuals.

We used the search terms \\\"alcohol\\\" AND \\\"depression\\\" AND \\\"Mendelian Randomization\\\". No restrictions were applied to language, date, or article type. Ten articles were retrieved, but only two were focused on alcohol consumption and depression-related traits. The studies were based on genetic variants in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes only, did not find evidence for a causal effect of alcohol consumption on depression phenotypes, with one study finding a causal effect of alcohol consumption on alcoholism. Both studies noted that future studies are needed with increased sample sizes and clinically derived phenotypes. To our knowledge, no previous study has applied two-sample Mendelian randomization to investigate causal relationships between alcohol dependence and major depression.\\n\\nTwin studies show genetic factors influence susceptibility to MD, AD, and alcohol consumption. Differently from observational approaches where several studies have investigated the relationship between alcohol-and depression-related phenotypes, very limited use of molecular genetic data has been applied to investigate this issue. Additionally, the use of genetic information has been shown to be less biased by confounders and reverse causation than observation data. However, genetic approaches, like Mendelian randomization, require large sample sizes to be informative.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyIn this study, we used genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium and UK Biobank, which include information regarding hundred thousands of individuals, to test the presence of shared genetic mechanisms and causal relationships among major depression, alcohol dependence, and alcohol consumption. The results support a causal influence of MD on AD, while alcohol consumption showed shared genetic mechanisms with respect to both major depression and alcohol dependence.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceGiven the significant morbidity and mortality associated with MD, AD, and the comorbid condition, understanding mechanisms underlying these associations not only address important public health concerns but also has the potential to facilitate prevention and intervention efforts.",

    "abstract": "The protein titin plays a key role in vertebrate muscle where it acts like a giant molecular spring. Despite its importance and conservation over vertebrate evolution, a lack of high quality annotations in non-model species makes comparative evolutionary studies of titin challenging. The PEVK region of titin--named for its high proportion of Pro-Glu-Val-Lys amino acids--is particularly difficult to annotate due to its abundance of alternatively spliced isoforms and short, highly repetitive exons. To understand PEVK evolution across mammals, we first developed a bioinformatics tool, PEVK_Finder, to annotate PEVK exons from genomic sequences of titin and then applied it to a diverse set of mammals. PEVK_Finder consistently outperforms standard annotation tools across a broad range of conditions and improves annotations of the PEVK region in non-model mammalian species. We find that the PEVK region can be divided into two subregions (PEVK-N, PEVK-C) with distinct patterns of evolutionary constraint and divergence. The bipartite nature of the PEVK region has implications for titin diversification. In the PEVK-N region, certain exons are conserved and may be essential, but natural selection also acts on particular codons. This region is also rich in glutamate and may contribute to actin binding. In the PEVK-C, exons are more homogenous and length variation of the PEVK region may provide the raw material for evolutionary adaptation in titin function. Taken together, we find that the very complexity that makes titin a challenge for annotation tools may also promote evolutionary adaptation.",

    "abstract": "An outstanding issue in our understanding of human brain development is whether sensitive periods exist for higher-order processes (e.g., emotion regulation) that depend on the prefrontal cortex. Evidence from rodent models suggests that there is a sensitive period before puberty when acoustic stimuli, like music, shape medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) responses that regulate affect in the context of acute stress in adulthood. The present study examined whether a homologous sensitive period for the mPFC occurs during human childhood. In the context of acute stress, adult behavioral preferences were observed only for music experienced during childhood, not preschool or adolescent periods. Childhood music increased mPFC activation and modulated connectivity with the amygdala, which was associated with enhanced emotion regulation and lowered autonomic arousal. Moreover, the timing of this sensitive period could be moved by early-life stress. These findings indicate that childhood is a sensitive period for mPFC encoding of regulatory stimuli.\\n\\nSensitive periods are developmental moments of heightened neuroplasticity when experiences shape brain function and behavior with lasting effects (1). They are fundamental to human cortical ontogeny, and yet, the timing and nature of sensitive periods for human prefrontal cortex functions remain unknown (2-8). In the rodent, Yang and colleagues have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) exhibits a sensitive period during the prepubertal juvenile period, with heightened responsivity to complex auditory stimuli (i.e., music) (9). Specifically, initial exposure to music during the open (juvenile) sensitive period or a pharmacologically re-opened sensitive period in adulthood was followed by that music uniquely producing a behavioral preference in adulthood, increasing mPFC activity, and reducing anxiety-like behavior. This finding and others converging on the same prepubertal period of plasticity in the rodent (9, 10) may have important implications for human development; the complementary prepubertal period in humans (i.e., school-age childhood) also exhibits developmentally-unique mPFC circuitry phenotypes (11-17) that make childhood a strong candidate for a human mPFC sensitive period. Here, we used Billboard music chart data to identify age-specific exposures to pop songs to test whether music shapes human mPFC responses during a childhood sensitive period as in the rodent. To parallel the approach used in the rodent, we examined whether (i) music experienced during childhood uniquely produced a behavioral preference under stress, (ii) childhood music enhanced emotion regulation behaviorally and physiologically, (iii) mPFC activity was enhanced by childhood music, and mPFC circuitry mediated emotion regulation benefits of childhood music, and (iv) whether the timing of this putative sensitive period could be shifted by early adversity.",

A coarse level representation in early lmVTC activity allowed for decoding of visually dissimilar real words, pseudowords, and false fonts. Functional interactions between anterior ventral temporal regions, possibly containing stored knowledge about words, and low-order visual regions occurred after this initial stage of processing and was followed by the individuation of orthographically similar real words in lmVTC, but not similar pseudowords, letter strings, or false fonts. These results suggest that the individuation of real word representations in lmVTC is catalyzed by stored knowledge about word forms that emerges from network-level interactions with anterior regions of the temporal lobe.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection favors organisms that are the most successful in fitness-related behaviors such as foraging. Secondary adaptations pose the problem of re-adapting an already  optimized phenotype to new constraints. When animals forage underwater, they face strong physical constraints, particularly when capturing prey. Successful prey capture requires a predator to be fast and to generate a high acceleration. This involves two main constraints due to the surrounding fluid: drag and added mass. Both constraints are related to the shape of the animal. We experimentally explore the relationship between shape and performance in the context of an aquatic snake strike. As a model, we use two different 3D- printed snake heads representing typical shapes of aquatically-foraging and non-aquatically- foraging snakes, and frontal strike kinematics based on in vivo observations. By using direct force measurements, we compare the drag and added mass faced by the aquatic and non- aquatic snake models during a strike. Our results show that both drag and added mass are optimized in aquatic snakes. Using flow field measurements with particle image velocimetry, we examine the fluid dynamical mechanisms that could be behind the reduction of hydrodynamic constraints observed for the aquatic snake head shape, which makes it well suited to capture prey under water.\\n\\nSummary statementThe present work explores the functional implications of head shape 15 in a group of aquatic predators using a fluid mechanics approach.",

The correlation of measured gene expression changes in unfixed and fixed samples using blocks prepared from a pellet of a single cell type was R2 = 0.97, demonstrating that no significant artifacts were introduced by fixation. Fixed and fresh samples prepared in an equivalent manner produced comparable sequencing depth results (+/-20%), with similar %CV (11.5 and 12.7%, respectively), indicating no significant loss of measurable RNA due to fixation. The sensitivity of the TempO-Seq assay was the same whether the tissue section was fixed or not. The assay performance was equivalent for human, mouse, or rat whole transcriptome. The results from 10 mm2 and 2 mm2 areas of tissue obtained from 5 m thick sections were equivalent, thus demonstrating high sensitivity and ability to profile focal areas of histology within a section. Replicate reproducibility of separate areas of tissue ranged from R2 = 0.83 (lung) to 0.96 (liver) depending on the tissue type, with an average correlation of R2 = 0.90 across nine tissue types. The average %CVs were 16.8% for genes expressed at greater than 200 counts, and 20.3% for genes greater than 50 counts. Tissue specific differences in gene expression were identified and agreed with the literature. There was negligible impact on assay performance using FFPE tissues that had been archived for up to 30 years. Similarly, there was negligible impact of H&E staining, facilitating accurate visualization for scraping and assay of small focal areas of specific histology within a section.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the microbial activity in humans is in the form of biofilms, i.e., an exopolysaccharide-enclosed bacterial mass. Unlike planktonic cells and the cells on the surface of the biofilm, the biofilm-embedded cells are more resistant to the effects of the antibiotics and the host cellular defense mechanisms. A combination of biofilm growth and inherent resistance prevents effective antibiotic treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections including those in patients with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotic resistance has led to an increasing interest in alternative modalities of treatment. Thus, phages that multiply in situ and in the presence of susceptible hosts can be used as natural, self-limiting, and profoundly penetrating antibacterial agents. The objective of this study is to identify active phages against a collection of P. aeruginosa isolates (PCOR strains) including the prototype PAO1 and the isogenic constitutively alginate-producing PDO300 strains. These PCOR strains were tested against six phages (P105, P134, P140, P168, P175B, and P182). The analysis shows 69 % of the PCOR isolates are sensitive and the rest are resistant to all six phages. These phages were then tested for their ability to inhibit biofilm formation using a modified biofilm assay. The analysis demonstrated that the sensitive strains showed increased resistance, but none of the susceptible strains from the initial screening were resistant. Using the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay for biofilm formation, the biofilm eradication ability of the phages was tested. The data showed that a higher volume of phage was required to eradicate preformed biofilms than the amount required to prevent colonization of planktonic cells. This data supports the idea of phage therapy more as a prophylactic treatment.",

We performed a genome-wide association study across 1240 individuals from this cohort to identify genetic variants associated with anti-drug antibody development.\\n\\nFindingsThe Human Leukocyte Antigen allele, HLA-DQA1*05, carried by approximately 40% of Europeans, significantly increased the rate of anti-drug antibody development (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.25; P=5.88x10-13).

We show that PDI-Trans activity is male-specific, surface expressed, essential for fertilization/transmission, and exhibits disulphide isomerase activity which is up-regulated post-gamete activation. We demonstrate that PDI-Trans is a viable anti-malarial drug and vaccine target blocking malarial transmission with the use of the PDI inhibitor bacitracin (98.21%/92.48% reduction in intensity/prevalence), and anti-PDI-Trans peptide antibodies (66.22%/33.16% reduction in intensity/prevalence).

    "abstract": "Brain white matter hyperintensities (WMH), common in older adults, may contribute to cortical disconnection and cognitive dysfunction. The presence of WMH within white matter (WM) tracts indicates underlying microstructural WM changes that may also affect the normal-appearing WM (NAWM) of a tract. We performed an exploratory study using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of 52 healthy participants from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (age 72.2 {+/-} 0.7 years) selected to include a range of WMH burden, to quantify microstructural changes of tracts intersecting WMH. We reconstructed tracts using automated tractography and identified intersections with WMH. Tissue volumes and water diffusion tensor parameters (mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)) were established for tract-WMH and tract-NAWM. MD and FA were also measured for tract-NAWM at 2 mm incremental distances from the tract-WMH edge, and from the edge of nearby, non-intersecting, WMH. We observed microstructural changes in tract-WMH suggestive of tissue damage. Tract-NAWM also showed a spatial gradient of FA and MD abnormalities, which diminished with distance from the tract-WMH. Nearby WMH lesions, not directly crossed by the tract, also affected tract microstructure with a similar pattern. Additionally, both FA and MD changes in tract-NAWM were predicted by FA and MD changes respectively in tract-WMH. FA was also predicted by tract-WMH overlap volume, whereas MD was better predicted by whole-brain WMH load. These results suggest that tract-NAWM microstructure is affected by the pathological process underlying WMH, when WMH are either within or near to the tract. The changes in NAWM tract tissue may indicate future lesion progression and may play an important role in cognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiate translation within mRNA 5 leaders, and have the potential to alter main coding sequence (CDS) translation on transcripts in which they reside. Ribosome profiling (RP) studies suggest that translating ribosomes are pervasive within 5 leaders across model systems. However, the significance of this observation remains unclear. To explore a role for uORF usage in neuronal differentiation, we performed RP on undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. Using a spectral coherence algorithm (SPECtre), we identify 4,954 uORFs across 31% of all neuroblastoma transcripts. These uORFs predominantly utilize non-AUG initiation codons and exhibit translational efficiencies (TE) comparable to annotated coding regions. Usage of both AUG initiated uORFs and a conserved and consistently translated subset of non-AUG initiated uORFs correlates with repressed CDS translation. Ribosomal protein transcripts are enriched in uORFs, and select uORFs on such transcripts were validated for expression. With neuronal differentiation, we observed an overall positive correlation between translational shifts in uORF/CDS pairs. However, a subset of transcripts exhibit inverse shifts in translation of uORF/CDS pairs. These uORFs are enriched in AUG initiation sites, non-overlapping, and shorter in length.\\n\\nCumulatively, CDSs downstream of uORFs characterized by persistent translation show smaller shifts in TE with neuronal differentiation relative to CDSs without a predicted uORF, suggesting that fluctuations in CDS translation are buffered by uORF translation. In sum, this work provides insights into the dynamic relationships and potential regulatory functions of uORF/CDS pairs in a model of neuronal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "GARP and EARP are related heterotetrameric protein complexes that associate with the cytosolic face of the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes, respectively. At these locations, GARP and EARP function to promote the fusion of endosome-derived transport carriers with their corresponding compartments. GARP and EARP share three subunits, VPS51, VPS52 and VPS53, and each has an additional complex-specific subunit, VPS54 or VPS50, respectively. The role of these complexes in human physiology, however, remains poorly understood. By exome sequencing, we have identified compound heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the shared GARP/EARP subunit VPS51 in a six-year-old patient with severe global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, epilepsy, cortical vision impairment, pontocerebellar abnormalities, failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, lower extremity edema and dysmorphic features. The mutation in one allele causes a frameshift that produces a longer but highly unstable protein that is degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, the other mutant allele produces a protein with a single amino-acid substitution that is stable but assembles less efficiently with the other GARP/EARP subunits. Consequently, skin fibroblasts from the patient have reduced levels of fully-assembled GARP and EARP complexes. Likely because of this deficiency, the patients fibroblasts display altered distribution of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which normally sorts acid hydrolases to lysosomes. Furthermore, a fraction of the patients fibroblasts exhibit swelling of lysosomes. These findings thus identify a novel genetic locus for a neurodevelopmental disorder and highlight the critical importance of GARP/EARP function in cellular and organismal physiology.",

    "abstract": "Wnts are secreted proteins that regulate cell fate specification during development of all metazoans. Wnt proteins were proposed to spread over several cell diameters to activate signalling directly at a distance. In the Drosophila wing epithelium, an extracellular gradient of Wingless (Wg, the homolog of Wnt1) was observed extending over several cells away from producing cells. However, it was also recently shown that a membrane-tethered Neurotactin-Wg fusion protein (NRT-Wg) can rescue the loss-of endogenous Wg, leading to proper patterning of the wing. Therefore, whether Wg spreading is required for correct tissue patterning during development remains controversial and the functional range of wild-type Wg is unclear. Here, by capturing secreted Wg on distally located cells we show that the Wg gradient acts directly up to eleven cell distances. Cells located outside the reach of extracellular Wg depend on the Frizzled2 receptor to maintain target gene expression. We find that NRT-Wg is not restricted to the producing cells and propose that it can rescue signalling defects by perdurance in the receiving cells. These results provide insight into the mechanisms by which Wnt proteins mediate patterning of a rapidly growing tissue.",

    "abstract": "The invasive phenotype of metastatic cancer cells is accompanied by the formation of actin-rich invadopodia, which adhere to the extracellular matrix, and degrade it. In this study, we explored the role of the tyrosine kinome in the formation of invadopodia in metastatic melanoma cells. Using a microscopy-based siRNA screen, we identified novel invadopodia regulators, the knock-down of which either suppresses (e.g., TYK2, IGFR1, ERBB3, TYRO3, FES, ALK, PTK7) or enhances invadopodia formation and function (e.g., ABL2, AXL, CSK). Particularly intriguing was the discovery that the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL displays a dual regulatory function, manifested by enhancement of invadopodia function upon knock-down or long-term inhibition, as well as following its over-expression. We show here that this apparent contradiction may be attributed to the capacity of AXL to directly stimulate invadopodia; yet its suppression up-regulates the ERBB3 signaling pathway, which consequently activates core invadopodia regulators, and greatly enhances invadopodia function. Bioinformatic analysis of multiple melanoma cells points to an inverse expression pattern of AXL and ERBB3, with the apparent association of high-AXL melanomas, with high expression of invadopodia components and an invasive phenotype. The relevance of these results to melanoma metastasis in vivo, and to potential anti-invasion therapy, is discussed.",

However, the mechanisms that control modes of LC-NA activity remain unknown. Here, we reveal a local population of GABAergic neurons (LC-GABA) capable of modulating LC-NA activity and arousal. Monosynaptic retrograde virus tracing shows that inputs to LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons arise from similar regions, though a few regions provide differential inputs to one subtype over the other. Recordings in the LC demonstrate two modes of LC-GABA responses whereby spiking is either correlated or broadly anti-correlated with LC-NA responses, reflecting anatomically similar and functionally coincident inputs, or differential and non-coincident inputs, to LC-NA and LC-GABA neurons. Coincident inputs control the gain of phasic LC-NA mediated novelty responses, while non-coincident inputs, such as from the prefrontal cortex to LC, alter overall levels of LC-NA responses without affecting response gain. These findings demonstrate distinct modes by which an inhibitory LC circuit regulates the gain and tone of arousal in the brain.",

In the first case, the FEM algorithm tested is a fast open-source getDP solver running within the SimNIBS 2.1.1 environment.

We present other relevant simulation results such as volumetric mesh generation times for the FEM, time necessary to compute the potential integrals for the BEM-FMM, and solution performance metrics for different hardware/operating system combinations. In the second case, we observe an excellent agreement for electric field distribution across different cranium compartments and, at the same time, a speed improvement of three orders of magnitude when the BEM-FMM algorithm used.\\n\\nThis study may provide a justification for anticipated use of the BEM-FMM algorithm for high-resolution realistic transcranial magnetic stimulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Glycoprotein B (gB) is a conserved viral fusion protein that is required for herpesvirus entry. To mediate fusion with the cellular membrane, gB refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation. We hypothesize that an interaction between the C-terminal arm and the central coiled-coil of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) gB ectodomain is critical for fusion. We previously reported that three mutations in the C-terminal arm (I671A/H681A/F683A, called gB3A) greatly reduced cell-cell fusion and that virus carrying these mutations had a small plaque phenotype and delayed entry into cells. By serially passaging gB3A virus, we selected three revertant viruses with larger plaques. These revertant viruses acquired mutations in gB that restore the fusion function of gB3A, including gB-A683V, gB-S383F/G645R/V705I/A855V, and gB-T509M/N709H. V705I and N709H are novel mutations that map to the portion of domain V that enters domain I in the postfusion structure. S383F, G645R, and T509M are novel mutations that map to an intersection of three domains in a prefusion model of gB. We introduced these second-site mutations individually and in combination into wild-type gB and gB3A to examine the impact of the mutations on fusion and expression. V705I and A855V (a known hyperfusogenic mutation) restored the fusion function of gB3A, whereas S383F and G645R dampened fusion and T509M and N709H worked in concert to restore gB3A fusion. The results identify two regions in the gB ectodomain that modulate the fusion activity of gB, potentially by impacting intramolecular interactions and stability of the prefusion and/or postfusion gB trimer.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEGlycoprotein B (gB) is an essential viral protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses and is required for virus entry. gB is thought to undergo a conformational change that provides the energy to fuse the viral and cellular membranes, however the details of this conformational change and the structure of the prefusion and intermediate conformations of gB are not known. Previously, we demonstrated that mutations in the gB \\\"arm\\\" region inhibit fusion and impart a small plaque phenotype. Using serial passage of a virus carrying these mutations, we identified revertants with restored plaque size. The revertant viruses acquired novel mutations in gB that restored fusion function and mapped to two sites in the gB ectodomain. This work supports our hypothesis that an interaction between the gB arm and the core of gB is critical for gB refolding and provides details about the function of gB in herpesvirus mediated fusion and subsequent virus entry.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori has an impressive ability to persist chronically in the human stomach. Similar characteristics are associated with biofilm formation in other bacteria. The H. pylori biofilm process, however, is poorly understood. To gain insight into this mode of growth, we carried out comparative transcriptomic analysis between H. pylori biofilm and planktonic cells, using the mouse colonizing strain SS1. Optimal biofilm formation was obtained with low serum and three-day growth, conditions which caused both biofilm and planktonic cells to be [~]80% coccoid. RNA-seq analysis found that 8.18% of genes were differentially expressed between biofilm and planktonic cell transcriptomes. Biofilm-downregulated genes included those involved in metabolism and translation, suggesting these cells have low metabolic activity. Biofilm-upregulated genes included those whose products were predicted to be at the cell envelope, involved in regulating a stress response, and surprisingly, genes related to formation of the flagellar apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy visualized flagella that appeared to be a component of the biofilm matrix, supported by the observation that an aflagellated mutant displayed a less robust biofilm with no apparent filaments. We observed flagella in the biofilm matrix of additional H. pylori strains, supporting that flagellar use is widespread. Our data thus supports a model in which H. pylori biofilm involves a multi-gene stress-biased response, and that flagella play an important role in H. pylori biofilm formation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms, communities of bacteria that are embedded in a hydrated matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, pose a substantial health risk and are key contributors to many chronic and recurrent infections. Chronicity and recalcitrant infections are also common features associated with the ulcer-causing human pathogen H. pylori. However, relatively little is known about the role of biofilms in H. pylori pathogenesis as well as the biofilm structure itself and the genes associated with this mode of growth. In the present study, we found that H. pylori biofilm cells highly expressed genes related to cell envelope, stress response and those encoding the flagellar apparatus. Flagellar filaments were seen in high abundance in the biofilm. Flagella are known to play a role in initial biofilm formation, but typically are downregulated after that state. H. pylori instead appears to have co-opted these structures for non-motility roles, including a role building a robust biofilm.",

Previous studies focused on relatively static, enduring features such as gray matter volume and white matter structure. In this report, we investigate prediction of intelligence based on task activation patterns during the N-back working memory task as well as six other tasks in the Human Connectome Project dataset, encompassing 19 task contrasts. We find that whole brain task activation patterns are a highly effective basis for prediction of intelligence, achieving a 0.68 correlation with intelligence scores in an independent sample, which exceeds results reported from other modalities. Additionally, we show that tasks that tap executive processing and that are more cognitively demanding are particularly effective for intelligence prediction. These results suggest a picture analogous to treadmill testing for cardiac function: Placing the brain in an activated task state improves brain-based prediction of intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Brassica napus (AACC, 2n=38), is an important oilseed crop grown worldwide. However, little is known about the population evolution of this species, the genomic difference between its major genetic clusters, such as European and Asian rapeseed, and impacts of historical large-sale introgression events in this young tetraploid. In this study, we reported the de novo assembly of the genome sequences of an Asian rapeseed (B. napus), Ningyou 7 and its four progenitors and carried out de novo assembly-based comparison, pedigree and population analysis with other available genomic data from diverse European and Asian cultivars. Our results showed that Asian rapeseed originally derived from European rapeseed, but it had subsequently significantly diverged, with rapid genome differentiation after intensive local breeding selection. The first historical introgression of B. rapa dramatically broadened the allelic pool of Asian B. napus, but decreased their deleterious variations. The secondary historical introgression of European rapeseed (canola-quality) has reshaped Asian rapeseed into two groups, accompanied by an increase in genetic load. This study demonstrates distinctive genomic footprints by recent intra- and inter-species introgression events for local adaptation, and provide novel insights for understanding the rapid genome evolution of a young allopolyploid crop.",

    "abstract": "Methane oxidizing microorganisms (methanotrophs) are ubiquitous in the environment and represent a major sink for the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Recent studies have demonstrated that methanotrophs are abundant and contribute to CH4 dynamics in caves. However, very little is known about what controls the distribution and abundance of methanotrophs in subterranean ecosystems. Here, we report a survey of soils collected from > 20 caves in North America to elucidate the factors shaping cave methanotroph communities. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we recovered methanotrophs from nearly all (98 %) of the samples, including cave sites where CH4 concentrations were at or below detection limits ([&le;] 0.3 ppmv). We identified a core methanotroph community among caves that was comprised of high-affinity methanotrophs. Although associated with local-scale mineralogy, methanotroph composition did not systematically vary between the entrances and interior of caves, where CH4 concentrations varied. We also observed that methanotrophs are able to disperse readily between cave systems showing these organisms have low barriers to dispersal. Last, the relative abundance of methanotrophs was positively correlated with cave-air CH4 concentrations suggesting that these microorganisms contribute to CH4 flux in subterranean ecosystems.\n\nIMPORTANCERecent observations have shown that the atmospheric greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is consumed by microorganisms (methanotrophs) in caves at rates comparable to CH4 oxidation in surface soils. Caves are abundant in karst landscapes that comprise 14 % of Earths land surface area, and therefore may represent a potentially important, but overlooked CH4 sink. We sampled cave soils to gain a better understand the community composition and structure of cave methanotrophs. Our results show that the members of the USC-{gamma} clade are dominant in cave communities and can easily disperse through the environment, that methanotroph relative abundance was correlated with local scale mineralogy of soils, and that the relative abundance of methanotrophs was positively correlated with CH4 concentrations in cave air.",

    "abstract": "Placebo analgesia refers to the reduction of pain following the administration of an inactive treatment. While most clinical trials compare a drug treatment against a placebo to determine the efficacy of the analgesic, most experimental studies of placebo analgesia do not include a real analgesic condition. A direct comparison of placebo against a real analgesic can inform us about the true size of the placebo effect. To this end, we aimed to provide a robust estimate of placebo analgesia by contrasting the effect of pain relief expectation from an inert cream (vaseline) against a real topical analgesic agent (lidocaine) applied on two different limbs and their respective control conditions. Pain reports and electroencephalography (EEG) responses triggered by laser nociceptive stimulation were collected. Forty typical healthy adults were enrolled in a double-blind randomized within-subject study where a standard placebo induction script of verbal suggestions in a sham medical setting was used to enhance the expectation on treatment outcome. In line with the earliest studies of placebo analgesia, majority (30 of 40) of participants was placebo responders, i.e. they reported lower pain to the placebo treatment. Placebo responders reported low pain and displayed low laser evoked potentials (LEPs) amplitude for both the analgesic and placebo treatment limbs compared to the respective control limbs. Placebo analgesia correlated positively with the amplitude of the LEPs, thus establishing convergent validity of the findings. This study provides a robust estimate of the neural and behavioural measures of placebo analgesia, in comparison to a real analgesic. These estimates can help inform the quantitative criteria for similar neural and behavioural measures in assessing the effectiveness of a real drug in placebo controlled trials.",

Here, monkeys reached to one of two targets, whose colors alternated randomly between trials, by discriminating the dominant color of a checkerboard cue composed of different numbers of squares of the two target colors in different trials. In a \\\"Targets First\\\" task the colored targets appeared first, followed by the checkerboard; in a \\\"Checkerboard First\\\" task, this order was reversed. After both cues appeared in both tasks, responses of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) neurons covaried with action choices, strength of evidence for action choices, and RTs--- hallmarks of decision-related activity. However, very few neurons were modulated by checkerboard color composition or the color of the chosen target, even in the Checkerboard First task. These findings implicate PMd in the action-selection but not the perceptual components of the decision-making process in these tasks.",

    "abstract": "Brain mechanisms responsible for errors during cognitive tasks are poorly understood, particularly in adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using subject-specific multimodal imaging (EEG, MRI, behavior) during flanker task performance by a sample of 94 human adolescents (mean age = 15.5 years, 50% female) with varying degrees of ADHD symptomatology, we examined the degree to which amplitudes of source-resolved event-related potentials (ERPs) from brain independent components within a critical (but often ignored) period in the action selection process, the stimulus-response interval, predicted motor response errors (across trials) and error rates (across individuals). Reduced amplitudes of Frontocentral P3 (peaking at approximately 390 milliseconds in stimulus-locked ERPs) and Pre-Movement Positivity (PMP, peaking at approximately 110 milliseconds pre-response in response-locked ERPs) in projections from posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) predicted erroneous responses, and reduced amplitude of PMP predicted a larger participant error rate. After regressing stimulus-from response-locked ERPs, we concluded that errors primarily depended upon response selection processes reflected in PMP amplitude. Finally, mediation analyses showed that smaller PMPs on correct response trials was associated with the higher frequency of errors committed by adolescents with more ADHD symptoms. These results bolster the importance of pMFC in action selection and support the possible value of using PMP as an intervention target to remediate performance deficits in ADHD.",

Previous work suggested that in some ant species colony-specific signatures are generated through a \\\"gestalt\\\" mechanism via the passive transfer and homogenization of CHCs across all individual members of the colony. In contrast, we demonstrate that nestmate recognition cues of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) mature in foragers via a sequence of stereotypic age-dependent quantitative and qualitative chemical transitions, which are driven by intrinsic biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, in contrast to predictions of the \\\"Gestalt\\\" model, nestmate recognition cues in honey bee colonies do not represent a passive \\\"average\\\" signature that is carried and recognized by all colony members. Instead, specific colony members develop the relevant cues via an innately-determined developmental program that can be modulated by colony-specific social environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Wild life is increasingly coming in contact with humans in many parts of the world. Human perception of wild life may be an important factor in population management and conservation practices in urban and semi-urban areas. Human attitude towards bird species may vary from non-violent coexistence to a perception of birds as pests. Based on the data collected from survey interviews, we studied the perceptions of local communities in Rajasthan, India towards Indian Peafowl. Local communities in Rajasthan reported Indian Peafowl as crop pest and this perception varied across seasons. The crop loss incurred due to Indian Peafowl also varied across seasons according to the respondents. Despite reporting peafowls as a crop pest, locals regularly offered grains for them as a traditional practice. Thus, at our study sites locals have mostly positive perception about Indian peafowl around them.\\n\\nFood provisioning by local human population influenced diet composition and time-budget of Indian Peafowls at food provision and non-provision sites. Sites at which food provisioning was less or absent, peafowl spent more time in walking in search of food and more than half of their diet consisted of natural food. In contrast, the sites at which plenty of grains were available, time spent in walking was significantly less, while time spent in feeding was significantly more; and over 70% of their diet consisted of carbohydrate and protein-rich provisioned grains. Food provisioning changed the benefit: cost ratio (measured as time spent in feeding to time spent in all other behaviours) between provision and non-provision sites. Thus, food provisioning by humans can change feeding ecology of native Indian peafowl populations, while the presence of peafowl in human dominated landscape changes how humans interact with wild life around them.",

    "abstract": "Trio family and case-control studies of next-generation sequencing data have proven integral to understanding the contribution of rare inherited and de novo single-nucleotide variants to the genetic architecture of complex disease. Ideally, such studies should identify individual risk genes of moderate to large effect size to generate novel treatment hypotheses for further follow-up. However, due to insufficient power, gene set enrichment analyses have come to be relied upon for detecting differences between cases and controls, implicating sets of hundreds of genes rather than specific targets for further investigation. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical framework, termed gTADA, that integrates gene-set membership information with gene-level de novo and rare inherited case-control counts, to prioritize risk genes with excess rare variant burden within enriched gene sets. Applying gTADA to available whole-exome sequencing datasets for several neuropsychiatric conditions, we replicated previously reported gene set enrichments and identified novel risk genes. For epilepsy, gTADA prioritized 40 risk genes (posterior probabilities > 0.95), 6 of which replicate in an independent whole-genome sequencing study. In addition, 30/40 genes are novel genes. We found that epilepsy genes had high protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and show specific expression during human brain development. Some of the top prioritized EPI genes were connected to a PPI subnetwork of immune genes and show specific expression in prenatal microglia. We also identified multiple enriched drug-target gene sets for EPI which included immunostimulants as well as known antiepileptics. Immune biology was supported specifically by case-control variants from familial epilepsies rather than do novo mutations in generalized encephalitic epilepsy.",

Automated tracking also improves replicability by avoiding observer biases and allowing reproducible workflows. However, few automated tracking programs exist that are open access, open source, and capable of tracking unmarked organisms in noisy environments.\\n\\n2. Tracktor is an image-based tracking freeware designed to perform single-object tracking in noisy environments, or multi-object tracking in uniform environments while maintaining individual identities. Tracktor is code-based but requires no coding skills other than the user being able to specify tracking parameters in a designated location, much like in a graphical user interface (GUI). The installation and use of the software is fully detailed in a user manual.\\n\\n3. Through four examples of common tracking problems, we show that Tracktor is able to track a variety of animals in diverse conditions. The main strengths of Tracktor lie in its ability to track single individuals under noisy conditions (e.g. when the object shape is distorted), its robustness to perturbations (e.g. changes in lighting conditions during the experiment), and its capacity to track multiple individuals while maintaining their identities. Additionally, summary statistics and plots allow measuring and visualizing common metrics used in the analysis of animal movement (e.g. cumulative distance, speed, acceleration, activity, time spent in specific areas, distance to neighbour, etc.).\\n\\n4.

We find that brain states are composed of interdigitated functional networks and exhibit context-dependent dynamics. Using diffusion-weighted imaging acquired from the same subjects, we show that structural connectivity constrains the temporal progression of brain states. We also combine tools from network control theory with geometrically conservative null models to demonstrate that brains are wired to support states of high activity in default mode areas, while requiring relatively low energy. Finally, we show that brain state dynamics change throughout development and explain working memory performance. Overall, these results elucidate the structural underpinnings of cognitively and developmentally relevant spatiotemporal brain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale structural brain networks encode white-matter connectivity patterns among distributed brain areas. These connection patterns are believed to support cognitive processes and, when compromised, can lead to neurocognitive deficits and maladaptive behavior. A powerful approach for studying the organizing principles of brain networks is to construct group-representative networks from multi-subject cohorts. Doing so amplifies signal to noise ratios and provides a clearer picture of brain network organization. Here, we show that current approaches for generating grouprepresentative networks over-estimate the proportion of short-range connections present in a network and, as a result, fail to match subject-level networks along a wide range of network statistics. We present an alternative approach that preserves the connection-length distribution of individual subjects. Due to this simple modification, the networks generated using this novel approach successfully recapitulate subject-level properties, outperforming all existing approaches by better preserving features that promote integrative brain function rather than segregative. The method developed here holds promise for future studies investigating basic organizational principles and features of largescale structural brain networks.",
