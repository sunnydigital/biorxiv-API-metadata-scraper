    "abstract": "Visual neglect is a frequent and disabling consequence of right hemisphere damage. Previous work demonstrated a probable role of posterior callosal dysfunction in the chronic persistence of neglect signs. Prism adaptation is a non-invasive and convenient technique to rehabilitate chronic visual neglect, but it is not effective in all patients. Here we aimed to assess the hypothesis that prism adaptation improves left neglect by facilitating compensation through the contribution of the left, undamaged hemisphere. We assessed the relationship between prism adaptation effects, cortical thickness and white matter integrity in a group of 14 patients with unilateral right-hemisphere strokes and chronic visual neglect. Results showed that patients who benefitted from prism adaptation had thicker cortex in temporo-parietal, prefrontal and cingulate areas of the left, undamaged hemisphere. Additionally, these patients had a higher fractional anisotropy value in the body and genu of the corpus callosum. Results from normal controls show that these callosal regions connect temporo-parietal, sensorimotor and prefrontal areas. Finally, shorter time intervals from the stroke tended to improve patients response to prism adaptation. We concluded that prism adaptation may improve left visual neglect by promoting the contribution of the left hemisphere to neglect compensation. These results support current hypotheses on the role of the healthy hemisphere in the compensation for stroke-induced, chronic neuropsychological deficits, and suggest that prism adaptation can foster this role by exploiting sensorimotor/prefrontal circuits, especially when applied at early stages post-stroke.",

    "abstract": "The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by the chronic activation of signaling initiated by immunoglobulin- (IgM). By analyzing DNA copy profiles of 1,000 DLBCLs, we identified gains of 18q21.2 as the most frequent genetic alteration in ABC-like DLBCL. We show that these alterations target the TCF4 (E2-2) transcription factor, and that over-expression of TCF4 leads to its occupancy on immunoglobulin gene enhancers and increased expression of IgM at the transcript and protein level. The TCF4 gene is one of the top BRD4-regulated genes in DLBCL. Using a BET proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) we show that TCF4 and IgM expression can be extinguished, and ABC-like DLBCL cells can be killed in vitro and in vivo. This highlights a novel genetic mechanism for promoting immunoglobulin signaling in ABC-like DLBCL and provides a functional rationale for the use of BET inhibitors in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementThis study describes the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on tunneling nanotube formation via increased adhesion through {beta}-integrin in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.\\n\\nAbstractThe actin-containing cell-to-cell communicator tunneling nanotube (TNT) is involved in regulation of cell death threshold of leukemic cells, while the mechanism of TNT regulation is mostly unknown. We have investigated TNT formation and its response to treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells with the pathognomonic chimeric fusion kinase BCR-ABL1 after treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib and interferon-. Bone marrow cells of chronic phase CML patients and the CML cell line Kcl-22 formed few or no TNTs. Nilotinib and interferon- treatment induced TNT formation in Kcl-22 cells and were found to be linked to increased adherence to fibronectin coated surfaces by restoration of {beta}1-integrin function. This suggests modulation of TNT cell-cell communication in CML as a novel mechanism in kinase inhibitor therapy of CML.",

The loci were enriched for genes involved in circadian regulation, cAMP, glutamate and insulin signalling pathways, and those expressed in the retina, hindbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary. We provide evidence that being a morning person is causally associated with better mental health but does not appear to affect BMI or Type 2 diabetes.

    "abstract": "Sleep is an essential human function but its regulation is poorly understood. Identifying genetic variants associated with quality, quantity and timing of sleep will provide biological insights into the regulation of sleep and potential links with disease. Using accelerometer data from 85,670 individuals in the UK Biobank, we performed a genome-wide association study of 8 accelerometer-derived sleep traits, 5 of which are not accessible through self-report alone. We identified 47 genetic associations across the sleep traits (P<5x10-8) and replicated our findings in 5,819 individuals from 3 independent studies. These included 26 novel associations for sleep quality and 10 for nocturnal sleep duration. The majority of newly identified variants were associated with a single sleep trait, except for variants previously associated with restless legs syndrome that were associated with multiple sleep traits. Of the new associated and replicated sleep duration loci, we were able to fine-map a missense variant (p.Tyr727Cys) in PDE11A, a dual-specificity 3,5-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase expressed in the hippocampus, as the likely causal variant. As a group, sleep quality loci were enriched for serotonin processing genes and all sleep traits were enriched for cerebellar-expressed genes. These findings provide new biological insights into sleep characteristics.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCancer diagnosis during pregnancy occurs in 1 out of 1000 pregnancies with common malignancies including breast and hematological cancers. Fetal exposure to currently utilized agents is poorly described. We directly assessed fetal exposure by screening meconium from 23 newborns whose mothers had undergone treatment for cancer during pregnancy.\\n\\nStudy DesignMeconium was collected from newborns whose mothers were diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy and underwent chemotherapy in the second or third trimester as part of the Cancer and Pregnancy Registry. We conducted screening of 23 meconium samples for chemotherapeutics and known metabolites of chemotherapeutics by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Putative identification of paclitaxel and/or its metabolites was made in 8 screened samples. In positively screened samples, we quantified paclitaxel, 3-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 6-hydroxypaclitaxel by stable isotope dilution-LC-HRMS.\\n\\nResultsMean levels of paclitaxel were 399.9 pg/mg in meconium samples from newborn born to mothers that underwent chemotherapy during pregnancy. 3-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6-hydroxypaclitaxel mean levels were 105.2 and 113.4 pg/mg meconium, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionIntact paclitaxel, and at least two of its major metabolites were detected in meconium, providing unambiguous confirmation of human fetal exposure. Variability in meconium levels between individuals may indicate a potential for reducing fetal exposure based on timing, dosing, and individual characteristics. This preliminary study may provide an efficient approach for examining the effects of cancer diagnosis during pregnancy on other outcomes by providing a measure of direct fetal exposure.",

Our results show that children explore more eagerly than adults, but obtain lower rewards.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial cristae are critical for efficient oxidative phosphorylation, however, how cristae architecture is precisely organized remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered that Mic19, a core component of MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) complex, can be cleaved at N-terminal by mitochondrial protease OMA1. Mic19 directly interacts with mitochondrial outer-membrane protein Sam50 (the key subunit of SAM complex) and inner-membrane protein Mic60 (the key component of MICOS complex) to form Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis, which dominantly connects SAM and MICOS complexes to assemble MIB (mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging) supercomplex for mediating mitochondrial outer- and inner-membrane contact. OMA1-mediated Mic19 cleavage causes Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis disruption, which separates SAM and MICOS and leads to MIB disassembly. Disrupted Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis, even in the presence of SAM and MICOS complexes, causes the abnormal mitochondrial morphology, loss of mitochondrial cristae junctions, abnormal cristae distribution and reduced ATP production. Importantly, Sam50 displays punctate distribution at mitochondrial outer membrane, and acts as an anchoring point to guide the formation of mitochondrial cristae junctions. Therefore, we propose a model that Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis mediated SAM-MICOS complexes integration determines mitochondrial cristae architecture.",

They provide a mechanism for sharing cultural identity, imparting knowledge, revealing beliefs, reinforcing social bonds and providing entertainment that is central to all human societies. Here we investigated the extent to which the delivery medium of a story (audio or visual) affected conscious and subconscious engagement with the narrative. Although participants self-reported greater involvement for watching video relative to listening to auditory scenes, stronger physiological responses were recorded for auditory stories. Sensors placed at their wrists showed higher and more variable heart rates, greater electrodermal activity, and even higher body temperatures. We interpret these findings as physiological evidence that the stories were more cognitively and emotionally engaging when presented in an auditory format. This may be because listening to a story, rather than watching a video, is a more active process of co-creation, and that this imaginative process in the listeners mind is detectable on the skin at their wrist.",

We reasoned that IDRs should be more accessible to targeted in vivo biotinylation than more ordered protein regions, if they retain their flexibility in vivo. Indeed, we observed a positive correlation of predicted IDRs and biotinylation density across four independent large-scale proximity proteomics studies that together report >20 000 biotinylation sites.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCorrect quantification of transcript expression is essential to understand the functional products of the genome in different physiological conditions and developmental stages. Recently, the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows the researchers to perform transcriptome analysis for the organisms without the reference genome and transcriptome. For such projects, de novo transcriptome assembly must be carried out prior to quantification. However, a large number of erroneous contigs produced by the assemblers might result in unreliable estimation on the abundance of transcripts. In this regard, this study comprehensively investigates how assembly quality affects the performance of quantification for RNA-Seq analysis based on de novo transcriptome assembly.\\n\\nResultsSeveral important factors that might seriously affect the accuracy of the RNA-Seq analysis were thoroughly discussed. First, we found that the assemblers perform comparatively well for the transcriptomes with lower biological complexity. Second, we examined the over-extended and incomplete contigs, and then demonstrated that assembly completeness has a strong impact on the estimation of contig abundance. Lastly, we investigated the behavior of the quantifiers with respect to sequence ambiguity which might be originally present in the transcriptome or accidentally produced by assemblers. The results suggest that the quantifiers often over-estimate the expression of family-collapse contigs and under-estimate the expression of duplicated contigs. For organisms without reference transcriptome, it remained challenging to detect the inaccurate abundance estimation on family-collapse contigs. On the contrary, we observed that the situation of under-estimation on duplicated contigs can be warned through analyzing the read distribution of the duplicated contigs.\\n\\nConclusionsIn summary, we explicated the behavior of quantifiers when erroneous contigs are present and we outlined the potential problems that the assemblers might cause for the downstream analysis of RNA-Seq. We anticipate the analytic results conducted in this study provides valuable insights for future development of transcriptome assembly and quantification.\\n\\nAvailabilitywe proposed an open-source Python based package QuantEval that builds connected components for the assembled contigs based on sequence similarity and evaluates the quantification results for each connected component.

EE measured using metabolic chambers increased transiently by what was considered a relatively small extent after the switch to the KD, whereas EE measured using doubly labeled water (EEDLW) increased to a greater degree after the response in the chambers had waned. Using a publicly available dataset, we examined the effect of housing conditions on the magnitude of the increase in EEDLW after the switch to the KD and the role of physical activity in that response.\\n\\nMethodsThe 14-day EEDLW measurement period included 4 days when subjects were confined to chambers instead of living in wards. To determine the effect on EEDLW only for the days subjects were living in the wards, we calculated non-chamber EE (EEnonchamber). To assess the role of physical activity in the response to the KD, we analyzed chamber and non-chamber accelerometer data for the BD and KD EEDLW measurement periods.\\n\\nResultsIn comparison with the increase in average 14-day EEDLW of 151 kcal/d {+/-} 63 (P = 0.03) after the switch to the KD, EEnonchamber increased by 203 {+/-} 89 kcal/d (P = 0.04) or 283 {+/-} 116 kcal/d(P = 0.03) depending on the analytical approach. Hip accelerometer counts decreased significantly (P = 0.01) after the switch to the KD, whereas wrist and ankle accelerometer counts did not change.\\n\\nConclusionsSwitching from the BD to the KD substantially increased EEDLW, but apparently only on days subjects were living in the ward outside the metabolic chamber.

    "abstract": "Wheat Avenin-like proteins (TaALP) are atypical storage proteins belonging to the Prolamin superfamily. Previous studies on ALPs have focused on the proteins positive effects on dough strength, whilst no correlation has been made between TaALPs and the plant immune system. Here, we performed genome-wide characterization of ALP encoding genes in bread wheat. In silico analyses indicated the presence of critical peptides in TaALPs that are active in the plant immune system. Pathogenesis-related nucleotide motifs were also identified in the putative promoter regions of TaALP encoding genes. RT-PCR was performed on TaALP and previously characterised pathogenesis resistance genes in developing wheat caryopses under control and Fusarium graminearum infection conditions. The results showed that TaALP and NMT genes were upregulated upon F. graminearum inoculation. mRNA insitu hybridization showed that TaALP genes were expressed in the embryo, aleurone and sub-aleurone layer cells. Seven TaALP genes were cloned for the expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, which displayed significant inhibitory function on F. graminearum under anti-fungal tests. In addition, FHB index association analyses showed that allelic variations of two ALP genes on chromosome 7A were significantly correlated with FHB symptoms. Over-expression of an ALP gene on chromosome 7A showed an enhanced resistance to FHB. Yeast two Hybridization results revealed that ALPs have potential proteases inhibiting effect on metacaspases and beta-glucosidases. A vital infection process related pathogen protein, F. graminearum Beta-glucosidase was found to interact with ALPs. Our study is the first to report a class of wheat storage protein or gluten protein with biochemical functions. Due to its abundance in the grain and the important multi-functions, the results obtained in the current study are expected to have a significant impact on wheat research and industry.",

The research field is dynamic and expanding with applications across biomedical, biotechnological and many other applied biological domains. Its computationally-intensive nature has driven requirements for open data formats, data repositories and data analysis tools. However, the rapid progress has resulted in a mosaic of independent - and sometimes incompatible - analysis methods that are difficult to connect into a useful and complete data analysis solution.\\n\\nFindingsThe PhenoMeNal (Phenome and Metabolome aNalysis) e-infrastructure provides a complete, workflow-oriented, interoperable metabolomics data analysis solution for a modern infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud platform. PhenoMeNal seamlessly integrates a wide array of existing open source tools which are tested and packaged as Docker containers through the projects continuous integration process and deployed based on a kubernetes orchestration framework. It also provides a number of standardized, automated and published analysis workflows in the user interfaces Galaxy, Jupyter, Luigi and Pachyderm.\\n\\nConclusionsPhenoMeNal constitutes a keystone solution in cloud infrastructures available for metabolomics. It provides scientists with a ready-to-use, workflow-driven, reproducible and shareable data analysis platform harmonizing the software installation and configuration through user-friendly web interfaces. The deployed cloud environments can be dynamically scaled to enable large-scale analyses which are interfaced through standard data formats, versioned, and have been tested for reproducibility and interoperability.

    "abstract": "Essential features of cancer tissue cellular heterogeneity such as negatively selected genome topologies, sub-clonal mutation patterns and genome replication states can only effectively be studied by sequencing single-cell genomes at scale and high fidelity. Using an amplification-free single-cell genome sequencing approach implemented on commodity hardware (DLP+) coupled with a cloud-based computational platform, we define a resource of 40,000 single-cell genomes characterized by their genome states, across a wide range of tissue types and conditions. We show that shallow sequencing across thousands of genomes permits reconstruction of clonal genomes to single nucleotide resolution through aggregation analysis of cells sharing higher order genome structure. From large-scale population analysis over thousands of cells, we identify rare cells exhibiting mitotic mis-segregation of whole chromosomes. We observe that tissue derived scWGS libraries exhibit lower rates of whole chromosome anueploidy than cell lines, and loss of p53 results in a shift in event type, but not overall prevalence in breast epithelium. Finally, we demonstrate that the replication states of genomes can be identified, allowing the number and proportion of replicating cells, as well as the chromosomal pattern of replication to be unambiguously identified in single-cell genome sequencing experiments. The combined annotated resource and approach provide a re-implementable large scale platform for studying lineages and tissue heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "In the latest hg38 human genome assembly, centromeric gaps has been filled in by alpha satellite (AS) reference models (RMs) which are statistical representations of homogeneous higher-order repeat (HOR) arrays that make up the bulk of the centromeric regions. We studied these models to compose an atlas of human HORs where each monomer of a HOR could be characterized and represented by a number of its polymorphic sequence variants. We further used these data and HMMER sequence analysis platform to annotate AS HORs in the assembly. This led to discovery and annotation of a new type of low copy number highly divergent HORs which were not represented by RMs. The annotation can be viewed as UCSC Genome Browser custom track (the HOR-track) and used together with our previous annotation of AS SFs in the same assembly where each AS monomer can be viewed in its genomic context together with its classification into one of the 5 major SFs (the SF-track). To catalog the diversity of AS HORs in the human genome we introduced a new naming system. Each HOR received a name which showed its SF, chromosomal location and index number. Here we present the first installment of the HOR-track covering only the 17 HORs that belong to SF1 which forms live functional centromeres in chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 16 and 19 and also a large number of minor dead HOR domains, both homogeneous (pseudo) and divergent (relic). The 4 newly discovered divergent SF1 HORs have provided the missing links in SF1 early evolution and substantiated its partition into 2 generations, archaic and modern, which we reported earlier. Additionally, we demonstrated that monomer-by-monomer HOR annotation was useful for mapping and quantification of various structural variants of AS HORs which would be important for studies of inter-individual polymorphism of AS including centromeric functional epialleles.",

However, the role of the common bacterial cohabitant, phage, in kin recognition, has not been explored. Here we find that a boundary (demarcation line) is formed between different swimming Escherichia coli strains but not between identical clones; hence, motile bacterial cells discriminate between self and non-self. The basis for this self-recognition is a novel, 49 kb, T1-type, lytic phage of the family siphoviridae (named here SW1) that controls formation of the demarcation line by utilizing one of the hosts cryptic prophage proteins, YfdM, to propagate. Critically, SW1 increases the fitness of E. coli K-12 compared to the identical strain that lacks the phage. Therefore, bacteria use phage to recognize kin.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the principles of DNA binding by transcription factors (TFs) is of primary importance for studying gene regulation. Recently, several lines of evidence suggested that both DNA sequence and shape contribute to TF binding. However, the question if in the absence of any sequence similarity to the binding motif, DNA shape can still increase probability of binding was yet to be addressed.\\n\\nTo address this challenge, we developed Co-SELECT, a computational approach to analyze the results of in vitro HT-SELEX experiments for TF-DNA binding. Specifically, the presence of motif-free sequences in late HT-SELEX rounds and their enrichment in weak binders allowed us to detect evidence for the role of DNA shape features in TF binding.\\n\\nOur approach revealed that, even in the absence of the sequence motif, TFs have propensity to weakly bind to DNA molecules enriched in specific shape features. Surprisingly, we also found that some properties of DNA shape contribute to promiscuous binding of all tested TF families. Strikingly, such promiscuously bound shapes correspond to the most frequent shape formed by the DNA. We propose that this promiscuous binding facilitates diffusing of TFs along the DNA molecule before it is locked in its binding site.",

We conducted field and laboratory experiments to investigate bee health in response to field-relevant doses of this pesticide. Significant effects were observed in honey bee colony flight activity and thermoregulation after being treated with methoxyfenozide. Data collected indicated that hives fed 500 ppb methoxyfenozide treated pollen patty had: 1) a significantly reduced rate of daily hive weight loss due to forager departure at the start of the colonys daily activity; 2) the end of the colonys daily activity delayed by 17-21 minutes compared to Control; and 3) higher temperature variability during the winter. Colonies in the 125 ppb treatment group had fewer differences with the Control group, but did show a delay in the foraging end time by 30-46 minutes compared to the Control. Bee colony metrics of adult bee mass and brood surface area, and individual bee measurements of head weight, newly-emerged bee weight, and hypopharyngeal gland size were not significantly affected by the methoxyfenozide exposure levels of our experiments. An experiment conducted using the same treatment groups in the spring resulted in fewer differences among groups than did the experiments conducted in the fall. Analyses of methoxyfenozide concentrations in the treatment patty, wax, and bee bread showed that: 1) observed methoxyfenozide concentrations were about 18-60% lower than the calculated concentrations; 2) no residues were observed in wax in any treatment; and 3) methoxyfenozide was detected in stored bee bread in the 500 ppb treatment, at concentrations about 1-2.5% of the observed concentration for that treatment. These results suggest that there may be significant effects on honey bee colony behavior (and possibly health) in the field that are difficult to detect through traditional hive inspections and individual metrics.",

The systematic random sampling technique was used to select a total of 697 people living with HIV/AIDS. Data was collected using structured interviewer administered questionnaire and International HIV Dementia Scale was used to screen HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits.

    "abstract": "Taenia solium is a zoonotic cestode parasite which causes human neurocysticercosis. Pigs transmit the parasite by acting as the intermediate host. An intervention was implemented in pigs to control transmission of T. solium in Dalit communities of Banke District, Nepal. Every 3 months, pigs were vaccinated with the TSOL18 recombinant vaccine (Cysvax, IIL, India)) and, at the same time, given an oral treatment with 30mg/kg oxfendazole (Paranthic 10%, MCI, Morocco). The prevalence of porcine cysticercosis was determined in both an intervention area as well as a similar no intervention control area, among randomly selected, slaughter-age pigs. Post mortem assessments were undertaken both at the start and at the end of the intervention. Participants conducting the post mortem assessments were blinded as to the source of the animals being assessed. At the start of the intervention the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis was 23.6% and 34.5% in the control and intervention areas, respectively. Following the intervention, the prevalence of cysticercosis in pigs from the control area was 16.7% (no significant change), whereas no infection was detected after complete slicing of all muscle tissue and brain in animals from the intervention area (P=0.004). These findings are discussed in relation to the feasibility and sustainability of T. solium control. The 3-monthly vaccination and drug treatment intervention in pigs used here is suggested as an effective and practical method for reducing T. solium transmission, thereby reducing the incidence of human neurocysticercosis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeurocysticercosis is a disease caused by a parasitic infection of the brain. The parasite responsible, Taenia solium, is transmitted by pigs where human sanitation is poor and pigs roam freely. Neurocysticercosis is responsible for many cases of epilepsy in people living in poor, developing countries. The feasibility and sustainability of implementing control measures have been major impediments to reducing the incidence of neurocysticercosis. Recently, two new commercial products have become available for pigs which together offer the possibility of interrupting the parasites transmission the TSOL18 vaccine (Cysvax, IIL, India) and an oxfendazole formulation (Paranthic 10%, MCI, Morocco) licensed for use in pigs for the treatment of cysticercosis. Here we describe the impact of implementing vaccination plus drug treatment of pigs in the Banke district of Nepal. The intervention eliminated the risk of transmission of T. solium by the animals vaccinated and treated during the trial. Application of the vaccination and drug treatment program used here, possibly with strategic use of anthelmintics also in the human population, is an effective option for reducing the incidence of neurocysticercosis in Nepal and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Processing words with referents that are typically observed up or down in space (up/down words) influences the subsequent identification of visual targets in congruent locations. Eye-tracking studies have shown that up/down word comprehension shortens launch times of subsequent saccades to congruent locations and modulates concurrent saccade trajectories. This can be explained by a task-dependent interaction of semantic processing and oculomotor programs or by a direct recruitment of direction-specific processes in oculomotor and spatial systems as part of semantic processing. To test the latter possibility, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment and used multi-voxel pattern analysis to assess 1) whether the typical location of word referents can be decoded from the fronto-parietal spatial network and 2) whether activity patterns are shared between up/down words and up/down saccadic eye movements. In line with these hypotheses, significant decoding of up vs. down words and cross-decoding between up/down saccades and up/down words were observed in the frontal eye field region in the superior frontal sulcus and the inferior parietal lobule. Beyond these spatial attention areas, typical location of word referents could be decoded from a set of occipital, temporal, and frontal areas, indicating that interactions between high-level regions typically implicated with lexical-semantic processing and spatial/oculomotor regions constitute the neural basis for access to spatial aspects of word meanings.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of recent genetic technologies for mice, it is now feasible to investigate the circuit mechanisms of brain functions in an unprecedented manner. Although transgenic mice are commonly used on C57BL/6J (C57) background, hearing research has typically relied on different genetic backgrounds, such as CBA/Ca or CBA due to the genetic defect of C57 mice for early age-related hearing loss. This limits the utilization of available genetic resources for hearing research. Here we report congenic (>F10) Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) mice on CBA/Ca background. By crossing this line with Cre-driver mice on C57 background, F1 hybrids restored the hearing deficit of C57 mice. We also found a linear relationship between aging and hearing loss, with progression rates varied depending on genetic backgrounds (3.39 dB/month for C57; 0.82 dB/month for F1 hybrid). We further demonstrate that this approach allows to express ChR2 in a specific type of inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex and that they can be identified within a simultaneously recorded population of neurons in awake mice. Thus, our Cre-dependent optogenetic transgenic mice on CBA/Ca background are a valuable tool to investigate the circuit mechanisms of hearing across lifespan.",

    "abstract": "In juvenile and \\\"young adult\\\" mice monocular deprivation (MD) shifts the ocular dominance (OD) of binocular neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) away from the deprived eye. However, OD plasticity is completely absent in mice older than 110 days, but can be reactivated by treatments which decrease GABA levels in V1. Typically, these OD shifts can be prevented by increasing GABAergic transmission with diazepam. We could recently demonstrate that both bilateral whisker and auditory deprivation (WD, AD), can also restore OD plasticity in mice older than 110 days, since MD for 7 days in WD mice caused a potentiation of V1 input through the ipsilateral (open) eye, the characteristic feature of OD plasticity of \\\"young adult\\\" mice. Here we examined whether WD for 7 days also decreases GABA levels. For this, we performed post mortem HPLC analysis of V1 tissue. Indeed, we found that WD significantly decreased GABA levels in V1. Surprisingly, enhancing GABAergic inhibition by diazepam did not abolish OD shifts in WD mice, as revealed by repeated intrinsic signal imaging. On the contrary, this treatment led to a depression of V1 input through the previously closed contralateral eye, the characteristic signature of OD plasticity in juvenile mice during the critical period. Interestingly, the same result was obtained after AD. Taken together, these results suggest that cross-modally restored OD plasticity does not only depend on reduction of GABA levels in V1, but also requires other, so far unknown mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, and impaired glutamate clearance following synaptic release promotes spillover, inducing extra-synaptic signaling. The effects of glutamate spillover on animal behavior and its neural correlates are poorly understood. We developed a glutamate spillover model in Caenorhabditis elegans by inactivating the conserved glial glutamate transporter GLT-1. GLT-1 loss drives aberrant repetitive locomotory reversal behavior through uncontrolled oscillatory release of glutamate onto AVA, a major interneuron governing reversals. Repetitive glutamate release and reversal behavior require the glutamate receptor MGL-2/mGluR5, expressed in RIM and other interneurons presynaptic to AVA. mgl-2 loss blocks oscillations and repetitive behavior; while RIM activation is sufficient to induce repetitive reversals in glt-1 mutants. Repetitive AVA firing and reversals require EGL-30/Gq, an mGluR5 effector. Our studies reveal that cyclic autocrine presynaptic activation drives repetitive reversals following glutamate spillover. That mammalian GLT1 and mGluR5 are implicated in pathological motor repetition suggests a common mechanism controlling repetitive behaviors.",

A fundamental, unanswered question in neuroscience is what dimensions of visual information constrain the development and topography of this shared brain organization? To answer this question, we scanned with fMRI a unique group of adults who, as children, engaged in extensive experience with a novel stimulus-Pokemon-which are dissimilar from other ecological categories such as faces and places along critical dimensions (foveal bias, rectilinearity, size, animacy) from. We find that experienced adults not only demonstrate distinct and consistent distributed cortical responses to Pokemon, but their activations suggest that it is the experienced retinal eccentricity during childhood that predicts the locus of distributed responses to Pokemon in adulthood. These data advance our understanding about how childhood experience and functional constraints shape the functional organization of the human brain.",

Here we use behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) as a model disease. We demonstrate that inversion of canonical microcircuit models to non-invasive human magnetoecphalography can identify the regional- and laminar-specificity of bvFTD pathophysiology, and their parameters can accurately differentiate patients from matched healthy controls. Using such models, we show that changes in local coupling in frontotemporal dementia underlie the failure to adequately establish sensory predictions, leading to altered prediction error responses in a cortical information-processing hierarchy. Using machine learning, this model-based approach provided greater case-control classification accuracy than conventional evoked cortical responses. We suggest that this approach provides an in vivo platform for testing mechanistic hypotheses about disease progression and pharmacotherapeutics.",

We further resolve the expression pattern over time and assign specific novel transcripts to the retinal cell type, predominantly in the inner nuclear layer. Using chemical ablation and free run experiments we segregate the transcripts that are rhythmic when entrained by light from those that show sustained oscillations in the absence of external cues.

Genes responsible for familial ALS have been identified, however the molecular basis for sALS is unknown. To discover metabotypic biomarkers that inform on disease etiology, untargeted metabolite profiling was performed on 77 patient-derived dermal fibroblast lines and 45 age/sex-matched controls. Surprisingly, 25% of sALS lines showed upregulated methionine-derived homocysteine, channeled to cysteine and glutathione (GSH). Stable isotope tracing of [U-13C]-glucose showed activation of the trans-sulfuration pathway, associated with accelerated glucose flux into the TCA cycle, glutamate, GSH, alanine, aspartate, acylcarnitines and nucleotide phosphates. A four-molecule support vector machine model distinguished the sALS subtype from controls with 97.5% accuracy. Plasma metabolite profiling identified increased taurine as a hallmark metabolite for this sALS subset, suggesting systemic perturbation of cysteine metabolism. Furthermore, integrated multiomics (mRNAs/microRNAs/metabolites) identified the super-trans-sulfuration pathway as a top hit for the sALS subtype. We conclude that sALS can be stratified into distinct metabotypes, providing for future development of personalized therapies that offer new hope to sufferers.",

Despite recent structural insights, our mechanistic understanding of LINC complex assembly remains limited by the lack of an experimental system for its in vitro reconstitution and manipulation. Here, we describe artificial nuclear membranes (ANMs) as a synthetic biology platform based on mammalian cell-free expression for the rapid reconstitution of SUN proteins in supported lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that SUN1 and SUN2 are oriented in ANMs with solvent-exposed C-terminal KASH-binding SUN domains. We also find that SUN2 possesses a single transmembrane domain, while SUN1 possesses three. Finally, SUN protein-containing ANMs bind synthetic KASH peptides, thereby reconstituting the LINC complex core. This work represents the first in vitro reconstitution of KASH-binding SUN proteins in supported lipid bilayers using cell-free expression, which will be invaluable for testing proposed models of LINC complex assembly and its regulation.",

To gain insight into the functions of nuclear G{beta}{gamma}, we investigated the functional role of G{beta}{gamma} signalling in regulation of GPCR-mediated gene expression in primary rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts. Following activation of the angiotensin II type I receptor in these cells, G{beta}{gamma} dimers interact with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Our findings suggest that G{beta}1 recruitment to RNAPII negatively regulates the fibrotic transcriptional response, which can be overcome by strong fibrotic stimuli. The interaction between G{beta}{gamma} subunits and RNAPII expands the role for G{beta}{gamma} signalling in cardiac fibrosis. The G{beta}{gamma}-RNAPII interaction was regulated by signaling pathways in HEK 293 cells that diverged from those operating in cardiac fibroblasts. Thus, the interaction may be a conserved feature of transcriptional regulation although such regulation may be cell-specific.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus is enclosed by the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). While the ONM is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the INM is independent and separates the nucleoplasm from the ER lumen. To maintain INM homeostasis, proteins mislocalized to the INM are degraded by the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. However, the mechanism for turnover of resident INM proteins is less clear. Here we show that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulates the degradation of Mps3, a conserved integral protein of the INM. Turnover of Mps3 requires the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc7 and Ubc6, but not the three known ERAD ubiquitin ligases, Doa10, Hrd1, and the Asi1-Asi3 complex. Using a genetic approach, we have found that Cdh1, a coactivator of APC/C, modulates Mps3 stability. APC/C controls Mps3 degradation through Mps3s N-terminus, which resides in the nucleoplasm and possesses two putative APC/C-dependent destruction motifs. Accumulation of Mps3 at the INM impairs nuclear morphological changes and cell division. Our findings therefore reveal an unexpected mechanism of APC/C-mediated protein quality control at the INM that coordinates nuclear morphogenesis and cell-cycle progression.",

Besides their potent hepatotoxicity, MCs have been revealed to induce potential reproductive toxicity in various animal studies. However, little is still known regarding the distribution of MCs in the reproductive organ, which could directly affect reproductive cells. In order to respond to this question, an acute study was conducted in adult medaka fish (model animal) gavaged with 10 {micro}g.g-1 body weight of pure MC-LR. The histological and immunohistochemical examinations reveal an intense distribution of MC-LR within hepatocytes along with a severe liver lesion in the toxin-treated female and male fish. Besides being accumulated in the hepatocytes, MC-LR was also found in the connective tissue of the ovary and the testis, as well as in oocytes and degenerative spermatocyte-like structures. Both liver and gonad play important roles in the reproductive process of oviparous vertebrates. This observation constitutes the first observation of the presence of MC-LR in the reproductive cell of a vertebrate model with in vivo study. Our results, which provide intracellular localization of MC-LR in the gonad, advance our understanding of the potential reproductive toxicity of MC-LR in fish.",

    "abstract": "The trans-activating response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a transcriptional repressor and splicing factor. TDP-43 is normally mostly in the nucleus, although it shuttles to the cytoplasm. Mutations in TDP-43 are one cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In neurons of these patients, TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates. In addition, wild-type TDP-43 is also frequently found in neuronal cytoplasmic aggregates in patients with neurodegenerative diseases not caused by TDP-43 mutations. TDP-43 expressed in yeast causes toxicity and forms cytoplasmic aggregates. This disease model has been validated because genetic modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity in yeast have led to the discovery that conserved genes in humans are ALS genetic risk factors. While it is still unknown how TDP-43 is associated with toxicity, several studies find that TDP-43 alters mitochondrial function. We now report that TDP-43 is much more toxic when yeast is grown in non-fermentable media requiring respiration than when grown on fermentable carbon sources. However, we also establish that TDP-43 remains toxic in the absence of respiration. Thus, there is a TDP-43 toxicity target in yeast distinct from respiration and respiration is not required for this toxicity. Since we find that H2O2 increases the toxicity of TDP-43, the free oxygen radicals associated with respiration could likewise enhance the toxicity of TDP-43. In this case, the TDP-43 toxicity targets in the presence or absence of respiration could be identical, with the free radical oxygen species produced by respiration activating TDP-43 to become more toxic or making TDP-43 targets more vulnerable.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LITDP-43 toxicity and aggregation is enhanced when yeast are grown in media that requires respiration.\\nC_LIO_LIRespiration is not the sole target of TDP-43 toxicity because TDP-43 still aggregates and is toxic in cells that are not respiring.\\nC_LIO_LIHydrogen peroxide enhances TDP-43 toxicity in the absence of respiration suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by respiration may likewise enhance TDP-43 toxicity.\\nC_LIO_LIROS could activate TDP-43 to become more toxic or make TDP-43 targets more vulnerable.\\nC_LI\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/415893_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@85d24aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b103d3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72280dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3a82e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Chromosome segregation requires kinetochores to attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. Proper attachments come under tension and are stabilized, but defective attachments lacking tension are released, giving another chance for correct attachments to form. This error correction process requires the Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates kinetochores to destabilize microtubule attachments. However, the mechanism by which Aurora B can distinguish kinetochore tension remains unclear because it is difficult to detect kinase-triggered detachment and manipulate kinetochore tension in vivo. To address these challenges, we developed an optical trapping-based flow assay with soluble Aurora B and reconstituted kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Strikingly, we found that tension on these attachments suppressed their Aurora B-triggered release, suggesting that tension-dependent changes in the conformation of kinetochores can regulate Aurora B activity or its outcome. Our work uncovers the basis for a key mechano-regulatory event that ensures accurate segregation and may inform studies of other mechanically regulated enzymes.",

Endothelial cells of the cerebral vessels of 3-5d post fertilisation embryos extruded large membranous spherical structures. These were only found on the cerebral vessels, and did not detach from the parent vessel, instead regressing back into the endothelial cell. These structures did not communicate with the vessel lumen, exhibited periodic oscillations in size and shape, and were enriched with filamentous actin at their neck.

    "abstract": "Proteins associated with familial neurodegenerative disease often aggregate in patients neurons. Several such proteins, e.g. TDP-43, aggregate and are toxic when expressed in yeast. Deletion of the ATXN2 ortholog, PBP1, reduces yeast TDP-43 toxicity, which led to identification of ATXN2 as an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) risk factor and therapeutic target. Likewise, new yeast neurodegenerative disease models could facilitate identification of other risk factors and targets. Mutations in SS18L1, encoding the calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) chromatin-remodeling protein, are associated with ALS. We show that CREST is toxic in yeast and forms nuclear and occasionally cytoplasmic foci that stain with Thioflavin-T, a dye indicative of amyloid-like protein. Like the yeast chromatin-remodeling factor SWI1, CREST inhibits silencing of FLO genes. Toxicity of CREST is enhanced by the [PIN+] prion and reduced by deletion of the HSP104 chaperone required for the propagation of many yeast prions. Likewise, deletion of PBP1 reduced CREST toxicity and aggregation. In accord with the yeast data, we show that the Drosophila ortholog of human ATXN2, dAtx2, is a potent enhancer of CREST toxicity. Downregulation of dAtx2 in flies overexpressing CREST in retinal ganglion cells was sufficient to largely rescue the severe degenerative phenotype induced by human CREST. Overexpression caused considerable co-localization of CREST and PBP1/ATXN2 in cytoplasmic foci in both yeast and mammalian cells. Thus, co-aggregation of CREST and PBP1/ATXN2 may serve as one of the mechanisms of PBP1/ATXN2-mediated toxicity. These results extend the spectrum of ALS associated proteins whose toxicity is regulated by PBP1/ATXN2, suggesting that therapies targeting ATXN2 may be effective for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMutations in the calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) protein have been shown to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we show that the human CREST protein expressed in yeast forms largely nuclear aggregates and is toxic. We also show that the HSP104 chaperone required for propagation of yeast prions is likewise required for CREST toxicity. Furthermore deletion of HSP104 affects CREST aggregation. ATXN2, previously shown to modify ALS toxicity caused by mutations in the TDP-43 encoding gene, also modifies toxicity of CREST expressed in either yeast or flies. In addition, deletion of the yeast ATXN2 ortholog reduces CREST aggregation. These results extend the spectrum of ALS associated proteins whose toxicity is regulated by ATXN2, suggesting that therapies targeting ATXN2 may be effective for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The importance of cell surfaces in the self-assembly of proteins is widely accepted. One biologically significant event is the assembly of amyloidogenic proteins into aggregates, which leads to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. The interaction of amyloidogenic proteins with cellular membranes appears to dramatically facilitate the aggregation process. Recent findings indicate that, in the presence of surfaces, aggregation occurs at physiologically low concentrations, suggesting interaction with surfaces plays a critical role in the disease-prone aggregation process. However, the molecular mechanisms behind on-surface aggregation remain unclear. Here we provide a theoretical model that offers a molecular explanation. According to this model, monomers transiently immobilized to surfaces increase the local monomer protein concentration and thus work as nuclei to dramatically accelerate the entire aggregation process. This theory was verified by experimental studies, using mica surfaces, to examine the aggregation kinetics of amyloidogenic-synuclein protein (-Syn) and non-amyloidogenic cytosine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G).",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450s are ubiquitous metalloenzymes involved in the metabolism and detoxification of foreign components via catalysis of the hydroxylation reactions of a vast array of organic substrates. However, despite the breadth of cytochrome P450 mediated reactions, a long-standing question is: How does the substrate, in the first place, access the catalytic center of cytochrome P450? The prevalence of conflicting crystallographic evidences of both closed and open catalytic center in the substrate-free and substrate-bound cytochrome P450 has given rise to a notion of conformational heterogeneity, which makes the plausible mechanism of substrate recognition by cytochrome P450 puzzling from structural point of view. Here we report multi-microsecond-long unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, which are able to capture the spontaneous process of binding of substrate from bulk solvent to the occluded catalytic center of an archetypal system cytochrome P450cam, at an atomistic precision. In all binding trajectories, the substrate enters through a single channel, where it makes its first contact with the protein-surface and subsequently dwells in a highly long-lived intermediate state, before sliding into the catalytic center of P450cam. The simulated substrate-bound pose and crystallographic pose are in excellent agreement. Contrary to the prevalent hypotheses, our results indicate that a large-scale opening of F/G loop of P450cam is not required for passage of substrate to the catalytic center. Rather, we find that a substrate-induced side-chain displacement of Phe87 residue, coupled with a complex array of dynamical interconversions of multiple metastable substrate conformations along the entry channel, drives the substrate recognition in P450cam. By reconciling multiple precedent investigations, this work put forward an unambiguous view of the substrate recognition mechanism in deep buried cavity of cytochrome P450.",

However, the mechanisms underlying AXL overexpression in resistance to BYL719 remain elusive. Here we demonstrated that the AP-1 transcription factors, c-JUN and c-FOS, regulate AXL overexpression in HNSCC and ESCC. The expression of AXL was correlated with that of c-JUN both in HNSCC patients and in HNSCC and ESCC cell lines. Silencing of c-JUN and c-FOS expression in tumor cells downregulated AXL expression and enhanced the sensitivity of human papilloma virus positive (HPVPos) and negative (HPVNeg) tumor cells to BYL719 in vitro. Blocking of the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) using SP600125 in combination with BYL719 showed a synergistic anti-proliferative effect in vitro, which was accompanied by AXL downregulation and potent inhibition of the mTOR pathway. In vivo, the BYL719-SP600125 drug combination led to the arrest of tumor growth in cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, and in syngeneic head and neck murine cancer models. Collectively, our data suggests that JNK inhibition in combination with anti-PI3K therapy is a new therapeutic strategy that should be tested in HPVPos and HPVNeg HNSCC and ESCC patients.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical microenvironment serves as an important factor influencing stem cell differentiation. Mechanobiological responses depend strongly on actomyosin contractility and integrin-based cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions mediated by adhesive structures such as focal adhesions (FAs). While the roles of FAs in mechanobiology have been intensively studied in many mesenchymal and migratory cell types, recently it has been recognized that certain pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) exhibited significantly attenuated FA-mediated mechanobiological responses. FAs in such PSCs are sparsely distributed and much less prominent in comparison to \\\"classical\\\" FAs of typical adherent cells. Despite these differences, insights into how FAs in PSCs are structurally organized to perform their functions are still elusive. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to study PSC-ECM interactions, here we surveyed the molecular composition and nanostructural organization of FAs. We found that despite being small in size, mESC FAs appeared to be compositionally mature, containing markers such as vinculin, zyxin, and -actinin, and dependent on myosin II contractility. Using super-resolution microscopy, we revealed that mESC FAs were organized into a conserved multilayer nanoscale architecture. However, the nanodomain organization was compressed in mESCs, with the force transduction layer spanning [~] 10 nm, significantly more compact than in FAs of other cell types. Furthermore, we found that the position and orientation of vinculin, a key mechanotransduction protein, were modulated in an ECM-dependent manner. Our analysis also revealed that while most core FA genes were expressed, the expression of LIM domain proteins was comparatively lower in PSCs. Altogether our results suggest that while core structural and mechanosensitive elements are operational in mESC FAs, their structural organization and regulatory aspects may diverge significantly from \\\"classical\\\" FAs, which may account for the attenuated mechanobiological responses of these cell types.",

    "abstract": "Through the process of symmetric cell division, one mother cell gives rise to two identical daughter cells. Many stem cells utilize asymmetric cell division (ACD) to produce a self-renewed stem cell and a differentiating daughter cell. Since both daughter cells inherit the identical genetic information during ACD, a crucial question concerns how non-genic factors could be inherited differentially to establish distinct cell fates. It has been hypothesized that epigenetic differences at sister centromeres could contribute to biased sister chromatid attachment and segregation. However, direct in vivo evidence has never been shown. Here, we report that a stem cell-specific  mitotic drive ensures biased sister chromatid attachment and segregation. We have found during stem cell ACD, sister centromeres become asymmetrically enriched with proteins involved in centromere specification and kinetochore function. Furthermore, we show that that temporally asymmetric microtubule activities direct polarized nuclear envelope breakdown, allowing for the preferential recognition and attachment of microtubules to asymmetric sister kinetochores and sister centromeres. This communication occurs in a spatiotemporally regulated manner. Abolishment of either the establishment of asymmetric sister centromeres or the asymmetric microtubule emanation results in randomized sister chromatid segregation, which leads to stem cell loss. Our results demonstrate that the cis-asymmetry at sister centromeres tightly coordinates with the trans-asymmetry from the mitotic machinery to allow for differential attachment and segregation of genetically identical yet epigenetically distinct sister chromatids. Together, these results provide the first direct in vivo mechanisms for partitioning epigenetically distinct sister chromatids in asymmetrically dividing stem cells, which opens a new direction to study how this mechanism could be used in other developmental contexts to achieve distinct cell fates through mitosis.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDuring Drosophila male germline stem cell asymmetric division, sister centromeres communicate with spindle microtubules for differential attachment and segregation of sister chromatids.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) is a basic, versatile and ubiquitous cellular signal controlling a wide variety of biological processes. A remarkable example is the steering of sea urchin spermatozoa towards the conspecific egg by a spatially and temporally orchestrated series of cytosolic [Ca2+]i spikes. Although this process has been an experimental paradigm for reproduction and sperm chemotaxis studies, the composition and regulation of the signalling network underlying the cytosolic calcium fluctuations are hitherto not fully understood. Here, we used a differential equations model of the signalling network to assess which set of channels can explain the characteristic envelop and temporal organisation of the [Ca2+]i-spike trains. The signalling network comprises an initial membrane hyperpolarisation/repolarisation produced by an upstream module triggered by the egg-released chemoattractant peptide, via receptor activation, cGMP synthesis and decay. Followed by downstream modules leading to pHi, voltage and [Ca2+]i fluctuations. The upstream module outputs were fitted to kinetic data on cGMP activity and early membrane potential changes measured in bulk cell populations. Two candidate modules featuring voltage-dependent Ca2+-channels link these outputs to the downstream dynamics and can independently explain the typical decaying envelop and the progressive spacing of the spikes. In the first module, [Ca2+]i-spike trains require the concerted action of a classical CaV-like channel and a potassium channel, BK (Slo1), whereas the second module relies on pHi-dependent, [Ca2+]i-inactivated CatSper dynamics alone. The model predicts that these two modules interfere with each other and produce unreasonable dynamics when present at similar proportions, which suggests that one may predominate over the other in vivo. To assess these alternatives, several quantitative predictions were derived from each module and confronted to experimental observations. We show that the [Ca2+]I dynamics observed experimentally after sustained alkalinisation can be reproduced by a model featuring the CatSper module but not by one including the pH-independent CaV and BK module. We conclude in favour of the module containing CatSper.",

Its unique features include a high electric field level within the biological tissue due to the resonance effect and a low power dissipation level, or a low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), in the body itself. Because of its large resonator volume together with non-contact coupling, the subject may be located anywhere within the coil over a longer period at moderate and safe electric field levels. The electric field effect does not depend on body position within the resonator. However, field penetration is deep anywhere within the body, including the extremities where muscles, bones, and peripheral tissues are mostly affected. A potential clinical application of this device is treatment of chronic pain. Substantial attention is paid to device safety; this includes both AC power safety and exposure of human subjects to electromagnetic fields. In the former case, we employ inductive coupling which eliminates a direct current path from AC power to the coil. Our design enhances overall device safety at any power level, even when operated under higher-power conditions. Human exposure to electromagnetic fields within the coil is evaluated by performing modeling with two independent numerical methods and with an anatomically realistic multi-tissue human phantom. We show that SAR levels within the body correspond to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) safety standards when the input power level of the amplifier driver does not exceed 3 kW. We also show that electric field levels generally comply with International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection safety standards if the input power level does not exceed 1.5 kW.",

As a result of examining preobese male homozygous mutant mice to investigate with the exclusion of the effect of obesity, hyperphagia with hyperleptinemina and insulin resistance caused by decreased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle were already observed, but the increased hepatic glucose production was not. To investigate whether the insulin resistance was caused by deletion of the Il33 gene, we treated these preobese homozygous mutant mice with recombinant IL-33 protein and noted a significant improvement in insulin resistance. Thus, insulin resistance in these homozygous mutant mice was caused, at least in part, by IL-33 deficiency, suggesting a favorable role of IL-33 for glucose metabolism in the skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFatigue is a common and disabling symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with a variety of direct and indirect influences, but remains poorly understood. Performance-based and self-report measures of fatigue are only weakly correlated and may have independent predictors. We adopted a multifactorial approach, utilising a measure of concurrent cognitive performance change in order to examine the clinical, psychological, and cognitive factors influencing subjective and objective fatigue in MS.\\n\\nMethodsSixty-one people with MS were assessed. Subjective fatigue was measured using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue Assessment Instrument, and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The Conners Continuous Performance Test 3 (CCPT3) and VAS were administered before and after two hours of cognitive testing, representing a period of cognitive effort. The differences in scores formed measures of objective performance fatigue and subjective fatigue change, respectively. We examined differences across baseline fatigue, fatigue change and performance change classifications, using regression analysis to uncover predictors of subjective fatigue and performance change.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81ec81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce44e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10e1bdeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147c5ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b831f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_FLOATNOTable 1.C_FLOATNO O_TABLECAPTIONDemographic and clinical features of the sample\\n\\nC_TABLECAPTION C_TBL ResultsDepression, sleep, and emotion-focused coping each predicted baseline fatigue and together explained 53.5% of variance.

The varying factors driving subjective and objective fatigue suggest that future studies need to take into account these disparate aspects when developing fatigue assessment tools. Targeting influential fatigue drivers such as psychological variables, and even using gender specific interventions may have the potential to improve the burden of fatigue and quality of life of people with MS.",

In the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, gametogenesis is induced either by N starvation or by growth with arginine as the sole N source. We showed that arginine cultures supported robust phototrophic growth, constitutively turned on N starvation-induced genes, and increased lipid droplets. The lipids accumulated in arginine cultures exhibited strong enrichment of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, a preferred characteristic of biodiesel precursors.

    "abstract": "Effector-specific cortical mechanisms can be difficult to establish using fMRI, in part because low time resolution might temporally conflate different signals related to target representation, motor planning, and motor execution. Here, we used an event-related fMRI protocol and a cue-separation paradigm to temporally separate these three major sensorimotor stages for saccades vs. reaches. In each trial, subjects (N=12) 1) briefly viewed a target 4-7{degrees} left or right of midline fixation on a touchscreen, followed by an 8 second delay (effector-independent target memory phase), 2) were instructed by an auditory cue to perform a reach or a saccade, followed by a second delay of 8 seconds (effector-specific planning phase), and finally 3) were prompted to move by reaching-to-touch or performing a saccade towards the remembered target (effector-specific execution phase). Our analysis of saccade and reach activation (vs. a non-spatial control task) revealed modest effector-agnostic target memory activity (left AG, bilateral mIPS) followed by independent effector parietofrontal sites and time courses during the motor components of the task, specifically: more medial (pIPS, mIPS, M1, and PMd) activity during both reach planning and execution, and more lateral (mIPS, AG, and FEF) activity only during saccade execution. These motor activations were bilateral, with a left (contralateral) preference for reach. A conjunction analysis revealed that left mIPS and right AG, PCu, SPOC, FEF/PMv and LOTC showed activation for both saccades and reaches. Overall, effector-preference contrasts (reach vs. saccade) revealed significantly more parietofrontal activation for reaches than saccades during both planning and execution, with the exception of FEF. Cross-correlation of reach, saccade, and reach-saccade activation through time revealed correlated activation both within and across effectors in each hemisphere, but with a tendency toward higher correlations in the right hemisphere, especially between the eye and hand. These results demonstrate substantially independent but temporally correlated cortical networks for human eye, hand, and eye-hand control, that follow explicit spatiotemporal rules for effector-specific timing, medial-lateral distribution, and hemispheric lateralization.",

    "abstract": "Accurate predictions of T-cell epitopes would be useful for designing vaccines, immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases, and improved protein therapies. The humoral immune response involves uptake of antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs), APC processing and presentation of peptides on MHC class II (pMHCII), and T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of pMHCII complexes. Most in silico methods predict only peptide-MHCII binding, resulting in significant over-prediction of CD4 T-cell epitopes. We present a method, ITCell, for prediction of T-cell epitopes within an input protein antigen sequence for given MHCII and TCR sequences. The method integrates information about three stages of the immune response pathway: antigen cleavage, MHCII presentation, and TCR recognition. First, antigen cleavage sites are predicted based on the cleavage profiles of cathepsins S, B, and H. Second, for each 12-mer peptide in the antigen sequence we predict whether it will bind to a given MHCII, based on the scores of modeled peptide-MHCII complexes. Third, we predict whether or not any of the top scoring peptide-MHCII complexes can bind to a given TCR, based on the scores of modeled ternary peptide-MHCII-TCR complexes and the distribution of predicted cleavage sites. Our benchmarks consist of epitope predictions generated by this algorithm, checked against 20 peptide-MHCII-TCR crystal structures, as well as epitope predictions for four peptide-MHCII-TCR complexes with known epitopes and TCR sequences but without crystal structures. ITCell successfully identified the correct epitopes as one of the 20 top scoring peptides for 22 of 24 benchmark cases. To validate the method using a clinically relevant application, we utilized five factor VIII-specific TCR sequences from hemophilia A subjects who developed an immune response to factor VIII replacement therapy. The known HLA-DR1-restricted factor VIII epitope was among the six top-scoring factor VIII peptides predicted by ITCall to bind HLA-DR1 and all five TCRs. Our integrative approach is more accurate than current single-stage epitope prediction algorithms applied to the same benchmarks. It is freely available as a web server (http://salilab.org/itcell).\\n\\nAuthor summaryKnowledge of T-cell epitopes is useful for designing vaccines, improving cancer immunotherapy, studying autoimmune diseases, and engineering protein replacement therapies. Unfortunately, experimental methods for identification of T-cell epitopes are slow, expensive, and not always applicable. Thus, a more accurate computational method for prediction of T-cell epitopes needs to be developed. While the T-cell response to extracellular antigens proceeds through multiple stages, current computational methods rely only on the prediction of peptide binding affinity to an MHCII receptor on antigen presenting cells, resulting in a relatively high number of false-positive predictions of T-cell epitopes within protein antigens. We developed an integrative approach to predict T-cell epitopes that computationally combines information from three stages of the humoral immune response pathway: antigen cleavage, MHCII presentation, and TCR recognition, resulting in an increased accuracy of epitope predictions. This method was applied to predict epitopes within blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) that were recognized by TCRs from hemophilia A subjects who developed an anti-FVIII antibody response. The correct epitope was predicted after modeling all possible 12-mer FVIII peptides bound in ternary complexes with the relevant MHCII (HLA-DR1) and each of five experimentally determined FVIII-specific TCR sequences.",

So far, very few studies have assessed the impact of different farming systems on the root microbiota and it is still unclear whether agricultural intensification influences network complexity of microbial communities. We investigated the impact of conventional, no-till and organic farming on wheat root fungal communities using PacBio SMRT sequencing on samples collected from 60 farmlands in Switzerland. Organic farming harboured a much more complex fungal network than conventional and no-till farming systems. The abundance of keystone taxa was the highest under organic farming where agricultural intensification was the lowest. The occurrence of keystone taxa was best explained by soil phosphorus levels, bulk density, pH and mycorrhizal colonization. The majority of keystone taxa are known to form arbuscular mycorrhizal associations with plants and belong to the orders Glomerales, Paraglomerales, and Diversisporales. Supporting this, the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in roots and soils was also significantly higher under organic farming. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report mycorrhizal keystone taxa for agroecosystems, and we demonstrate that agricultural intensification reduces network complexity and the abundance of keystone taxa in the root microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic chromosomes are often composed of components organized into multiple scales, such as nucleosomes, chromatin fibers, topologically associated domains (TAD), chromosome compartments, and chromosome territories. Therefore, reconstructing detailed 3D models of chromosomes in high resolution is useful for advancing genome research. However, the task of constructing quality highresolution 3D models is still challenging with existing methods. Hence, we designed a hierarchical algorithm, called Hierarchical3DGenome, to reconstruct 3D chromosome models at high resolution (<=5 Kilobase (KB)). The algorithm first reconstructs high-resolution 3D models at TAD level. The TAD models are then assembled to form complete high-resolution chromosomal models. The assembly of TAD models is guided by a complete low-resolution chromosome model. The algorithm is successfully used to reconstruct 3D chromosome models at 5KB resolution for the human B-cell (GM12878). These high-resolution models satisfy Hi-C chromosomal contacts well and are consistent with models built at lower (i.e. 1MB) resolution, and with the data of fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments.

We sought to determine the effect of environmental variability on the growth characteristics of pneumococcus and to evaluate correlations between variability in growth characteristics between strains and biological and epidemiological characteristics.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated the effect of temperature and oxygen on the growth of 256 pneumococcal isolates representing 53 serotypes, recovered from healthy carriers and from disease patients.

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a toxin-mediated disease. Several factors have been identified that influence the production of the two major C. difficile toxins, TcdA and TcdB, but prior published evidence suggested that additional unknown factors were involved in toxin regulation. Previously, we identified a C. difficile regulator, RstA, that promotes sporulation and represses motility and toxin production. We observed that the predicted DNA-binding domain of RstA was required for RstA-dependent repression of toxin genes, motility genes and rstA transcription. In this study, we further investigated the regulation of toxin and motility gene expression by RstA. DNA pulldown assays confirmed that RstA directly binds the rstA promoter via the predicted DNA-binding domain. Through mutational analysis of the rstA promoter, we identified several nucleotides that are important for RstA-dependent transcriptional regulation. Further, we observed that RstA directly binds and regulates the promoters of the toxin genes, tcdA and tcdB, as well as the promoters for the sigD and tcdR genes, which encode regulators of toxin gene expression. Complementation analyses with the Clostridium perfringens RstA ortholog and a multi-species chimeric RstA protein revealed that the C. difficile C-terminal domain is required for RstA DNA-binding activity, suggesting that species-specific signaling controls RstA function. Our data demonstrate that RstA is a transcriptional repressor that autoregulates its own expression and directly inhibits transcription of the two toxin genes and two positive toxin regulators, thereby acting at multiple regulatory points to control toxin production.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile is an anaerobic, gastrointestinal pathogen of humans and other mammals. C. difficile produces two major toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which cause the symptoms of the disease, and forms dormant endospores to survive the aerobic environment outside of the host. A recently discovered regulatory factor, RstA, inhibits toxin production and positively influences spore formation. Herein, we determine that RstA directly represses toxin gene expression and gene expression of two toxin gene activators, TcdR and SigD, creating a complex regulatory network to tightly control toxin production. In addition, the ability for RstA to bind DNA and repress toxin production requires the species-specific domain predicted to respond to small quorum-sensing peptides. This study provides a novel regulatory link between C. difficile sporulation and toxin production. Further, our data suggest that C. difficile toxin production is regulated through a direct sensing mechanism.",

However, commonly reads are also found within the transcript leader sequence (TLS) (aka 5 untranslated region) preceding the main open reading frame (ORF), which indicates the translation of regulatory upstream ORFs (uORFs). Here, we present a workflow for the identification of functional uORFs, which contribute to the translational regulation of their associated main ORFs. The workflow is available as free and open Snakemake workflow. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive human uORF annotation file, which can be used within the pipeline, thus reducing the runtime.

Short fragmented reads are the main source of data from 2nd-generation sequencing, and detecting structural variations from this type of data is different from that of 1st-generation sequencing, where the read length is much longer. Current detection methods are low in specificity and are inefficient. We developed a hybrid algorithm, FirstSV, to meet the clinical demand for fast and accurate structural variation detection. Its main features include cluster analysis, realignment, and local assembly.

    "abstract": "With the increasing impact of the global warming, occurrences of cyanobacterial blooms in aquatic ecosystems are becoming a main ecological concern around the world. Due to their capacity to produce potential toxic metabolites, interactions between the cyanobacteria/cyanotoxin complex and the other freshwater organisms have been widely studied in the past years. Non-targeted metabolomic analyses have the powerful capacity to study a high number of metabolites at the same time and thus to understand in depth the molecular interactions between various organisms in different environmental scenario and notably during cyanobacterial blooms. In this way during summer 2015, liver metabolomes of two fish species, sampled in peri-urban lakes of the ile-de-France region containing or not high concentrations of cyanobacteria, were studied. The results suggest that similar metabolome changes occur in both fish species exposed to cyanobacterial blooms compared to them not exposed. Metabolites implicated in protein synthesis, protection against ROS, steroid metabolism, cell signaling, energy storage and membrane integrity/stability have shown the most contrasted changes. Furthermore, it seems that metabolomic studies will provide new information and research perspectives in various ecological fields and notably concerning cyanobacteria/fish interactions but also a promising tool for environmental monitoring of water pollutions.",

    "abstract": "Pathway analysis is a very important aspect in computational systems biology as it serves as a crucial component in many computational pipelines. KEGG is one of the prominent databases that host pathway information associated with various organisms. In any pathway analysis pipelines, it is also important to collect and organize the pathway constituent genes for which a tool to automatically retrieve that would be a useful one to the practitioners. In this article, I present KPGminer, a tool that retrieves the constituent genes in KEGG pathways for various organisms and organizes that information suitable for many downstream pathway analysis pipelines. We exploited several KEGG web services using REST APIs, particularly GET and LIST methods to request for the information retrieval which is available for developers. Moreover, KPGminer can operate both for a particular pathway (single mode) or multiple pathways (batch mode). Next, we designed a crawler to extract necessary information from the response and generated outputs accordingly. KPGminer brings several key features including organism-specific and pathway-specific extraction of pathway genes from KEGG and always up-to-date information. Thus, we hope KPGminer can be a useful and effective tool to make downstream pathway analysis easier and faster.

Yet, there are only few studies that propose algorithms on this particularly important research field.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we first overview the current literature and define two general terms for the types of approaches in general for gene level cell-to-cell communications: Gene Regulatory Cross Networks (GRCN) and Gene Co-Expression Cross Networks (GCCN). We then propose two algorithms for each type, named as GRCNone and GCCNone. We applied them to reveal communications among 8 different immune cell types and evaluate their performances mainly via membrane protein database. Also, we show the biological relevance of the predicted cross-networks with pathway enrichment analysis. We then provide an approach that prioritize the targets by ranking them before experimental validations.\\n\\nConclusionsWe establish two main approaches and propose algorithms for genome-wide scale gene level cell-to-cell communications between any two different cell-types. This study aims accelerating this relatively new avenue of research in cross-networks and points out the gap of it with the well-established single cell type gene networks. The proposed algorithms have the potential to reveal gene level interactions between normal and disease cell types. For instance, they might reveal the interaction of genes between tumor and normal cells, which are the potential drug-targets and thus can help finding new cures that might prevent the prevailing of tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are proteo-liposomes universally shed by Gram-negative bacteria. Their secretion is significantly enhanced by the transition into the intra-host milieu and OMVs have been shown to play critical roles during pathogenesis. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 (EHEC), causes diarrheal disease in humans, and soluble toxins including Shiga-like toxins that contribute to disease severity and clinical complications including hemolytic uremic syndrome, have been shown to be OMV associated. In addition to Shiga-like toxins, EHEC produces a type III secretion system (T3SS), and T3SS effectors are associated with colonization and disease severity in vivo. Here, we show that type III secreted substrates including translocators and effectors are incorporated into OMVs independent of type III secretion activity. EHEC strains with non-functional type III secretion systems shed more OMVs and vesicles enter host cells with accelerated kinetics compared to vesicles shed from wild type EHEC. The T3SS effector translocated intimin receptor (Tir) is trafficked from OMVs into host cells and localizes to the membrane. However, its clustering on the host membrane and co-localization with bacterial pedestals is intimin-dependent. We further show that OMV-delivered Tir can cross-complement an effector-deficient EHEC strain, demonstrating that OMV-associated effectors reach the host cell in a biologically intact form. Finally, we observe that the non-LEE encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase effector NleL is also trafficked to host cells via OMVs, where it ubiquitinylates its target kinase JNK. Together, these data demonstrate that trafficking of OMV-associated effectors is a novel and T3SS-independent pathway for the delivery of active effectors to host cells.",

    "abstract": "Dichlorvos, is a broad-spectrum organophosphorus pesticide that is widely applied in the agricultural industry and considered a pollutant to fish and bees. T. atroviride strain T23, an efficient DDVP-degrading strain, could convert DDVP to dichloroacetic acid, 2,2-dichloroethanol and phosphoric acid through mineralization. RT-qPCR analysis showed TaPon1-like encoding an organophosphorus hydrolase, is continuously highly expressed in the process of degrading DDVP. TaPon1-like contained an open reading frame of 1317 bp, and the deduced amino acid sequence shared 21% homology with HuPON1, which also exhibits excellent hydrolysis of organophosphate-oxons compounds. By analysis of gene knockout, we found the {Delta}TaPon1-like knockout strain KO1 lost 35.6% of its DDVP-degradation capacity at 24 h, but this loss of degradation activity was recovered when the gene was complemented. Furthermore, the purified recombinant protein reTAPON1-LIKE, could transform DDVP only to dimethyl phosphate and showed significant paraoxonase activity (1028 U L-1). The reTAPON1-LIKE enzyme showed a broad degradation spectrum, degrading not only DDVP but also organophosphate-oxons and lactone. The kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) of the purified reTAPON1-LIKE were determined to be 0.23 mM and 204.3 s-1 for DDVP, respectively. The highest activity was obtained at 35 {degrees}C, and the optimal pH was 8.5. The activity of reTAPON1-LIKE was enhanced most significantly when 1.0 mM Ca2+ was added but declined when 1.0 mM Cu2+ was added. These results showed TAPON1-LIKE play an important role for DDVP degradation in the first step by T23 and provided clue to comprehensively understanding the degradation mechanism of organophosphate-oxons pesticides by filamentous fungi.\\n\\nImportanceThe large amounts of residues of organophosphate pesticides in agroecological system has become a great threat to the safety of environment and humans. Bioremediation in association with microbial is innovative technology having a potential to alleviate such pollution problems. The genus Trichoderma is genetically diverse with capabilities to degrade chemical pesticides among different strains with agricultural significance. As a typical organophosphorus pesticide, it is one of the most employed compounds of the family. Though it was classified as a highly toxic pesticide by WHO due to its hazardous properties, it plays an important role in the control of plant pests, food storage and homes, as well as to treat infections in livestock. Therefore, we use DDVP as a model of organophosphate pesticide to study the mechanism of Trichoderma degrading organophosphate pesticides, for the aim of globally understanding molecular mechanism of enzymatic degradation of organophosphate pesticides by beneficial fungi.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater sponges (Spongillida) are a unique lineage of demosponges that secondarily colonized lakes and rivers and are now found ubiquitously in these ecosystems. They developed specific adaptations to freshwater systems, including the ability to survive extreme thermal ranges, long-lasting dessication, anoxia, and resistance to a variety of pollutants. While spongillids have colonized all freshwater systems, the family Lubomirskiidae is endemic to Lake Baikal, and plays a range of key roles in this ecosystem. Our work compares the genomic content and microbiome of individuals of three species of the Lubomirskiidae, providing hypotheses for how molecular evolution has allowed them to adapt to their unique environments. We have sequenced deep (>92% of the metazoan  Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) set) transcriptomes from three species of Lubomirskiidae and a draft genome resource for Lubomirskia baikalensis. We note Baikal sponges contain unicellular algal and bacterial symbionts, as well as the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium. We investigated molecular evolution, gene duplication and novelty in freshwater sponges compared to marine lineages. Sixty one orthogroups have consilient evidence of positive selection. Transporters (e.g. zinc transporter-2), transcription factors (aristaless-related homeobox) and structural proteins (for example actin-3), alongside other genes, are under strong evolutionary pressure in freshwater, with duplication driving novelty across the Spongillida, but especially in the Lubomirskiidae. This addition to knowledge of freshwater sponge genetics provides a range of tools for understanding the molecular biology and, in the future, the ecology (for example, colonization and migration patterns) of these key species.",

HIV proviral load was higher among patients with detectable episomal DNA (p=0.01). Individuals receiving initial PI-r treatment presented lower HIV antibodies (p=0.027) and LPS (p=0.029) than individuals receiving NNRTI.

Residual replication may decrease with longer periods of suppressive ART and higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The relationship between episomal DNA and total DNA suggests a replenishment of the proviral reservoir with impacts on HIV persistence. Lower antibody and LPS levels among patients with initial PI-r ART suggest these regimens may more effectively suppress HIV with higher capacity to decrease the HIV antigenic component.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis (NE) has reemerged as a prevalent chicken disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics. The lack of antimicrobial alternative strategies to control NE is mainly due to limited insight into the disease pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of microbiota metabolic product secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) on preventing NE. C. perfringens growth was inhibited by 82.8% in 50 M DCA Tryptic Soy Broth. Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges induced acute NE showed as severe intestinal inflammation and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens, while 1.5 g/kg DCA diet dramatically reduced the disease. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum without altering the bacterial ileal luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA reduced inflammatory mediators of Inf{gamma}, Litaf, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Inf{gamma}, Litaf, Mmp9, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Blocking COX signaling by pharmacological inhibitor aspirin attenuated INF{gamma}-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced ileal inflammation, intestinal cell apoptosis, and BW loss. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced ileal inflammation and BW loss through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings offer new strategies against C. perfringens-induced diseases.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWidespread antimicrobial resistance has become a serious challenge to both agricultural and healthcare industries. Withdrawing antimicrobials without effective alternatives exacerbates chicken productivity loss at billions of dollars every year, caused by intestinal diseases, such as coccidiosis-and C. perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis. This study revealed that microbial metabolic product secondary bile acid DCA prevents C. perfringens-induced intestinal disease in chickens through modulating inflammatory COX signaling pathways. Therefore, microbiome and its downstream targets of host inflammatory responses could be used to control NE. These findings have opened new avenues for developing novel antimicrobial free alternatives to prevent or treat C. perfringens-induced diseases.",

    "abstract": "In all animals, sexual differentiation of somatic tissue is precisely timed, yet the molecular mechanisms that control the timing of sexual differentiation, particularly in the brain, are poorly understood. We have used sexually dimorphic molecular, anatomical and behavioral features of the C. elegans nervous system to decipher a regulatory pathway that controls the precise timing of sexual differentiation. We find that the sexually dimorphic differentiation of postmitotic neurons in the male nervous system is abrogated in animals that carry a mutation in the miRNA let-7 and prematurely executed in animals either lacking the let-7 inhibitor lin-28, or the direct let-7 target lin-41, an RNA-binding, posttranscriptional regulator. We show that an isoform of a phylogenetically conserved transcription factor, lin-29a, is a critical target of LIN-41 in controlling sexual maturation of sex-shared neurons. lin-29a is expressed in a male-specific manner in a subset of sex-shared neurons at the onset of sexual maturation. lin-29a acts cell-autonomously in these neurons to control the expression of sexually dimorphic neurotransmitter switches, sensory receptor expression, neurite anatomy and connectivity, and locomotor behavior. lin-29a is not only required but also sufficient to impose male-specific features at earlier stages of development and in the opposite sex. The temporal, sexual and spatial specificity of lin-29a expression is controlled intersectionally through the lin-28/let-7/lin-41 heterochronic pathway, sex chromosome configuration and neuron type-specific terminal selector transcription factors. Two Doublesex-like transcription factors represent additional neuron-type specific targets of LIN-41 and are regulated in a similar intersectional manner, indicating the existence of modular outputs downstream of the heterochronic pathway. In conclusion, we have provided insights into the molecular logic of the timing of sexual differentiation in the C. elegans nervous system. Remarkably, the lin28/let7 axis also controls the timing of sexual differentiation in mice and humans thereby hinting toward a striking universality of the control mechanisms of sexual differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The origin and fate of new mutations within species is the fundamental process underlying evolution. However, while much attention has been focused on characterizing the presence, frequency, and phenotypic impact of genetic variation, the evolutionary histories of most variants are largely unexplored. We have developed a non-parametric approach for estimating the date of origin of genetic variants in large-scale sequencing data sets. The accuracy and robustness of the approach is demonstrated through simulation. Using data from two publicly available human genomic diversity resources, we estimated the age of more than 45 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome and release the Atlas of Variant Age as a public online database. We characterize the relationship between variant age and frequency in different geographical regions, and demonstrate the value of age information in interpreting variants of functional and selective importance. Finally, we use allele age estimates to power a rapid approach for inferring the ancestry shared between individual genomes, to quantify genealogical relationships at different points in the past, as well as describe and explore the evolutionary history of modern human populations.",

    "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling regulates many different developmental and homeostatic processes in metazoans. The BMP pathway is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans, and is known to regulate body size and mesoderm development. We have identified the C. elegans smoc-1 (Secreted MOdular Calcium binding protein-1) gene as a new player in the BMP pathway. smoc-1(0) null mutants have a small body size, while overexpression of smoc-1 led to a long body size and increased expression of the RAD-SMAD BMP reporter, suggesting that SMOC-1 acts as a positive modulator of BMP signaling. Using double mutant analysis, we showed that SMOC-1 antagonizes the function of the glypican LON-2 and acts through the BMP ligand DBL-1 to regulate BMP signaling. Moreover, SMOC-1 appears to specifically regulate BMP signaling without significant involvement in a TGF{beta}-like pathway that regulates dauer development. We found that smoc-1 is expressed in multiple tissues, including cells of the pharynx, intestine, and posterior hypodermis, and that the expression of smoc-1 in the intestine is positively regulated by BMP signaling. We further established that SMOC-1 functions cell non-autonomously to regulate body size. Human SMOC1 and SMOC2 can each partially rescue the smoc-1(0) mutant phenotype, suggesting that SMOC-1s function in modulating BMP signaling is evolutionarily conserved. Together, our findings highlight a conserved role of SMOC proteins in modulating BMP signaling in metazoans.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYBMP signaling is critical for development and homeostasis in metazoans, and is under tight regulation. We report the identification and characterization of a Secreted MOdular Calcium binding protein SMOC-1 as a positive modulator of BMP signaling in C. elegans. We established that SMOC-1 antagonizes the function of LON-2/glypican and acts through the DBL-1/BMP ligand to promote BMP signaling. We identified smoc-1-expressing cells, and demonstrated that SMOC-1 acts cell non-autonomously and in a positive feedback loop to regulate BMP signaling. We also provide evidence suggesting that the function of SMOC proteins in the BMP pathway is conserved from worms to humans.",

We identify somatic mutations using a newly developed pipeline, RNA-MuTect, for calling somatic mutations directly from RNA-seq samples and their matched-normal DNA. When applied to the GTEx dataset, we detect multiple variants across different tissues and find that mutation burden is associated with both the age of the individual and tissue proliferation rate.

    "abstract": "Inflammation in autoimmune disease is mediated by a complex network of interacting cells. Their identity and cross-talk are encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA). Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), a chronic autoimmune arthritis of childhood, is characterised by synovial inflammation with infiltration of both innate and adaptive immune cells1. Activated T cells play a role in disease2 but the cell types that drive the recruitment and activation of immune cells within the synovium are not known. Here, we utilised droplet-based and full length single cell mRNA sequencing to obtain a quantitative map of the cellular landscape of JIA. We studied 45,715 cells from the synovial fluid of inflamed knee joints and peripheral blood. We identified a population of synovial innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), shared across patients, that exhibited a unique transcriptional profile in comparison to canonical ILC subtypes. Validation at protein-level across a spectrum of autoimmune arthritides revealed that these ILCs are pathologically expanded in a particular type of JIA. Using statistical tools to assess cellular interactions in synovial fluid, ILCs emerged as a central node of communication, expressing the full repertoire of genes required to orchestrate and maintain the inflammatory milieu. Several ILC-mediated signalling pathways may lend themselves as novel therapeutic targets. Together our findings demonstrate a distinct ILC subtype associated with a tissue-specific childhood autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "Unilateral or bilateral corticospinal tract injury in the pyramids of adult rats causes changes in proprioceptive axon terminal arborization in the cervical spinal cord accompanied by hyperreflexia and abnormal movements including spasms [1, 2]. Treatment of affected forelimb muscles with an Adeno-Associated Viral Vector (AAV) encoding human neurotrophin-3 (NT3) normalizes many of these anatomical, neurophysiological and behavioural changes [1]. Interestingly, in several studies, neurotrophin-3 protein accumulates in cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG) on the side ipsilateral to AAV injection [1, 3]. We hypothesize that neurotrophin-3 induces these changes (in proprioceptive axon wiring, proprioceptive reflex neurophysiology and sensorimotor behaviors involving proprioception) by modifying gene expression in affected cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG). As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we analyzed the transcriptomes of cervical DRGs obtained during a previous study from naive rats and from rats after bilateral pyramidotomy (bPYX) with unilateral intramuscular injections of either AAV1-CMV-NT3 or AAV1-CMV-EGFP made 24h after injury [1]. Ten weeks after surgery, Poly(A) RNAs and small RNAs from C6 to C8 DRGs on the treated side were sequenced. We detected mRNAs or small RNAs that were significantly regulated under three conditions (bPYX+GFP vs naive; bPYX+NT3 versus naive; bPYX+NT3 vs bPYX+GFP). We identified mRNAs and small RNAs whose expression level was altered after pyramidotomy and normalized by neurotrophin-3 treatment. A bioinformatic analysis enabled us to identify genes that are likely to be expressed in proprioceptors after injury and which were regulated by neurotrophin-3 in the direction expected from other datasets involving knockout or overexpression of neurotrophin-3. This dataset will help us and others identify genes in sensory neurons whose expression levels are regulated by neurotrophin-3 treatment. This may help identify novel therapeutic targets to improve sensation and movement after neurological injury. Data has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE82197).",

Such fragmentation has been reported to impact a small fraction of the tRNA pool and thus presumed to not directly impact translation. We report that oxidative stress can rapidly generate tyrosine tRNAGUA fragments in human cells--causing significant depletion of the precursor tRNA. Tyrosine tRNAGUA depletion impaired translation of growth and metabolic genes enriched in cognate tyrosine codons. Depletion of tyrosine tRNAGUA or its translationally regulated targets USP3 and SCD repressed proliferation--revealing a dedicated tRNA-regulated growth suppressive pathway for oxidative stress response. Tyrosine fragments are generated in a DIS3L2 exoribonuclease-dependent manner and inhibit hnRNPA1-mediated transcript destabilization. Moreover, tyrosine fragmentation is conserved in C. elegans. Thus, tRNA fragmentation can coordinately generate trans-acting small-RNAs and functionally deplete a tRNA.

Each colorectal crypt is a small clone of cells derived from a single recently-existing stem cell. Here, we whole genome sequenced hundreds of normal crypts from 42 individuals. Signatures of multiple mutational processes were revealed, some ubiquitous and continuous, others only found in some individuals, in some crypts or during some phases of the cell lineage from zygote to adult cell. Likely driver mutations were present in [~]1% of normal colorectal crypts in middle-aged individuals, indicating that adenomas and carcinomas are rare outcomes of a pervasive process of neoplastic change across morphologically normal colorectal epithelium.",

This model, which we call Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models, and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on ChIP-seq data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity and predicts the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity.

We then wished to define the expected rate of plausibly causative variants coming through strict filtering in control in comparison to disease populations to quantify background diagnostic \\\"noise\\\".\\n\\nMethodsWe developed G2P (www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype) as an online system to facilitate the development, validation, curation and distribution of large-scale, evidence-based datasets for use in diagnostic variant filtering. Each locus-genotype-mechanism-disease-evidence thread (LGMDET) associates an allelic requirement and a mutational consequence at a defined locus with a disease entity and a confidence level and evidence links. We then developed an extension to Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), VEP-G2P, which can filter based on G2P other widely used gene panel curation systems. We compared the output of disease-associated and control whole exome sequence (WES) using Developmental Disorders G2P (G2PDD; 2044 LGMDETs) and constitutional cancer predisposition G2P (G2PCancer; 128 LGMDETs).\\n\\nResultsWe have shown a sensitivity/precision of 97.3%/33% and 81.6%/22.7% for causative de novo and inherited variants respectively using VEP-G2PDD in DDD study probands WES.

    "abstract": "Although the cellular and molecular responses to exposure to relatively high temperatures (acute thermal stress or heat shock) have been studied previously, only sparse empirical evidence of how it affects cold-water species is available. As climate change becomes more pronounced in areas such as the Western Antarctic Peninsula, it has become crucial to understand the capacity of these species to respond to thermal stress.\n\nHere we use the Antarctic sponge Isodictya sp. to investigate how sessile organisms (particularly Porifera) can adjust to acute short-term heat stress, by exposing this species to 3 and 5 {degrees}C for 4 hours, corresponding to predicted temperatures under high-end 2080 IPCC-SRES scenarios. Assembling a de novo reference transcriptome (90,188 contigs, >93.7% metazoan BUSCO genes) we have begun to discern the molecular componentry employed by Isodictya to adjust to environmental insult.\n\nOur initial analyses suggest that TGF-{beta}, ubiquitin and hedgehog cascades are involved, alongside other genes. However, the degree and type of response changed little from 3 to 5 {degrees}C, suggesting that even moderate rises in temperature could cause stress at the limits of this organisms capacity. Given the importance of sponges to Antarctic ecosystems, our findings are vital for discerning the consequences of increases in Antarctic ocean temperature on these and other species.",

    "abstract": "Microbial biofilms are important in natural ecosystems and in biotechnological applications. Biofilm architecture influences organisms spatial positions, who their neighbors are, and redox gradients, which in turn determine functions. We ask if and how biofilm thickness influences community composition, architecture and functions. But biofilm thickness cannot easily be isolated from external environmental factors. We designed a metacommunity system in a wastewater treatment plant, where either 50 or 400 {micro}m thick nitrifying biofilms were grown simultaneously on biofilm carriers in the same reactor. Model simulations showed that the 50 {micro}m biofilms could be fully oxygenated whereas the 400 {micro}m biofilms contained anaerobic zones. The 50 and 400 {micro}m biofilms developed significantly different communities. due to deterministic factors were stronger than homogenizing dispersal forces in the reactor, despite the fact that biofilms experienced the same history and external conditions. Relative abundance of aerobic nitrifiers was higher in the 50 {micro}m biofilms, while anaerobic ammonium oxidizers were more abundant in the 400 {micro}m biofilms. However, turnover was larger than the nestedness component of between-group beta-diversity, i.e. the 50 {micro}m biofilm was not just a subset of the thicker 400 {micro}m biofilm with reduced taxa richness. Furthermore, the communities had different nitrogen transformation rates. The study shows that biofilm thickness has a strong impact on community composition and ecosystem function, which has implications for biotechnological applications, and for our general understanding of biofilms.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMicroorganisms colonize all surfaces in water and form biofilms. Diffusion limitations form steep gradients of energy and nutrient sources from the water phase into the deeper biofilm parts, influencing community composition through the biofilm. Thickness of the biofilm will affect diffusion gradients, and is therefore presumably important for biofilm composition. Since environmental factors determine thickness, studies of how thickness influences biofilm functions and community assembly, have been difficult to perform. We studied biofilms for wastewater treatment with fixed thicknesses of 50 and 400 {micro}m during otherwise similar conditions and history. Despite growing in the same wastewater reactor, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and confocal microscopy showed the formation of two different communities, performing different ecosystem functions. Using statistical methods, we show for the first time, how biofilm thickness influences community assembly. The results help our understanding of the ecology of microbial biofilms, and in designing engineered systems based on ecological principles.",
