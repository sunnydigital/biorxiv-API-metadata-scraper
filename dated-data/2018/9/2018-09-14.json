    "abstract": "We present physico-chemical based model grounded in population genetics. Our model predicts the stationary probability of observing an amino acid residue at a given site. Its predictions are based on the physico-chemical properties of the inferred optimal residue at that site and the sensitivity of the proteins functionality to deviation from the physico-chemical optimum at that site. We contextualize our physico-chemical model by comparing our model fit and parameters it to the more general, but less biologically meaningful entropy based metric: site sensitivity or 1/E. We show mathematically that our physico-chemical model is a more restricted form of the entropy model and how 1/E is proportional to the log-likelihood of a parameter-wise  saturated model. Next, we fit both our physico-chemical and entropy models to sequences for subtype Cs Gag poly-protein in the LANL HIV database. Comparing our models site sensitivity parameters G' to 1/E we find they are highly correlated. We also compare the ability of G', 1/E, and other indirect measures of HIV fitness to empirical in vitro and in vivo measures. We find G' does a slightly better job predicting empirical fitness measures of in vivo viral escape time and in vitro spreading rates. While our predictive gain is modest, our model can be modified to test more complex or alternative biological hypotheses. More generally, because of its explicit biological formulation, our model can be easily extended to test for stabilizing vs. diversifying selection. We conjecture that our model could also be extended include epistasis in a more realistic manner than Ising models, while requiring many fewer parameters than Potts models.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota are shaped by a combination of ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in [~]30 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over [~]6 month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps are seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.",

    "abstract": "Decision bias is traditionally conceptualized as an internal reference against which sensory evidence is compared. Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation towards a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation towards target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2-6 Hz (theta) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8--12 Hz (alpha) power in posterior cortex. The alpha suppression in turn mediated the output activity of visual cortex, as expressed in 59--100 Hz (gamma) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation towards the decision bound that maximizes their reward.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale population based analyses coupled with advances in technology have demonstrated that the human genome is more diverse than originally thought. To date, this diversity has largely been uncovered using short read whole genome sequencing. However, standard short-read approaches, used primarily due to accuracy, throughput and costs, fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify large, balanced structural events, cannot access repetitive regions of the genome and fail to resolve the human genome into its two haplotypes. Here we describe an approach that retains long range information while harnessing the advantages of short reads. Starting from only [~]1ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries. The use of novel informatic approaches allows for the barcoded short reads to be associated with the long molecules of origin producing a novel datatype known as  Linked-Reads. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single Linked-Read library. We have previously demonstrated the utility of whole genome Linked-Reads (lrWGS) for performing diploid, de novo assembly of individual genomes (Weisenfeld et al. 2017). In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short read approaches for reference based analysis. We demonstrate the ability of Linked-Reads to reconstruct megabase scale haplotypes and to recover parts of the genome that are typically inaccessible to short reads, including phenotypically important genes such as STRC, SMN1 and SMN2. We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone.",

    "abstract": "Culture-based methods to measure Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used by beach administrators to inform whether bacteria levels represent an elevated risk to swimmers. Since results take up to 12 hours, statistical models are used to forecast bacteria levels in lieu of test results; however they underestimate days with elevated fecal indicator bacteria levels. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests return results within 3 hours but are 2 to 5 times more expensive than culture-based methods. This paper presents a prediction model which uses limited deployments of qPCR tested sites with inter-beach correlation to predict when bacteria will exceed acceptable thresholds. The model can be used to inform management decisions on when to warn residents or close beaches due to exposure to the bacteria. Using data from Chicago collected between 2006 and 2016, the model proposed in this paper increased sensitivity from 3.4 percent to 11.2 percent-a 230 percent increase. We find that the correlation between beaches are substantial enough to provide higher levels of precision and sensitivity to predictive models. Thus, limited deployments of qPCR testing can be used to deliver better predictions for beach administrators at lower cost and less complexity.",

    "abstract": "Growing interest surrounds transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a safe and inexpensive method for improving cognitive functions and mood. Nevertheless, tDCS studies rarely examine psychological factors such as expectations of outcomes, which may influence tDCS responsiveness through placebo-like effects. Here we sought to evaluate the potential influence of expectations on tDCS intervention outcomes. We assessed expectations of tDCS outcomes in 88 healthy young adults on three occasions: i) at baseline; ii) after reading information implying either high or low effectiveness of stimulation; and iii) after a single-session of sham-controlled anodal tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, during working memory (WM) training. Participants were largely uncertain about the effectiveness of stimulation in improving cognitive function at baseline. High or low expectation priming using simple positive or cautionary messages significantly increased or decreased expectation ratings, respectively, but ratings significantly decreased following stimulation in all groups. We found greater improvement in participants who received high compared to low expectation priming. Participants who received active stimulation and low expectation priming exhibited the lowest performance, suggesting that expectation priming and stimulation may have interacted. We did not find a significant effect of baseline expectations, belief of group assignment, or individual characteristics on measures of WM and verbal fluency. However, controlling for baseline expectations revealed greater post-intervention improvement on the executive function measures in participants who received high (compared to low) expectation priming. People randomly assigned to receive high expectation priming reported having a more pleasant experience overall, including greater satisfaction. Our findings suggest that expectations of outcomes should be taken into account in tDCS-based experimental studies and clinical trials.\\n\\nHighlights- Based on prior knowledge, healthy subjects are uncertain about NIBS effectiveness.\\n\\n- Expectations of NIBS can change after a single exposure to simple written messages.\\n\\n- Expectations of outcomes may influence cognitive performance.\\n\\n- High expectations may lead to a more positive experience and motivation to perform.\\n\\n- Low expectations may be counterproductive to NIBS.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of analysis tools are available to fMRI researchers in order to extract patterns of task variation and, ultimately, understand cognitive function. However, this  methodological plurality comes with a drawback. While conceptually similar, two different analysis pipelines applied on the same dataset may not produce the same scientific results. Differences in methods, implementations across software packages, and even operating systems or software versions all contribute to this variability. Consequently, attention in the field has recently been directed to reproducibility and data sharing. Neuroimaging is currently experiencing a surge in initiatives to improve research practices and ensure that all conclusions inferred from an fMRI study are replicable.\\n\\nIn this work, our goal is to understand how choice of software package impacts on analysis results. We use publically shared data from three published task fMRI neuroimaging studies, reanalyzing each study using the three main neuroimaging software packages, AFNI, FSL and SPM, using parametric and nonparametric inference. We obtain all information on how to process, analyze, and model each dataset from the publications. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. While qualitatively we find broad similarities between packages, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000 - 0.743 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software. We discuss the challenges involved in trying to reanalyse the published studies, and highlight our own efforts to make this research reproducible.",

SLIMEr enhances a GEM with mathematical constructs where we Split Lipids Into Measurable Entities (SLIME reactions), in addition to constraints on both the lipid classes and the acyl chain distribution. By implementing SLIMEr on the consensus GEM of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we can predict accurate amounts of lipid species, analyze the flexibility of the resulting distribution, and compute the energy costs of moving from one metabolic state to another.

    "abstract": "Depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide1. A known risk factor of depression is exposure to early life stress2. Such early stress exposure has been proposed to sensitise the maturing psychophysiological stress system to later life stress3. Activating positive memories dampens acute stress responses with resultant lower cortisol response and improved mood in humans4 and reduced depression-like behaviour in mice5. It is unknown whether recalling positive memories similarly reduces adolescent vulnerability to depression. Here we used path modelling to examine the effects of positive autobiographical memory specificity on later morning cortisol and negative self-cognitions during low mood in adolescents at risk for depression due to early life stress (n = 427, age: 14 years)6. We found that experimentally assessed positive but not negative memory specificity was associated with lower morning cortisol and less negative self-cognitions during low mood one year later. Moderated mediation analyses demonstrated that positive memory specificity reduced later depressive symptoms through lowering negative self-cognitions in response to negative life events reported in the one-year interval. Positive memory specificity actively dampened the negative effect of stressors over time, thereby operating as a resilience factor reducing the risk of subsequent depression7. These findings suggest that developing methods to improve positive memory specificity in at-risk adolescents may counteract vulnerability to depression.",

We now report expression of full-length CD95L mRNA, itself, is highly toxic to cells and induces a similar form of cell death. We demonstrate that small (s)RNAs derived from CD95L are loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) RISC which is required for the toxicity and that processing of CD95L mRNA into sRNAs is independent of both Dicer and Drosha. We provide evidence that in addition to the CD95L transgene a number of endogenous protein coding genes involved in regulating protein translation, particularly under low miRNA conditions, can be processed to sRNAs and loaded into the RISC suggesting a new level of cell fate regulation involving RNAi.",

    "abstract": "Microbial populations often assemble in dense populations in which proliferating individuals exert mechanical forces on the nearby cells. Here, we use yeast strains whose doubling times depend differently on temperature to show that physical interactions among cells affect the competition between different genotypes in growing yeast colonies. Our experiments demonstrate that these physical interactions have two related effects: they cause the prolonged survival of slower-growing strains at the actively-growing frontier of the colony and cause faster-growing strains to increase their frequency more slowly than expected in the absence of physical interactions. These effects also promote the survival of slower-growing strains and the maintenance of genetic diversity in colonies grown in time-varying environments. A continuum model inspired by overdamped hydrodynamics reproduces the experiments and predicts that the strength of natural selection depends on the width of the actively-growing layer at the colony frontier. We verify these predictions experimentally. The reduced power of natural selection observed here may favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells in microbial populations and could explain the apparent neutrality of inter-clone competition within tumors.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMicrobes often live in dense populations such as colonies and biofilms. We show that the success and extinction of yeast strains within a growing colony are determined by a combination of their relative fitness and the forces exerted by proliferating cells on their neighbors. These physical interactions prolong the survival of less-fit strains at the growing frontier of the colony and slow down the colonys takeover by fitter strains. This reduction in the power of natural selection favors the maintenance of genetic diversity in environments in which the strains relative growth rates vary with time. Growth-induced physical interactions may thus favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells, which are typically less-fit than non-resistant cells, within dense microbial populations.",

This suggests a unique relationship between PORCN and WNT4 signaling. To examine the role of PORCN in WNT4 signaling, WNT4 or WNT3A were over-expressed in breast and ovarian cancer, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. Conditioned medium from these lines, and co-culture systems, were used to assess the dependence of Wnt secretion and activity on critical Wnt secretion proteins PORCN and WLS. We observed that WLS was universally required for Wnt secretion and paracrine signaling. In contrast, the dependence of WNT3A secretion and activity on PORCN varied across cell lines, and WNT4 secretion was PORCN-independent in all models. Surprisingly, WNT4 did not present paracrine activity in any tested context. Absent the expected paracrine activity of secreted WNT4, we identified cell autonomous Wnt signaling activation by WNT4 and WNT3A, independent of PORCN or secretion. The PORCN-independent, cell-autonomous Wnt signaling demonstrated herein may be critical in WNT4-driven cellular contexts, or those that are otherwise considered to have dysfunctional Wnt signaling.\\n\\nSummary StatementWnt proteins can mediate an atypical mode of cell-autonomous signaling, distinct from paracrine signaling, that is independent of both palmitoylation by PORCN and Wnt secretion.",

However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This  signal-space approach allows for greater accuracy than existing  base-space tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.",

    "abstract": "Visual attention dramatically improves subjects ability to see and also modulates the responses of neurons in every known visual and oculomotor area, but whether those modulations can account for perceptual improvements remains unclear. We measured the relationship between populations of visual neurons, oculomotor neurons, and behavior during detection and discrimination tasks. We found that neither of the two prominent hypothesized neuronal mechanisms underlying attention (which concern changes in information coding and the way sensory information is read out) provide a satisfying account of the observed behavioral improvements. Instead, our results are more consistent with the novel hypothesis that attention reshapes the representation of attended stimuli to more effectively influence behavior. Our results suggest a path toward understanding the neural underpinnings of perception and cognition in health and disease by analyzing neuronal responses in ways that are constrained by behavior and interactions between brain areas.",

    "abstract": "The \\\"apparent motion\\\" illusion is evoked when stationary stimuli are successively flashed in spatially separated positions. It depends on the precise spatial and temporal separations of the stimuli. For large spatiotemporal separation, the long-range apparent motion (lrAM), it remains unclear how the visual system computes unambiguous motion signals. Here we investigated whether intracortical interactions within retinotopic maps could shape a global motion representation at the level of V1 population in response to a lrAM. In fixating monkeys, voltage-sensitive dye imaging revealed the emergence of a spatio-temporal representation of the motion trajectory at the scale of V1 population activity, shaped by systematic backward suppressive waves. We show that these waves are the expected emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the horizontal intra-cortical network. Such non-linearities explain away ambiguous correspondence problems of the stimulus along the motion path, preformating V1 population response for an optimal read-out by downstream areas.",

    "abstract": "Animals and their neuronal circuits must maintain function despite significant environmental fluctuations. The crab, Cancer borealis, experiences daily changes in ocean temperature and pH. Here, we describe the effects of extreme changes in extracellular pH - from pH 5.5 to 10.4 - on two central pattern generating networks, the stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia of C. borealis. Given that the physiological properties of ion channels are known to be sensitive to pH within the range tested, it is surprising that these rhythms generally remained robust from pH 6.1 to pH 8.8. Unexpectedly, the stomatogastric ganglion was more sensitive to acid while the cardiac ganglion was more sensitive to base. Considerable animal-to-animal variability was likely a consequence of similar network performance arising from variable sets of underlying conductances. Together, these results illustrate the potential difficulty in generalizing the effects of environmental perturbation across circuits, even within the same animal.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that perception and reasoning vary according to the phase of internal bodily signals such as heartbeat. This has been shown by locking the presentation of sensory events to distinct phases of the cardiac cycle. However, task-relevant information is not usually encountered in such a phase-locked manner nor passively accessed, but rather actively sampled at ones own pace. Moreover, if the phase of the cardiac cycle is an important modulator of perception and cognition, as previously proposed, then the way in which we actively sample the world should be similarly modulated by the phase of the cardiac cycle. Here we tested this by coregistration of eye movements and heartbeat signals while participants freely compared differences between two visual arrays. Across three different analyses, we found a significant coupling of saccades, subsequent fixations, and blinks with the cardiac cycle. More eye movements were generated during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, which has been reported as the period of maximal effect of the baroreceptors activity upon cognition. Conversely, more fixations were found during the diastole phase (quiescent baroreceptors). Lastly, more blinks were generated in the later period of the cardiac cycle. These results suggest that interoceptive and exteroceptive processing do adjust to each other; in our case, by sampling the outer environment during quiescent periods of the inner organism.",

The method is widely applicable in data-driven science. Calculating the components is based on a unified physical framework which introduces the objective function, namely the Kullback-Leibler divergence, appropriate for quantifying the change of the macroscopic state as it is effected by the microscopic features. To demonstrate the applicability of RPCA, we analyze the thermodynamically relevant conformational changes of the protein HIV-1 protease upon binding to different drug molecules. In this case, the RPCA method provides a sound thermodynamic foundation for the analysis of the binding process. The relevant collective (global) conformational changes can be reconstructed from the informative latent variables to exhibit both the enhanced and the restricted conformational fluctuations upon ligand association. Moreover, RPCA characterizes the locally relevant conformational changes which can be presented on the structure of the protein.",

    "abstract": "Growth rate and yield are fundamental features of micro-bial growth. However, we lack a mechanistic and quantita-tive understanding of the rate-yield relationship. Studies pairing computational predictions with experiments have shown the importance of maintenance energy and proteome allocation in explaining rate-yield tradeoffs and overflow metabolism. Recently, adaptive evolution experiments of Es-cherichia coli reveal a phenotypic diversity beyond what has been explained using simple models of growth rate versus yield. Here, we identify a two-dimensional rate-yield trade-off in adapted E. coli strains where the dimensions are (A) a tradeoff between growth rate and yield and (B) a tradeoff between substrate (glucose) uptake rate and growth yield. We employ a multi-scale modeling approach, combining a previously reported coarse-grained small-scale proteome allocation model with a fine-grained genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression (ME-model), to develop a quantitative description of the full rate-yield relationship for E. coli K-12 MG1655. The multi-scale analysis resolves the complexity of ME-model which hindered its practical use in proteome complexity analysis, and provides a mecha-nistic explanation of the two-dimensional tradeoff. Further, the analysis identifies modifications to the P/O ratio and the flux allocation between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway as potential mechanisms that enable the tradeoff between glucose uptake rate and growth yield. Thus, the rate-yield tradeoffs that govern microbial adaptation to new environments are more complex than previously reported, and they can be understood in mechanistic detail using a multi-scale modeling approach.",

Assuming a link between the TVV and the instantaneous change of the cellular action potentials, drugs accelerating repolarization by blocking inward (depolarizing) ion currents cause a relative increase of the TVV, while drugs delaying repolarization by blocking outward ion currents cause a relative decrease of the TVV.\\n\\nEvaluating the published data from two FDA funded studies, the TrX effect profiles indicate increasingly delayed electrical activity over the entire repolarization process for drugs solely reducing outward potassium current (dofetilide, moxifloxacin). For drugs eliciting block of the inward sodium or calcium currents (mexiletine, lidocaine), the TrX effect profiles were consistent with accelerated electrical activity in the initial repolarization phase. For multichannel blocking drugs (ranolazine) or drug combinations blocking multiple ion currents (dofetilide + mexiletine, dofetilide + lidocaine), the overall TrX effect profiles indicate a superposition of the individual TrX effect profiles.\\n\\nThe parameter Tr40c allows separating pure potassium channel blocking drugs from multichannel blocking drugs with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.90, CI = [0.88 to 0.92]. This is significantly larger than the performance of J-Tpeakc (0.81, CI = [0.78 to 0.84]) using the published data from the second FDA study. Further performance improvement was achieved by combining the ten parameters Tr10c to Tr100c in a logistic regression model, resulting in an AUC value of 0.94.\\n\\nThe TVV based approach substantially improves assessment of drug effects on cardiac repolarization, providing a plausible and improved mechanistic link between drug effects on ionic currents and overall ventricular repolarization reflected in the body surface ECG.

In the last few years, the number of strandings on Cape Cod Massachusetts beaches has increased by nearly an order of magnitude relative to preceding decades. This study uses a combination of ocean observations and a well-respected ocean model to investigate the causes and transport of cold-stunned animals in Cape Cod Bay. After validating the model using satellite-tracked drifters and local temperature moorings, ocean currents were examined in the Cape Cod Bay in an attempt to explain stranding locations as observed by volunteers and, for some years, backtracking was conducted to examine the potential source regions. The general finding, as expected, is that sub 10.5{degrees}C water temperatures in combination with persistent strong wind stress (>0.4Pa) will result in increased strandings along particular sections of the coast dependent on the wind direction. However, it is still uncertain where in the water column the majority of cold stunned turtles reside and, if many of them are on the surface, considerable more work will need to be done to incorporate the direct effects of wind and waves on the advective processes.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization has targeted stopping the transmission of Human African Trypanosomiasis by 2030. To achieve this, better tools are urgently required to identify and monitor Trypanosome infections in human, animals, and tsetse fly vectors. This study presents a single test approach for detection and identification of Trypanosomes and their comprehensive characterization at species and sub-group level. Our method uses newly designed ITS1 PCR primers (a widely used method for detection of African Trypanosomes, amplifying the ITS1 region of ribosomal RNA genes) coupled to Illumina sequencing of the amplicon. The protocol is based on the widely used Illuminas 16s bacterial metagenomic analysis procedure that makes use of multiplex PCR and dual indexing. We analyzed wild tsetse flies collected from Zambia and Zimbabwe. Our results show that the traditional method for Trypanosome species detection based on band size comparisons on a gel is unable to distinguish between T. vivax and T. godfreyi accurately. Additionally, this approach shows increased sensitivity of detection at species level. Through phylogenetic analysis, we identified Trypanosomes at species and sub-group level without the need for any additional tests. Our results show T. congolense Kilifi sub-group is more closely related to T. simiae than to other T. congolense sub-groups. This agrees with previous studies using satellite DNA and 18s RNA analysis. While current classification does not list any sub-groups for T. vivax and T. godfreyi, we observed distinct subgroups for these species. Interestingly, sequences matching T. congolense Tsavo (now classified as T. simiae Tsavo) clusters distinctly from the rest of the T. simiae Tsavo sequences suggesting that the Nannomonas group is more divergent than currently thought thus the need for a better classification criteria. This approach has the potential for refining classification of Trypanosomes and provide detailed molecular epidemiology information useful for surveillance and transmission control efforts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDetection of Trypanosomes in the tsetse flies plays an important role in the control of African trypanosomiasis by providing information on circulating Trypanosome species in a given area. We have developed a method that combines multiplex PCR and next-generation sequencing for Trypanosome species detection. The method is based on the widely used bacterial metagenomic analysis protocol and uses a modular, two-step PCR process followed by sequencing of all amplicons in a single run, making sequencing of amplicons more efficient and cost-effective when dealing with large sample sizes. As part of this approach, we designed novel primers for amplifying the ITS1 region of the Trypanosome rRNA gene that is more sensitive than conventional primers. Identification of Trypanosome species is based on BLAST searches against the constantly updated NCBIs nt database, which facilitates the identification of Trypanosome subgroups. Our approach is more accurate than traditional gel-based analysis and shows how the latter is prone to misidentification. It is also sensitive and is able to discriminate between subgroups within Trypanosome species. Applied as an epidemiological tool, it has the potential to provide new, comprehensive and more accurate information on vector-pathogen-host interconnections which are key in the control and management of African trypanosomiasis.",

The two primary active compounds of the flower bud are luteolin, a flavonoid, and chlorogenic acid, a phenolic acid. Both active compounds have demonstrated antioxidant activity.

This study aims to investigate if the antioxidants luteolin and chlorogenic acid have a synergistic effect to inhibit free radicals when combined. A 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH*) assay was performed. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of luteolin and chlorogenic acid were first determined and then combined at a 1:1 ratio. The combined inhibition capacity was then compared with the sum of the individual inhibition capacities. The IC50 of luteolin is 26.304 g{middle dot}ml-1 {+/-} 0.120 g{middle dot}ml-1 while the IC50 of chlorogenic acid is 85.529 g{middle dot}ml-1 {+/-} 4.482 g{middle dot}ml-1.

    "abstract": "Leaf tooth can indicate several systematically informative features and is extremely useful for circumscribing fossil leaf taxa. Moreover, it can help discriminate species or even higher taxa accurately. Previous studies extract features that are not strictly defined in botany; therefore, a uniform standard to compare the accuracies of various feature extraction methods cannot be used. For efficient and automatic retrieval of plant leaves from a leaf database, in this study, we propose an image-based description and measurement of leaf teeth by referring to the leaf structure classification system in botany. First, image preprocessing is carried out to obtain a binary map of plant leaves. Then, corner detection based on the curvature scale-space (CSS) algorithm is used to extract the inflection point from the edges; next, the leaf tooth apex is extracted by screening the convex points; then, according to the definition of the leaf structure, the characteristics of the leaf teeth are described and measured in terms of number of orders of teeth, tooth spacing, number of teeth, sinus shape, and tooth shape. In this manner, data extracted from the algorithm can not only be used to classify plants, but also provide scientific and standardized data to understand the history of plant evolution. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the extraction method, we use leaf tooth features and simple linear discriminant analysis to classify leaves; the results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy as compared to other methods.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClonorchis sinensis is a group I bio-carcinogen responsible for cholangiocarcinoma (CHCA) in humans. However, the mechanism by which C. sinensis promotes carcinogenesis is unclear.\\n\\nMethodologyUsing the human cholangiocyte line H69, we investigated cell proliferation and gap junction protein expression after stimulation with the hepatotoxin N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and/or excretory-secretory products (ESP) of C. sinensis, which induce inflammation. NDMA and ESP treatment increased proliferation by 146% and the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase by 37%. Moreover, the expression of the cell cycle protein E2F1 and the cell proliferation-related proteins Ki-67 and cytokeratin 19 increased in response to combined treatment with NDMA and ESP. The gap-junction proteins connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx26 also increased. In contrast, Cx32 expression decreased in cells treated with NDMA and ESP. Cox-2 was also upregulated. Silencing of Cx43 reduced cell proliferation and significantly suppressed Cx26 and Cox-2 expression.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that Cx43 is an important factor in CHCA induced by C. sinensis ESP and NDMA and further investigations targeting this pathway may allow prevention of this deadly disease.\\n\\nAuthor summaryClonorchis sinensis, a human fluke, resides in the liver of humans and is commonly found in the common bile duct and gall bladder. This parasite is the main cause of cholangiocarcinoma, also called bile duct cancer, in humans. Of note, the excretory-secretory products (ESP) of C. sinensis are known to cause inflammation in the biliary epithelium, which may ultimately result in neoplasms via production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent DNA damage. Together with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a potent hepatotoxin that can cause fibrosis and tumors in the liver, ESP led to an increase in the growth and proliferation of cholangiocytes. Our results showed that the ESPs of C. sinensis induced pro-inflammatory responses by increasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and nuclear factor kappa B (NF{kappa}B), which in turn, enhanced the production of connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap-junction protein. Therefore, Cx 43 can serve as a potential target for developing a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in humans.",

We investigated these processes in a controlled environment (Montpellier European Ecotron) applying a continuous 13CO2 label for three weeks to 12 soil-vegetation monoliths originating from a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) and representing two diversity levels (4 and 16 sown species). Plant species richness did not affect community- and species-level 13C abundances neither in total biomass nor in non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Community-level 13C excess tended to be higher in the 16-species than in the 4-species mixtures. Community-level 13C excess was positively related to canopy leaf nitrogen (N), i.e. leaf N per unit soil surface. At the species level shoot 13C abundances varied among plant functional groups and were larger in legumes and tall herbs than in grasses and small herbs and correlated positively with traits as leaf N concentrations, stomatal conductance and shoot height. The 13C abundances in NSC were larger in transport sugars (sucrose, raffinose-family oligosaccharides) than in free glucose, fructose and compounds of the storage pool (starch) suggesting that newly assimilated carbon is to a small portion allocated to storage. Our results emphasize that the functional composition of communities is key in explaining carbon assimilation in grasslands.",

So far, structural characterization of Sortilin and its endogenous ligands has been limited to crystallographic studies of Sortilin in complex with the neuropeptide Neurotensin. Here, we use hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to investigate the conformational response of Sortilin to binding biological ligands including the peptides Neurotensin and the Sortilin propeptide and the proteins Progranulin and pro-Nerve growth factor-{beta}. The results show that the ligands employ two binding sites inside the cavity of the {beta}-propeller of Sortilin. However, ligands have distinct differences in their conformational impact on the receptor. Interestingly, the protein ligands induce conformational stabilization in a remote membrane-proximal domain, hinting at an unknown conformational link between the ligand binding region and this membrane-proximal region of Sortilin. Our findings improves our molecular understanding of Sortilin and how it mediates diverse ligand-dependent functions important in neurobiology.",

    "abstract": "Reduced protein homeostasis and increased protein instability is a common feature of aging. Yet it remains unclear whether protein instability is a cause of aging. In neurodegenerative diseases and amyloidoses, specific proteins self-assemble into amyloid fibrils and accumulate as pathological solid aggregates in a variety of tissues. More recently, widespread protein aggregation has been described during normal aging, in the absence of disease processes. Until now, an extensive characterization of the nature of age-dependent protein aggregation and its consequences for aging has been lacking. Here, we show that age-dependent aggregates are rapidly formed by newly synthesized proteins and contain amyloid-like structures similar to disease-associated protein aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrate that age-dependent protein aggregation accelerates the functional decline of different tissues in C. elegans. Together, these finding reveal that the formation of amyloid aggregates is a generic problem of aging and likely to be an important target for strategies designed to maintain physiological functions in later stages of life.",

One example is the Wnt signaling pathway, which seems to depend on endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex for initiation of Wnt signal transduction. So far, the role of different endocytic pathways in Wnt signaling, the molecular players and the kinetics of this process are unclear. Here, we monitor endocytosis in Wnt3a and Wnt5a mediated signaling by membrane capacitance recordings of HEK293 cells. Our measurements revealed a fast and substantial increase in the number of endocytic vesicles. This endocytotic activity is specifically elicited by extracellular Wnt ligands; it starts immediately upon ligand binding and ceases over a period of ten minutes. By using specific inhibitors, we can dissect Wnt induced endocytosis into two independent pathways, where canonical Wnt3a is taken up mainly by clathrin-independent endocytosis and Wnt5a exclusively by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Macropinocytosis is an actin-driven process of large-scale, non-specific fluid uptake used for feeding by some cancer cells and the macropinocytosis model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. In Dictyostelium, macropinocytic cups are organised by  macropinocytic patches in the plasma membrane. These contain activated Ras, Rac and PI(3,4,5)P3 and direct actin polymerisation to their periphery. Here, we show that a classical (PkbA) and a variant (PkbR1) Akt protein kinase acting downstream of PI(3,4,5)P3 are together are near-essential for fluid uptake. This pathway enables the formation of larger macropinocytic patches and macropinosomes, thereby dramatically increasing fluid uptake. Akt targets identified by phosphoproteomics were highly enriched in small G-protein regulators, including the RhoGAP GacG. GacG knockout mutants make few macropinosomes but instead redeploy their cytoskeleton from macropinocytosis to motility, moving rapidly but taking up little fluid. The function of Akt in cell feeding through control of macropinosome size has implications for cancer cell biology.\\n\\nSummary statementDictyostelium amoebae feed by macropinocytosis in a PIP3 dependent manner. In the absence of PI3-kinases or the downstream Akt protein kinases, cells have smaller macropinosomes and nearly abolished fluid uptake.",

How these genes interact with endothelial signalling pathways to exert their functions remains incompletely understood. We have generated novel zebrafish mutants in foxc1a and foxc1b, the zebrafish orthologues of mammalian Foxc1, to determine their function during angiogenesis. foxc1a mutants display abnormal formation of cranial veins including the primordial hindbrain channels (PHBC), reduced Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) receptor expression in these and loss of central arteries. foxc1b mutants are normal, whereas foxc1a; foxc1b double mutants exhibit ectopic angiogenesis from trunk segmental arteries. Dll4/Notch signalling is reduced in foxc1a; foxc1b double mutant arteries and ectopic angiogenesis can be suppressed by induction of Notch or inhibition of Vegfc signalling. We conclude that foxc1a and foxc1b play compensatory and context-dependent roles to co-ordinate angiogenesis by promoting venous sprouting via induction of VEGF receptor expression whilst antagonising arterial sprouting by inducing Dll4/Notch signalling. foxc1a/b mediated induction of both pro- and anti-angiogenic axes of VEGF-Dll4/Notch negative feedback imparts competition to balance arterial and venous angiogenesis within developing vascular beds.\\n\\nSummary Statementfoxc1a and foxc1b promote angiogenesis from veins and suppress angiogenesis from arteries by promoting competing pro-angiogenic Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor signalling, and anti-angiogenic Dll4/Notch signalling in zebrafish embryos.",

Labeling and imaging of blood stage Plasmodium falciparum has always been challenging since it is a small intracellular parasite. The gold standard for parasite immunofluorescence is fixation in suspension with addition of minute amounts of glutaraldehyde to the paraformaldehyde-based solution. While this maintains red blood cell integrity, it has been postulated that antigenicity of the parasite proteins was, if at all, only slightly reduced. Here we show the deleterious effect that even these small quantities of glutaraldehyde can have on immunofluorescence staining quality and present an alternative cell seeding protocol that allows fixation with only paraformaldehyde.

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death caused by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation. It can be induced by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), the key enzyme for efficiently reducing peroxides within phospholipid bilayers. Recent data suggest that cancer cells undergoing EMT (dedifferentiation) and those resistant to standard therapy expose a high vulnerability toward ferroptosis. Although recent studies have begun to identify and characterize the metabolic and genetic determinants underlying ferroptosis, many mechanisms that dictate ferroptosis sensitivity remain unknown. Here, we show that low cell density sensitizes primary mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells to ferroptosis induced by GPX4 inhibition, whereas high cell density confers resistance. These effects occur irrespective of oncogenic signaling, cellular phenotype and expression of the fatty acid ligase acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4). By contrast, we show that a massive accumulation of neutral triacylglycerides (TAG) enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is induced at low cell density. In addition, de novo lipogenesis and desaturation pathways were found to be reduced at low cell density, indicative of increased fatty acid uptake. Our study suggests that PUFA-mediated toxicity is limited by the enrichment in TAGs that in turn might pose a vulnerability towards ferroptosis. Conclusively, cell density regulates lipid metabolism of breast epithelial and cancer cells, which results in a ferroptosis-sensitive cell state with the potential to be exploited therapeutically during metastatic dissemination.",

We confirm this is due to a cell autonomous failure of microglia to induce apoptosis through the secretion of the appropriate factors.

As a proof of principle, we applied Transite to public RNA expression data from human patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors were sampled at diagnosis, or after recurrence following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.

Being able to express this transition in simple and general slow degrees of freedom, would give a distinctive advantage, since it would require minimal knowledge of the system under study, while in turn it would elucidate its physics and accelerate the convergence speed of enhanced sampling methods relying on collective variables. In this study we pursuit this goal by combining for the first time Variation Approach to Conformational dynamics with Funnel-Metadynamics. In so doing, we predict for the benzamidine/trypsin system the ligand binding mode, and we accurately compute the absolute protein-ligand binding free energy and unbinding rate at unprecedented low computational cost.

    "abstract": "Abstract Fungal community composition in the Anthropocene is driven by rapid changes in environmental conditions caused by human activities. This study examines the relative importance of two global change drivers - atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and annual grass invasion - on structuring fungal communities in a California chaparral ecosystem, with emphasis on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We used molecular markers, functional groupings, generalized linear statistics and joint distribution modeling, to examine how environmental variables structure taxonomic and functional composition of fungal communities. Invasion of a chaparral ecosystem decreased richness and relative abundance of non-AMF symbionts and rhizophilic AMF (e.g. Glomeraceae) as well as the proportion of edaphophilic AMF (e.g. Gigasporaceae). We found increased richness and the proportion of rhizophilic and edaphophilic AMF with increasing soil NO3. Our findings suggest that invasive persistence may decrease the presence of multiple soil symbionts that native species depend on for pathogen protection and increased access to soil resources.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres, short guanine-rich repeats that cap linear chromosomes, are involved in cell senescence and organismal ageing. Our present understanding of telomere function oscillates between a marker of individual quality, which should be positively correlated with reproduction, to a marker of costs of reproduction (e.g. due to DNA damage). To test these  quality and  cost hypotheses, we tested the output of very simple predictions in a free-living population of European starlings Sturnus vulgaris where reproductive success of adult females was followed over 2 breeding seasons (with 2 broods per breeding). If telomere length indicate individual quality, low quality females (LQ, no fledgling) should have lower telomere lengths than high quality females (which produced fledglings in 1st and 2nd broods). Additionally, physiological determinants of adult individual quality (established in a previous study) and provisioning rate should be positively associated with adult telomere lengths. Finally, telomere length should predict future reproductive success. Adult telomere length was lower in LQ females but only during the chick-rearing period. Females producing larger clutches at fledging in the 1st brood of the 1st year also had longer telomeres. Provisioning rate was positively related to telomere length, as were plasma markers of oxidative damage, non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides. Despite these associations, we found weak support for telomeres as indicators of individual quality. Telomere length failed in predicting future reproduction success and there was a lack of consistency in within-individual telomere length over the breeding season. In starlings, we suggest that telomere length may indicate current breeding capacities and energy status of female adults, rather than future fecundity/survival.",

    "abstract": "Structural connectomes derived using diffusion tractography are increasingly used to investigate white matter connectivity in neurological diseases. However inherent biases in diffusion tractography algorithms may lead to both false negatives and false positives in connectome construction. A range of graph thresholding approaches and more recently several streamline filtering algorithms have been developed to address these issues. However there is no consensus in the literature regarding the best available approach. Using a cohort of Huntingtons disease patients and healthy controls we compared the effect of several graph thresholding strategies: proportional, absolute, consensus and consistency thresholding, with and without streamline filtering, using Spherical Deconvolution Informed Filtering of tractograms (SIFT2) algorithm. We examined the effect of thresholding strategies on the stability of graph theory metrics and the sensitivity of these measures in neurodegeneration. We show that while a number of graph thresholding procedures result in stable metrics across thresholds, the detection of group differences is highly variable. We also showed that the application of streamline filtering using SIFT2 resultes in better detection of group differences and stronger clinical correlations. We therefore conclude that the application of SIFT2 streamline filtering without graph thresholding may be sufficient for structural connectome construction.",

    "abstract": "Running wheels are frequently used to improve the welfare of captive animals, increase environmental enrichment, and, by doing so, reduce stereotypic behaviors. It is, however, still debated whether or not wheel running itself is a stereotypy. New evidence emerged when Meijer and Robbers (2014, Proc. Royal Soc. B) reported voluntary wheel running of wild animals in the Netherlands. Since stereotypic behaviors are exclusively attributed to captive animals, the occurrence of wheel running in the wild suggests that this behavior is non-stereotypic. Our study explores that same line of investigation, examining whether wild animals will voluntarily use running wheels in a natural area in Paraguay in comparison to the urban and semi-urban settings in the Netherlands. Of the 1857 small mammal visits we recorded, only two occasions showed evidence of what could be considered as wheel running behavior; over hundredfold fewer than previously reported. The potential reasons for the observed difference in wheel running activity, such as different species pool or seasonality, are discussed. The difference, however, is likely to be due to the much lower probability of Neotropical mammals in a remote natural site encountering man-made objects and experiencing urbanization-related behavioral patterns. Additionally, in the light of our findings, we review the definition of wheel running as a stereotypic behavior.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn orthologous group (OG) comprises a set of orthologous and paralogous genes that share a last common ancestor (LCA). OGs are defined with respect to a chosen taxonomic level, which delimits the position of the LCA in time to a specified speciation event. A hierarchy of OGs expands on this notion, connecting more general OGs, distant in time, to more recent, fine-grained OGs, thereby spanning multiple levels of the tree of life. Large scale inference of OG hierarchies with independently computed taxonomic levels can suffer from inconsistencies between successive levels, such as the position in time of a duplication event. This can be due to confounding genetic signal or algorithmic limitations. Importantly, inconsistencies limit the potential use of OGs for functional annotation and third-party applications.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a new methodology to ensure hierarchical consistency of OGs across taxonomic levels. To resolve an inconsistency, we subsample the protein space of the OG members and perform gene tree-species tree reconciliation for each sampling. Differently from previous approaches, by subsampling the protein space, we avoid the notoriously diffcult task of accurately building and reconciling very large phylogenies. We implement the method into a high-throughput pipeline and apply it to the eggNOG database. We use independent protein domain definitions to validate its performance.\\n\\nConclusionThe presented consistency pipeline shows that, contrary to previous limitations, tree reconciliation can be a useful instrument for the construction of OG hierarchies. The key lies in the combination of sampling smaller trees and aggregating their reconciliations for robustness. Results show comparable or greater performance to previous pipelines.

    "abstract": "A recent study suggests that the evidence of adaptive DNA sequence evolution accumulated in the last 20 years may be suspect1. The suspicion thus calls for a re-examination of the reported evidence. The two main lines of evidence are from the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test, which compares divergence and polymorphism data, and the PAML test, which analyzes multi-species divergence data. Here, we apply these two tests concurrently on the genomic data of Drosophila and Arabidopsis. To our surprise, the >100 genes identified by the two tests do not overlap beyond random expectations. The results could mean i) high false positives by either test or ii) high false-negatives by both tests due to low powers. To rule out the latter, we merge every 20 - 30 genes into a \"supergene\". At the supergene level, the power of detection is high, with 8% - 56% yielding adaptive signals. Nevertheless, the calls still do not overlap. Since it is unlikely that one test is largely correct and the other is mostly wrong (see Discussion), the total evidence of adaptive DNA sequence evolution should be deemed unreliable. As suggested by Chen et al.1, the reported evidence for positive selection may in fact be signals of fluctuating negative selection, which are handled differently by the two tests. Possible paths forward on this central evolutionary issue are discussed.",

PRS-CS utilizes a high-dimensional Bayesian regression framework, and is distinct from previous work by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes, which is robust to varying genetic architectures, provides substantial computational advantages, and enables multivariate modeling of local LD patterns. Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of effect size distributions, especially when the training sample size is large.

Finally, machine-learning models with accepted accuracy for predicting mammalian virulence of influenza A viruses were built. Overall, this study highlighted the importance of nucleotide mutations, especially synonymous mutations in viral virulence, and provided rapid methods for evaluating the virulence of influenza A viruses.

The discovery of new channelrhodopsins, Chrimson -- which is 45 nm more red-shifted than any previously discovered or engineered channelrhodopsin -- and its mutant ChrimsonR with faster kinetics [2] made this technology available for medical applications. However, a detailed model that would be able to accurately reproduce the membrane potential dynamics in cells transfected with ChrimsonR under light stimulation is missing. We address this issue by developing the first model for the electrochemical behavior of ChrimsonR that predicts its conductance in response to arbitrary light stimulation. Our model captures ON and OFF dynamics of the protein for stimuli with frequencies up to 100 Hz and their relationship with the brightness, as well as its activation curve, the steady-state amplitude of the response as a function of light intensity. Additionally, we capture a slow adaptation mechanism at a timescale at the order of minutes. Our model holds for light intensities covering the whole dynamic range of the channel (from response onset to saturation) and for timescales in the order of up to several minutes. This model is a new step towards modeling the spiking activity of ChrimsonR-expressing neurons, required for the precise control of information transmission in optogenetics-based Brain-Computer Interfaces, and will inform future applications of ChrimsonR based optogenetics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPsychiatric disorders are highly heterogeneous, defined based on symptoms with little connection to potential underlying biological mechanisms. A possible approach to dissect biological heterogeneity is to look for biologically meaningful subtypes. A recent study Drysdale et al. (2017) showed promising results along this line by simultaneously using resting state fMRI and clinical data and identified four distinct subtypes of depression with different clinical profiles and abnormal resting state fMRI connectivity. These subtypes were predictive of treatment response to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy.\\n\\nObjectiveHere, we attempted to replicate the procedure followed in the Drysdale et al. study and their findings in an independent dataset of a clinically more heterogeneous sample of 187 participants with depression and anxiety. We aimed to answer the following questions: 1) Using the same procedure, can we find a statistically significant and reliable relationship between brain connectivity and clinical symptoms? 2) Is the observed relationship similar to the one found in the original study? 3) Can we identify distinct and reliable subtypes? 4) Do they have similar clinical profiles as the subtypes identified in the original study?\\n\\nMethodsWe followed the original procedure as closely as possible, including a canonical correlation analysis to find a low dimensional representation of clinically relevant resting state fMRI features, followed by hierarchical clustering to identify subtypes. We extended the original procedure using additional statistical tests, to test the statistical significance of the relationship between resting state fMRI and clinical data, and the existence of distinct subtypes. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the whole procedure using resampling.\\n\\nResults and ConclusionWe were not able to replicate the findings of the original study. Relationships between brain connectivity and clinical symptoms were not statistically significant and we also did not find clearly distinct subtypes of depression. We argue, that based on our rigorous approach and in-depth review of the original results, that the evidence for the existence of the distinct resting state connectivity based subtypes of depression is weak and should be interpreted with caution.",

    "abstract": "A canonical foraging task is the patch-leaving problem, in which a forager must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy. Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the current patch and the overall environment. Evidence accumulation models belong to the class of drift diffusion processes and have been used to model decision making in different contexts especially in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We solve the model for conditions where foraging decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can represent different \\\"strategies\\\", for example an increment-decrement or counting strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is uncertain. To account for sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an energy-dependent utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits underlying patch leaving decisions.",

One attractive scenario is the use of abundant waste material to produce readily collectable product, minimizing production costs. Towards that end, we established the production of semivolatile medium-chain -olefins from lignin-derived monomers: we constructed 1-undecene synthesis pathway in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 using ferulate as the sole carbon source. In order to overcome the toxicity of ferulate, we first applied adaptive laboratory evolution, resulting in a highly ferulate-tolerant strain. Next, we demonstrated the 1-undecene production from glucose by heterologously expressing a fatty acid decarboxylase UndA and a thioesterase  TesA in the wild type strain. Finally, we constructed the alkene synthesis pathway in the ferulate-tolerant strain. We were able to produce 1-undecene from ferulate and collect the product from the culture headspace without downstream processing. This study demonstrates the potential of bacterial lignin upgradation into value-added products.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been strong interest in examining the microbiome and its impact on human health and the environment. By leveraging modern sequencing technologies, investigators can quickly determine the composition of a given microbial sample. At the same time, the same investigations often yield an array of categorical and numerical metadata derived from the sequenced samples such as immunohistochemical measures or locality information. Understanding how the microbiome data is associated with this external metadata is essential in developing targeted treatments for chronic diseases or proposing bacteria-modulated host responses. While many R or Python libraries and command-line tools have been developed for specific analysis purposes, there are still relatively few tools to facilitate open-ended data exploration and hypothesis generation. Here we introduce Mian, an open-source web framework to interactively visualize or run a suite of statistical and feature selection tools on the microbiome to identify important taxonomic groups in the context of any provided categorical or numerical metadata. Visualizations include boxplots, correlation networks, and PCA or NMDS scatterplots. Tools include Fishers Exact Test, Boruta feature selection, alpha and beta diversity, and differential and correlational analysis. Mian supports multiple standard representations of the OTU table as input and optionally subsamples the data during the upload process. Users can also filter and aggregate the OTU table at different taxonomic levels and dynamically adjust analysis parameters to see how the visualizations, results, and statistical measures change in real-time.

    "abstract": "The margins of an expanding range are predicted to be challenging environments for adaptation. Marginal populations should often experience low effective population sizes (Ne) where genetic drift is high due to demographic expansion and/or census population size is low due to unfavorable environmental conditions. Nevertheless, invasive species demonstrate increasing evidence of rapid evolution and potential adaptation to novel environments encountered during colonization, calling into question whether significant reductions in Ne are realized during range expansions in nature. Here we report one of the first empirical tests of the joint effects of expansion dynamics and environment on effective population size variation during invasive range expansion. We estimate contemporary values of Ne using rates of linkage disequilibrium among genome-wide markers within introduced populations of the highly invasive plant Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) in North America (California, USA), as well as in native European populations. As predicted, we find that Ne within the invasion is positively correlated with both expansion history (time since founding) and habitat quality (abiotic climate). History and environment had independent additive effects with similar effect sizes, supporting an important role of both factors in this invasion. These results support theoretical expectations for the population genetics of range expansion, though whether these processes can ultimately arrest the spread of an invasive species remains an open question.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOver 90% of suicide attempters have a psychiatric diagnosis, however twin and family studies suggest that the genetic etiology of suicide attempt (SA) is partially distinct from that of the psychiatric disorders themselves. Here, we present the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) on suicide attempt using major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BIP) and schizophrenia (SCZ) cohorts from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.\\n\\nMethodSamples comprise 1622 suicide attempters and 8786 non-attempters with MDD, 3264 attempters and 5500 non-attempters with BIP and 1683 attempters and 2946 non-attempters with SCZ. SA GWAS were performed comparing attempters to non-attempters in each disorder followed by meta-analysis across disorders. Polygenic risk scoring investigated the genetic relationship between SA and the psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nResultsThree genome-wide significant loci for SA were found: one associated with SA in MDD, one in BIP, and one in the meta-analysis of SA in mood disorders. These associations were not replicated in independent mood disorder cohorts from the UK Biobank and iPSYCH. Polygenic risk scores for major depression were significantly associated with SA in MDD (P=0.0002), BIP (P=0.0006) and SCZ (P=0.0006).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides new information on genetic associations and the genetic etiology of SA across psychiatric disorders. The finding that polygenic risk scores for major depression predict suicide attempt across disorders provides a possible starting point for predictive modelling and preventative strategies. Further collaborative efforts to increase sample size hold potential to robustly identify genetic associations and gain biological insights into the etiology of suicide attempt.",

Key components of RNA degradation machineries, including UPF1, UPF3B, and XRN1, exhibited suppressed protein, but not mRNA, levels, explaining the build-up of aberrant RNAs that characterizes DUX4-expressing cells.

    "abstract": "The application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) has become routine across genetic research. Among a range of applications, PRS are exploited to assess shared aetiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the predictive power of genetic data for use in clinical settings, and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed on individuals, or their biological samples (eg. tissues, cells), at the tails of the PRS distribution and contrasted. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are set to play a key role in personalised medicine. However, despite the growing application and importance of PRS, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice.

    "abstract": "Words are not processed in isolation but in rich contexts that are used to modulate and facilitate language comprehension. Here, we investigate distinct neural networks underlying two types of contexts. Firstly, the current linguistic environment, presented as the relative frequencies of two syntactic structures (prepositional object (PO) and double-object (DO)), which would either follow everyday linguistic experience or not. Secondly, preference towards one or the other structure depending on the verb; learned in everyday language use and stored in memory. German participants were reading PO and DO sentences in German while brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Firstly, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed a pattern of activation that integrated the current linguistic environment with everyday linguistic experience. When the input did not match everyday experience, the unexpectedly frequent structure showed higher activation in the ACC than the other conditions and more connectivity from the ACC to posterior parts of the language network. Secondly, verb-based surprisal of seeing a structure given a verb (PO verb preference but DO structure presentation) resulted, within the language network (left inferior frontal and left middle/superior temporal gyrus) and the precuneus, in increased activation compared to a predictable situation. In conclusion, 1) beyond the canonical language network, brain areas engaged in cognitive control, such as the ACC, might use the statistics of syntactic structures to facilitate language comprehension, 2) the language network is directly engaged in processing verb preferences. These two networks show distinct influences on sentence processing.",

    "abstract": "Recordings with a large number of intracranial electrodes in eight neurosurgical subjects offered a unique opportunity to examine the fast temporal dynamics of face processing simultaneously across a relatively large extent of the human temporal cortex (TC). Measuring the power of slow oscillatory bands of activity ({theta}, , {beta}, and {gamma}) as well as High-Frequency Broadband (HFB, 70-177 Hz) signal, we found that the HFB showed the strongest univariate and multivariate changes in response to face compared to non-face stimuli. Using the HFB signal as a surrogate marker for local cortical engagement, we identified recording sites with selective responses to faces that were anatomically consistent across subjects and responded with graded strength to human, mammal, bird, and marine animal faces. Importantly, the most face selective sites were located more posteriorly and responded earlier than those with less selective responses to faces. Using machine learning based methods, we demonstrated that a sparse model focusing on information from the human face selective sites performed as well as, or better than, anatomically distributed models of face processing when discriminating faces from non-faces stimuli. Lastly, we identified the posterior fusiform (pFUS) site as causally the most relevant node for inducing distortion of face perception by direct electrical stimulation. Our findings support the notion of face information being processed first in the most selective sites - that are anatomically discrete and localizable within individual brains and anatomically consistent across subjects - which is then distributed in time to less selective anterior temporal sites within a time window that is too fast to be detected by current neuroimaging methods. The new information about the fast spatio-temporal dynamics of face processing across multiple sites of the human brain provides a new common ground for unifying the seemingly contradictory modular and distributed models of face processing in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a deadly transmissible disease that can infect almost any body-part of the host but is mostly infect the lungs. It is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. In the 30 high TB burden countries, 87% of new TB cases occurred in 2016. Seven countries: India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Africa accounted for 64% of the new TB cases. To stop the infection and progression of the disease, early detection of TB is important. In our study, we used microarray data set and compared the gene expression profiles obtained from blood samples of patients with different datasets of Healthy control, Latent infection, Active TB and performed network-based analysis of DEGs to identify potential biomarker.\\n\\nObjectivesWe want to observe the transition of genes from normal condition to different stages of the TB and identify, annotate those genes/pathways/processes that play key role in the progression of TB disease during its cyclic interventions in human body.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 319 genes that are differentially expressed in various stages of TB (Normal to LTTB, Normal to Active TB and LTTB to active TB) and allocated to pathways from multiple databases which comprised of curated class of associated genes. These pathways importance was then evaluated according to the no. of DEGs present in the pathway and these genes show the broad spectrum of processes that take part in every state. In addition, we studied the regulatory networks of these classified genes, network analysis does consider the interactions between genes (specific for TB) or proteins provide us new facts about TB disease, which in turn can be used for potential biomarkers identification. We identified total 29 biomarkers from various comparison groups of TB stages in which 14 genes are over expressed as host responses against pathogen, but 15 genes are down regulated that means these genes has allowed the process of host defense to cease and give time to pathogen for its progression.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study revealed that gene-expression profiles can be used to identify and classified the genes on stage specific pattern among normal, LTTB and active TB and network modules associated with various stages of TB were elucidated, which in turn provided a basis for the identification of potential pathways and key regulatory genes that may be involved in progression of TB disease.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to environmental stressors during early development has important implications for rescheduling many cellular and molecular mechanisms. In some fish species, environmental stressors, like high temperatures (HT), cause an increase in cortisol levels. In turn, this mechanism induces sex reversal of genotypic females, overriding genetic factors related to development of the gonad. However, the involvement of the brain in this process is not well clarified. In the present work, we investigated the mRNA levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone b (crhb) and its receptors (crhr1 and crhr2), and found out that they were up-regulated at HT during the critical period of gonadal sex determination in medaka (Oryzias latipes), i.e., when the gonadal primordium is sexually labile. In order to clarify their roles in sex reversal, biallelic mutants for crhr1 and crhr2 were produced by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Remarkably, biallelic mutant of both loci (crhr1 and crhr2) did not undergo female-to-male sex reversal upon HT exposition, whereas mutants for either crhr1 or crhr2 showed partial, or intersex phenotypes, suggesting that both crh receptors are required for HT-induced masculinization. Inhibition of this process in double crhrs mutants could be successfully rescued through the administration of the downstream effector of the hypothalamic-pituitary interrenal axis, the cortisol. Taken together, these results revealed for the first time the participation of the central nervous system acting as a transducer of masculinization induced by thermal stress.",

    "abstract": "Habituation is a simple form of learning, where animals learn to reduce their responses to repeated innocuous stimuli. While habituation is simple in concept, its exact implementation in the vertebrate brain is not clear. It could occur via a single plasticity event at a singular site in the circuit, or alternatively via more complex strategies that combine multiple mechanisms at various processing stages and sites. Here, we use a visual habituation assay in larval zebrafish, where larvae habituate to sudden reductions in illumination (dark flashes). We find that 8 different components of this response habituate, including the probability of executing a response, its latency, and measures of its magnitude. Through behavioural analyses, we find that habituation of these different behavioural components occurs independently of each other and at different locations in the circuit. Further, we use genetic and pharmacological manipulations to show that habituation of different behavioural components are molecularly distinct. These results are consistent with a model by which visual habituation originates from the combination of multiple independent processes, which each act to adapt specific components of behaviour. This may allow animals to more specifically habituate behaviour based on stimulus context or internal state.",

Here, we cast a transcriptome-wide view on the transported mRNAs and cognate RBP binding sites during endosomal messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) transport in Ustilago maydis. Using individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), we compare the key transport RBP Rrm4 and the newly identified endosomal mRNP component Grp1 that is crucial to coordinate hyphal growth. Both RBPs bind predominantly in the 3 untranslated region of thousands of shared cargo mRNAs, often in close proximity. Intriguingly, Rrm4 precisely binds at stop codons, which constitute landmark sites of translation, suggesting an intimate connection of mRNA transport and translation. Towards uncovering the code of recognition, we identify UAUG as specific binding motif of Rrm4 that is bound by its third RRM domain. Altogether, we provide first insights into the positional organisation of co-localising RBPs on individual cargo mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Phosphomannomutase 2 Deficiency (PMM2-CDG) is the most common monogenic congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) affecting at least 800 patients globally. PMM2 orthologs are present in model organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene SEC53. Here we describe conserved genotype-phenotype relationships across yeast and human patients between five PMM2 loss-of-function missense mutations and their orthologous SEC53 mutations. These alleles range in severity from folding defective (hypomorph) to dimerization defective (severe hypomorph) to catalytic dead (null). We included the first and second most common missense mutations - R141H, F119L respectively- and the most common compound heterozygote genotype - PMM2R141H/F119L - observed in PMM2-CDG patients. Each mutation described is expressed in haploid as well as homozygous and heterozygous diploid yeast cells at varying protein expression levels as either SEC53 protein variants or PMM2 protein variants. We developed a 384-well-plate, growth-based assay for use in a screen of the 2,560-compound Microsource Spectrum library of approved drugs, experimental drugs, tool compounds and natural products. We identified three compounds that suppress growth defects of SEC53 variants, F126L and V238M, based on the biochemical defect of the allele, protein abundance or ploidy. The rare PMM2 E139K protein variant is fully functional in yeast cells, suggesting that its pathogenicity in humans is due to the underlying DNA mutation that results in skipping of exon 5 and a nonfunctional truncated protein. Together, these results demonstrate that yeast models can be used to characterize known and novel PMM2 patient alleles in quantitative growth and enzymatic activity assays, and used as patient avatars for PMM2-CDG drug screens yielding compounds that could be rapidly cross-validated in zebrafish, rodent and human organoid models.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) display hyperpolarisation-gated synaptic plasticity, where inhibition believed to come from cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) of vestibular nerve afferent synapses. This phenomenon is thought to underlie the plasticity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here we present a novel multi-scale computational model, which captures both electrophysiological and biochemical signalling at vestibular nerve synapses on proximal dendrites of the MVN neuron. We show that AMPA receptor phosphorylation at the vestibular synapse depends in complex ways on dendritic calcium influx, which is in turn shaped by patterns of post-synaptic hyperpolarisation and vestibular nerve stimulation. Hyperpolarisation-gated synaptic plasticity critically depends on the activation of LVA calcium channels and on the interplay between CaMKII and PP2B in dendrites of the post-synaptic MVN cell. The extent and direction of synaptic plasticity depend on the strength and duration of hyperpolarisation, and on the relative timing of hyperpolarisation and vestibular nerve stimulation. The multi-scale model thus enables us to explore in detail the interactions between electrophysiological activation and post-synaptic biochemical reaction systems. More generally, this model has the potential to address a wide range of questions about neural signal integration, post-synaptic biochemical reaction systems and plasticity.",

Thus, biomaterial-based repair strategies, which can restore the mechanical integrity of the AF and support long-term tissue regeneration are needed. Accordingly, a collagen-based multi-laminate scaffold with an underlying \\\"angle-ply\\\" architecture has been previously reported demonstrating similar mechanical properties to native AF tissue. The objectives of this work were to: 1) enhance the biomaterials impact strength, 2) define its contribution to spinal kinematics, and 3) assess its ability to prevent IVD herniation. First, AFRPs were enriched with a glycosaminoglycan-based (GAG) interlamellar matrix (ILM), and then tested for its radially-directed impact resistance under physiological stresses. Subsequent kinematic testing was conducted using a characterized GAG-enriched AFRP as an AF focal defect closure device. In summary, AFRPs demonstrated 1) incorporation of a GAG-based ILM significantly increased radial impact strength, 2) restoration of axial FSU kinematics and 3) ability to prevent herniation of native IVD tissues. Together, these results suggest that the AFRP demonstrates the mechanical robustness and material properties to restore an IVDs physiological mechanical function through the adequate closure of an AF focal defect.",

Principal motor function characteristics include myosin unitary step size, duty cycle, and force-velocity relationship for translating actin under load.

Assay miniaturization in a polydimethylsiloxane/glass (PDMS/glass) hybrid microfluidic flow channel is an essential component to a small sample volume assay applicable to costly protein samples however the PDMS substrate dramatically inhibits myosin motility. Myosin in vitro motility in a PDMS/glass hybrid microfluidic flow cell was tested under a variety of conditions to identify and mitigate the effect of PDMS on myosin. Substantial contamination by the monomeric species in polymerized PDMS flow cells is shown to be the cause of myosin motility inhibition. Normal myosin motility recovers by either extended cell aging ([~]20 days) to allow more complete polymerization or by direct chemical extraction of the free monomers from the polymer substrate. PDMS flow cell aging is the low cost alternative compatible with the other PDMS and glass modifications needed for in vitro myosin motility assaying.",

Here, we combine interferometric scattering microscopy with recombinant tubulin to monitor individual tubulins binding to and dissociating from growing microtubule tips. We make the first direct, single-molecule measurements of tubulin on- and off-rates. We detect two populations of transient dwell times, and determine via binding-interface mutants that they are separated by the formation of inter-protofilament bonds. Applying a computational model, we find that slow association kinetics with strong interactions along protofilaments best recapitulate our data, and furthermore predict plus-end tapering. Overall, we provide the most direct and complete quantification of how microtubules grow to date.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEMicrotubule polymerization dynamics are fundamental to cell migration and cell division, where they are targets for chemotherapy drugs. Despite significant progress, the precise structural and biochemical events occurring at growing microtubule tips are not well defined, and better understanding is necessary for discriminating mechanisms of microtubule dynamics regulation in cells. Here, we visualize individual tubulin subunits reversibly and irreversibly interacting with dynamic microtubule tips, and thereby directly measure tubulin on- and off-rates. By analyzing plus-tip residence times of wild-type and mutant tubulin, we characterize the relative contributions of longitudinal (along protofilaments) and lateral (between protofilaments) bond energies to microtubule growth.

    "abstract": "The ART program in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) like India, has a public health approach with the standardized regimen for all people living with HIV (PLHIV). Based on the evidence from high-income countries (HIC), the successful implication and scale-up of ART in India, the risk of an enhanced and accentuated onset of premature-aging or age-related diseases could be observed in PLHIV. However, very limited data is available on residual inflammation and immune activation in the populations who are on first-generation anti-HIV drugs like zidovudine and lamivudine that had more toxic side effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of systemic inflammation and understand the risk of age-associated diseases in PLHIV on long-term suppressive ART using a large number of biomarkers of the inflammation and immune activation. Blood samples were obtained from therapy naive PLHIV (Pre-ART, n=43), PLHIV on ART for >5 years (ART, n=53), and HIV-negative healthy controls (HIVNC, n=41). Samples were analyzed for 92 markers of inflammation, sCD14, sCD163, and telomere length. Several statistical tests were performed to compare the groups under study. Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the associations. Despite a median duration of eight years of successful ART, sCD14 (p<0.001) and sCD163 (p=0.04) levels continued to be significantly elevated in ART group as compared to HIVNC. Eleven inflammatory markers, including 4E-BP1, ADA, CCL23, CD5, CD8A, CST5, MMP1, NT3, SLAMF1, TRAIL and TRANCE, were found to be significantly different (p<0.05) between the groups. Many of these markers are associated with age-related co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive decline and some of these markers are being reported for the first time in the context of HIV-induced inflammation. Linear regression analysis showed a significant negative association between HIV-1-positivity and telomere length (p<0.0001). In ART-group CXCL1 (p=0.048) and TGF- (p=0.026) have a significant association with increased telomere length and IL-10RA was significantly associated with decreased telomere length (p=0.042). This observation warrants further mechanistic studies to generate evidence to highlight the need for enhanced treatment monitoring and special interventions in HIV-infected individuals.",

This dichotomy, however, is challenged by recent findings showing that learning is represented in a mixed reference frame. Overlooked in this framework is how learning is the result of multiple processes, such as explicit re-aiming and implicit motor adaptation. Therefore the proposed mixed representation may simply reflect the superposition of explicit and implicit generalization functions, each represented in different reference frames. Here, we characterized the individual generalization functions of explicit and implicit learning in relative isolation to determine if their combination could predict the overall generalization function when both processes are in operation. We modified the form of feedback in a visuomotor rotation task to isolate explicit and implicit learning, and tested generalization across different limb postures to dissociate the extrinsic and intrinsic representations. We found that explicit generalization occurred predominantly in an extrinsic reference frame but the amplitude was reduced with postural changes, whereas implicit generalization was phase-shifted according to a mixed reference frame representation and amplitude was maintained. A linear combination of individual explicit and implicit generalization functions accounted for nearly 85% of the variance associated with the generalization function in a typical visuomotor rotation task, where both processes are in operation. This suggests that each form of learning results from a mixed representation with distinct extrinsic and intrinsic contributions, and the combination of these features shape the generalization pattern observed at novel limb postures.\\n\\nNew and noteworthyGeneralization following learning in visuomotor adaptation tasks can reflect how the brain represents what it learns. In this study, we isolated explicit and implicit forms of learning, and showed that they are derived from a mixed reference frame representation with distinct extrinsic and intrinsic contributions. Furthermore, we showed that the overall generalization pattern at novel workspaces is due to the superposition of independent generalization effects developed by explicit and implicit learning processes.",

    "abstract": "The retrosplenial complex (RSC) plays a crucial role in spatial orientation by computing heading direction and translating between distinct spatial reference frames based on multi-sensory information. While invasive studies allow investigating heading computation in moving animals, established non-invasive analyses of human brain dynamics are restricted to stationary setups. To investigate the role of the RSC in heading computation of actively moving humans, we used a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach synchronizing electroencephalography with motion capture and virtual reality. Data from physically rotating participants were contrasted with rotations based only on visual flow. During physical rotation, varying rotation velocities were accompanied by pronounced wide frequency band synchronization in RSC, the parietal and occipital cortices. In contrast, the visual flow rotation condition was associated with pronounced alpha band desynchronization, replicating previous findings in desktop navigation studies, and notably absent during physical rotation. These results suggest an involvement of the human RSC in heading computation based on visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive input and implicate revisiting traditional findings of alpha desynchronization in areas of the navigation network during spatial orientation in movement-restricted participants.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms that can generate and maintain the heterogeneous distribution of the membrane components. Here we report that the propagating wave patterns of the bacterial Min proteins can impose corresponding steric pressure on the membrane to establish a directional accumulation of the membrane components, resulting in segregation of the components in the membrane. The diffusivity, influenced by the membrane anchor of the component, and the repulsed ability, influenced by the steric property of the soluble region of the component and molecular crowding, determine the differential spatial distribution of the component in the membrane. Thus, transportation of the membrane components by the Min proteins follows a simple physical principle, which resembles a linear peristaltic pumping process, to selectively segregate and maintain heterogeneous distribution of materials in the membrane.",

The formation of monolayer-bound LDs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bilayer is poorly understood, but the ER protein seipin is essential to this process. Here, we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure and functional characterization of D. melanogaster seipin. The structure reveals a ring-shaped dodecamer, with the luminal domain of each monomer resolved at [~]4.0 [A]. Each luminal domain monomer exhibits two distinctive features: a hydrophobic helix positioned towards the ER bilayer, and a {beta}-sandwich domain that has structural similarity with lipid-binding proteins. This structure, and our functional testing in cells, suggest a model in which seipin oligomers initially detect forming LDs in the ER via hydrophobic helices and subsequently act as membrane anchors to enable lipid transfer and LD growth.",

    "abstract": "Cospeciation has been suggested to be the main force driving the evolution of herpesviruses, with viral species co-diverging with their hosts along more than 400 million years of evolutionary history. Recent studies, however, have been challenging this assumption, showing that other co-phylogenetic events, such as intrahost speciations and host switches play a central role on their evolution. Most of these studies, however, were performed with undated phylogenies, which may underestimate or overestimate the frequency of certain events. In this study we performed co-phylogenetic analyses using time-calibrated trees of herpesviruses and their hosts. This approach allowed us to (i) infer co-phylogenetic events over time, and (ii) integrate crucial information about continental drift and host biogeography to better understand virus-host evolution. We observed that cospeciations were in fact relatively rare events, taking place mostly after the Late Cretaceous (~100 Millions of years ago). Host switches were particularly common among alphaherpesviruses, where at least 10 transfers were detected. Among beta- and gammaherpesviruses, transfers were less frequent, with intrahost speciations followed by losses playing more prominent roles, especially from the Early Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous, when those viral lineages underwent several intrahost speciations. Our study reinforces the understanding that cospeciations are uncommon events in herpesvirus evolution. More than topological incongruences, mismatches in divergence times were the main disagreements between host and viral phylogenies. In most cases, host switches could not explain such disparities, highlighting the important role of losses and intrahost speciations in the evolution of herpesviruses.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use is correlated within spouse-pairs, but it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol consumption on mate-selection from social factors or cohabitation leading to spouses becoming more similar over time. We hypothesised that genetic variants related to alcohol consumption may, via their effect on alcohol behaviour, influence mate selection.\n\nTherefore, in a sample of over 47,000 spouse-pairs in the UK Biobank we utilised a well-characterised alcohol related variant, rs1229984 in ADH1B, as a genetic proxy for alcohol use. We compared the phenotypic concordance between spouses for self-reported alcohol use with the association between an individuals self-reported alcohol use and their partners rs1229984 genotype using Mendelian randomization. This was followed up by an exploration of the spousal genotypic concordance for the variant and an analysis determining if relationship length may be related to spousal alcohol behaviour similarities.\n\nWe found strong evidence that both an individuals self-reported alcohol consumption and rs1229984 genotype are associated with their partners self-reported alcohol use. The Mendelian randomization analysis found that each unit increase in an individuals weekly alcohol consumption increased their partners alcohol consumption by 0.26 units (95% C.I. 0.15, 0.38; P=1.10x10-5). Furthermore, the rs1229984 genotype was concordant within spouse-pairs, suggesting that some spousal concordance for alcohol consumption existed prior to cohabitation. Although the SNP is strongly associated with ancestry, our results suggest that this concordance is unlikely to be explained by population stratification. Overall, our findings suggest that alcohol behaviour directly influences mate selection.",

Genome-wide association studies were conducted using the GBS dataset and sixteen disease rating datasets.

A significant association between disease phenotype and 528 SNPs was observed in six GWA analyses. Homology of sequences encompassing the significant SNPs was determined to predict gene identities and functions. Seventeen genes recurred in six GWA analyses, suggesting a strong association with virulence. Here, the putative genes/genomic regions associated with the significant SNPs are presented.",

We show that differential gene transcription is closely linked to variation in chromatin interaction networks mediated by RNA polymerase II. We also demonstrate that CTCF-mediated interactions are well conserved across population, but enriched with disease-associated SNPs. Altogether, this study assesses the critical impact of structural variants on the higher order organization of chromatin folding and provides unique insight into the mechanisms regulating gene transcription at the population scale, among which the local arrangement of chromatin loops seems to be the leading one.

    "abstract": "Transient expression of CRISPR/Cas9 is an effective approach for limiting its activities and improving its precision in genome editing. Here, we describe the heat-shock inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for controlled genome editing, and demonstrate its efficiency in the model crop, rice. Using a soybean heat-shock protein gene promoter and the rice U3 promoter to express Cas9 and sgRNA, respectively, we developed the heat-shock (HS) inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system, and tested its efficacy in targeted mutagenesis. Two loci were targeted by transforming rice with HS-CRISPR/Cas9 vectors, and the presence of targeted mutations was determined before and after the HS treatment. We found only a low rate of targeted mutagenesis before HS, but an increased rate of mutagenesis after HS treatment among the transgenic lines. Specifically, only [~]11% of transformants showed characteristic insertions-deletions at the ambient room temperature, but a higher percentage ([~]45%) of callus lines developed mutations after a few days of HS treatment. Analysis of regenerated plants harboring HS-CRISPR/Cas9 revealed that targeted mutagenesis was suppressed in the plants but induced by HS, which was detectable by Sanger sequencing after several weeks of HS treatments. Most importantly, the HS-induced mutations were transmitted to the progeny at a high rate, generating monoallelic and biallelic mutant lines that independently segregated from Cas9. Taken together, this work shows that HS-CRISPR/Cas9 is a controlled and reasonably efficient platform for genome editing, and therefore, a promising tool for limiting genome-wide off-target effects and improving the precision of genome editing.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA method for the temporal control on gene editing based on the use of heat-shock induced expression of CRISPR/Cas9 is described, which was efficient in producing heritable mutations in the rice genome.

We recruit N1 = 13 MODS patients with NABD at 6 months after ICU discharge, together with N2 = 13 healthy controls (matched by age, sex and years of education), and acquire functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest to find that, as compared to control, MODS patients with NABD present an overall increase of the functional connectivity (FC) at rest. In particular, we find that the default mode network (DMN) hyperconnects (increasing the node strength of the FC matrix) to three classes of networks: primary sensory (such as auditory, sensory-motor and visual), multimodal integration (such as dorsal attention and salience) and higher order cognition networks (such as fronto-parietal, language and executive control). Therefore, although these patients do not have an apparent structural damage after MODS, at the functional level, we found brain network alterations coexisting with hyperconnectivity of the DMN, that similar to what happens at the onset of other pathologies, might indicate a possible mechanism for brain compensation occurring after MODS.",

We carried out genome sequence surveys on four manually isolated sporocytes from the same sporangium to analyse the phylogenetic position of Chytriodinium based on SSU and concatenated SSU/LSU rRNA gene sequences, and also characterize two genes related to the plastidial heme pathway, hemL and hemY. The results suggest the presence of a cryptic plastid in Chytriodinium and a photosynthetic ancestral state of the parasitic Chytriodinium/Dissodinium clade. Finally, by mapping Tara Oceans V9 SSU amplicon data to the recovered SSU rRNA gene sequences from the sporocytes, we show that globally, Chytriodinium parasites are most abundant within the pico/nano- and mesoplankton of the surface ocean and almost absent within microplankton, a distribution indicating that they generally exist either as free-living spores or host-associated sporangia.",

We ran multiple [~] 300 ns all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from three NMR-based structural models of A{beta}(1-40 residues) fibrils having 2-fold (pdb code 2LMN) or 3-fold rotational symmetry (2LMP, and 2M4J). The 2M4J structure is based on an AD brain-seeded fibril whereas 2LMP and 2LMN represent two all-synthetic fibrils. Fibrils are constructed to contain either 6 or an infinite number of layers made using periodic images. The 6 layer fibrils partially unravel over the simulation time, mainly at their ends, while infinitely long fibrils do not. Once formed, the D23-K28 salt bridges are very stable and form within and between chains. Fibrils tend to retain (2LMN and 2LMP) or develop (2M4J) a \\\"stagger\\\" or register shift of {beta}-strands along the fibril axis. The brain-seeded fibril rapidly develops gaps at the sides of the fibril, which allows bidirectional flow of water and ions from the bulk phase in and out the central longitudinal core of the fibril. Similar but less marked changes were also observed for the 2LMP fibrils. The residues defining the gaps largely coincide with those demonstrated to have relatively rapid Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange in solid state NMR studies. These observations suggest that A{beta}(1-40 residues) fibrils may act as aqueous pores that might disrupt water and ion fluxes if inserted into a cell membrane.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal firing is organized in theta sequences controlled by internal memory-related processing and by external sensory cues. How these computations are segregated or integrated, depending on the cognitive needs, is not fully understood. Although theta activity in the hippocampus is most commonly studied as a unique coherent oscillation, it is the result of a complex interaction between different rhythm generators. Here we investigated the coordination between theta generators as a possible mechanism to couple or decouple internally and externally driven computations. We separated and quantified three different theta current generators from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, one originating in CA3 with current sinks in CA1 str. radiatum and two with current sinks in CA1 str. lacunosum-moleculare and dentate molecular layer, mainly driven by entorhinal cortex (EC) layers 3 and 2, respectively. These theta generators followed non fully coherent dynamics and presented epochs of higher and lower phase coupling, suggesting a flexible interaction between them. Selective optogenetic inhibition in CA3 depressed the str. radiatum generator without affecting the EC-driven theta oscillations, indicating that theta rhythm generators can be modulated independently. In addition, band-specific gamma interactions with theta oscillations selectively occurred with the corresponding pathway-specific theta current generator, supporting the existence of different theta-gamma coding frameworks to organize neuronal firing in the hippocampus. Importantly, we found that epochs of highly synchronized theta rhythmicity across generators preferentially occurred during memory-guided exploration and mismatch novelty detection in familiar environments, two conditions in which internally generated memory representations need to be coordinated with the incoming sensory information about external cues. We propose a mechanism for segregating and integrating hippocampal computations based on the coexistence of different theta-gamma frameworks that flexibly couple or decouple accommodating the cognitive needs.",

    "abstract": "The trans-neuronal propagation of tau has been implicated in the progression of tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Tau secretion from neurons is the first step in tau transmission, but little is known about the cellular mechanism. Here, we report that p300/CBP, the lysine acetyltransferase that acetylates tau and regulates its homeostasis and toxicity, serves as a key regulator of tau secretion by inhibiting the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Increased p300/CBP activity was associated with impaired function of this pathway in a tau transgenic mouse model. p300/CBP hyperactivation increased tau secretion by blocking autophagic flux. Conversely, inhibiting p300/CBP genetically or pharmacologically promoted autophagic flux, and reduced tau accumulation, tau secretion, and tau propagation in fibril-induced tau spreading models in vitro and in vivo. Our findings show that p300/CBP-induced impairment in the ALP underlies excessive unconventional secretion and pathogenic spread of tau.",
