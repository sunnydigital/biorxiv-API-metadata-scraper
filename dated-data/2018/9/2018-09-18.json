    "abstract": "MotivationLong non-coding RNA expression data has been increasingly used in finding diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer studies. Existing differential analysis tools for RNA sequencing does not effectively accommodate low abundant genes, as commonly observed in lncRNA. We propose a novel and robust statistical method lncDIFF to detect differential expressed (DE) genes without assuming the true density on normalized counts.\\n\\nResultslncDIFF adopts the generalized linear model with zero-inflated exponential quasi likelihood to estimate group effect on normalized counts, and employs the likelihood ratio test to detect differential expressed genes. The proposed method and tool is suitable for data processed with standard RNA-Seq preprocessing and normalization pipelines. Simulation results illustrate that lncDIFF detects DE genes with more power and lower false discovery rate regardless of the data pattern. The analysis on a head and neck squamous cell carcinomas study also confirms that lncDIFF has better sensitivity in identifying novel lncRNA genes with relatively large fold change and prognostic value.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationlncDIFF is an R package available at https://github.com/qianli10000/lncDIFF.\\n\\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Unprecedented rates of biodiversity loss rise the urgency for preserving species ability to cope with ongoing global changes. An approach in this direction is to target intra-specific hotspots of genetic diversity as conservation priorities. However, these hotspots are often identified by sampling at a spatial resolution too coarse to be useful in practical management of threatened species, hindering the long-appealed dialog between conservation stakeholders and conservation genetic researchers. Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal variation in species presence, genetic diversity, as well as potential risk factors, within a previously identified hotspot of genetic diversity for the endangered Apennine yellow bellied toad Bombina pachypus. Our results show that this hotspot is neither a geographically homogeneous nor a temporally stable unit. Over a time-window spanning 10-40 years since previous assessments, B. pachypus populations declined in large portions of its hotspot, and their genetic diversity levels decreased. Considering the demographic trend, genetic and epidemiological data, and models of current and future climatic suitability, populations at the extreme south of the hotspot area still qualify for urgent in-situ conservation actions, whereas northern populations would be better managed through a mix of in-situ and ex-situ actions. Our results emphasize that identifying hotspot of genetic diversity, albeit essential step, does not suffice to warrant on-ground conservation of threatened species. Hotspots should be analysed at finer geographic and temporal scales, to provide conservation stakeholders with key knowledge to best define conservation priorities, and to optimize resource allocation to alternative management practices.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive radiation occurs when the members of a single lineage evolve different adaptive forms in response to selection imposed by competitors or predators. Iconic examples include Darwins finches, Caribbean anoles, and Hawaiian silverswords, all of which live on islands. Parasites, which live on host \\\"islands,\\\" show macroevolutionary patterns consistent with adaptive radiation in response to host-imposed selection. Here we show rapid adaptive divergence of experimentally evolving feather lice in response to preening, the main host defense. We demonstrate that host defense exerts strong phenotypic selection for crypsis in lice transferred to different colored rock pigeons (Columba livia). During four years of experimental evolution ([~]60 generations), the lice evolved heritable differences in color. The color differences spanned the phenotypic distribution of congeneric species of lice adapted to other species of pigeons. Our results indicate that host-mediated selection triggers rapid divergence in the adaptive radiation of parasites, which are among the most diverse organisms on earth. Our research suggests that host defense should be included with competition and predation as a major mechanism driving the evolution of biodiversity by adaptive radiation.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, is an apicomplexan parasite with a complex, multi-host life cycle. Sixty percent of transcripts from its extreme AT-rich (81%) genome possess coding polyadenosine (polyA) runs, distinguishing the parasite from its hosts and other sequenced organisms. Recent studies indicate that transcripts with polyA runs encoding poly-lysine are hot spots for ribosome stalling and frameshifting, eliciting mRNA surveillance pathways and attenuating protein synthesis in the majority of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here, we show that the P. falciparum translational machinery is paradigm-breaking. Using bioinformatic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that both endogenous genes and reporter sequences containing long polyA runs are efficiently and accurately transcribed and translated in P. falciparum cells. Translation of polyA tracks in the parasite does not elicit any response from mRNA surveillance pathways usually seen in host human cells or organisms with similar AT content. The translation efficiency and accuracy of the parasite protein synthesis machinery reveals a unique role of ribosomes in the evolution and adaptation of P. falciparum to an AU-rich transcriptome and polybasic amino sequences. Finally, we show that the ability of P. falciparum to synthesize long poly-lysine repeats has given this parasite a unique protein exportome and an advantage in infectivity that can be suppressed by addition of exogenous poly-basic polymers.",

The visual assessment of every imaging scan is a necessary quality control step, yet arduous and time-consuming. A sizeable body of evidence shows that images of low quality are a source of variability that may be comparable to the effect size under study. We present the MRIQC Web-API, an open crowdsourced database that collects image quality metrics extracted from MR images and corresponding manual assessments by experts. The database is rapidly growing, and currently contains over 100,000 records of image quality metrics of functional and anatomical MRIs of the human brain, and over 200 expert ratings. The resource is designed for researchers to share image quality metrics and annotations that can readily be reused in training human experts and machine learning algorithms. The ultimate goal of the database is to allow the development of fully automated quality control tools that outperform expert ratings in identifying subpar images.",

Autosomal dominant Syndactyly type IV (SD4) is a very rare form of syndactyly, occurring as a result of heterozygous mutation in an SHH regulatory element (ZRS) that resides in intron 5 of the LMBR1 gene on chromosome 7q36.3. The SD4 is characterized by complete cutaneous syndactyly of all fingers, cup-shaped hands due to flexion of the fingers and accompanied by polydactyly. Here, we firstly reported a big Chinese family, manifesting cup-shaped hands consistent with SD4 and intrafamilial heterogeneity in clinical phenotype of tibial and fibulal shortening, triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (TPTPS). Genetically, we identified a novel duplication of [~]222.23 kb covering exons 2-17 of the LMBR1 gene in this family by next generation sequencing.

Drosophila genome encodes nine Toll receptors and six Spatzle (Spz) proteins, and only the canonical Toll-Spz (Toll-1-Spz-1) pathway has been well investigated. In this study, we compared the nine Drosophila Tolls and showed that similarly to Toll, Toll-7 also strongly activated drosomycin promoter. Importantly, we showed that both Toll and Toll-7 interacted with Spz, Spz-2 and Spz-5, and co-expression of Toll or Toll-7 with Spz, Spz-2 and Spz-5 activated the drosomycin promoter. Furthermore, Toll and Toll-7 both recognized vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by binding to the VSV glycoprotein. Septic infection in Toll and Toll-7 mutant flies suggested that Toll and Toll-7 differentially affected defense responses in adult males and females after systemic infection by Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans or VSV. Our results suggest multiple Toll family members activate the expression of antimicrobial peptides. Our results also provide evidence that Toll and Toll-7 bind multiple Spatzle proteins and differentially affect immune defense against different pathogens in adult male and female flies.",

    "abstract": "The phosphoprotein pp150 is a structurally, immunogenically, and regulatorily important capsid-associated tegument protein abundant in {beta}-herpesviruses including cytomegaloviruses (CMV), but absent in -herpesviruses and {Gamma}-herpesviruses. In human CMV (HCMV), bridging across each triplex and three adjacent major capsid proteins (MCPs) is a group of three pp150 subunits in a \\\"{bigtriangleup}\\\"-shaped fortifying configuration, 320 of which encase and stabilize the genome-containing capsid. Because murine CMV (MCMV) has been used as a model for HCMV pathogenesis and therapeutic studies, one might expect that pp150 and the capsid in MCMV and HCMV have similar structures. Here, by cryoEM and sub-particle reconstructions, we have obtained structures of MCMV capsid and pp150 at near atomic resolutions and built their atomic models. Surprisingly, the capsid-binding patterns of pp150 differ between HCMV and MCMV despite their highly similar capsid structures. In MCMV, pp150 is absent on triplex Tc and exists as a \\\"{Lambda}\\\"-shaped dimer on other triplexes, leading to only 260 groups of two pp150 subunits per capsid in contrast to 320 groups of three pp150 subunits encasing each HCMV capsid. Many more amino acids contribute to pp150-pp150 interactions in MCMV than in HCMV, making MCMV pp150 dimer inflexible thus incompatible to instigate triplex Tc-binding as observed in HCMV. While pp150 is essential in HCMV, pp150-deleted MCMV mutants remained viable though with attenuated infectivity and exhibiting defects in retaining viral genome. These results support targeting capsid proteins, but invalidate targeting pp150, when using MCMV as a model for HCMV pathogenesis and therapeutic studies.\\n\\nImportanceCMV infection is a leading viral cause of congenital birth defects and often responsible for life-threating complications in immunocompromised individuals like AIDS and post-organ transplantation patients. Absence of effective vaccines and potent drugs against CMV infections has motivated animal-based studies, mostly based on the mouse model with MCMV, both for understanding pathogenesis of CMV infections and for developing therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the first atomic structures of MCMV and show that the organization patterns of capsid-associated tegument protein pp150 between human and mouse CMV are different despite their highly similar capsid structures. Our functional studies demonstrate that deleting pp150 does not eliminate MCMV infection in contrast to pp150s essential role in HCMV infections. These results thus establish the validity to target capsid proteins, but raise concerns to target pp150, when using MCMV as HCMV model for pathogenesis and therapeutic studies.",

    "abstract": "Although there is strong evidence that certain activities can increase bone density and structure in some individuals, it is unclear what specific mechanical factors govern the response. This is important because understanding the effect of mechanical signals on bone could contribute to more effective osteoporosis prevention methods and efficient clinical trial design. The degree to which strain rate and magnitude govern bone adaptation in humans has never been prospectively tested. Here, we studied the effects of a voluntary upper extremity compressive loading task in healthy adult women during a twelve month prospective period. One hundred and two women age 21-40 participated in one of two experiments. (1): low (n=21) and high (n=24) strain magnitude. (2): low (n=21) and high (n=20) strain rate. Control: (n=16): no intervention. Strains were assigned using subject-specific finite element models. Load cycles were recorded digitally. The primary outcome was change in ultradistal integral bone mineral content (iBMC), assessed with QCT. Interim timepoints and secondary outcomes were assessed with high resolution pQCT (HRpQCT). Sixty-six subjects completed the intervention, and interim data were analyzed for 77 subjects. Both the low and high strain rate groups had significant 12-month increases to ultradistal iBMC (change in control: -1.3{+/-}2.7%, low strain rate: 2.7{+/-}2.1%, high strain rate: 3.4{+/-}2.2%), total iBMC, and other measures. \\\"Loading dose\\\" was positively related to 12-month change in ultradistal iBMC, and interim changes to total BMD, cortical thickness and inner trabecular BMD. Subjects who gained the most bone completed, on average, 130 loading bouts of (mean strain) 550 {varepsilon} at 1805 {varepsilon}/s. Those with the greatest gains had the highest loading dose. We conclude that signals related to strain magnitude, rate, and number of loading bouts contribute to bone adaptation in healthy adult women, but only explain a small amount of variance in bone changes.",

    "abstract": "The integration of direct bottom-up inputs with contextual information is a canonical motif in neocortical circuits. In area V1, neurons may reduce their firing rates when the (classical) receptive field input can be predicted by the spatial context. We previously hypothesized that gamma-synchronization (30-80Hz) provides a complementary signal to rates, encoding whether stimuli are predicted from spatial context by preferentially synchronizing neuronal populations receiving predictable inputs. Here we investigated how rates and synchrony are modulated by predictive context. Large uniform surfaces, which have high spatial predictability, strongly suppressed firing yet induced prominent gamma-synchronization, but only when they were colored. Yet, chromatic mismatches between center and surround, breaking predictability, strongly reduced gamma-synchronization while increasing firing rates. Differences between colors, including strong gamma-responses to red, arose because of stimulus adaptation to a full-screen background, with a prominent difference in adaptation between M- and L-cone signaling pathways. Thus, synchrony signals whether RF inputs are predicted from spatial context and may encode relationships across space, while firing rates increase when stimuli are unpredicted from the context.",

Extracellular gate opening and closure are key steps of the transport cycle, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we generated a synthetic single domain antibody (sybody) that recognizes the heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/288 exclusively in the presence of ATP, which was essential to solve a 3.2 [A] crystal structure of the outward-facing transporter. The sybody binds to an extracellular wing and strongly inhibits ATPase activity by shifting the transporters conformational equilibrium towards the outward-facing state, as shown by double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Mutations that facilitate extracellular gate opening resulted in a comparable equilibrium shift and strongly reduced ATPase activity and drug transport. Using the sybody as conformational probe, we demonstrate that efficient extracellular gate closure is required to dissociate the NBD dimer after ATP hydrolysis to reset the transporter back to its inward-facing state.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects [~]10% of the global population, with considerable ethnic differences in prevalence and aetiology. We assembled genome-wide association studies (GWAS)1-3 of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function that defines CKD, in 312,468 individuals from four ancestry groups. We identified 93 loci (20 novel), which were delineated to 127 distinct association signals. These signals were homogenous across ancestries, and were enriched for protein-coding exons, kidney-specific histone modifications, and transcription factor binding sites for HDAC2 and EZH2. Fine-mapping revealed 40 high-confidence variants driving eGFR associations and highlighted potential causal genes with cell-type specific expression in glomerulus, and proximal and distal nephron. Mendelian randomisation (MR) supported causal effects of eGFR on overall and cause-specific CKD, kidney stone formation, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and hypertension. These results define novel molecular mechanisms and effector genes for eGFR, offering insight into clinical outcomes and routes to CKD treatment development.",

    "abstract": "T cell activation is a critical driver of immune response and if uncontrolled, it can result in failure to respond to infection or in excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. CD28 costimulatory pathway is an essential regulator of CD4 T cell responses. To deconvolute how T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 orchestrate activation of human CD4 T cells we stimulated cells using varying intensities of TCR and CD28 signals followed by gene expression profiling. We demonstrate that T-helper differentiation and cytokine expression are controlled by CD28. Strikingly, cell cycle and cell division are sensitive to CD28 in memory cells, but under TCR control in naive cells, in contrast to the paradigm that memory cells are CD28-independent. Using a combination of chromatin accessibility and enhancer profiling, we observe that IRFs and Blimp-1 (PRDM1) motifs are enriched in naive and memory T cells in response to TCR. In contrast, memory cells initiate AP1 transcriptional regulation only when both TCR and CD28 are engaged, implicating CD28 as an amplifier of transcriptional programmes in memory cells. Lastly, we show that CD28-sensitive genes are enriched in autoimmune disease loci, pointing towards the role of memory cells and the regulation of T cell activation through CD28 in autoimmune disease development. This study provides important insights into the differential role of CD28 in naive and memory T cell responses and offers a new platform for design and interpretation of costimulatory based therapies.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryGenomic profiling of CD4 T cell activation reveals a sensitivity switch from TCR in naive to CD28 in memory cells.",

Cad16T with a combination of long-term monitoring of key physicochemical parameters with CTD, 14C-incorporation experiments and quantitative proteomics of in situ dialysis bag incubations of pure cultures. Regular vertical CTD profiling during the study period in summer 2017 revealed that the chemocline sank from 12 to 14 m which was accompanied by a bloom of cyanobacteria and the subsequent oxygenation of the deeper water column. Sampling was performed both day and night in September. While CO2 assimilation rates were higher during the light period, the relative change in the proteome (663 quantified proteins) was only 1% of all CDS encoded in str. Cad16T. Oxidative respiration was thereby upregulated at light, whereas stress-related mechanisms prevailed during the night. These results indicate that the low light availability due to high cell concentrations and the oxygenation of the chemocline induced a mixotrophic growth in str. Cad16T.\\n\\nThe complete proteome data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010641.",

Such has been the case with Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), which target only a fraction of the strains in the population. Here, we use the frequencies of accessory genes to predict changes in the pneumococcal population after vaccination, hypothesizing that these frequencies reflect negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) on the gene products. We find that the standardized predicted fitness of a strain estimated by an NFDS-based model at the time the vaccine is introduced enables to predict whether the strain increases or decreases in prevalence following vaccination. Further, we are able to forecast the equilibrium post-vaccine population composition and assess the invasion capacity of emerging lineages. Overall, we provide a method for predicting the impact of an intervention on pneumococcal populations with potential application to other bacterial pathogens in which NFDS is a driving force.",

Yet, while the importance of reentrant feedback is well established in perception, the top-down modulations for action and the neural circuits involved in this process have received less attention. Do action-specific intentions influence the processing of visual information in the human cortex? Using a cue-separation fMRI paradigm, we found that action-specific instruction (manual alignment vs. grasp) influences the cortical processing of object orientation several seconds after the object had been viewed. This influence occurred as early as in the primary visual cortex and extended to ventral and dorsal visual stream areas. Importantly, this modulation was unrelated to non-specific action planning. Further, the primary visual cortex showed stronger functional connectivity with frontal-parietal areas and the inferior temporal cortex during the delay following orientation processing for align than grasping movements, strengthening the idea of reentrant feedback from dorsal visual stream areas involved in action. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that intended manual actions have such an early, pervasive, and differential influence on the cortical processing of vision.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDIndividuals at high risk schizophrenia may benefit from early intervention but few validated risk predictors are available. Genetic profiling is one approach to risk stratification that has been extensively validated in research cohorts, but its utility in clinical settings remains largely unexplored. Moreover, the broad health consequences of a high genetic risk of schizophrenia are poorly understood, despite being highly relevant to treatment decisions.\\n\\nMETHODSWe used electronic health records of 91,980 patients from three large healthcare systems to evaluate the penetrance and pleiotropy of genetic risk for schizophrenia. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia were calculated from meta-analysis summary statistics and tested for association with schizophrenia diagnostic codes and 1338 code-defined disease categories in a phenome-wide association study. Effect estimates were meta-analyzed across sites, and follow-up analyses evaluated the effect of a schizophrenia diagnosis.\\n\\nRESULTSPRSs were robustly associated with schizophrenia (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in PRS = 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-1.8], p = 1.25 x 10-16) and patients in the highest risk decile of the PRS distribution had a four-fold increased odds of schizophrenia compared to those in the bottom decile (95% CI, 2.4-6.5, p = 4.43 x 10-8). PRSs were also associated with other psychiatric phenotypes, including anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorders, personality disorders, and suicidal behavior. Non-psychiatric associations included heart palpitations, urinary syndromes, obesity, and nonspecific somatic symptoms. Most associations remained significant when conditioning on a diagnosis of schizophrenia, indicating genetic pleiotropy.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate that an available measure of genetic risk for schizophrenia is robustly associated with schizophrenia in healthcare settings and has pleiotropic effects on related psychiatric disorders as well as other medical symptoms and syndromes. Our results provide an initial indication of the opportunities and limitations that may arise with the future application of PRS testing in healthcare systems.",

However, how metabolic pathways influence meiotic progression in metazoans remains poorly understood. Here we report that the TORC1 regulators GATOR1 and GATOR2 mediate a response to meiotic double-stranded breaks (DSBs) during Drosophila oogenesis. We find that meiotic DSBs trigger the activation of a GATOR1 dependent pathway that downregulates TORC1 activity in the female germline. In GATOR1 mutants, high TORC1 activity results in the delayed repair of meiotic DSBs and the hyperactivation of p53. Conversely, the GATOR2 component Mio is required to attenuate GATOR1 activity, to ensure that meiotic DSBs do not trigger a permanent growth arrest. Unexpectedly, we found that GATOR1 inhibits retrotransposon expression in the presence of meiotic DSBs in a pathway that functions in parallel to p53. Our studies have revealed a link between the GATOR complex, the repair of meiotic DSBs and retrotransposon expression",

For example, noise in rod phototransduction limits our ability to detect light and minimizing the impact of this noise requires precisely tuned nonlinear processing by the retina. But detection sensitivity is only one aspect of night vision: prompt and accurate behavior also requires that rods reliably encode the timing of photon arrivals. We show here that the temporal resolution of responses of primate rods is much finer than the duration of the light response and identify the key limiting sources of transduction noise. We also find that the thermal activation rate of rhodopsin is lower than previous estimates, implying that other noise sources are more important than previously appreciated. A model of rod single-photon responses reveals that the limiting noise relevant for behavior depends critically on how rod signals are pooled by downstream neurons.",

For example, \\\"sensation-seeking\\\" is predictive of the initial propensity to take drugs; whereas \\\"novelty-seeking\\\" predicts compulsive drug-seeking behavior. In addition, the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues can predict the propensity to approach drug cues, and reinstatement or relapse, even after relatively brief periods of drug exposure. The question addressed here is the extent to which these three  vulnerability factors are related; that is, predictive of one another. Some relationships have been reported in small samples, but here a large sample of 1,598 outbred male and female heterogeneous stock rats were screened for Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior (to obtain an index of incentive salience attribution;  sign-tracking), and subsequently tested for sensation-seeking and novelty-seeking. Despite the large N there were no significant correlations between these traits, in either males or females. There were, however, novel relationships between multiple measures of incentive salience attribution and, based on these findings, we generated a new metric that captures \\\"incentive value\\\".

Individual ganglion cells receive input from unique presynaptic retinal circuits, and the characteristic patterns of light-evoked action potentials in each ganglion cell type therefore reflect computations encoded in synaptic input and in postsynaptic signal integration and spike generation. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of tools for characterizing retinal ganglion cell computation. Therefore, we developed a statistical model, the separable Nonlinear Input Model, capable of characterizing the large array of distinct computations reflected in retinal ganglion cell spiking. We recorded ganglion cell responses to a correlated noise (\\\"cloud\\\") stimulus designed to accentuate the important features of retinal processing in an in vitro preparation of mouse retina and found that this model accurately predicted ganglion cell responses at high spatiotemporal resolution. It identified multiple receptive fields (RFs) reflecting the main excitatory and suppressive components of the response of each neuron. Most significantly, our model succeeds where others fail, accurately identifying ON-OFF cells and segregating their distinct ON and OFF selectivity and demonstrating the presence of different types of suppressive receptive fields. In total, our computational approach offers rich description of ganglion cell computation and sets a foundation for relating retinal computation to retinal circuitry.",

    "abstract": "The productivity of indigenous goats in Africa is constrained by shortage of protein-rich feed especially in winter. This study investigated the nutritional value of mucuna forage (MF) and seed meal (MSM) as alternative protein sources for indigenous goats. Mucuna was planted in 3 parallel and adjacent fields and its foliage nutritional composition determined at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after planting (WAP). MF was harvested at 14 WAP whilst mucuna pods were harvested at 28 - 30 WAP, shelled and the MSM chemically analysed. In a completely randomised design (CRD), 20 indigenous goats were randomly offered 5 treatment diets with, respectively, 0%, 25%, 50% and 100% MF and 100% MSM replacing broiler litter (BL), each with 4 replicates, for 82 days. Both mucuna foliage DM and CF contents increased (P < 0.001) whilst foliage CP, EE and ash contents decreased (P<0.001) with maturity. On the other hand, MSM contained high DM (90.7%), EE (3.7% DM) and CP (26.0% DM) but low CF (9.7% DM) and ash (5.5% DM) contents. Both body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were not influenced by dietary mucuna incorporation (P > 0.05). However, dietary MF, particularly at the 100% level, decreased goat feed intake (FI) (P < 0.001) whilst 100% MSM increased (P < 0.001) this parameter. Mucuna had no effect on all carcass characteristics (P > 0.05) but increased (P < 0.05), particularly at the 100% MSM level, hot carcass weight and dressing percentage. There were no effects of mucuna on all biochemical and haematological indices (P > 0.05), except for the increase in serum glucose (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the optimal stage for harvesting and utilisation of MF is between 12 and 16 WAP and both MF and MSM, particularly the latter, are rich alternative protein sources for indigenous goats.",
