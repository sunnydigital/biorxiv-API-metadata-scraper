    "abstract": "Cooperation significantly impacts a species population dynamics as individuals choose others to associate with based upon fitness opportunities. Models of these dynamics typically assume that individuals can freely move between groups. Such an assumption works well for facultative co-operators (e.g. flocking birds, schooling fish, and swarming locusts) but less so for obligate co-operators (e.g. canids, cetaceans, and primates). With obligate co-operators, the fitness consequences from associations are stronger compared to facultative co-operators. Consequently, individuals within a group should be more discerning and selective over their associations, rejecting new members and even removing current members. Incorporating such aspects into population models may better reflect obligately cooperative species. In this paper, we create and analyze a model of the population dynamics of obligate co-operators. In our model, a behavioral game determines within-group population dynamics that then spill over into between-group dynamics. Our analysis shows that group number increases when population dynamics are stable, but additional groups lead to unstable population dynamics and an eventual collapse of group numbers. Using a more general analysis, we identify a fundamental mismatch between the stability of the behavioral dynamics and the stability of the population dynamics. When one is stable, the other is not. Our results suggest that group turnover may be inherent to the population dynamics of obligate co-operators. The instability arises from a non-chaotic deterministic process, and such dynamics should be predictable and testable.",

Both processes are trivially parallelizable.\\n\\nApplications include detection of duplicates, clustering and classification of semi-structured data, which support larger goals including summarizing large and complex data sets, quality assessment, and data mining.

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used to aid in understanding pathogen transmission [1]. Very often the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating isolates collected during an epidemiological study are used to identify sets of cases that are potentially linked by direct transmission. However, there is little agreement in the literature as to what an appropriate SNP cut-off threshold should be, or indeed whether a simple SNP threshold is appropriate for identifying sets of isolates to be treated as \\\"transmission clusters\\\". The SNP thresholds that have been adopted for inferring transmission vary widely even for one pathogen. As an alternative to reliance on a strict SNP threshold, we suggest that the key inferential target when studying the spread of an infectious disease is the number of transmission events separating cases. Here we describe a new framework for deciding whether two pathogen genomes should be considered as part of the same transmission cluster, based jointly on the number of SNP differences and the length of time over which those differences have accumulated. Our approach allows us to probabilistically characterize the number of inferred transmission events that separate cases. We show how this framework can be modified to consider variable mutation rates across the genome (e.g. SNPs associated with drug resistance) and we indicate how the methodology can be extended to incorporate epidemiological data such as spatial proximity. We use recent data collected from tuberculosis studies from British Columbia, Canada and the Republic of Moldova to apply and compare our clustering method to the SNP threshold approach. In the British Columbia data, different cases break off from the main clusters as cut-off thresholds are lowered; the transmission-based method obtains slightly different clusters than the SNP cut-offs. For the Moldova data, straightforward application of the methods shows no appreciable difference, but when we take into account the fact that resistance conferring sites likely do not follow the same mutation clock as most sites due to selection, the transmission-based approach differs from the SNP cut-off method. Outbreak simulations confirm that our transmission based method is at least as good at identifying direct transmissions as a SNP cut-off. We conclude that the new method is a promising step towards establishing a more robust identification of outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Cells possess remarkable control of the folding and entanglement topology of long and flexible chromosomal DNA molecules. It is thought that structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes play a crucial role in this, by organizing long DNAs into series of loops. Recent experimental data suggest that SMC complexes are able to translocate on DNA, as well as pull out lengths of DNA via a \\\"loop extrusion\\\" process. We describe a Brownian loop-capture-ratchet model for translocation and loop extrusion based on known structural, catalytic, and DNA-binding properties of the Bacillus subtilis SMC complex. Our model provides an example of a new class of molecular motor where large conformational fluctuations of the motor  track - in this case DNA - are involved in the basic translocation process. Quantitative analysis of our model leads to a series of predictions for the motor properties of SMC complexes, most strikingly a strong dependence of SMC translocation velocity on tension in the DNA track that it is moving along, with \\\"stalling\\\" occuring at subpiconewton tensions. A closely related hallmark of the loop-capture mechanism is a strong dependence of translocation step size on DNA tension. We also discuss how the same mechanism might be used by other structurally related SMC complexes (E. coli MukBEF and eukaryote condensin, cohesin and SMC5/6) to organize genomic DNA.",

    "abstract": "The success of humans in novel environments is partially supported by our ability to implement new task procedures via instructions. This complex skill has been associated with the activity of control-related brain areas. Current models link fronto-parietal and a cingulo-opercular networks with transient and sustained modes of cognitive control, based on observations during repetitive task settings or rest (Dosenbach et al. 2008). The current study extends this dual model to novel instructed tasks. We employed a mixed design and an instruction-following task to extract phasic and tonic brain signals associated with the encoding and implementation of novel verbal rules. We also performed a representation similarity analysis to capture consistency in task-set encoding within trial epochs. Our findings show that both networks are involved while following novel instructions: transiently, during the implementation of the instruction, and in a sustained fashion, across novel trials blocks. Moreover, the multivariate results showed that task representations in the cingulo-opercular network were more stable than in the fronto-parietal one. Our data extend the dual model of cognitive control to novel demanding situations, highlighting the high flexibility of control-related regions in adopting different temporal profiles.",

    "abstract": "The vimentin network displays remarkable plasticity to support basic cellular functions. Here, we show that in several cell types vimentin filaments redistribute to the cell periphery during mitosis, forming a robust scaffold interwoven with cortical actin and affecting the mitotic cortex properties. Importantly, the intrinsically disordered tail domain of vimentin is essential for this redistribution, which allows normal mitotic progression. A tailless vimentin mutant forms curly bundles, which remain entangled with dividing chromosomes leading to mitotic catastrophes or asymmetric partitions. Serial deletions of the tail domain induce increasing impairments of cortical association and mitosis progression. Disruption of actin, but not of microtubules, mimics the impact of tail deletion. Pathophysiological stimuli, including HIV-protease and lipoxidation, induce similar alterations. Interestingly, filament integrity is dispensable for cortical association, which also occurs in vimentin particles. These results unveil novel implications of vimentin dynamics in cell division by means of its interplay with the mitotic cortex.",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons often have variable responses to repeated presentations of the same stimulus, which can significantly degrade the information contained in those responses. Such variability is often shared across many neurons, which in principle can allow a decoder to mitigate the effects of such noise, depending on the structure of the shared variability and its relationship to sensory encoding at the population level. Latent variable models offer an approach for characterizing the structure of this shared variability in neural population recordings, although they have thus far typically been used under restrictive mathematical assumptions, such as assuming linear transformations between the latent variables and neural activity. Here we leverage recent advances in machine learning to introduce two nonlinear latent variable models for analyzing large-scale neural recordings. We first present a general nonlinear latent variable model that is agnostic to the stimulus tuning properties of the individual neurons, and is hence well suited for exploring neural populations whose tuning properties are not well characterized. This motivates a second class of model, the Generalized Affine Model, which simultaneously determines each neurons stimulus selectivity and a set of latent variables that modulate these stimulus responses both additively and multiplicatively. While these approaches can detect general nonlinear relationships in shared neural variability, we find that neural activity recorded in anesthetized primary visual cortex (V1) is best described by a single additive and single multiplicative latent variable, i.e., an \\\"affine model\\\". In contrast, application of the same models to recordings in awake macaque prefrontal cortex discover more general nonlinearities to compactly describe the population response variability. These results thus demonstrate how nonlinear latent variable models can be used to describe population variability, and suggest that a range of methods is necessary to study different brain regions under different experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. However, GWAS techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWAS method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach. GenEpi identifies both within-gene and cross-gene epistasis through a two-stage modeling workflow. In both stages, GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and constructs the prediction models by L1-regularized regression with stability selection. The simulated data showed that GenEpi outperforms other widely-used methods on detecting ground-truth epistasis. As real data is concerned, this study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both biological meanings and predictive power.

Hopanoid biosynthesis genes are conserved in nitrogen-fixing plant symbionts, and we previously found that the extended (C35) class of hopanoids in Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens are required for efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the tropical legume host Aeschynomene afraspera. Here we demonstrate that the nitrogen fixation defect conferred by extended loss can fully be explained by a reduction in root nodule sizes rather than per-bacteroid nitrogen fixation levels. Using a single-nodule tracking approach to track A. afraspera nodule development, we provide a quantitative model of root nodule development in this host, uncovering both the baseline growth parameters for wild-type nodules and a surprising heterogeneity of extended hopanoid mutant developmental phenotypes. These phenotypes include a delay in root nodule initiation and presence of a subpopulation of nodules with slow growth rates and low final volumes, which are correlated with reduced motility and surface attachment in vitro and lower bacteroid densities in planta, respectively. This work provides a quantitative reference point for understanding the phenotypic diversity of ineffective symbionts in A. afraspera and identifies specific developmental stages affected by extended hopanoid loss for future mechanistic work.",

NMDAR is activated by phosphorylation by Fyn and there is also some evidence to suggest that abnormalities in Fyn functionality could also be involved in susceptibility to schizophrenia. In a recent weighted burden analysis of exome sequenced schizophrenia cases and controls we noted modest statistical evidence for an enrichment of rare, functional variants in FYN, GRIN1 and GRIN2B in schizophrenia cases.\\n\\nAimsTo test the plausibility of the hypothesis that schizophrenia susceptibility might be associated with genetic variants predicted to cause impaired functioning of NMDAR, either directly or indirectly through impairment of the kinases which phosphorylate it.\\n\\nMethodIn an exome sequenced sample of 4225 schizophrenia cases and 5834 controls rare variants occurring in genes for the NMDAR subunits and for the kinases acting on it were annotated. The counts of disruptive and damaging variants were compared between cases and controls and the distribution of amino acids affected by damaging variants were visualised in ProteinPaint and the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Special attention was paid to tyrosine residues subject to phosphorylation.\\n\\nResultsThere was no suggestion that abnormalities of the serine-threonine kinases or of Src were associated with schizophrenia. 3 cases and no controls had a disruptive variant in GRIN2A and 2 cases and no controls had a disruptive variant in FYN. 14 cases and 3 controls had damaging variants in FYN and all the variants in controls affected amino acid residues in the N-terminal region outside of any known functional domains. By contrast, 10 variants in cases affected amino acids in functional domains and in the 3D structure of Fyn two of the amino acid substitions, A376T and Q517E, were adjacent to each other. 8 cases and 1 control had damaging variants in GRIN1 but there was no obvious pattern with respect to particular functional domains being affected in this or other genes. A single case had a variant in GRIN2A affecting a well-supported phosphorylation site, Y943C, and three cases had a variant which produce an amino acid change, T216S, which lies two residues away from two well-supported phosphorylation sites. Aside from this, there was no suggestion that tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Fyn or NMDAR were affected.\\n\\nConclusionsThe numbers of variants involved are too small for firm conclusions to be drawn. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that about 0.5% of subjects with schizophrenia have disruptive or damaging genetic variants which could plausibly impair functioning of NMDAR directly or indirectly through impairing Fyn function.",

Vertebrate and invertebrate keratinocytes/keratinocyte-like epidermal cells ensheath peripheral arbors of somatosensory neurons, including nociceptors, yet the developmental origins and functional roles of this ensheathment are largely unknown. Here, we describe an evolutionarily conserved morphogenetic mechanism for epidermal ensheathment of somatosensory neurites. We found that somatosensory neurons in Drosophila and zebrafish induce formation of epidermal sheaths, which wrap neurites of different types of neurons to different extents. Neurites induce formation of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate microdomains at nascent sheaths, followed by a filamentous actin network, and recruitment of junctional proteins that likely form autotypic junctions to seal sheaths. Finally, blocking epidermal sheath formation destabilized dendrite branches and reduced nociceptive sensitivity in Drosophila. Epidermal somatosensory neurite ensheathment is thus a deeply conserved cellular process that contributes to the morphogenesis and function of nociceptive sensory neurons.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus infections represent the major cause of titanium based-orthopaedic implant failure. Current treatments for S. aureus infections involve the systemic delivery of antibiotics and additional surgeries, increasing health-care costs and affecting patients quality of life. As a step toward the development of new strategies that can prevent these infections, we build upon previous work demonstrating that the colonization of catheters by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans can be prevented by coating them with thin polymer multilayers composed of chitosan (CH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) designed to release a {beta}-amino acid-based peptidomimetic of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We demonstrate here that this {beta}-peptide is also potent against S. aureus (MIC = 4 {micro}g/mL) and characterize its selectivity toward S. aureus biofilms. We demonstrate further that {beta}-peptide-containing CH/HA thin-films can be fabricated on the surfaces of rough planar titanium substrates in ways that allow mammalian cell attachment and permit the long-term release of {beta}-peptide. {beta}-Peptide loading on CH/HA thin-films was then adjusted to achieve release of {beta}-peptide quantities that selectively prevent S. aureus biofilms on titanium substrates in vitro for up to 24 days and remained antimicrobial after being challenged sequentially five times with S. aureus inocula, while causing no significant MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cytotoxicity compared to uncoated and film-coated controls lacking {beta}-peptide. We conclude that these {beta}-peptide-containing films offer a novel and promising localized delivery approach for preventing orthopaedic implant infections. The facile fabrication and loading of {beta}-peptide-containing films reported here provides opportunities for coating other medical devices prone to biofilm-associated infections.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCETitanium (Ti) and its alloys are used widely in internal fixation devices due to their mechanical strength and long-term biocompatibility. However, these devices are susceptible to bacterial colonization and the subsequent formation of biofilms. Here we report a chitosan and hyaluronic acid polyelectrolyte multilayer-based approach for the localized delivery of helical, cationic, globally amphiphilic {beta}-peptide mimetics of antimicrobial peptides to inhibit S. aureus colonization and biofilm formation. Our results reveal that controlled release of this {beta}-peptide can selectively kill S. aureus cells without exhibiting toxicity toward MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells. Further development of this polymer-based coating could result in new strategies for preventing orthopaedic implant-related infections, improving outcomes of these titanium implants.",

    "abstract": "At the molecular level, the evolution of new traits can be broadly divided between changes in gene expression and changes in protein structure. For proteins, the evolution of novel functions is generally thought to proceed through sequential point mutations or recombination of whole functional units. In Saccharomyces, the uptake of the sugar maltotriose into the cell is the primary limiting factor in its utilization, but maltotriose transporters are relatively rare, except in brewing strains. No known wild strains of Saccharomyces eubayanus, the cold-tolerant parent of hybrid lager-brewing yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae x S. eubayanus), are able to consume maltotriose, which limits their ability to fully ferment malt extract. In one strain of S. eubayanus, we found a gene closely related to a known maltotriose transporter and were able to confer maltotriose consumption by overexpressing this gene or by passaging the strain on maltose. Even so, most wild strains of S. eubayanus lack native maltotriose transporters. To determine how this rare trait could evolve in naive genetic backgrounds, we performed an adaptive evolution experiment for maltotriose consumption, which yielded a single strain of S. eubayanus able to grow on maltotriose. We mapped the causative locus to a gene encoding a novel chimeric transporter that was formed by an ectopic recombination event between two genes encoding transporters that are unable to import maltotriose. In contrast to classic models of the evolution of novel protein functions, the recombination breakpoints occurred within functional domains. Thus, the ability of the new protein to carry maltotriose was likely acquired through epistatic interactions between independently evolved substitutions. By acquiring multiple mutations at once, the transporter rapidly gained a novel function, while bypassing potentially deleterious intermediate steps. This study provides an illuminating example of how recombination between paralogs can establish novel interactions among substitutions to create adaptive functions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHybrids of the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus (lager-brewing yeasts) dominate the modern brewing industry. S. cerevisiae, also known as bakers yeast, is well-known for its role in industry and scientific research. Less well recognized is S. eubayanus, which was only discovered as a pure species in 2011. While most lager-brewing yeasts rapidly and completely utilize the important brewing sugar maltotriose, no strain of S. eubayanus isolated to date is known to do so. Despite being unable to consume maltotriose, we identified one strain of S. eubayanus carrying a gene for a functional maltotriose transporter, although most strains lack this gene. During an adaptive evolution experiment, a strain of S. eubayanus without native maltotriose transporters evolved the ability to grow on maltotriose. Maltotriose consumption in the evolved strain resulted from a chimeric transporter that arose through recombination between genes encoding parent proteins that were unable to transport maltotriose. Traditionally, functional chimeric proteins are thought to evolve by recombining discrete functional domains or modules, but the breakpoints in the chimera studied here occurred within modular units of the protein. These results support the less well-recognized role of recombination between paralogous sequences in generating novel proteins with adaptive functions.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. Neuronal degeneration and death underlie progressive forms of MS and cognitive dysfunction. Neuronal damage is triggered by numerous harmful factors in the brain that engage diverse signalling cascades in neurons thus therapeutic approaches to protect neurons will need to focus on agents that can target broad biological processes. To target the broad spectrum of signaling events that mediate neurodegeneration in MS we have focused on non-coding small microRNAs (miRNAs). microRNAs are epigenetic regulators of protein expression, targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and inhibiting their translation. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in many neurodegenerative diseases including MS. In this study we identified two miRNAs, miR-223-3p and miR-27a-3p, that were upregulated in neurons in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of CNS inflammation and in active MS lesions. Overexpression of miR-27a-3p or miR-223-3p protected dissociated cortical neurons from degeneration in response to peripheral blood mononuclear cell conditioned media (PBMC-CM). Introduction of miR-223-3p in vivo in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) protected RGC axons from degeneration in the EAE model. By in silico analysis we found that mRNAs in the glutamate receptor (GluR) pathway are enriched in miR-27a-3p and miR-223-3p targets. Antagonism of the GluR pathway protected neurons from PBMC-CM-dependent degeneration. Our results suggest that miR-223-3p and miR-27a-3p are upregulated in response to inflammation to mediate a compensatory neuroprotective gene expression program that desensitizes neurons to glutamate by downregulating mRNAs involved in GluR signalling.",

Linking the level of miRNAs to the expression of predicted target mRNAs across 19 single cells that are phenotypically identical, we observe that the predicted targets are significantly anti-correlated with the variation of abundantly expressed miRNAs, suggesting that miRNA expression variability alone may lead to non-genetic cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Genome-scale analysis of paired miRNA-mRNA co-profiles further allows us to derive and validate new regulatory relationships of cellular pathways controlling miRNA expression and variability.",

High proportions of shared variation impede estimation of connectivity, even despite leveraging information from many genetic markers. We overcome these impediments by combining classical analysis of neutral variation with assays of the structure of selected variation, demonstrated using populations of the principal African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Accurate estimation of mosquito migration is crucial for efforts to combat malaria. Modeling and cage experiments suggest that mosquito gene drive systems will enable malaria eradication, but establishing safety and efficacy requires identification of isolated populations in which to conduct field-testing. We assess Lake Victoria islands as candidate sites, finding one island 30 kilometers offshore is as differentiated from mainland samples as populations from across the continent. Collectively, our results suggest sufficient contemporary isolation of these islands to warrant consideration as field-testing locations and illustrate shared adaptive variation as a useful proxy for connectivity in highly polymorphic species.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) acted as a signal molecule to transmit signals in plants at the early stage of disease infection, and it could induce disease resistance of the plant, including potato late blight. Anionic peroxidases in many plants were reported to be involved in defense to disease. However, limited information about anionic peroxidase genes is available for the potato. Here, we reported that the expression of the StPOPA, a gene encoding a suberization-associated anionic peroxidase, was associated with resistance in potato against P. infestans. The StPOPA gene was induced by P. infestans infection, mechanical damage, jasmonic acid and ethylene treatment. Overexpression of the StPOPA gene in potato enhanced the resistance against P. infestans via promoting the accumulation of callose in the cell wall and ROS in the cytoplasm, which restricted the infection and spreading of the disease possibly by purposeful programmed cell death. Taken together, our results suggested that the StPOPA gene contributed to potato immunity against P. infestans and this gene could be used for the genetic improvement of resistance against potato late blight.",

CC1 contains an intrinsically disordered N-terminus that links microtubules at evenly distributed distances through four conserved hydrophobic regions. NMR analyses revealed that two neighboring residues in the first hydrophobic binding motif are crucial for the microtubule interaction, which we confirmed through live cell analyses. The microtubule-binding mechanism of CC1 is remarkably similar to that of the prominent neuropathology-related protein Tau, indicating evolutionary convergence of MAP functions across animal and plant cells.",

    "abstract": "Contrasting with fish or amphibian, retinal regeneration from Muller glial cells is largely limited in mammals. In our quest towards the identification of molecular cues that may boost their stemness potential, we investigated the involvement of the Hippo pathway effector YAP, which we previously found to be upregulated in Muller cells following retinal injury. We report that conditional Yap deletion in Muller cells prevents the upregulation of cell cycle genes that normally accompanies reactive gliosis upon photoreceptor cell death. This occurs as a consequence of defective EGFR signaling. Consistent with a function of YAP in triggering Muller glia cell cycle re-entry, we further show that in Xenopus, a species endowed with efficient regenerative capacity, YAP is required for their injury-dependent proliferative response. Finally, and noteworthy, we reveal that YAP overactivation in mouse Muller cells is sufficient to induce their reprogramming into highly proliferative cells. Overall, we unravel a pivotal role for YAP in tuning Muller cell response to injury and highlight a novel YAP-EGFR axis by which Muller cells exit their quiescence state, a critical step towards regeneration.",

Therefore, better therapeutic approaches are necessary. NSCLCs generally possess many genetic mutations and are well infiltrated by T cells (TIL), making TIL therapy an attractive option. Here we show that T cells from treatment naive, stage I-IVa NSCLC tumors can effectively be isolated and expanded, with similar efficiency as from normal lung tissue. Importantly, 76% (13/17) of tested TIL products isolates from NSCLC lesions exhibited clear reactivity against primary tumor digests, with 0.5%-30% of T cells producing the inflammatory cytokine Interferon (IFN)-{gamma}. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed tumor reactivity. The cytokine production correlated well with CD137 and CD40L expression. Furthermore, almost half (7/17) of the TIL products contained polyfunctional T cells that produced Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)- and/or IL-2 in addition to IFN-{gamma}, a hallmark of effective immune responses. Tumor-reactivity in the TIL products correlated with high percentages of CD103+CD69+CD8+ T cell infiltrates in the tumor lesions, with PD-1hiCD4+ T cells, and with FoxP3+CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cell infiltrates, suggesting that the composition of T cell infiltrates may predict the level of tumor reactivity. In conclusion, the effective generation of tumor-reactive and polyfunctional TIL products implies that TIL therapy will be a successful treatment regimen for NSCLC patients.",

The bias greatly controlled the animals choices and confidence on their decisions. During decision formation the phasic activity reflected bias-induced modulations and simultaneously coded reward prediction errors. In contrast, the activity during the delay period was not affected by the bias, was not tuned to the value of the stimuli but was temporally modulated, pointing to a role different from that of the phasic activity.",

In addition, they can be easily derivatized to trigger specific cellular behavior. The 3D shape of such particles can be resolved with superresolution (< 50 nm) accuracy using conventional confocal microscopy. We introduce a computational method that allows us to infer surface traction forces with high sensitivity (~ 10 Pa), directly from the particle shape without embedding tracers in the particle. We illustrate the potential and flexibility of this approach by measuring forces throughout phagocytic engulfment.

Of practical importance, BChE is a promising therapeutic candidate for intoxication by organophosphate nerve agents and insecticides, and for detoxification of addictive substances. Efficacy of the recombinant enzyme hinges on its having a long circulatory half-life; this, in turn, depends strongly on its ability to tetramerize. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of the highly glycosylated native BChE tetramer purified from human plasma at 5.7 [A]. Our structure reveals that the BChE tetramer is organised as a staggered dimer of dimers. Tetramerization is mediated by assembly of the C-terminal tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization (WAT) helices from each subunit as a superhelical assembly around a central anti-parallel polyproline II helix (PRAD). The catalytic domains within a dimer are asymmetrically linked to the WAT/PRAD. In the resulting arrangement, the tetramerization domain is largely shielded by the catalytic domains, which may contribute to the stability of the HuBChE tetramer. Our cryo-EM structure reveals the basis for assembly of the physiological tetramers, and has implications for the therapeutic applications of HuBChE. This mode of tetramerization is seen only in the cholinesterases, and may provide a promising template for designing other proteins with improved circulatory residence times.",

    "abstract": "At its first synapse, the retina establishes two parallel channels that encode light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF). At the same synapse, changes in photoreceptor glutamate release are sensed by ON bipolar cells (BCs) via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), and OFF BCs via ionotropic BCs, which differ in their synaptic configuration with the photoreceptor terminal. ON BCs form invaginating synapses that bring them in close proximity to presynaptic ribbons and the presumed sole source of glutamate release. OFF bipolar cells form flat contacts distal to the ribbon synapse. We investigated the role of LRIT3 in normal assembly and function of the mGlur6 signaling cascade present in ON BCs. We demonstrate that LRIT3 is required for nyctalopin expression and thus TRPM1 expression and function. Using glutamate imaging, whole-cell electrophysiology, and multi-electrode array extracellular recordings we demonstrate that the loss of LRIT3 impacts both the ON and OFF pathways at the level of the BCs. The effect on ON pathway signaling, a lack of ON BC response, is shared by mutants lacking mGluR6, TRPM1 GPR179 or nyctalopin. The effects on the OFF pathway are unique to LRIT3, and include a decrease in response amplitude of both OFF BC and GCs. Based on these results, we propose a working model where LRIT3 is required for either efficient glutamate release or reuptake from the first retinal synapse.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAt the first visual synapse, photoreceptor cells signal to two distinct bipolar cell (BC) populations, one characterized by a depolarizing response to light onset (ON or DBCs), the other by a hyperpolarizing response (OFF or HBCs). The DBC light response depends on a G protein-coupled receptor and associated protein complex, known as the signalplex. Mutations in signalplex proteins lead to DBC pathway-specific loss of visual function. Here we show how loss of LRIT3, a previously identified signalplex protein, prevents functional assembly of the DBC signalplex and alters visual function in both ON and OFF signaling pathways. Thus, our results indicate that the function of LRIT3 at this first synapse extends beyond assembly of the DBC signalplex.",

    "abstract": "An animals survival depends on finding food, and the memory of food and contexts are often linked. Given that the hippocampus is required for spatial and contextual memory, it is reasonable to expect related coding of space and food stimuli in hippocampal neurons. However, relatively little is known about how the hippocampus responds to tastes, the most central sensory property of food. In this study, we examined the taste-evoked responses and spatial firing properties of single units in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region as male rats received a battery of taste stimuli differing in both chemical composition and palatability within a specific spatial context. We identified a subset of hippocampal neurons that responded to tastes, some of which were place cells. These taste and place responses had a distinct interaction: taste-responsive cells tended to have less spatially specific firing fields, and place cells only responded to tastes delivered inside their place field. Like neurons in the amygdala and lateral hypothalamus, hippocampal neurons discriminated between tastes predominantly on the basis of palatability, with taste-selectivity emerging concurrently with palatability-relatedness; these responses did not reflect movement or arousal. However, hippocampal taste responses emerged several hundred msec later than responses in other parts of the taste system, suggesting that the hippocampus does not influence real-time taste decisions, instead associating the hedonic value of tastes with a particular context. This incorporation of taste responses into existing hippocampal maps could be one way that animals use past experience to locate food sources.\\n\\nSignificance statementFinding food is essential for animals survival, and taste and context memory are often linked.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions from dioecy to hermaphroditism must overcome the inertia of sexual dimorphism because modified males or females will express the opposite sexual function for which their phenotypes have been optimized. We tested this prediction by comparing the siring success of female-derived hermaphrodites of the plant Mercurialis annua with males and hermaphrodites that present a male-like inflorescence. We found that pollen dispersed by female-derived hermaphrodites was about a third poorer at siring outcross offspring than that from hermaphrodites with male-like inflorescences, illustrating the notion that a  ghost of dioecy past compromises the fitness of derived hermaphrodites in outcrossing populations. We conclude that whereas dioecy might evolve from hermaphroditism by conferring upon individuals certain benefits of sexual specialization, reversals from dioecy to hermaphroditism must often be limited to situations in which outcrossing cannot be maintained and inbreeding is favored. Our study provides novel empirical support for evolutionary models for the breakdown of dioecy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRelationships between specific microbes and proper immune system development, composition, and function have been reported in a number of studies. However, researchers have discovered only a fraction of the likely relationships. High-dimensional \\\"omic\\\" methodologies such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and Time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) immunophenotyping generate data that support generation of hypotheses, with the potential to identify additional relationships at a level of granularity ripe for further experimentation. Pairwise linear regressions between microbial and host immune features is one approach for quantifying relationships between \\\"omes\\\", and the differences in these relationships across study cohorts or arms. This approach yields a top table of candidate results. However, the top table alone lacks the detail that domain experts need to vet candidate results for follow-up experiments.\\n\\nResultsTo support this vetting, we developed VOLARE (Visualization Of LineAr Regression Elements), a web application that integrates a searchable top table, small in-line graphs illustrating the fitted models, a network summarizing the top table, and on-demand detailed regression plots showing full sample-level detail. We applied VOLARE to three case studies--microbiome:cytokine data from fecal samples in HIV, microbiome:cytokine data in inflammatory bowel disease and spondyloarthritis, and microbiome:immune cell data from gut biopsies in HIV. We present both patient-specific phenomena and relationships that differ by disease state. We also analyzed interaction data from system logs to characterize usage scenarios. This log analysis revealed that, in using VOLARE, domain experts frequently generated detailed regression plots, suggesting that this detail aids the vetting of results.\\n\\nConclusionsSystematically integrating microbe:immune cell readouts through pairwise linear regressions and presenting the top table in an interactive environment supports the vetting of results for scientific relevance. VOLARE allows domain experts to control the analysis of their results, screening dozens of candidate relationships with ease. This interactive environment transcends the limitations of a static top table.",

    "abstract": "Species-energy relationships (SER) have been used scarcely to predict responses of biodiversity to changes in land use. In this work, two hypothesis of the SER were tested on bird communities along urbanization gradients: the increasing population size (IPS) and the niche position (NP) hypotheses. The IPS hypothesis states that sites with more primary productivity have more individuals, decreasing the probability of extinction and increasing species richness. The HPN predicts that sites with greater primary productivity and environmental heterogeneity allow the availability of a greater variety of resources and the presence of specialist species, thus increasing species richness. The hypothesis of habitat heterogeneity was evaluated by which more complex habitats provide more variety of resources and greater species richness. Birds were counted along three urban-rural gradients in the Pampean region of Argentina during the breeding season. The productive energy was measured from the NDVI and the environmental heterogeneity through the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, calculated with the percentage coverage of different substrates. Bird richness and habitat diversity were higher at intermediate levels of urbanization, while primary productivity had a negative relationship with urbanization. Although there was a positive relationship between bird richness and abundance, there was no positive relationship between bird abundance and primary productivity. Bird richness showed a positive relationship with habitat diversity and primary productivity; although path analysis revealed that the habitat diversity increased bird richness through an increase of bird abundance. The NP hypothesis was the most consistent to predict the bird richness along urban-rural gradients.",

    "abstract": "Different parts of a gene can be of differential importance to development and health. This regional heterogeneity is also apparent in the distribution of disease mutations which often cluster in particular regions of disease genes. The ability to precisely estimate functionally important sub-regions of genes will be key in correctly deciphering relationships between genetic variation and disease. Previous methods have had some success using standing human variation to characterize this variability in importance by measuring sub-regional intolerance, i.e., the depletion in functional variation from expectation within a given region of a gene. However, the ability to precisely estimate local intolerance was restricted by the fact that only information within a given sub-region is used, leading to instability in local estimates, especially for small regions. We show that borrowing information across regions using a Bayesian hierarchical model, stabilizes estimates, leading to lower variability and improved predictive utility. Specifically, our approach more effectively identifies regions enriched for ClinVar pathogenic variants. We also identify significant correlations between sub-region intolerance and the distribution of pathogenic variation in disease genes, with AUCs for classifying de novo missense variants in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) genes of up to 0.86 using exonic sub-regions and 0.91 using sub-regions defined by protein domains. This result immediately suggests that considering the intolerance of regions in which variants are found may improve diagnostic interpretation. We also illustrate the utility of integrating regional intolerance into gene-level disease association tests with a study of known disease genes for epileptic encephalopathy.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential element for many biological processes; however, due to its high reactivity iron can also be very toxic, producing reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry. Ferritins protect the cell from oxidative stress by catalytically converting Fe(II) into less toxic Fe(III) and storing the resulting iron minerals within their core. Encapsulated ferritins (EncFtn) are a sub-family of ferritin-like proteins, which are widely distributed in all bacterial and archaeal phyla. We recently characterised the Rhodospirillum rubrum EncFtn, showing that although enzymatically active, due to its open structure it requires the association with an encapsulin nanocage in order to act as an iron store. Given the wide distribution of the EncFtn family in organisms with diverse environmental niches, a question arises as to whether the structure and catalytic activity is conserved across the family. Here we structurally characterise two EncFtn members from the halophile Haliangium ochraceum and the thermophile Pyrococcus furiosus, which show the same distinct annular decamer topology observed in R. rubrum EncFtn, with the ferroxidase centre (FOC) formed between one of the dimer interfaces. Solution and native mass spectrometr analyses show that the stability of the protein quaternary structure differs between EncFtn proteins from different species. The catalytic role of the EncFtn proteins was confirmed by biochemical assays, and we show that Zn(II) ions inhibit the ferroxidase activity of the EncFtn proteins to varying degrees. Our results represent a further step in the characterisation of the recently discovered EncFtn ferritin-like sub-family, indicating a common structural organisation and catalytic activity, despite diverse host environments.",

    "abstract": "Empirical knowledge of ecosystem stability and diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability of population and ecosystem properties. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.",
