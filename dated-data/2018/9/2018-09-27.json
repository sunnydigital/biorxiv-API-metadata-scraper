    "abstract": "The taxonomic identification of mammalian fauna within fossil assemblages is a well-established component of paleoenvironmental reconstructions. However, many fragmentary specimens recovered from fossil sites are often disregarded as they can be difficult to identify with the precision required for taxonomic methods. For this reason, the large numbers of isolated rodent incisors that are often recovered from hominin fossil bearing sites have generally been seen as offering little interpretive value. Ecomorphological analysis, often referred to as a \\\"taxon-free\\\" method, can potentially circumvent this problem by focusing on the adaptive, rather than the taxonomic significance of rodent incisor morphology. Here, we determine if the morphology of the upper incisors of modern southern African rodents reflects dietary behavior using discriminant function analysis. Our model suggests that a strong ecomorphological signal exists in our modern sample and we apply these results to two samples of isolated incisors from the hominin fossil bearing sites, Sterkfontein and Swartkrans.",

    "abstract": "We have extended our previous survey of the association of mitochondrial prevalence in particular tissues with ascites susceptibility in broilers. We previously reported that in breast muscle of 22 week old susceptible line male birds had significantly higher mtDNA copy number relative to nuclear copy number (mtDNA/nucDNA), compared to resistant line male birds. The higher copy number correlated with higher expression of PPARGC1A mRNA gene. Ascites is a significant metabolic disease associated with fast-growing meat-type chickens (broilers) and is a terminal result of pulmonary hypertension syndrome. We now report the mtDNA/nucDNA ratio in lung, liver, heart, thigh, and breast of both genders at 3, and 20 weeks old. At 3 weeks the mtDNA/nucDNA ratio is significantly higher in lung, breast, and thigh for susceptible line males compared to the resistant line males. Conversely, we see the opposite for lung and breast in females. At 20 weeks of age the differences between males from the two lines is lost for lung, and thigh. Although there is a significant reduction in the mtDNA/nucDNA ratio of breast from 3 weeks to 20 weeks in the susceptible line males, the susceptible males remain higher than resistant line males for this specific tissue. We assessed relative expression of five genes known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis for lung, thigh and breast muscle from males and females of both lines with no consistent pattern to explain the marked gender and line differences for these tissues. Our results indicate clear sex differences in mitochondrial biogenesis establishing a strong association between the mtDNA quantity in a tissue-specific manner and correlated with ascites-phenotype. We propose that mtDNA/nucDNA levels could serve as a potential predictive marker in breeding programs to reduce ascites.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is threatening attempts at tuberculosis epidemic control. Molecular diagnostics for drug resistance that rely on the detection of resistance-related mutations could expedite patient care and accelerate progress in TB eradication. We performed minimum inhibitory concentration testing for 12 anti-TB drugs together with Illumina whole genome sequencing on 1452 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates. We then used a linear mixed model to evaluate genome wide associations between mutations in MTB genes or noncoding regions and drug resistance, followed by validation of our findings in an independent dataset of 792 patient isolates. Novel associations at 13 genomic loci were confirmed in the validation set, with 2 involving noncoding regions. We found promoter mutations to have smaller average effects on resistance levels than gene body mutations in genes where both can contribute to resistance. Enabled by a quantitative measure of resistance, we estimated the heritability of the resistance phenotype to 11 anti-TB drugs and identify a lower than expected contribution from known resistance genes. We also report the proportion of variation in resistance levels explained by the novel loci identified here. This study highlights the complexity of the genomic mechanisms associated with the MTB resistance phenotype, including the relatively large number of potentially causative or compensatory loci, and emphasizes the contribution of the noncoding portion of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is one of the most cultured fish species over the world with many different breeds and plenty of published protocols for sperm cryopreservation, however, data regarding preservation of gonadal tissue and surrogate production is still missing. A protocol for freezing common carp spermatogonia was developed through varying different factors along a set of serial subsequent experiments. Among the six cryoprotectants tested, the best survival was achieved with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). In the next experiment, a wide range of cooling rates (0.5-10 {degrees}C/min) and different concentrations of Me2SO were tested resulting in the highest survival using 2 M Me2SO and cooling rate of -1 Q59 A When testing different tissue sizes and incubation times in the cryomedium, the highest viability was observed when incubating 100 mg tissue fragments for 30 min. Finally, sugar supplementation did not yield significant differences. When testing different equilibration (ES) and vitrification solutions (VS) used for needle-immersed vitrification, no significant differences were observed between the tested groups. Additionally, varied exposure time to VS did not improve the vitrification outcome where the viability was 4-fold lower than that of freezing. The functionality of cryopreserved cells was tested by interspecific transplantation into sterilized goldfish recipients. The exogenous origin of the gonads in goldfish recipients was confirmed by molecular markers and incorporation rate was over 40% in both groups at 3 months post transplantation. Results of this study can serve as an alternative way for long-term preservation of germplasm in carp which can be recovered in a surrogate recipient.",

    "abstract": "The green peach aphid (GPA), Myzus persicae S., and the cabbage aphid (CA), Brevicoryne brassicae L., exhibit a feeding preference when exposed to different canola (Brassica napus L.) plant structures. Preference may be associated with the concentration and/or composition of allelochemicals; specifically, glucosinolates (GLS). Furthermore, each aphid species employs a different strategy for tolerating plant defensive chemistry; GPA excretes glucosinolates while CA sequesters these toxic compounds. Given these different detoxification mechanisms, it is possible that both feeding location and aphid species may affect prey suitability for Hippodamia convergens larvae. We conducted a factorial laboratory experiment to evaluate whether one or both factors impacted predator fitness. We hypothesized that plant structures with higher GLS concentrations will negatively affect the development and survival of immature predators, which will also vary based on prey detoxification strategies. Results confirm that when predators fed on either aphid species reared on canola structures having lower GLS concentrations, development was faster than when they fed on aphids reared on structures having higher GLS. Although predators consumed more GPA than CA, consumption rates did not differ between rearing location for GPA, but fewer CA were consumed when reared on reproductive canola parts. These findings suggest that: 1) plant-mediated differences in prey quality exist for canola aphids; 2) the type of adaptation used by aphids to overcome plant defenses have important consequences for prey suitability; and 3) reduced feeding by H. convergens larvae on unsuitable prey may offset deleterious effects of plant defenses against aphid pests. By evaluating source-sink dynamics at the plant level, we can further understand trophic interactions involving plant defenses and how these interactions may influence community dynamics and structure.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most well-studied serotype of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) class of E. coli intestinal pathogens, and is responsible for many outbreaks of serious food-borne illness worldwide each year. Adherence mechanisms are a critical component of its pathogenesis, persistence in natural reservoirs, and environmental contamination. E. coli O157:H7 has a highly effective virulence operon, the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE), and its encoded intimate adherence mechanism is well characterized. However, factors involved in the preceding initial attachment are not well understood. In this study, we propose a mechanism of initial adherence used by E. coli O157:H7 in vitro. We describe a bacterial protein not previously reported to be involved in adherence, Slp, and its interactions with the human host protein polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). The human pIgR has previously been shown to act as an adherence receptor for some mucosal pathogens, and is highly expressed in the intestine. Following observation of significant colocalization between E. coli O157:H7 and pIgR location on Caco-2 cells, a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay using a human recombinant Fc-tagged pIgR protein led to the identification of this protein. Disruption of Slp expression in E. coli O157:H7, through deletion of its encoding gene slp, produced a significant adherence deficiency to Caco-2 cells at early time points associated with initial adherence. Plasmid complementation of slp fully restored the wild-type phenotype. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed evidence that this interaction is specific to the pathogenic strains of E. coli tested, and not the nonpathogenic strain E. coli K12. Additionally, deletion of slp resulted in the absence of the corresponding protein band in further Co-IP assays, while the plasmid-encoded slp complementation of the deletion mutant strain restored the wild-type pattern. These data support the proposal that Slp directly contributes to initial adherence, with the pIgR protein as its proposed receptor.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEscherichia coli O157:H7 and other enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are responsible for tens of thousands of cases of food-borne illness in the United States each year. E. coli O157:H7 has a particularly effective intimate adherence mechanism. However, the mechanisms of initial adherence, which facilitate attachment and virulence prior to the engagement of intimate adherence, are not well understood. In this study, we describe an initial adherence interaction between the E. coli O157:H7 Slp and the human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) expressed by the human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2. The relationship was first demonstrated as a significant colocalization between the locations of E. coli O157:H7 bacterial cells and pIgR protein using immunofluorescence microscopy. The E. coli O157:H7 Slp protein was identified, and disruption of the slp gene resulted in a severe adherence deficiency to Caco-2 cells during initial adherence. This effect was reversed upon complementation of the {Delta}slp strain with a plasmid-encoded slp gene, and the constitutive over-expression of slp resulted in hyper-adherence exceeding that of the wild-type E. coli O157:H7. These data support the proposition that Slp directly contributes to initial adherence, with the pIgR protein as its proposed receptor.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of environmental pH on the synthesis of apple anthocyanins is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the anthocyanin contents of apple calli cultured in media at different pHs (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). The highest anthocyanin content was observed at pH 6.0. Additionally, the moderately acidic conditions up-regulated the expression of MdMYB3 as well as specific anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes (MdDFR and MdUFGT). Moreover, the anthocyanin content was higher in calli overexpressing MdMYB3 than in the wild-type controls at different pHs. Yeast one-hybrid assay results indicated that MdMYB3 binds to the MdDFR and MdUFGT promoters in vivo. An analysis of the MdDFR and MdUFGT promoters revealed multiple MYB-binding sites. Meanwhile, electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that MdMYB3 binds to the MdDFR and MdUFGT promoters in vitro. Furthermore, GUS promoter activity assays suggested that the MdDFR and MdUFGT promoter activities are enhanced by acidic conditions, and the binding of MdMYB3 may further enhance activity. These results implied that an acid-induced apple MYB transcription factor (MdMYB3) promotes anthocyanin accumulation by up-regulating the expression of MdDFR and MdUFGT under moderately acidic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The adherens junction couples the actin cytoskeletons of neighboring cells to provide the foundation for multicellular organization. The core of the adherens junction is the cadherin-catenin complex that arose early in the evolution of multicellularity to link cortical actin to intercellular adhesions. Over time, evolutionary pressures have shaped the signaling and mechanical functions of the adherens junction to meet specific developmental and physiological demands. Evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) identifies genes with correlated fluctuations in evolutionary rate that can reflect shared selective pressures and functions. Here we use ERC to identify genes with evolutionary histories similar to shotgun (shg), which encodes the Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-Cad) ortholog. Core adherens junction components -catenin and p120-catenin displayed strong ERC correlations with shg, indicating that they evolved under similar selective pressures during evolution between Drosophila species. Further analysis of the shg ERC profile revealed a collection of genes not previously associated with shg function or cadherin-mediated adhesion. We then analyzed the function of a subset of ERC-identified candidate genes by RNAi during border cell (BC) migration and identified novel genes that function to regulate DE-Cad. Among these, we found that the gene CG42684, which encodes a putative GTPase activating protein (GAP), regulates BC migration and adhesion. We named CG42684 raskol (\\\"to split\\\" in Russian) and show that it regulates DE-Cad levels and actin protrusions in BCs. We propose that Raskol functions with DE-Cad to restrict Ras/Rho signaling and help guide BC migration. Our results demonstrate that a coordinated selective pressure has shaped the adherens junction and this can be leveraged to identify novel components of the complexes and signaling pathways that regulate cadherin-mediated adhesion.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe establishment of intercellular adhesions facilitated the genesis of multicellular organisms. The adherens junction, which links the actin cytoskeletons of neighboring cells, arose early in the evolution of multicellularity and selective pressures have shaped its function and molecular composition over time. In this study, we used evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis to examine the evolutionary history of the adherens junction and to identify genes that coevolved with the adherens junction gene shotgun, which encodes the Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-Cad). ERC analysis of shotgun revealed a collection of genes with similar evolutionary histories. We then tested the role of these genes in border cell migration in the fly egg chamber, a process that requires the coordinated regulation of cell-cell adhesion and cell motility. Among these, we found that a previously uncharacterized gene CG42684, which encodes a putative GTPase activating protein (GAP), regulates the collective cell migration of border cells, stabilizes cell-cell adhesions and regulates the actin dynamics. Our results demonstrate that components of the adherens junction share an evolutionary history and that ERC analysis is a powerful method to identify novel components of cell adhesion complexes in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial populations that colonize a host can play important roles in host health, including serving as a reservoir that transmits to other hosts and from which invasive strains emerge, thus emphasizing the importance of understanding rates of acquisition and clearance of colonizing populations. Studies of colonization dynamics have been based on assessment of whether serial samples represent a single population or distinct colonization events. With the use of whole genome sequencing to determine genetic distance between isolates, a common solution to estimate acquisition and clearance rates has been to assume a fixed genetic distance threshold below which isolates are considered to represent the same strain. However, this approach is often inadequate to account for the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, the time intervals between consecutive measurements, and the uncertainty in the estimated acquisition and clearance rates. Here, we present a fully Bayesian model that provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing us to determine bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. Our method explicitly models the within-host variation using population genetic simulation, and the inference is done using a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We validate the method with multiple carefully conducted simulations and demonstrate its use in practice by analyzing a collection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a large recently completed longitudinal clinical study. An R-code implementation of the method is freely available at: https://github.com/mjarvenpaa/bacterial-colonization-model.git.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAs colonizing bacterial populations are the source for much transmission and a reservoir for infection, they are a major focus of interest clinically and epidemiologically. Understanding the dynamics of colonization depends on being able to confidently identify acquisition and clearance events given intermittent sampling of hosts. To do so, we need a model of within-host bacterial population evolution from acquisition through the time of sampling that enables estimation of whether two samples are derived from the same population. Past efforts have frequently relied on empirical genetic distance thresholds that forgo an underlying model or employ a simple molecular clock model. Here, we present an inferential method that accounts for the timing of sample collection and population diversification, to provide a probabilistic estimate for whether two isolates represent the same colonizing strain. This method has implications for understanding the dynamics of acquisition and clearance of colonizing bacteria, and the impact on these rates by factors such as sensitivity of the sampling method, pathogen genotype, competition with other carriage bacteria, host immune response, and antibiotic exposure.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to a pathogen primes many organisms to respond faster or more efficiently to subsequent exposures. Such priming can be unspecific or specific, and has been found to extend across generations. Disentangling and quantifying specific and unspecific effects is essential for understanding the genetic epidemiology of a system. By combining a large infection experiment and mathematical modeling, we disentangle different transgenerational effects in the crustacean model Daphnia magna exposed to different strains of the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. In the experiments, we exposed hosts to a high-dose of one of three parasite strains, and subsequently challenged their offspring with multiple doses of the same or a different strain, i. e. homologously or heterogously. We find that exposure to Pasteuria decreases the susceptibility of a hosts offspring by approximately 50%. This transgenerational protection is not larger for homologous than for heterologous parasite challenges. Our work represents an important contribution not only to the analysis of immune priming in ecological systems, but also to the experimental assessment of vaccines. We present for the first time an inference framework to investigate specific and unspecific effects of immune priming on the susceptibility distribution of hosts -- effects that are central to understanding immunity and the effect of vaccines.\\n\\nAuthor summaryImmune memory is a feature of immune systems that forms the basis of vaccination. In opposition to textbook accounts, the ability to specifically remember previous exposures has been found to extend to invertebrates and shown to be able to be passed on from mother to off-spring, i. e. to be transgenerational. In this paper, we investigate the extent of this specificity in unprecedented detail in water fleas. We exposed water flea mothers to different strains of a bacterial pathogen and challenged their offspring with a wide range of doses of a strain that were either identical to (homologous) or different from (heterologous) the strain, to which the mother had been exposed. We find that, while exposure of the mother reduces the susceptibility of the offspring, this effect is not specific. This work outlines the limits of specific transgenerational immune memory in this invertebrate system.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division and peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis are orchestrated by the coordinated dynamic movement of essential protein complexes. Recent studies show that bidirectional treadmilling of FtsZ filaments/bundles is tightly coupled to and limiting for both septal PG synthesis and septum closure in some bacteria, but not in others. Here we report the dynamics of FtsZ movement leading to septal and equatorial ring formation in the ovoid-shaped pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). Conventional and single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFm) showed that nascent rings of FtsZ and its anchoring and stabilizing proteins FtsA and EzrA move out from mature septal rings coincident with MapZ rings early in cell division. This mode of continuous nascent ring movement contrasts with a failsafe streaming mechanism of FtsZ/FtsA/EzrA observed in a {Delta}mapZ mutant and another Streptococcus species. This analysis also provides several parameters of FtsZ treadmilling in nascent and mature rings, including treadmilling velocity in wild-type cells and ftsZ(GTPase) mutants, lifetimes of FtsZ subunits in filaments and of entire FtsZ filaments/bundles, and the processivity length of treadmilling of FtsZ filament/bundles. In addition, we delineated the motion of the septal PBP2x transpeptidase and its FtsW glycosyl transferase binding partner relative to FtsZ treadmilling in Spn cells. Five lines of evidence support the conclusion that movement of the bPBP2x:FtsW complex in septa depends on PG synthesis and not on FtsZ treadmilling. Together, these results support a model in which FtsZ dynamics and associations organize and distribute septal PG synthesis, but do not control its rate in Spn.\\n\\nSignificanceThis study answers two long-standing questions about FtsZ dynamics and its relationship to septal PG synthesis in Spn for the first time. In previous models, FtsZ concertedly moves from midcell septa to MapZ rings that have reached the equators of daughter cells. Instead, the results presented here show that FtsZ, FtsA, and EzrA filaments/bundles move continuously out from early septa as part of MapZ rings. In addition, this study establishes that the movement of bPBP2x:FtsW complexes in septal PG synthesis depends on and likely mirrors new PG synthesis and is not correlated with the treadmilling of FtsZ filaments/bundles. These findings are consistent with a mechanism where septal FtsZ rings organize directional movement of bPBP2x:FtsW complexes dependent on PG substrate availability.",

    "abstract": "Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is a conserved multistep pathway. The first step, the conversion of GTP to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP), requires bicsistronic MOCS1. Alternative splicing of MOCS1 in exons 1 and 9 produces four different N-terminal and three different C-terminal products (type I-III). Type I splicing results in bicistronic transcripts with two open reading frames, of which only the first, MOCS1A, is translated, whereas type II/III splicing produces two-domain MOCS1AB proteins. Here, we report and characterize the mitochondrial translocation of alternatively spliced MOCS1 proteins. While MOCS1A requires exon 1a for mitochondrial translocation, MOCS1AB variants target to mitochondria via an internal motif overriding the N-terminal targeting signal. Within mitochondria, MOCS1AB undergoes proteolytic cleavage resulting in mitochondrial matrix localization of the MOCS1B domain. In conclusion we found that MOCS1 produces two functional proteins, MOCS1A and MOCS1B, which follow different translocation routes before mitochondrial matrix import, where both proteins collectively catalyze cPMP biosynthesis. MOCS1 protein maturation provides a novel mechanism of alternative splicing ensuring the coordinated targeting of two functionally related mitochondrial proteins encoded by a single gene.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, DNA damage repair is implemented by a host of proteins that are coordinated by defined molecular signals. One such signal that transpires during the Fanconi Anemia (FA) - interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair pathway is the site-specific monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI proteins by a large, multi-protein FA core complex. The mechanics for this exquisitely specific monoubiquitin signal has been elusive. Here we show FANCL, the RING E3 module of the FA core complex, allosterically activates its cognate E2 Ube2T for monoubiquitination by a mechanism distinct from the typical RING-based catalysis. FANCL triggers intricate re-wiring of Ube2Ts intra-residue network thus activating the E2 for precision targeting. This network is intrinsically regulated by conserved gates and loops which can be engineered to yield Ube2T variants that enhance FANCD2 ubiquitination by ~30-fold without compromising on target specificity. Finally, we also uncover allosteric networks in other ubiquitin E2s that can be leveraged by RING E3 ligases to drive specific ubiquitination.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of residual structures persistent in unfolded proteins in concentrated denaturant solution is currently an important issue in studies of protein folding, because the residual structure present, if any, in the unfolded state may form a folding initiation site and guide the subsequent folding reactions. Here, we thus studied the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D)-exchange behavior of unfolded ubiquitin in 6.0 M guanidinium chloride at pH 2.6 and 20{degrees}C. We employed a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-quenched H/D-exchange NMR technique with the use of spin desalting columns, which allowed us to make a quick medium exchange from 6.0 M guanidinium chloride to a quenching DMSO solution. The technique is particularly effective for studies of the H/D-exchange kinetics of unfolded proteins in concentrated denaturant. By the backbone resonance assignment of the hetero-nuclear single quantum coherence spectrum of 15N-labeled ubiquitin in the DMSO solution, we successfully investigated the H/D-exchange kinetics of 27 identified peptide amide groups in the ubiquitin sequence. Although most of these amide groups were not protected, the four amide groups of Ile3, Val5, Ile13 and Leu73 were weakly but significantly protected with a protection factor of 2.5-3.0, indicating that there were residual structures in unfolded ubiquitin and that these amide groups were 60-67% hydrogen-bonded by the residual structures. We show that the first native {beta}-hairpin, composed of residues 2-16 in the native ubiquitin structure, is partially structured even in 6.0 M guanidinium chloride and that the amide group of Leu73 is protected by a nonnative hydrogen-bonding interaction. From comparison with the previous folding studies of ubiquitin, it is concluded that the residual native {beta}-hairpin in unfolded ubiquitin forms a folding initiation site and guides the subsequent folding reactions of the protein.",

    "abstract": "Certain antibiotics, particularly fluoroquinolones, induce the mutagenic SOS response and increase the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been associated with antibiotic lethality. Both SOS and ROS promote bacterial mutagenesis, fueling the emergence of resistant mutants during antibiotic treatments. However, the relative contribution of ROS and SOS on this antibioticmediated mutagenesis is currently unknown. We used the antioxidant molecule N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to study the contribution of ROS on the SOS response and the mutagenesis mediated by the fluoroquinolone anti-biotic ciprofloxacin (CIP). We show that NAC is able to reduce intracellular ROS levels, as well as the SOS response caused by treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of CIP, without affecting its anti-bacterial activity. This effect reduces anti-bioticinduced mutagenesis to levels comparable to a translesion synthesis DNA-polymerases deficient strain, suggesting that ROS play a major role in SOS-induced mutagenesis. Collectively, our results shed light on the mechanisms underlying antibioticinduced mutagenesis and open the possibility for the use of NAC as adjuvant in antibiotic therapy to hinder the development of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Weaning is a critical transition phase in swine production in which piglets must cope with different stressors that may affect their health. During this period, the prophylactic use of antibiotics is still frequent to limit piglet morbidity, which raises both economic and public health concerns such as the appearance of antimicrobial-resistant microbes. With the interest of developing tools for assisting health and management decisions around weaning, it is key to provide robustness indexes that inform on the animals capacity to endure the challenges associated to weaning. This work aimed at developing a modelling approach for facilitating the quantification of piglet resilience to weaning. We monitored 325 Large White pigs weaned at 28 days of age and further housed and fed conventionally during the post-weaning period without antibiotic administration. Body weight and diarrhoea scores were recorded before and after weaning, and blood was sampled at weaning and one week later for collecting haematological data. We constructed a dynamic model based on the Gompertz-Makeham law to describe live weight trajectories during the first 75 days after weaning following the rationale that the animal response is partitioned in two time windows (a perturbation and a recovery window). Model calibration was performed for each animal. Our results show that the transition time between the two time windows, as well as the weight trajectories are characteristic for each individual. The model captured the weight dynamics of animals at different degrees of perturbation, with an average coefficient of determination of 0.99, and a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.99. The utility of the model is that it provides biological parameters that inform on the amplitude and length of perturbation, and the rate of animal recovery. Our rationale is that the dynamics of weight inform on the capability of the animal to cope with the weaning disturbance. Indeed, there were significant correlations between model parameters and individual diarrhoea scores and haematological traits. Overall, the parameters of our model can be useful for constructing weaning robustness indexes by using exclusively the growth curves. We foresee that this modelling approach will provide a step forward in the quantitative characterization of robustness.\\n\\nImplicationsThe quantitative characterization of animal robustness at weaning is a key step for management strategies to improve health and welfare. This characterization is also instrumental for the further design of selection strategies for productivity and robustness. Within a precision livestock farming optic, this study develops a mathematical modelling approach to describe the body weight of piglets from weaning with the rationale that weight trajectories provide central information to quantify the capability of the animal to cope with the weaning disturbance.",

Here we find that injury to the adult Drosophila epithelium causes cells to enter the endocycle through the activation of Yorkie dependent genes (myc, e2f1, or cycE). Myc is even sufficient to induce the endocycle in the post-mitotic epithelium. As result, epithelial cells enter S phase but mitosis is blocked by inhibition of mitotic gene expression. The mitotic cell cycle program can be activated by simultaneously expressing the mitotic activator, Stg, while genetically depleting fzr. However, forcing cells to undergo mitosis is detrimental to wound repair as the adult fly epithelium accumulates DNA damage and mitotic errors ensue when cells are forced to proliferate. In conclusion, we find that wound-induced polyploidization enables tissue repair when cell division is not a viable option.",

We used species distribution models (SDMs) coupled with dynamic simulations of migration to assess: 1. the extinction risk posed to this species in its native Iberian range under climate change; 2. whether SDMs calibrated on the native range (replicating typical translocation planning) could predict invasive capacity in NW Europe; and 3. the extent to which recommended biogeographical constrains on translocations may limit available options. Insights gained on the above were used to build and test a generic decision framework for translocation, based on robust identification of microrefugia.\\n\\nResultsOur findings suggest a high likelihood of climate-induced extinction for R.p. ssp. baeticum in its native range. Notably, SDMs completely failed to predict invasive capacity in NW Europe. However, application of our framework was successful in identifying sites more proximate to the native range - albeit outside this species current biogeographic region - potentially suited to translocation.\\n\\nMain conclusionsThe framework here developed can be used to guide translocation of climate-endangered species in a spatially and temporally precise manner. However, we caution that use of SDMs can possess short-comings in failing to capture a full picture of sites suited to translation, and in risk assessment of the capacity of translocated taxa to form invasive species. Strict biogeographic constraints to the selection of translocation sites can evidently help to safeguard against invasions, but may also severely hinder the options available to avert climate-induced extinctions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCrops are often selected for traits that confer a selective disadvantage in the wild. A key trait that has been greatly altered by domestication is investment in herbivore defence. It remains unclear, however, whether variation in chemical defence affects a crops ability to colonize semi-natural habitats where it typically has to compete with a resident community. Here, we investigate how breeding efforts aimed at reducing glucosinolate levels in seeds - canonical herbivore deterrents - influence initial establishment of Brassica populations spanning a wild-feral-domesticated gradient.\\n\\nMethodsWe followed the dynamics of twenty-nine Brassica accessions in two experimental fields by recording life table parameters and vegetation cover biannually over a two-year period. Accessions were selected to vary in their glucosinolate content, and included lines of wild turnip (B. rapa), feral B. napus as well as modern canola and historical oilseed rape cultivars. Populations were established by sowing seeds on bare soil after which the natural vegetation was allowed to regenerate, providing a temporal gradient in the degree of interspecific competition.\\n\\nResultsPopulations flourished in the first year, but many perished during a second year of growth, in particular those of oilseed rape. Declines coincided with an increase in vegetation cover, but were slower in populations harbouring more glucosinolates. These compounds had opposing effects on different life cycle stages: seedling establishment was greater in high-glucosinolate lines, which traded off with reduced post-recruitment survival. Crucially, the effect of glucosinolates on persistence was lost when focussing on oilseed rape only, but the underlying demographic trade-off remained.\\n\\nDiscussionOur study illustrates that initial establishment of feral oilseed rape is governed by glucosinolate-mediated trade-offs between seedling recruitment and subsequent survival, with low-glucosinolate lines (modern canola) being most successful when post-recruitment conditions are relatively benign. Such demographic trade-offs likely extend to other species, and must be considered when managing escaped crops and invasive plants.",

Random-effects meta-analyses of 31 studies including 1087 healthy adults yielded large negative age effects in 5-HT-2A receptors, moderate negative age effects in 5-HT transporters, and small negative age effects in 5-HT-1A receptors. Age differences were significantly larger in 5-HT-2A receptors compared to 5-HT-1A receptors. A meta-regression showed that 5-HT target, brain region, tracer kinetic measure, radionuclide, and publication year significantly moderated the age effect. The findings overall identify reduced serotonergic signal transmission in age. The evidence for a relative preservation of 5-HT-1A compared to 5-HT-2A receptors may partially explain differential psychological changes with age, such as why older people use more emotion-focused rather than problem-focused coping strategies.",

However, its global effects on the genome, including euchromatin, are less well understood. Here we develop Formaldehyde-Assisted Identification of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) for C. elegans to examine the chromatin configuration of mutants that lack virtually all H3K9me3, while leaving H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 intact. We find that nucleosomes are mildly disrupted, and levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 rise in mutant embryos. In addition to these expected changes, the most dramatic change occurs in euchromatin: many regions encompassing transcription start sites (TSSs) gain an average of two nucleosomes in mutants. The affected regions normally lack H3K9me3, revealing a locus non-autonomous role for H3K9me3. Affected TSSs are associated with genes that are active in epithelia and muscles, and implicated in development, locomotion, morphogenesis and transcription. Mutant embryos develop normally under ideal laboratory conditions but die when challenged, with defects in morphogenesis and development. Our findings reveal that H3K9me3 protects transcription start sites within euchromatin from nucleosome deposition. These results may be relevant to mammals, where diseases that disrupt the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin can alter epithelial and muscle gene expression.",

    "abstract": "In ecology, species can mitigate their extinction risks in uncertain environments by diversifying individual phenotypes. This observation is quantified by the theory of bet-hedging, which provides a reason for the degree of phenotypic diversity observed even in clonal populations. The theory of bet-hedging in well-mixed populations is rather well developed. However, many species underwent range expansions during their evolutionary history, and the importance of phenotypic diversity in such scenarios still needs to be understood. In this paper, we develop a theory of bet-hedging for populations colonizing new, unknown environments that fluctuate either in space or time. In this case, we find that bet-hedging is a more favorable strategy than in well-mixed populations. For slow rates of variation, temporal and spatial fluctuations lead to different outcomes. In spatially fluctuating environments, bet-hedging is favored compared to temporally fluctuating environments. In the limit of frequent environmental variation, no opportunity for bet-hedging exists, regardless of the nature of the environmental fluctuations. For the same model, bet-hedging is never an advantageous strategy in the well-mixed case, supporting the view that range expansions strongly promote diversification. These conclusions are robust against stochasticity induced by finite population sizes. Our findings shed light on the importance of phenotypic heterogeneity in range expansions, paving the way to novel approaches to understand how biodiversity emerges and is maintained.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEcological populations are often exposed to unpredictable and variable environmental conditions. A number of strategies have evolved to cope with such uncertainty. One of them is stochastic phenotypic switching, by which some individuals in the community are enabled to tackle adverse conditions, even at the price of reducing overall growth in the short term. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of these \\\"bet-hedging\\\" strategies for a population in the process of colonizing new territory. We show that bet-hedging is more advantageous when the environment varies spatially rather than temporally, and infrequently rather than frequently.",

Previously, we demonstrated that oil pollution affected gene expression patterns and altered genetic variation in natural populations of the foundation salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora. Here, we used a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing approach, epigenotyping by sequencing (epiGBS), to examine relationships among DNA sequence, DNA methylation, gene expression, and exposure to oil pollution. We documented genetic and methylation differentiation between oil-exposed and unexposed populations, suggesting that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill may have selected on genetic variation, and either selected on epigenetic variation or induced particular epigenotypes and expression patterns in exposed compared to unexposed populations. In support of the potential for differential response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we demonstrate genotypic differences in response to oil under controlled conditions. Overall, these findings demonstrate genetic variation, epigenetic variation and gene expression are correlated to exposure to oil pollution, which may all contribute to the response to environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval of long-term episodic memories is characterised by synchronised neural activity between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), with additional evidence that vmPFC activity leads that of the hippocampus. It has been proposed that the mental generation of scene imagery is a crucial component of episodic memory processing. If this is the case, then a comparable interaction between the two brain regions should exist during the construction of novel scene imagery. To address this question, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the construction of novel mental imagery. We tasked male and female humans with imagining scenes and single isolated objects in response to one-word cues. We performed source level power, coherence and causality analyses to characterise the underlying inter-regional interactions. Both scene and object imagination resulted in theta power changes in the anterior hippocampus. However, higher theta coherence was observed between the hippocampus and vmPFC in the scene compared to the object condition. This inter-regional theta coherence also predicted whether or not imagined scenes were subsequently remembered. Dynamic causal modelling of this interaction revealed that vmPFC drove activity in hippocampus during novel scene construction. Additionally, theta power changes in the vmPFC preceded those observed in the hippocampus. These results constitute the first evidence in humans that episodic memory retrieval and scene imagination rely on similar vmPFC-hippocampus neural dynamics. Furthermore, they provide support for theories emphasising similarities between both cognitive processes, and perspectives that propose the vmPFC guides the construction of context-relevant representations in the hippocampus.\n\nSignificance statementEpisodic memory retrieval is characterised by a dialogue between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). It has been proposed that the mental generation of scene imagery is a crucial component of episodic memory processing. An ensuing prediction would be of a comparable interaction between the two brain regions during the construction of novel scene imagery. Here, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG), and combined it with a scene imagination task. We found that a hippocampal-vmPFC dialogue existed, and that it took the form of vmPFC driving the hippocampus. We conclude that episodic memory and scene imagination share fundamental neural dynamics, and the process of constructing vivid, spatially coherent, contextually appropriate scene imagery is strongly modulated by vmPFC.",

    "abstract": "European pit-building antlions (Myrmeleon inconspicuus / Rambur 1842) are studied in their capacity to detect vibrations generated by the locomotion of an ant (Cataglyphis cursor) outside the pit. These locomotions have been recorded by laser velocimetry and copied in detail in their time sequences. The sequences are replicated by micro-controllers digital outputs acting on piezoelectric transducers placed several centimeters outside the peripheries of the pits: their actions on the surface of a sand media create surface waves with particle accelerations that are 3 orders of magnitude less than g, alleviating any possibility of sand avalanche towards the bottom of the pit. Depending on the amplitude of the vibrations, the antlions answer back, generally by sand tossing. One remarkable feature is the time delay from the start of the cue and the aggressive behavior induced by this cue. This time delay is studied versus the cue amplitude. The result of this work is that anlions answer back within minutes to cues with amplitudes between 1 to 2 nanometers at the level of their mechanosensors, and within seconds to these same cues if they are preceded by a sequence of signals at the [A]ngstrom amplitude. This induced aggressive behaviour evidences the sensitivity to vibrations at extremely low level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene expression profiling has benefited medicine by providing clinically relevant insights at the molecular candidate and systems levels. However, to adopt a more  precision approach that integrates individual variability including  omics data into risk assessments, diagnoses, and therapeutic decision making, whole transcriptome expression analysis requires methodological advancements. One need is for users to confidently be able to make individual-level inferences from whole transcriptome data. We propose that biological replicates in isogenic conditions can provide a framework for testing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a single subject (ss) in absence of an appropriate external reference standard or replicates.\\n\\nMethodsEight ss methods for identifying genes with differential expression (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, mixture model, DESeq, DESeq2, iDEG, and ensemble) were compared in Yeast (parental line versus snf2 deletion mutant; n=42/condition) and MCF7 breast-cancer cell (baseline and stimulated with estradiol; n=7/condition) RNA-Seq datasets where replicate analysis was used to build reference standards from NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2. Each dataset was randomly partitioned so that approximately two-thirds of the paired samples were used to construct reference standards and the remainder were treated separately as single-subject sample pairs and DEGs were assayed using ss methods. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall plots were determined for all ss methods against each RSs in both datasets (525 combinations).\\n\\nResultsConsistent with prior analyses of these data, ~50% and ~15% DEGs were respectively obtained in Yeast and MCF7 reference standard datasets regardless of the analytical method. NOISeq, edgeR and DESeq were the most concordant and robust methods for creating a reference standard. Single-subject versions of NOISeq, DEGseq, and an ensemble learner achieved the best median ROC-area-under-the-curve to compare two transcriptomes without replicates regardless of the type of reference standard (>90% in Yeast, >0.75 in MCF7).\\n\\nConclusionBetter and more consistent accuracies are obtained by an ensemble method applied to singlesubject studies across different conditions. In addition, distinct specific sing-subject methods perform better according to different proportions of DEGs. Single-subject methods for identifying DEGs from paired samples need improvement, as no method performs with both precision>90% and recall>90%. http://www.lussiergroup.org/publications/EnsembleBiomarker",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS), overlapping type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypertension, based on high-fat diet, poses risk for cardiovascular disease. A critical feature associated with such risk is the functional impairment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors are known not only to inhibit degradation of incretins to control blood glucose levels, but also to improve EPC bioactivity and induce anti-inflammatory effects in tissues. In the present study, we investigated the effects of such an inhibitor, MK-06266, in ischemia model of MS using diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. EPC bioactivity was examined in MK-0626-administered DIO mice and non-treated control group, using an EPC colony-forming assay and bone marrow cKit+ Sca-1+ lineage-cells, and peripheral blood-mononuclear cells. Our results showed that, in vitro, the effect of MK-0626 treatment on EPC bioactivities and differentiation was superior in comparison with non-treatment. Further, in vivo hindlimb ischemia model experiment indicated that microvascular density and pericyte-recruited arteriole number were increased in MK-0626-administered group, but not control group. Lineage profiling of isolated cells from ischemic tissues disclosed that MK-0626 administration has an inhibitory effect on unproductive inflammation. This occurred via a decrease in the influx of total blood cells and pro-inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, total macrophages, M1, total T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and B-cells, with a concomitant increase in number of regeneration-associated cells, such as M2/M ratio and Treg/T-helper. Laser Doppler analysis revealed that at day 14 after ischemic injury, blood perfusion in hindlimb was grater in DIO mice treated with MK-0626, but not in control. In conclusion, the dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitor has a positive effect on EPC differentiation in MS model of DIO mice. Following ischemic injury, DPP-4 i sharply reduces recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells into ischemic tissue, and triggers regeneration and reparation process. Thus, DPP-4 i is a promising therapeutic agent for MS treatment.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new biological modeling approach is proposed for predicting complex heterogeneous subcellular behaviors. Cell protrusion which initiates cell migration has a significant amount of subcellular heterogeneity in micrometer length and minute time scales. It is driven by actin polymerization, e.g., pushing the plasma membrane forward, and then regulated by a multitude of actin regulators. While mathematical modeling is central to system-level understandings of cell protrusion, most of the modeling is based on the ensemble average of actin regulator dynamics at the cellular or population levels, preventing from capturing the heterogeneous cellular activities. With these in mind, a systematic modeling framework is proposed in this paper for predicting velocities of heterogeneous protrusion of migrating cells driven by multiple molecular mechanisms. The modeling framework is developed through the integration of the multiple AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) models employing probability density input variables. Unlike conventional ARX models, it provides an effective framework for modeling heterogeneous subcellular behaviors with complex nonlinearities and uncertainties of dynamic systems. To train and validate the proposed model, numerous subcellular time series are extracted from time-lapse movies of migrating PtK1 cells using spinning disk confocal microscope: The current edge velocities and fluorescent intensities of mDia1, actin at the leading edge are used as the input while the future cell edge velocities are selected as an output. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is highly effective in predicting the future trends of heterogeneous cell protrusion. In particular, by capturing the various multiple activities from the dataset, it is expected that it would improve the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying cellular and subcellular heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Many computational models for analyzing and predicting cell physiology rely on in vitro data, collected in dilute and cleanly controlled buffer solutions. However, this can mislead models because about 40% of the intracellular volume is occupied by a dense mixture of proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, RNA, and DNA. These intracellular macromolecules interact with enzymes and their reactants and affect the kinetics of biochemical reactions, making in vivo reactions considerably more complex than the in vitro data indicates. In this work, we present a new type of kinetics that captures and quantifies the effect of volume exclusion and any other spatial phenomena on the kinetics of elementary reactions. We further developed a framework that allows for the efficient parameterization of this type of kinetics using particle simulations. Our formulation, entitled GEneralized Elementary Kinetics (GEEK), can be used to analyze and predict the effect of intracellular crowding on enzymatic reactions and was herein applied to investigate the influence of crowding on phosphoglycerate mutase in Escherichia coli, which exhibits prototypical reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Current research indicates that many enzymes are reaction limited and not diffusion limited, and our results suggest that the influence of fractal diffusion is minimal for these reaction-limited enzymes. Instead, increased association rates and decreased dissociation rates lead to a strong decrease in the effective maximal velocities Vmax and the effective Michaelis-Menten constants KM under physiologically relevant volume occupancies. Finally, the effects of crowding in the context of a linear pathway were explored, with the finding that crowding can have a redistributing effect, relative to ideal conditions, on the effective flux responses in the case of two-fold enzyme overexpression. We suggest that the presented framework in combination with detailed kinetics models will improve our understanding of enzyme reaction networks under non-ideal conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral lines of evidence support the hypothesis that impaired function of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) might be involved in the aetiology of schizophrenia. NMDAR is activated by phosphorylation by Fyn and there is also some evidence to suggest that abnormalities in Fyn functionality could also be involved in susceptibility to schizophrenia. In a recent weighted burden analysis of exome sequenced schizophrenia cases and controls we noted modest statistical evidence for an enrichment of rare, functional variants in FYN, GRIN1 and GRIN2B in schizophrenia cases.\\n\\nAimsTo test the plausibility of the hypothesis that schizophrenia susceptibility might be associated with genetic variants predicted to cause impaired functioning of NMDAR, either directly or indirectly through impairment of the kinases which phosphorylate it.\\n\\nMethodIn an exome sequenced sample of 4225 schizophrenia cases and 5834 controls rare variants occurring in genes for the NMDAR subunits and for the kinases acting on it were annotated. The counts of disruptive and damaging variants were compared between cases and controls and the distribution of amino acids affected by damaging variants were visualised in ProteinPaint and the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Special attention was paid to tyrosine residues subject to phosphorylation.\\n\\nResultsThere was no suggestion that abnormalities of the serine-threonine kinases or of Src were associated with schizophrenia. 3 cases and no controls had a disruptive variant in GRIN2A and 2 cases and no controls had a disruptive variant in FYN. 14 cases and 3 controls had damaging variants in FYN and all the variants in controls affected amino acid residues in the N-terminal region outside of any known functional domains. By contrast, 10 variants in cases affected amino acids in functional domains and in the 3D structure of Fyn two of the amino acid substitions, A376T and Q517E, were adjacent to each other. 8 cases and 1 control had damaging variants in GRIN1 but there was no obvious pattern with respect to particular functional domains being affected in this or other genes. A single case had a variant in GRIN2A affecting a well-supported phosphorylation site, Y943C, and three cases had a variant which produce an amino acid change, T216S, which lies two residues away from two well-supported phosphorylation sites. Aside from this, there was no suggestion that tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Fyn or NMDAR were affected.\\n\\nConclusionsThe numbers of variants involved are too small for firm conclusions to be drawn. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that about 0.5% of subjects with schizophrenia have disruptive or damaging genetic variants which could plausibly impair functioning of NMDAR directly or indirectly through impairing Fyn function.",

Despite our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of heavy metal uptake by plants, experimentally addressing the real-time whole-plant dynamics of heavy metal uptake and partitioning has remained a challenge. To overcome this, we applied a high sensitivity gamma-ray imaging system to image uptake and transport of radioactive 65Zn in whole-plant assays of Arabidopsis thaliana and the Zn hyperaccumulator A. halleri. We show that our system can be used to quantitatively image and measure uptake and root-to-shoot translocation dynamics of zinc in real time. In the metal hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri, 65Zn uptake and transport from its growth media to the shoot occurs rapidly and on time scales similar to those reported in rice. In transgenic A. halleri plants in which expression of the zinc transporter gene HMA4 is suppressed by RNAi, 65Zn uptake is completely abolished.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTWe have used gamma-ray imaging to visualize the stark differences of real-time whole-plant dynamics of zinc root-to-shoot transport in heavy metal hyperaccumulating and non-accumulating Arabidopsis.",

Conventional diagnoses using a combination of clinical presentation and descriptive biopsy information do not accurately predict risk for progression in patients with nephrotic syndrome, which complicates disease management. To address this challenge, a transcriptome-driven approach was used to classify patients with minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE). Transcriptome-based classification revealed a group of patients at risk for disease progression. High risk patients had a transcriptome profile consistent with TNF activation. Non-invasive urine biomarkers TIMP1 and CCL2 (MCP1), which are causally downstream of TNF, accurately predicted TNF activation in the NEPTUNE cohort setting the stage for patient stratification approaches and precision medicine in kidney disease.",

The evolution of this protein family is closely linked to the tempo of retrotransposable element (RTE) invasions, with specific KZNF family members demonstrated to transcriptionally repress specific families of RTEs3,4. The competing selective pressures between RTEs and the KZNFs results in evolutionary arms races whereby KZNFs evolve to recognize RTEs, while RTEs evolve to escape KZNF recognition5. Evolutionary analyses of the primate-specific RTE family L1PA and two of its KZNF binders, ZNF93 and ZNF649, reveal specific nucleotide and amino changes consistent with an arms race scenario. Our results suggest a model whereby ZNF649 and ZNF93 worked together to target independent motifs within the L1PA RTE lineage. L1PA elements eventually escaped the concerted action of this KZNF \\\"team\\\" over [~]30 million years through two distinct mechanisms: a slow accumulation of point mutations in the ZNF649 binding site and a rapid, massive deletion of the entire ZNF93 binding site.",

Activation of the Wingless-related-integration-site (WNT) pathway is associated with a bad prognosis. Using Drosophila and primary xenograft models of human GB, we describe a mechanism that leads to the activation of WNT signaling [Wingless (Wg) in Drosophila] in tumor cells. GB cells display a network of tumor microtubes (TMs) which enwraps neurons, accumulates Wg receptor Frizzled1 (Fz1), and, thereby, actively depletes Wg from the neurons. Consequently, GB cells proliferate due to {beta}-catenin activation, and neurons degenerate due to Wg signaling extinction. This novel view explains both neuron-dependent tumor progression, and also the neural decay associated with GB.",

Cross-fold validation schemes which properly segregate pairs with shared features show markedly reduced ability to predict enhancer-promoter interactions from epigenomic state.

Though not tested in human studies, recent primate studies indicate that the gut microbiome may also be a biological mechanism linking relationships to health. Integrating microbiota data into the 60-year-old Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we found that socialness with family and friends is associated with differences in the human fecal microbiota. Analysis of spouse (N = 94) and sibling pairs (N = 83) further revealed that spouses have more similar microbiota and more bacterial taxa in common than siblings, with no observed differences between sibling and unrelated pairs. These differences held even after accounting for dietary factors. The differences between unrelated individuals and married couples was driven entirely by couples who reported close relationships; there were no differences in similarity between couples reporting somewhat close relationships and unrelated individuals. Moreover, the microbiota of married individuals, compared to those living alone, has greater diversity and richness, with the greatest diversity among couples reporting close relationships, which is notable given decades of research documenting the health benefits of marriage. These results suggest that human interactions, especially sustained, close marital relationships, influence the gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Stemming biodiversity loss requires strategic conservation guided by well-articulated and achievable targets, whether they be proactive (e.g., protect diverse places) or reactive (e.g., protect threatened species). Both types of targets can be effective, but there are trade-offs, especially for broadly-distributed ecosystems or taxa, such as migratory species, a group for which conservation has been challenged by limited knowledge of distributions throughout the annual cycle. We combined novel spatiotemporal distribution models with population trend data to first examine focal areas for the conservation of Neotropical migratory birds (n=112 species) during the non-breeding period in the Western Hemisphere based on a proactive approach (highest diversity) versus a reactive approach (strongest declines) to conservation. For the focal areas, we then assessed the extent of recent anthropogenic impact, protected area status and projected future changes in land cover using three shared socioeconomic pathways (Sustainability=SSP1, Business-as-usual=SSP2, Regional nationalism=SSP3). Spatial priorities were strikingly different when targeting areas of high species diversity, emphasizing southern Mexico and northern Central America, versus areas with more severe declines across species, emphasizing the Andean cordilleras of South America. Only a fraction of the non-breeding region (1.4%) met targets for diversity and decline, mostly in southern Central America. Current levels of protection were similar for the two targets. Areas prioritized to conserve high species diversity have experienced less recent anthropogenic impact than areas prioritized for decline but are predicted to experience more rapid land conversion to less suitable open, agricultural landscapes in the next three decades under both an SSP1 and SSP2 scenario. Only the SSP3 scenario projected similar conversion rates for the two targets. Our findings indicate how even within taxa, efficient conservation efforts will depend on the careful consideration of desired targets combined with reliable predictions about the locations and types of land cover change under alternative socioeconomic futures.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis is a cellular program that generates haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. While chromosome events that contribute to reducing ploidy (homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination) are well conserved, their execution varies across species and even between sexes of the same species. The telomere bouquet is a conserved feature of meiosis that was first described nearly a century ago, yet its role is still debated. Here we took advantage of the prominent telomere bouquet in zebrafish, Danio rerio, and super-resolution microscopy to show that axis morphogenesis, synapsis, and the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) all take place within the immediate vicinity of telomeres. We established a coherent timeline of events and tested the dependence of each event on the formation of Spo11-induced DSBs. First, we found that the axis protein Sycp3 loads adjacent to telomeres and extends inward, suggesting a specific feature common to all telomeres seeds the development of the axis. Second, we found that newly formed axes near telomeres engage in presynaptic co-alignment by a mechanism that depends on DSBs, even when stable juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes at interstitial regions is not yet evident. Third, we were surprised to discover that ~30% of telomeres in early prophase I engage in associations between two or more chromosome ends and these interactions decrease in later stages. Finally, while pairing and synapsis were disrupted in both spo11 males and females, their reproductive phenotypes were starkly different; spo11 mutant males failed to produce sperm while females produced offspring with severe developmental defects. Our results support zebrafish as an important vertebrate model for meiosis with implications for differences in fertility and genetically derived birth defects in males and females.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInherent to reproduction is the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next. In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes an equal amount of genetic information, packaged in chromosomes, to the offspring. Diploid organisms, like humans, have two copies of every chromosome, while their haploid gametes (e.g. eggs and sperm) have only one. This reduction in ploidy depends on the segregation of chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in gametes with one copy of each chromosome. Missegregation of the chromosomes in the parents leads to abnormal chromosome numbers in the offspring, which is usually lethal or has detrimental developmental effects. While it has been known for over a century that homologous chromosomes pair and recombine to facilitate proper segregation, how homologs find their partners has remained elusive. A structure that has been central to the discussion of homolog pairing is the bouquet, or the dynamic clustering of telomeres during early stages of meiosis. Here we use zebrafish to show that the telomere bouquet is the site where key events leading to homologous chromosome pairing are coordinated. Furthermore, we show that deletion of spo11, a gene required for proper recombination in most studied organisms, resulted in very different effects in males and females where males were sterile while females produced deformed progeny.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen composition of the grape must has an impact on yeast growth and fermentation kinetics as well as on the organoleptic properties of the final product. In some technological processes, such as white wine/rose winemaking, the yeast-assimilable nitrogen content is sometimes insufficient to cover yeast requirements, which can lead to slow or sluggish fermentations. Growth is nevertheless quickly restored upon relief from nutrient starvation, e.g. through the addition of ammonium nitrogen, allowing fermentation completion. The aim of this study was to determine how nitrogen repletion affected the transcriptional response of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strain, in particular within the first hour after nitrogen addition. We found almost 4800 genes induced or repressed, sometimes within minutes after nutrient changes. Some of these responses to nitrogen depended on the TOR pathway, which controls positively ribosomal protein genes, amino acid and purine biosynthesis or amino acid permease genes and negatively stress-response genes, and genes related to the retrograde response (RTG) specific to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). Some unexpected transcriptional responses concerned all the glycolytic genes, the starch and glucose metabolism and citrate cycle-related genes that were down-regulated, as well as genes from the lipid metabolism.",

Multiple CrRLK1L-type receptor kinases prevent premature pollen tube burst, while another CrRLK1L protein, FERONIA (FER), is required for pollen tube burst in the female gametophyte. We report here the identification of two additional CrRLK1L homologues, HERCULES RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (HERK1) and ANJEA (ANJ), which act redundantly to promote pollen tube burst at the synergid cells. HERK1 and ANJ localise to the filiform apparatus of the synergid cells in unfertilised ovules, and in herk1 anj mutants a majority of ovules remain unfertilised due to pollen tube overgrowth, together indicating that HERK1 and ANJ act as female determinants for fertilisation. As in fer mutants, the synergid cell-specific, endomembrane protein NORTIA (NTA) is not relocalised after pollen tube reception; however, unlike fer mutants, reactive oxygen species levels are unaffected in herk1 anj double mutants. Both ANJ and HERK1 associate with FER and its proposed co-receptor LORELEI (LRE) in planta. Together, our data indicate that HERK1 and ANJ act with FER to mediate female-male gametophyte interactions during plant fertilisation.",

    "abstract": "During meiotic recombination in most mammals, hundreds of programmed DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) occur across all chromosomes in each cell at sites bound by the protein PRDM9. Faithful DSB repair using the homologous chromosome is essential for fertility, yielding either non-crossovers, which are frequent but difficult to detect, or crossovers. In certain hybrid mice, high sequence divergence causes PRDM9 to bind each homologue at different sites, \\\"asymmetrically\\\", and these mice exhibit meiotic failure and infertility, by unknown mechanisms. To investigate the impact of local sequence divergence on recombination, we intercrossed two mouse subspecies over five generations and deep-sequenced 119 offspring, whose high heterozygosity allowed detection of thousands of crossover and non-crossover events with unprecedented power and spatial resolution. Both crossovers and non-crossovers are strongly depleted at individual asymmetric sites, revealing that PRDM9 not only positions DSBs but also promotes their homologous repair by binding to the unbroken homologue at each site. Unexpectedly, we found that non-crossovers containing multiple mismatches repair by a different mechanism than single-mismatch sites, which undergo GC-biased gene conversion. These results demonstrate that local genetic diversity profoundly alters meiotic repair pathway decisions via at least two distinct mechanisms, impacting genome evolution and Prdm9-related hybrid infertility.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific hybridization can introduce genetic variation that aids in adaptation to new or changing environments. Here we investigate how the environment, and more specifically temperature, interacts with hybrid genomes to alter parental genome representation over time. We evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces uvarum hybrids in nutrient-limited continuous culture at 15{degrees}C for 200 generations. In comparison to previous evolution experiments at 30{degrees}C, we identified a number of temperature specific responses, including the loss of the S. cerevisiae allele in favor of the cryotolerant S. uvarum allele for several portions of the hybrid genome. In particular, we discovered a genotype by environment interaction in the form of a reciprocal loss of heterozygosity event on chromosome XIII. Which species haplotype is lost or maintained is dependent on the parental species temperature preference and the temperature at which the hybrid was evolved. We show that a large contribution to this directionality is due to temperature sensitivity at a single locus, the high affinity phosphate transporter PHO84. This work helps shape our understanding of what forces impact genome evolution after hybridization, and how environmental conditions may favor or disfavor hybrids over time.",

Osteolectin acts on Leptin Receptor+ (LepR+) skeletal stem cells and other osteogenic progenitors in bone marrow to promote their differentiation into osteoblasts. Here we identity a receptor for Osteolectin, 11 integrin, which is expressed by LepR+ cells and osteoblasts. 11{beta}1 integrin binds Osteolectin with nanomolar affinity and is required for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin. Deletion of Itga11 (which encodes 11) from mouse and human bone marrow stromal cells impaired osteogenic differentiation and blocked their response to Osteolectin. Like Osteolectin deficient mice, Lepr-cre; Itga11fl/fl mice appeared grossly normal but exhibited reduced osteogenesis and accelerated bone loss during aging. Osteolectin binding to 11{beta}1 promoted Wnt pathway activation, which was necessary for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin. This reveals a new mechanism for maintenance of adult bone mass: Wnt pathway activation by Osteolectin/11{beta}1 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts contain photosynthetic protein complexes that convert light energy into chemical energy. Photosynthetic protein complexes are considered to undergo structural reorganization to maintain the efficiency of photochemical reactions. A detailed description of the mobility of photosynthetic complexes in real-time is necessary to understand how macromolecular organization of the membrane is altered by environmental fluctuations. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize and characterize the in situ mobility of individual protein complexes in grana thylakoid membranes isolated from Spinacia oleracea. Our observations reveal that these membranes can harbor complexes with at least two distinctive classes of mobility. A large fraction of grana membranes contained proteins with quasi-static mobility, exhibiting molecular displacements smaller than 10 nm2. In the remaining fraction, the protein mobility is variable with molecular displacements of up to 100 nm2. This visualization at high-spatiotemporal resolution enabled us to estimate an average diffusion coefficient of [~]1 nm2 s-1. Interestingly, both confined and Brownian diffusion models could describe the protein mobility of the second group of membranes. We also provide the first direct evidence of rotational diffusion of photosynthetic complexes. The rotational diffusion of photosynthetic complexes could be an adaptive response to the high protein density in the membrane to guarantee the efficiency of electron transfer reactions. This characterization of the mobility of individual photosynthetic complexes in grana membranes establishes a foundation that could be adapted to study the dynamics of the complexes inside the intact and photosynthetically functional thylakoid membranes to be able to understand its structural responses to diverse environmental fluctuations.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe characterized the dynamics of individual photosynthetic protein complexes in grana thylakoid membranes from Spinacia oleracea by high-speed atomic microscopy (HS-AFM). Direct visualization at high spatiotemporal resolution unveils that the mobility of photosynthetic proteins is heterogeneous but governed by the confinement effect imposed by the high protein density in the thylakoid membrane. The photosynthetic complexes display rotational diffusion, which might be a consequence of the crowded environment in the membrane and a mechanism to sustain an efficient electron transfer chain.",

The recognition of diverse infection and other danger signals by innate immune receptors trigger caspase-1 activation that induces pyroptosis. Anthrax lethal factor (LF) is a secreted bacterial protease that known to potently activate Nlrp1b inflammasomes in mouse macrophages, but the molecular mechanism underlying LF-induced Nlrp1b activation remains unknown. We here carried out both a mouse genome-wide siRNA screen and a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen seeking to identify genes that participate in Nlrp1b activation triggered by LF treatment. We found that the N-end rule pathway E3 ligase UBR2 is required for Nlrp1b activation and a ubiquitin conjugating E2 enzyme E2O is also involved in this process via its physically interaction with UBR2. We show that LF triggers activation of Nlrp1b by initiating the degradation of the N-terminal fragment of Nlrp1b itself that produced via an auto-cleavage process. This study deepens our understanding of innate immunity defense against bacterial infection by elucidating the functional role of UBR2-mediated N-end rule pathway in LF-induced Nlrp1b activation.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is an important aspect of an organisms response to environmental change that often requires the modulation of gene expression. These changes in gene expression can be quantitative as a result of increases or decreases in the amounts of specific transcripts, or qualitative as a result of the expression of alternative transcripts from the same gene (e.g., via alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs). Although the role of quantitative changes in gene expression in phenotypic plasticity is well known, relatively few studies have examined the role of qualitative changes. Here, we use skeletal muscle RNA-seq data from Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the extent of qualitative changes in gene expression in response to cold. Fewer genes demonstrated alternative splicing than differential expression as a result of cold acclimation; however, differences in splicing were detected for between 426 and 866 genes depending on species, indicating that large numbers of qualitative changes in gene expression are associated with cold acclimation. Many of these alternatively spliced genes were also differentially expressed, and there was functional enrichment for involvement in muscle contraction among the genes demonstrating qualitative changes in response to cold acclimation. Additionally, there was a common group of 29 genes with cold-acclimation-mediated changes in splicing in all three species, suggesting that there may be a conserved set of genes with expression patterns that respond qualitatively to prolonged cold temperatures across fishes.\\n\\nSummary statementQualitative changes in gene expression, such as those mediated by alternative splicing of mRNAs, are involved in phenotypic plasticity in response to prolonged cold acclimation in ectothermic animals",

Although correct Wnt globular structure is essential for secretion, proteins that directly mediate Wnt folding and maturation are incompletely characterized.

We find that PDI-1 function is required to correctly form an anteroposterior EGL-20/Wnt gradient during embryonic development. Further, PDI-1 performs this role in EGL-20/Wnt-producing epidermal cells to cell-non-autonomously control EGL-20/Wnt-dependent neuronal migration. Using pharmacological inhibition, we further show that PDI function is required in human cells for Wnt3a secretion, revealing a conserved role for disulfide isomerases.

To determine if age impacts the rate of in vivo migration within animals, we examined the rostral migratory stream (RMS) of animals across 12 days using an established MRI technique. To visualize NPCs, we injected micron sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) into the lateral ventricle to endogenously label cells within the SVZ, which then appeared as hypo-intensive spots within MR images. Our in vivo MRI data showed that the rate of migration was significantly different between all ages examined, with decreases in the distance traveled as age progressed. The total number of iron oxide labeled cells within the olfactory bulb on day 12, decrease significantly when compared across ages in ex vivo high-resolution scans. We also, for the first time, demonstrated the endogenous labeling of cells within the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus. Here too, there was a significant decrease in the number of labeled cells within the structure across age. Histology of the NPCs verified the decrease in labeling of cells with doublecortin (DCX) as age progressed for both regions. The dramatic reduction of labeling in NPCs within the SVZ and DG observed with MRI, demonstrates the importance of understanding the impact of age on the relationship of NPC and disease.",

    "abstract": "Embryo implantation is the first step in the establishment of pregnancy in eutherian (Placental) mammals. Although viviparity evolved prior to the common ancestor of marsupials and eutherian mammals (therian ancestor), implantation is unique to eutherians. The ancestral therian pregnancy likely involved a short phase of attachment between the fetal and maternal tissues followed by parturition rather than implantation, similar to the mode of pregnancy found in marsupials such as the opossum. Embryo implantation in eutherian mammals as well as embryo attachment in opossum, induce a homologous inflammatory response in the uterus. Here, we elucidate the evolutionary mechanism by which the ancestral inflammatory fetal-maternal attachment was transformed into the process of implantation. We performed a comparative transcriptomic and immunohistochemical study of the gravid and non-gravid uteri of two eutherian mammals, armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and hyrax (Procavia capensis); a marsupial outgroup, opossum (Monodelphis domestica); and compared it to previously published data on rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). This taxon sampling allows inference of the eutherian ancestral state. Our results show that in the eutherian lineage, the ancestral inflammatory response was domesticated by suppressing a detrimental component viz. signaling by the cytokine IL17A, while retaining components that are beneficial to placentation, viz. angiogenesis, vascular permeability, remodeling of extracellular matrix. IL17A mediates recruitment of neutrophils to inflamed mucosal tissues, which, if unchecked, can damage the uterus as well as the embryo and lead to expulsion of the fetus. We hypothesized that the uterine decidual stromal cells, which evolved coincidentally with embryo implantation, evolved, in part, to prevent IL17A-mediated neutrophil infiltration. We tested a prediction of this hypothesis in vitro, and showed that decidual stromal cells can suppress differentiation of human naive T cells into IL17A-producing Th17 cells. Together, these results provide a mechanistic understanding of early stages of the evolution of the eutherian mode of pregnancy, and also identify a potentially ancestral function of an evolutionary novelty, the decidual stromal cell-type.",

    "abstract": "Host factors of influenza virus replication are often found in key topological positions within protein-protein interaction networks. This work explores how protein states can be manipulated through controllability analysis: the determination of the minimum manipulation needed to drive the cell system to any desired state. Here, we complete a two-part controllability analysis of two protein networks: a host network representing the healthy cell state and an influenza A virus-host network representing the infected cell state. This knowledge can be utilized to understand disease dynamics and isolate proteins for study as drug target candidates. Both topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets.\\n\\nImportanceSeasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year, with a constant threat of pandemic infection. Even so, the FDA has only approved four treatments, two of which are unsuited for at risk groups such as children and those with breathing complications. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods. Controllability analyses identify key regulating host factors of the infected cells progression, findings which are supported by biological context. These results are beneficial to future studies of influenza virus, both experimental and computational.",
