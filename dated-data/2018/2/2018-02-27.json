    "abstract": "Elucidating how ecological and evolutionary mechanisms interact to produce and maintain biodiversity is a fundamental problem in evolutionary ecology. We investigate this issue by focusing on how physiological evolution affects performance and species coexistence along the thermal niche axis in replicated radiations of Anolis lizards, groups best known for resource partitioning based on morphological divergence. We find repeated divergence in thermal physiology within these radiations, and that this divergence significantly affects performance within natural thermal environments. Morphologically similar species that co-occur invariably differ in their thermal physiology, providing evidence that physiological divergence facilitates species co-existence within anole communities. Despite repeated divergence in traits of demonstrable ecological importance, phylogenetic comparative analyses indicate that physiological traits have evolved more slowly than key morphological traits related to the structural niche. Phylogenetic analyses also reveal that physiological divergence is correlated with divergence in broad-scale habitat climatic features commonly used to estimate thermal niche evolution, but that the latter incompletely predicts variation in the former. We provide comprehensive evidence for repeated adaptive evolution of physiological divergence within Anolis adaptive radiations, including the complementary roles of physiological and morphological divergence in promoting community-level diversity. We recommend greater integration of performance-based traits into analyses of climatic niche evolution, as they facilitate a more complete understanding of the phenotypic and ecological consequences of climatic divergence.",

    "abstract": "Indirect evidence suggests that blastopore closure during gastrulation of anamniotes, including amphibians such as Xenopus laevis, depends on circumblastoporal convergence forces generated by the marginal zone (MZ), but direct evidence is lacking. We show that explanted MZs generate tensile convergence forces up to 1.5 N during gastrulation and over 4 N thereafter. These forces are generated by convergent thickening (CT) until the midgastrula and increasingly by convergent extension (CE) thereafter. Explants from ventralized embryos, which lack tissues expressing CE but close their blastopores, produce up to 2 N of tensile force, showing that CT alone generates forces sufficient to close the blastopore. Uniaxial tensile stress relaxation assays show stiffening of mesodermal and ectodermal tissues around the onset of neurulation, potentially enhancing long-range transmission of convergence forces. These results illuminate the mechanobiology of early vertebrate morphogenic mechanisms, aid interpretation of phenotypes, and give insight into the evolution of blastopore closure mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The majority of diseases that are a significant challenge for public and individual heath are caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. In this paper we introduce Lineage, a novel visual analysis tool designed to support domain experts who study such multifactorial diseases in the context of genealogies. Incorporating familial relationships between cases with other data can provide insights into shared genomic variants and shared environmental exposures that may be implicated in such diseases. We introduce a data and task abstraction, and argue that the problem of analyzing such diseases based on genealogical, clinical, and genetic data can be mapped to a multivariate graph visualization problem. The main contribution of our design study is a novel visual representation for tree-like, multivariate graphs, which we apply to genealogies and clinical data about the individuals in these families. We introduce data-driven aggregation methods to scale to multiple families. By designing the genealogy graph layout to align with a tabular view, we are able to incorporate extensive, multivariate attributes in the analysis of the genealogy without cluttering the graph. We validate our designs by conducting case studies with our domain collaborators.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTargeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of proteins that are encoded by genes critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSGenes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings provide a relevant towards better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.",

    "abstract": "Truncating CHD8 mutations are amongst the highest confidence risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) identified to date. To investigate how reduced Chd8 gene dosage may disrupt brain development and predispose individuals to ASD, we generated a Chd8 heterozygous mouse model. In line with clinical observations, we found that Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed subtle brain hyperplasia and hypertelorism, coupled with increased postnatal brain weight. Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed anomalous behaviours, but autism-like social deficits, repetitive and restricted behaviours were not present. Only minor gene expression changes were observed in the embryonic neocortex at E12.5, with more pronounced gene expression changes in postnatal cortex at P5. Differentially expressed genes showed highly significant enrichment for known autism candidates. Amongst the down-regulated transcripts, genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance were particularly prominent, implicating impaired connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the ASD phenotype. To probe this further, we performed resting state functional fMRI and found increased synchronised activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks, hinting at impaired sensory processing. Together, these data show that Chd8 heterozygous mice recapitulate key clinical features found in patients with CHD8 mutations and show a unique combination of behavioural phenotypes, which may be underpinned by a distinctive disruption of brain connectivity and sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTwo-sample summary data Mendelian randomization (MR) incorporating multiple genetic variants within a meta-analysis framework is a popular technique for assessing causality in epidemiology. If all genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable (IV) and necessary modelling assumptions, then their individual ratio estimates of causal effect should be homogeneous. Observed heterogeneity signals that one or more of these assumptions could have been violated.\\n\\nMethodsCausal estimation and heterogeneity assessment in MR requires an approximation for the variance, or equivalently the inverse-variance weight, of each ratio estimate. We show that the most popular  1st order weights can lead to an inflation in the chances of detecting heterogeneity when in fact it is not present. Conversely, ostensibly more accurate  2nd order weights can dramatically increase the chances of failing to detect heterogeneity, when it is truly present. We derive modified weights to mitigate both of these adverse effects.\\n\\nResultsUsing Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the modified weights outperform 1st and 2nd order weights in terms of heterogeneity quantification. Modified weights are also shown to remove the phenomenon of regression dilution bias in MR estimates obtained from weak instruments, unlike those obtained using 1st and 2nd order weights. However, with small numbers of weak instruments, this comes at the cost of a reduction in estimate precision and power to detect a causal effect compared to 1st order weighting. Moreover, 1st order weights always furnish unbiased estimates and preserve the type I error rate under the causal null. We illustrate the utility of the new method using data from a recent two-sample summary data MR analysis to assess the causal role of systolic blood pressure on coronary heart disease risk.\\n\\nConclusionsWe propose the use of modified weights within two-sample summary data MR studies for accurately quantifying heterogeneity and detecting outliers in the presence of weak instruments. Modified weights also have an important role to play in terms of causal estimation (in tandem with 1st order weights) but further research is required to understand their strengths and weaknesses in specific settings.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic modeling is a cornerstone of systems biology analysis of microbial organisms and communities, yet these genome-scale modeling efforts are invariably based on incomplete functional annotations. Annotated genomes typically contain 30-50% of genes without functional annotation, severely limiting our knowledge of the \\\"parts lists\\\" that the organisms have at their disposal. These incomplete annotations may be sufficient to derive a model of a core set of well-studied metabolic pathways that support growth in pure culture. However, pathways important for growth on unusual metabolites exchanged in complex microbial communities are often less understood, resulting in missing functional annotations in newly sequenced genomes. Here, we present results on a comprehensive reannotation of 27 bacterial reference genomes, focusing on enzymes with EC numbers annotated by KEGG, RAST, EFICAz, and the BRENDA enzyme database, and on membrane transport annotations by TransportDB, KEGG and RAST. Our analysis shows that annotation using multiple tools can result in a drastically larger metabolic network reconstruction, adding on average 40% more EC numbers, 3-8 times more substrate-specific transporters, and 37% more metabolic genes. These results are even more pronounced for bacterial species that are more phylogenetically distant from well-studied model organisms such as E. coli.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly experience symptoms related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. One-third of ASD cases may be complicated by the presence of ADHD. Individuals with dual diagnoses face greater barriers to accessing treatment for ADHD and respond less positively to primary pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic technology-aided tools for hyperactivity and inattention in people with ASD are being developed, although research into their efficacy and safety remains limited.\\n\\nObjectiveThe objective of this preliminary study was to describe the changes in ADHD-related symptoms in children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD after use of the Empowered Brain system, a behavioral and social communication aid for ASD running on augmented reality smartglasses.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited 8 children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD (male to female ratio of 7:1, mean age 15 years, range 11.7-20.5 years) through a Web-based research signup form. The baseline score on the hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC-H), a measure of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, determined their classification into a high ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H [&ge;]13) and a low ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H <13). All participants received an intervention with Empowered Brain, where they used smartglasses-based social communication and behavioral modules while interacting with their caregiver. We then calculated caregiver-reported ABC-H scores at 24 and 48 hours after the session.\\n\\nResultsAll 8 participants were able to complete the intervention session. Postintervention ABC-H scores were lower for most participants at 24 hours (n=6, 75%) and for all participants at 48 hours (n=8, 100%). At 24 hours after the session, average participant ABC-H scores decreased by 54.9% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 20% in the low ADHD symptom group. At 48 hours after the session, ABC-H scores compared with baseline decreased by 56.4% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 66.3% in the low ADHD symptom group.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides initial evidence for the efficacy of the Empowered Brain system in reducing ADHD-related symptoms, such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, in school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD. This digital smartglasses intervention can potentially be targeted at a broader array of mental health conditions that exhibit transdiagnostic attentional and social communication deficits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Further research is required to understand the clinical importance of these observed changes and to conduct longitudinal studies on this intervention with larger sample sizes.",

We show that our method is robust to partially sampled contact networks, incomplete disease information, and enables hypothesis testing on transmission mechanisms. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in two host-pathogen systems: Crithidia bombi in bumble bee colonies and Salmonella in wild Australian sleepy lizard populations.

Consequently, X and Y chromosomes initially have similar gene content, but ongoing Y degeneration leads to reduced Y gene expression and eventual Y gene loss. The resulting imbalance in gene expression between Y genes and the rest of the genome is expected to reduce male fitness, especially when protein networks have components from both autosomes and sex chromosomes. A diverse set of dosage compensating mechanisms that alleviates these negative effects has been described in animals2-4. However, the early steps in the evolution of dosage compensation remain unknown and dosage compensation is poorly understood in plants5. Here we show a novel dosage compensation mechanism in the evolutionarily young XY sex determination system of the plant Silene latifolia. Genomic imprinting results in higher expression from the maternal X chromosome in both males and females. This compensates for reduced Y expression in males but results in X overexpression in females and may be detrimental. It could represent a transient early stage in the evolution of dosage compensation. Our finding has striking resemblance to the first stage proposed by Ohno for the evolution of X inactivation in mammals.",

We tested 565 pairwise knockdowns in the developing eye, and identified 24 interactions between pairs of 16p11.2 homologs and 46 interactions between 16p11.2 homologs and neurodevelopmental genes that suppressed or enhanced cell proliferation phenotypes compared to one-hit knockdowns.

For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) are expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favour individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Here we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge by measuring survival, through mark recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach, as a function of the plasticity of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioural thermal preference and the thermal sensitivity of metabolism in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog Pleurodema thaul. Overall, our results indicate that thermal acclimation in this population is not being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival decreased in individuals with less tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated (probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year) and increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were non-significant.",

There is much evidence that the probability of host-shifts decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient hosts, but the consequences of such preferential host switching remain little explored. We develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of parasite host-shifts in the presence of this phylogenetic distance effect. Host trees evolve under a stochastic birth-death process and parasites co-evolve concurrently on those trees, undergoing host-shifts, co-speciation and extinction. Our model indicates that host trees have a major influence on these dynamics. This applies both to individual trees that evolved under the same stochastic process and to sets of trees that evolved with different macroevolutionary parameters. We predict that trees consisting of a few large clades of host species and those with fast species turnover should harbour more parasites than trees with many small clades and those that diversify more slowly. Within trees, large clades should exhibit a higher infection frequency than small clades.

    "abstract": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are enriched in charged and polar residues; and, therefore, electrostatic interactions play a predominant role in their dynamics. In order to remain multi-functional and exhibit their characteristic binding promiscuity, they need to retain considerable dynamic flexibility. At the same time, they also need to accommodate a large number of oppositely charged residues, which eventually lead to the formation of salt-bridges, imparting local rigidity. The formation of salt-bridges therefore oppose the desired dynamic flexibility. Hence, there appears to be a meticulous trade-off between the two mechanisms which the current study attempts to unravel. With this objective, we identify and analyze salt-bridges, both as isolated as well as composite ionic bond motifs, in the molecular dynamic trajectories of a set of appropriately chosen IDPs. Time evolved structural properties of these salt-bridges like persistence, associated secondary structural 'order-disorder' transitions, correlated atomic movements, contribution in the overall electrostatic balance of the proteins have been studied in necessary detail. The results suggest that the key to maintain such a trade-off over time is the continuous formation and dissolution of salt-bridges with a wide range of persistence. Also, the continuous dynamic interchange of charged-atom-pairs (coming from a variety of oppositely charged side-chains) in the transient ionic bonds supports a model of dynamic flexibility concomitant with the well characterized stochastic conformational switching in these proteins. The results and conclusions should facilitate the future design of salt-bridges as a mean to further explore the disordered-globular interface in proteins.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, epigenetic research has enjoyed explosive growth as high-throughput sequencing technologies become more accessible and affordable. However, this advancement has not been matched with similar progress in data analysis capabilities from the perspective of experimental biologists not versed in bioinformatic languages. For instance, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) is at present widely used to identify genomic loci of transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Basic ChIP-seq data analysis, including read mapping and peak calling, can be accomplished through several well-established tools, but more sophisticated analyzes aimed at comparing data derived from different conditions or experimental designs constitute a significant bottleneck. We reason that the implementation of a single comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis pipeline could be beneficial for many experimental (wet lab) researchers who would like to generate genomic data.\\n\\nResultsHere we present ChIPdig, a stand-alone application with adjustable parameters designed to allow researchers to perform several analyzes, namely read mapping to a reference genome, peak calling, annotation of regions based on reference coordinates (e.g. transcription start and termination sites, exons, introns, 5' UTRs and 3' UTRs), and generation of heatmaps and metaplots for visualizing coverage. Importantly, ChIPdig accepts multiple ChIP-seq datasets as input, allowing genome-wide differential enrichment analysis in regions of interest to be performed. ChIPdig is written in R and enables access to several existing and highly utilized packages through a simple user interface powered by the Shiny package. Here, we illustrate the utility and user-friendly features of ChIPdig by analyzing H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq profiles generated by the modENCODE project as an example.\\n\\nConclusionsChIPdig offers a comprehensive and user-friendly pipeline for analysis of multiple sets of ChIP-seq data by both experimental and computational researchers.

    "abstract": "Bacterial communities are composed of distinct groups of potentially interacting lineages, each thought to occupy a distinct ecological niche. It remains unclear, however, how quickly niche preference evolves and whether more closely related lineages are more likely to share ecological niches. We addressed these questions by following the dynamics of two bloom-forming cyanobacterial genera over an 8-year time-course in Lake Champlain, Canada, using 16S amplicon sequencing and measurements of several environmental parameters. The two genera, Microcystis (M) and Dolichospermum (D), are frequently observed simultaneously during bloom events and thus have partially overlapping niches. However, the extent of their niche overlap is debated, and it is also unclear to what extent niche partitioning occurs among strains within each genus. To identify strains within each genus, we applied minimum entropy decomposition (MED) to 16S rRNA gene sequences. We confirmed that at a genus level, M and D have different preferences for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Within each genus, we also identified strains differentially associated with temperature, precipitation, and concentrations of nutrients and toxins. In general, niche similarity between strains (as measured by co-occurrence over time) declined with genetic distance. This pattern is consistent with habitat filtering - in which closely-related taxa are ecologically similar, and therefore tend to co-occur under similar environmental conditions. In contrast with this general pattern, similarity in certain niche dimensions (notably particulate nitrogen and phosphorus) did not decline linearly with genetic distance, and instead showed a complex polynomial relationship. This observation suggests the importance of processes other than habitat filtering - such as competition between closely-related taxa, or convergent trait evolution in distantly-related taxa - in shaping particular traits in microbial communities.",

Tumor sequence surveys have frequently ranked the importance of substitutions to cancer growth by P value or a false-discovery conversion thereof. However, P values are thresholds for belief, not metrics of effect. Their frequent misuse as metrics of effect has often been vociferously decried. Here, we estimate the effect sizes of all recurrent single nucleotide variants in 23 cancer types, quantifying relative importance within and between driver genes. Some of the variants with the highest effect size, such as EGFR L858R in lung adenocarcinoma and BRAF V600E in primary skin cutaneous melanoma, have yielded remarkable therapeutic responses. Quantification of cancer effect sizes has immediate importance to the prioritization of clinical decision-making by tumor boards, selection and design of clinical trials, pharmacological targeting, and basic research prioritization.",

Researching FIs in resources with large-scale genetic and phenotypic data will provide insights into the causes and consequences of frailty. Thus, we aimed to develop an FI using UK Biobank data, a cohort study of 500,000 middle-aged and older adults.\\n\\nMethodsAn FI was calculated using 49 self-reported questionnaire items on traits covering health, presence of diseases and disabilities, and mental wellbeing, according to standard protocol. We used multiple imputation to derive FI values for the entire eligible sample in the presence of missing item data (N =500,336). To validate the measure, we assessed associations of the FI with age, sex, and risk of all-cause mortality (follow-up [&le;] 9.7 years) using linear and Cox proportional hazards regression models.\\n\\nResultsMean FI in the cohort was 0.125 (standard deviation = 0.075), and there was a curvilinear trend towards higher values in older participants. FI values were also marginally higher on average in women than men. In survival models, 10% higher baseline frailty (i.e. a 0.1 FI increment) was associated with higher risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.62, 1.68). Associations were stronger in younger participants than in old, and in men compared to women (HRs: 1.72 vs. 1.56, respectively).\\n\\nConclusionsThe FI is a valid measure of frailty in UK Biobank.

    "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is crucial for adaptation and is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders and psychopathology. Human studies of flexibility using reversal learning tasks typically contrast error trials before and after reversal, which provides little information about the mechanisms that support learning and expressing a new response. However, animal studies suggest a specific role in this latter process for the connections between the dorsal striatum and the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamus, a system which may recruit the striatal cholinergic interneurons, but which is not well understood in humans. This study investigated the role of this system in human probabilistic reversal learning, specifically with respect to learning a new response strategy, contrasting its function to that of the better understood orbitoftontal-striatal systems. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data we show that connectivity between the striatum and both the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and CM-Pf pathways increased during reversal, but not initial learning. However, while the strength of lOFC-striatal connectivity was associated with the speed of the reversal, the strength of CM-Pf-striatal connectivity was associated specifically with the quality of the reversal (reduced regressive errors). These findings expand our understanding of flexibility mechanisms in the human brain, bridging the gap with animal studies of this system.",

    "abstract": "When species occur in repeated ecologically distinct habitats across their range, adaptation may proceed surprisingly fast and result in parallel evolution. There is increasing evidence that such cases of rapid parallel evolution are fueled by standing genetic variation, but the origin of this genetic variation remains poorly understood. In Pogonus chalceus beetles, short- and long-winged ecotypes have diverged in response to contrasting hydrological regimes and can be repeatedly found along the Atlantic European coast. By analyzing genomic variation across the beetles distribution, we reveal that genomically widespread short-wing selected alleles evolved during a singular divergence event, estimated at ~0.19 Mya. The ancient and differentially selected alleles are currently polymorphic in all populations across the range, allowing for the fast evolution of one ecotype from a small number of random individuals, as low as 5 to 15, of the populations of the other ecotype. Our results suggest that cases of fast parallel ecological divergence might be the result of evolution at two different time frames: divergence in the past, followed by repeated selection on the divergently evolved alleles after admixture. We suggest that this mechanism may be common and potentially further driven by periods of geographic isolation imposed by large-scale environmental changes such as glacial cycles.",

    "abstract": "How motor memory consolidates still remains elusive. Motor tasks consolidation were shown to depend on periods of sleep, whereas pure non-hippocampal dependent tasks, like motor adaptation, might not. Some research suggests that the mode of training might affect the sleep dependency of motor adaptation tasks. Here we investigated whether sleep differentially impacts memory consolidation dependent on the variability during training. Healthy men were trained with their dominant, right hand on a force field adaptation task and re-tested after an 11-h consolidation period either involving overnight sleep (Sleep) or daytime wakefulness (Wake). Retesting also included a transfer to the non-dominant hand. Half of the subjects in each group adapted to different force field magnitudes with low inter-trial variability (Sleep-Blocked; Wake-Blocked), the other half with high variability (Sleep-Random; Wake-Random). EEG was recorded during task execution and overnight polysomnography. Motor adaptation was comparable between Wake and Sleep groups, although performance changes over sleep correlated with sleep spindles nesting in slow wave upstates. Higher training variability improved retest, including transfer learning, and these improvements correlated with higher alpha power in contralateral parietal areas. Enhanced consolidation after training might foster the ability to correct ongoing movements by responsive feedback rather than their pre-execution prediction.",

    "abstract": "Suicide accounts for nearly 800,000 deaths per year worldwide with rates of both deaths and attempts rising. Family studies have estimated substantial heritability of suicidal behavior; however, collecting the sample sizes necessary for successful genetic studies has remained a challenge. We utilized two different approaches in independent datasets to characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. The first is a patient reported suicide attempt phenotype from genotyped samples in the UK Biobank (337,199 participants, 2,433 cases). The second leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC, 2.8 million patients, 3,250 cases) and machine learning to derive probabilities of attempting suicide in 24,546 genotyped patients. We identified significant and comparable heritability estimates of suicide attempt from both the patient reported phenotype in the UK Biobank (h2SNP = 0.035, p = 7.12x10-4) and the clinically predicted phenotype from VUMC (h2SNP = 0.046, p = 1.51x10-2). A significant genetic overlap was demonstrated between the two measures of suicide attempt in these independent samples through polygenic risk score analysis (t = 4.02, p = 5.75x10-5) and genetic correlation (rg = 1.073, SE = 0.36, p = 0.003). Finally, we show significant but incomplete genetic correlation of suicide attempt with insomnia (rg = 0.34 - 0.81) as well as several psychiatric disorders (rg = 0.26 - 0.79). This work demonstrates the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. It points to a genetic underpinning to clinically predicted risk of attempting suicide that is similar to the genetic profile from a patient reported outcome. Lastly, it presents an approach for using EHR data and clinical prediction to generate quantitative measures from binary phenotypes that improved power for our genetic study.",

For the first time, we have refined the rat genetic map to sub-centimorgan (cM) r solution (<0.02 cM) by using 95,769 genetic markers and 870 informative meioses from a cohort of 528 heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. Global recombination rates in the revised sex-averaged map (0.66 cM/Mb) did not difeer compared to the historical map (0.65 cM/Mb); however, substantial refinement was made to the localization of highly recombinant regions within the revised map. Also for the first time, sex-specific rat genetic maps were generated, which revealed both genomewide and fine-scale variation in recombination rates between male and female rats. Reanalysis of multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) using the historical and refined rat genetic maps demonstrated marked changes to QTL localization, shape, and effect size. As a resource to the rat research community, we have provided revised centimorgan positions for all physical positions within the rat genome and commonly used genetic markers for trait mapping, including 44,828 SSLP markers and the RATDIV genotyping array. Collectively, this study provides a substantial improvement to the rat genetic map and an unprecedented resource for analysis of complex traits and recombination in the rat.",

    "abstract": "The transmission routes of Influenza A viruses (IAVs) submit virus particles to a wide range of environmental conditions that affect their transmission. In water, temperature, salinity and pH are important factors modulating viral persistence in a strain-dependant manner, and the viral factors driving IAV persistence remained to be described. We used an innovative method based on a real-time cell system analysis to quantify viral decay in an environmental model. Thus, we identified the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) as the main proteins driving the environmental persistence by comparing the inactivation slopes of several reassortant viruses. We also introduced synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the HA or in the NA that modulated IAV persistence. Our results demonstrate that HA stability and expression level, as well as calcium-binding sites of the NA protein are molecular determinants of viral persistence.\\n\\nFinally, IAV particles could not trigger membrane fusion after environmental exposure, stressing the importance of the HA and the NA for environmental persistence.",

    "abstract": "MOTIVATIONParticle tracking coupled with time-lapse microscopy is critical for understanding the dynamics of intracellular processes of clinical importance. Spurred on by advances in the spatiotemporal resolution of microscopy and automated computational methods, this field is increasingly amenable to multi-dimensional high-throughput data collection schemes (Snijder et al., 2012). Typically, complex particle tracking datasets generated by individual laboratories are produced with incompatible methodologies that preclude comparison to each other. There is therefore an unmet need for data management systems that facilitate data standardization, meta-analysis, and structured data dissemination. The integration of analysis, visualization, and quality control capabilities into such systems would eliminate the need for manual transfer of data to diverse downstream analysis tools. At the same time, it would lay the foundation for shared trajectory data, particle tracking, and motion analysis standards.\n\nRESULTSHere, we present Open Microscopy Environment inteGrated Analysis (OMEGA), a cross-platform data management, analysis, and visualization system, for particle tracking data, with particular emphasis on results from viral and vesicular trafficking experiments. OMEGA provides intuitive graphical interfaces to implement integrated particle tracking and motion analysis workflows while providing easy to use facilities to automatically keep track of error propagation, harvest data provenance and ensure the persistence of analysis results and metadata. Specifically, OMEGA: 1) imports image data and metadata from data management tools such as the Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects (OMERO; Allan et al., 2012); 2) tracks intracellular particles movement; 3) facilitates parameter optimization and trajectory results inspection and validation; 4) performs downstream trajectory analysis and motion type classification; 5) estimates the uncertainty propagating through the motion analysis pipeline; and, 6) facilitates storage and dissemination of analysis results, and analysis definition metadata, on the basis of our newly proposed FAIRsharing.org complainant Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments (MIAPTE; Rigano and Strambio-De-Castillia, 2016; 2017) guidelines in combination with the OME-XML data model (Goldberg et al., 2005). In so doing, OMEGA maintains a persistent link between raw image data, intermediate analysis steps, the overall analysis output, and all necessary metadata to repeat the analysis process and reproduce its results.\n\nAvailability and implementationOMEGA is a cross-platform, open-source software developed in Java.

    "abstract": "We characterize the morphogenic process of convergent thickening (CT), which occurs in the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) during gastrulation of Xenopus, the African clawed frog. CT was described previously as the tendency of explants of the ventral IMZ of Xenopus to converge their circumblastoporal dimension and thicken their radial dimension (Keller and Danilchik 1988). Here we show that CT occurs from the onset of gastrulation, initially throughout the pre-involution IMZ. We suggest that CT is driven by an increase in the interfacial tension between the deep IMZ and its epithelium, resulting in cells of the deep IMZ tending to minimize their surface area. In explants, this results in a progressive shortening (convergence) of the IMZ along its longer mediolateral axis and thickening in the orthogonal planes, and can generate tensile force (Shook et al. 2018). In vivo, convergence of the annular IMZ generates circumferential tension, closing the blastopore. These results provide the first clear example of a tensile morphogenic force from a Holtfreterian/Steinbergian change in tissue affinity.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations of sensory feedback evoke sensory prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory outcomes of movements), and reward prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted rewards and actual rewards). Sensory prediction errors result in obligatory remapping of the relationship between motor commands and predicted sensory outcomes. The role of reward prediction errors in sensorimotor adaptation is less clear. When moving towards a target, we expect to obtain the reward of hitting the target, and so we experience a reward prediction error if the perturbation causes us to miss it. These discrepancies between desired task outcomes and actual task outcomes, or \\\"task errors\\\", are thought to drive the use of strategic processes to restore success, although their role is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of task errors in sensorimotor adaptation: during target-reaching, we either removed task errors by moving the target mid-movement to align with cursor feedback of hand position, or enforced task error by moving the target away from the cursor feedback of hand position. Removing task errors not only reduced the rate and extent of adaptation during exposure to the perturbation, but also reduced the amount of post-adaptation implicit remapping. Hence, task errors contribute to implicit remapping resulting from sensory prediction errors. This suggests that the system which implicitly acquires new sensorimotor maps via exposure to sensory prediction errors is also sensitive to reward prediction errors.",

    "abstract": "Stolonization in syllid annelids is a unique mode of reproduction among animals. During the breeding season, a structure resembling the adult but containing only gametes, called stolon, is formed at the posterior end of the animal. When the stolons mature, they detach from the adult and the gametes are released into the water column. The process is synchronized within each species, and it has been reported to be under environmental and endogenous control, probably via endocrine regulation. To further understand the reproduction in syllids and to elucidate the molecular toolkit underlying stolonization, we generated Illumina RNA-seq data from different tissues of reproductive and non-reproductive individuals of Syllis magdalena, and characterized gene expression during the stolonization process. Several genes involved in gametogenesis (ovochymase, vitellogenin, testis-specific serine/threonine-kinase), immune response (complement receptor 2), neuronal development (tyrosine-protein kinase Src42A), cell proliferation (alpha-1D adrenergic receptor), and steroid metabolism (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2) were found differentially expressed in the different tissues and conditions analyzed. In addition, our findings suggest that several neurohormones, such as methyl farnesoate, dopamine and serotonin, might trigger the stolon formation, the correct maturation of gametes and the detachment of stolons when gametogenesis is complete. The process seems to be under circadian control, as indicated by the expression patterns of r-opsins. Overall, our results shed light into the genes that orchestrate the onset of gamete formation, and improve our understanding of how some hormones, previously reported to be involved in reproduction and metamorphosis processes in other invertebrates, seem to also regulate reproduction via stolonization.",

While easy access to cameras has increased the quantity of collected videos, the rate at which they can be analyzed remains a major limitation. Often, bench scientists struggle with the most basic problem that there is currently no user-friendly, flexible, and open source software tool with which to watch and annotate these videos.\\n\\nResultsWe have created the VideoTagger tool to address these and many of the other associated challenges of video analysis. VideoTagger allows non-programming users to efficiently explore, annotate, and visualize large quantities of video data, within their existing experimental protocols. Further, it is built to accept programmed plugins written in Python, to enable seamless integration with other sophisticated computer-aided analyses.\\n\\nWe tested VideoTagger ourselves, and have a growing base of users in other scientific disciplines. Capitalising on the unique features of VideoTagger to play back infinite lengths of video footage at various speeds, we annotated 39h of a Drosophila melanogaster lifespan video, at approximately 10-15x faster than real-time. We then used these labels to train a machine-learning plugin, which we used to annotate an additional 538h of footage automatically. In this way, we found that flies fall over spontaneously with increasing frequency as they age, and also spend longer durations struggling to right themselves. Ageing in flies is typically defined by length of life. We propose that this new mobility measure of ageing could help the discovery of mechanisms in biogerontology, refining our definition of what healthy ageing means in this extremely small, but widely used, invertebrate.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show how VideoTagger is sufficiently flexible for studying lengthy and/or numerous video experiments, thus directly improving scientists productivity across varied domains.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSMF with four applications including pairwise ChIP-seq data describing the chromatin modification map on protein-DNA interactions between K562 and Huvec cell lines; pairwise RNA-seq data representing the expression profiles of two cancers (breast invasive carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma); RNA-seq data of three breast cancer subtypes; and single-cell sequencing data of human embryonic stem cells and differentiated cells at six time points. Extensive analysis yields novel insights into hidden combinatorial patterns embedded in these interrelated multi-modal data.

However, selfish genetic elements that exploit this cooperation can achieve large fitness gains by increasing their transmission unfairly relative to the rest of the genome. This leads to counter-adaptations that generate unique selection pressures on the selfish genetic element. This arms race is similar to host-parasite co-evolution. Some multi-host parasites alter the hosts behaviour to increase the chance of transmission to the next host. Here we ask if, similarly to these parasites, a selfish genetic element in house mice, the t haplotype, also manipulates host behaviour, specifically the hosts migration propensity. Variants of the t that manipulate migration propensity could increase in fitness in a meta-population. We show that juvenile mice carrying the t haplotype were more likely to emigrate from and were more often found as migrants within a long-term free-living house mouse population. This result may have applied relevance as the t has been proposed as a basis for artificial gene drive systems for use in population control.",

Extensive epidemiological data links vitamin D deficiency to increased incidence of several cancers, although the underlying cancer-preventive mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) rapidly stimulates the interaction of the VDR with FBW7, and that of FBW7 with c-MYC. In contrast, it blocks the association of FBW7 with c-MYC antagonist MXD1. 1,25D also enhances the association of FBW7, proteasome subunits, and ubiquitin with DNA-bound c-MYC, consistent with induced degradation of c-MYC on DNA. In addition to c-MYC, 1,25D accelerates the turnover of other FBW7 target proteins. Intriguingly, FBW7 is essential for optimal VDR gene expression. It is also recruited to VDR targets genes, and its depletion attenuates 1,25D-stimulated VDR DNA binding, transactivation, and cell cycle arrest. Thus, the VDR and FBW7 are mutual cofactors, which provides a molecular basis for the cancer-preventive actions of vitamin D through accelerated turnover of FBW7 target proteins.",

Yet, developmental mechanisms for these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 is temporally expressed specifically in postnatal frontal cortex in mice, and its genetic deletion results in an increased density of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in medial PFC during postnatal development. Furthermore, initiation of Cyp26b1 expression in neonatal PFC depends on the connections between the thalamus and the neocortex. Thus, the thalamus has a postnatal role in regulating PV neuron development in PFC by inducing Cyp26b1 and thereby restricting retinoic acid signaling. Prenatally, the lack of thalamic input causes an aberrant radial distribution of medial ganglionic eminence-derived interneurons throughout the cortex. Therefore, the thalamus controls PV neuron development in PFC both by region-specific and cortex-wide mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Escaping from imminent danger is an instinctive behaviour fundamental for survival that requires classifying sensory stimuli as harmless or threatening. The absence of threat allows animals to forage for essential resources, but as the level of threat and potential for harm increases, they have to decide whether or not to seek safety1. Despite previous work on instinctive defensive behaviours in rodents2-13, little is known about how the brain computes the threat level for initiating escape. Here we show that the probability and vigour of escape in mice scale with the intensity of innate threats, and are well described by a theoretical model that computes the distance between threat level and an escape threshold. Calcium imaging and optogenetics in the midbrain of freely behaving mice show that the activity of excitatory VGluT2+ neurons in the deep layers of the medial superior colliculus (mSC) represents the threat stimulus intensity and is predictive of escape, whereas dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) VGluT2+ neurons encode exclusively the escape choice and control escape vigour. We demonstrate a feed-forward monosynaptic excitatory connection from mSC to dPAG neurons that is weak and unreliable, yet necessary for escape behaviour, and which we suggest provides a synaptic threshold for dPAG activation and the initiation of escape. This threshold can be overcome by high mSC network activity because of short-term synaptic facilitation and recurrent excitation within the mSC, which amplifies and sustains synaptic drive to the dPAG. Thus, dPAG VGluT2+ neurons compute escape decisions and vigour using a synaptic mechanism to threshold threat information received from the mSC, and provide a biophysical model of how the brain performs a critical behavioural computation.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied successfully to brain decoding and image reconstruction from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. However, direct training of a DNN with fMRI data is often avoided because the size of available data is thought to be insufficient to train a complex network with numerous parameters. Instead, a pre-trained DNN has served as a proxy for hierarchical visual representations, and fMRI data were used to decode individual DNN features of a stimulus image using a simple linear model, which were then passed to a reconstruction module. Here, we present our attempt to directly train a DNN model with fMRI data and the corresponding stimulus images to build an end-to-end reconstruction model. We trained a generative adversarial network with an additional loss term defined in a high-level feature space (feature loss) using up to 6,000 training data points (natural images and the fMRI responses). The trained deep generator network was tested on an independent dataset, directly producing a reconstructed image given an fMRI pattern as the input. The reconstructions obtained from the proposed method showed resemblance with both natural and artificial test stimuli. The accuracy increased as a function of the training data size, though not outperforming the decoded feature-based method with the available data size. Ablation analyses indicated that the feature loss played a critical role to achieve accurate reconstruction. Our results suggest a potential for the end-to-end framework to learn a direct mapping between brain activity and perception given even larger datasets.",

Our study reveals an improved computational efficiency and robustness of optimization compared to established approaches, when using Hessians computed with adjoint sensitivity analysis. The hybrid computation method was more than two-fold faster than the best competitor.

    "abstract": "Building a cerebral cortex of the proper size involves balancing rates and timing of neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, neurogenesis, and cell death. The cellular mechanisms connecting genetic mutations to brain malformation phenotypes are still poorly understood. Microcephaly may result when NSC divisions are too slow, produce neurons too early, or undergo apoptosis, but the relative contributions of these cellular mechanisms to various types of microcephaly are not understood. We previously showed that mouse mutants in Kif20b (formerly called Mphosph1, Mpp1, or KRMP1) have small cortices that show elevated apoptosis, and defects in maturation of NSC midbodies, which mediate cytokinetic abscission. Here we test the contribution of intrinsic NSC apoptosis to brain size reduction in this lethal microcephaly model. By making double mutants with the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Trp53 (p53), we find that apoptosis of cortical NSCs accounts for most of the microcephaly, but that there is a significant apoptosis-independent contribution as well. Remarkably, heterozygous p53 deletion is sufficient to fully rescue survival of the Kif20b mutant into adulthood. In addition, the NSC midbody maturation defects are not rescued by p53 deletion, showing that they are either upstream of p53 activation, or in a parallel pathway. Thus, this work potentially identifies a novel midbody-mediated pathway for p53 activation, and elucidates both NSC apoptosis and abscission mechanisms that could underlie human microcephaly or other brain malformations.",

The production of NC cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a valuable approach to study human NC biology. However, the origin of human trunk NC remains undefined and therefore current in vitro differentiation strategies induce only a modest yield of trunk NC cells. Here we show that hPSC-derived axial progenitors, the posteriorly-located drivers of embryonic axis elongation, give rise to trunk NC cells and their derivatives. Moreover, we define the molecular signatures associated with the emergence of human NC cells of distinct axial identities in vitro. Collectively, our findings indicate that there are two routes toward a human post-cranial NC state: the birth of cardiac and vagal NC is facilitated by retinoic acid-induced posteriorisation of an anterior precursor whereas trunk NC arises within a pool of posterior axial progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Human innate immunity employs cellular and humoral mechanisms to facilitate rapid killing of invading bacteria. The direct killing of bacteria by human serum is mainly attributed to the activity of the complement system that forms pores in Gram-negative bacteria. Although Gram-positive bacteria are considered resistant to serum killing, we here uncover that normal human serum effectively kills Enterococcus faecium. Comparison of a well-characterized collection of commensal and clinical E. faecium isolates revealed that human serum specifically kills commensal E. faecium strains isolated from normal gut microbiota, but not clinical isolates. Inhibitor studies show that the human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA), but not complement, is responsible for killing of commensal E. faecium strains in human normal serum. This is remarkable since hGIIA concentrations in  non-inflamed serum were considered too low to be bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies showed that serum hGIIA specifically causes permeabilization of commensal E. faecium membranes. Altogether, we find that a normal serum concentration of hGIIA effectively kills commensal E. faecium and that hGIIA resistance of clinical E. faecium could have contributed to the ability of these strains to become opportunistic pathogens in hospitalized patients.\\n\\nImportanceHuman normal serum contains antimicrobial components that effective kill invading Gram-negative bacteria. Although Gram-positive bacteria are generally considered resistant to serum killing, here we show that normal human effectively kills the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium strains that live as commensals in the gut of humans. In contrast, clinical E. faecium strains that are responsible for opportunistic infections in debilitated patients are resistant against human serum. The key factor in serum responsible for killing is group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) that effectively destabilizes commensal E. faecium membranes. We believe that hGIIA resistance by clinical E. faecium could have contributed to the ability of these strains to cause opportunistic infections in hospitalized patients. Altogether, understanding mechanisms of immune defense and bacterial resistance could aid in further development of novel anti-infective strategies against medically important multidrug resistant Gram-positive pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Determining which target to pursue is a challenging and error-prone first step in developing a therapeutic treatment for a disease, where missteps are potentially very costly given the long-time frames and high expenses of drug development. We identified examples of successes and failures of target-indication pairs in clinical trials across 875 targets and 574 disease indications to build a gold-standard data set of 6,140 known clinical outcomes. We used information from Open Targets and others databases that covered 17 different sources of evidence for target-indication association and represented the data as a matrix of 21,437x2,211x17 with over two million non-null values. We designed and executed three benchmarking strategies to examine the performance of multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Elasticnet, Random Forest, Tensor Factorization and Gradient Boosting Machine. With ten-fold cross validation, tensor factorization achieved AUROC=0.82{+/-}0.02 and AUPRC=0.71{+/-}0.03. Across multiple validation schemes, this was comparable or better than other methods. Tensor factorization is a general form of matrix factorization that has been successfully exploited in recommendation systems that suggest items to users based on their existing preference on a small number of items. Our application, using Bayesian probabilistic modelling, extends the capacity of matrix factorization to model multiple relationships between and among targets and indications. We use the model to show that our predicted probabilities of success correlate with clinical phases, and within clinical phase we can predict which trials are most likely to succeed.",

    "abstract": "Salt bridges form between pairs of ionisable residues in close proximity and are important interactions in proteins. While salt bridges are known to be important both for protein stability, recognition and regulation, we still do not have fully accurate predictive models to assess the energetic contributions of salt bridges. Molecular dynamics simulations is one technique that may be used study the complex relationship between structure, solvation and energetics of salt bridges, but the accuracy of such simulations depend on the force field used. We have used NMR data on the B1 domain of protein G (GB1) to benchmark molecular dynamics simulations. Using enhanced sampling simulations, we calculated the free energy of forming a salt bridge for three possible ionic interactions in GB1. The NMR experiments showed that these interactions are either not formed, or only very weakly formed, in solution. In contrast, we show that the stability of the salt bridges is slightly overestimated in simulations of GB1 using six commonly used combinations of force fields and water models. We therefore conclude that further work is needed to refine our ability to model quantitatively the stability of salt bridges through simulations, and that comparisons between experiments and simulations will play a crucial role in furthering our understanding of this important interaction.",

    "abstract": "The migration of immune cells is guided by specific chemical signals, such as chemokine gradients. Their trajectories can also be diverted by physical cues and obstacles imposed by the cellular environment, such as topography, rigidity, adhesion, or hydraulic resistance. On the example of hydraulic resistance, it was shown that neutrophil preferentially follow paths of least resistance, a phenomenon referred to as barotaxis. We here combined quantitative imaging and physical modeling to show that barotaxis results from a force imbalance at the scale of the cell, which is amplified by the acto-myosin intrinsic polarization capacity. Strikingly, we found that macropinocytosis specifically confers to immature dendritic cells a unique capacity to overcome this physical bias by facilitating external fluid transport across the cell, thereby enhancing their space exploration capacity in vivo and promoting their tissue-patrolling function. Conversely, mature dendritic cells, which down-regulate macropinocytosis, were found to be sensitive to hydraulic resistance. Theoretical modeling suggested that barotaxis, which helps them avoid dead-ends, may accelerate their migration to lymph nodes, where they initiate adaptive immune responses. We conclude that the physical properties of the microenvironment of moving cells can introduce biases in their migratory behaviors but that specific active mechanisms such as macropinocytosis have emerged to diminish the influence of these biases, allowing motile cells to reach their final destination and efficiently fulfill their functions.",

To our knowledge, these studies provide the first demonstration that CRISPR-Cas nucleases can induce substantial off-target mutations in vivo, a result we obtained using a deliberately promiscuous guide RNA (gRNA).

In the present study, we examine tissue concentrations of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin to see how they locally vary across multiple areas of the macaque cortex. Our results indicate that different cortical areas exhibit varying levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Using cluster analysis, we examine how similar cortical regions are to each other, finding that similarities in neurochemical content are shared by areas that exhibit similar functionality.

    "abstract": "The key negative regulatory gene of the RAS pathway, NF1, is mutated or deleted in numerous cancer types and is associated with increased cancer risk and drug resistance. Even though women with neurofibromatosis (germline NF1 mutations) have a substantially increased breast cancer risk at a young age and NF1 is commonly mutated in sporadic breast cancers, we have a limited understanding of the role of NF1 in breast cancer. Much of our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functional loss of NF1 comes from mouse models that do not completely recapitulate the phenotypes of human NF1. We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to create Nf1 rat models to evaluate the effect of Nf1 deficiency on tumorigenesis. The resulting Nf1 indels induced highly penetrant, aggressive mammary adenocarcinomas that express estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. We identified distinct Nf1 isoforms that were altered during tumorigenesis.\\n\\nTo evaluate NF1 in human breast cancer, we analyzed genomic changes in a breast cancer dataset of 2,000 clinically annotated breast cancers. We found NF1 shallow deletions in 25% of sporadic breast cancers, which correlated with poor clinical outcome. To identify biological networks impacted by NF1 deficiency, we constructed gene co-expression networks using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and identified a network connected to ESR1 (estrogen receptor). Moreover, NF1-deficient cancers correlated with established RAS activation signatures. Estrogen-dependence was verified by estrogen-ablation in Nf1 rats where rapid tumor regression was observed. These results demonstrated the significant role NF1 plays in both NF1-related breast cancer and sporadic breast cancer.",

Genotypic characterization of the chimeras indicates that emergence of compensatory mutations in the E protein is required to restore virus replicative fitness. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV.

    "abstract": "AbstarctInsect microbiomes influence many fundamental host traits, including functions of practical significance such as their capacity as vectors to transmit parasites and pathogens. The knowledge on the diversity and development of the gut microbiomes in various blood feeding insects is thus crucial not only for theoretical purposes, but also for the development of better disease control strategies. In Triatominae (Heteroptera: Reduviidae), the blood feeding vectors of Chagas disease in South America and parts of North America, the investigation of the microbiomes is in its infancy. The few studies done on microbiomes of South American Triatominae species indicate a relatively low taxonomic diversity and a high host specificity. We designed a comparative survey to serve several purposes: I) to obtain a better insight into the overall microbiome diversity in different species, II) to check the long term stability of the interspecific differences, III) to describe the ontogenetic changes of the microbiome, and IV) to determine the potential correlation between microbiome composition and presence in the vector gut of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Using 16S amplicons of two abundant species from the southern US, and four laboratory reared colonies, we showed that the microbiome composition is determined by host species, rather than locality or environment. The OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) determination confirms a low microbiome diversity, with 12-17 main OTUs detected in wild populations of T. sanguisuga and T. protracta. Among the dominant bacterial taxa are Acinetobacter and Proteiniphilum but also the symbiotic bacterium Arsenophonus triatominarum, previously believed to only live intracellularly. The possibility of ontogenic microbiome changes was evaluated in all six developmental stages and faeces of the laboratory reared model Rhodnius prolixus. We detected considerable changes along the hosts ontogeny, including clear trends in the abundance variation of the three dominant bacteria, namely Enterococcus, Acinetobacter and Arsenophonus. Finally, we screened the samples for the presence of T. cruzi. Comparing the parasite presence with the microbiome composition, we assessed the possible significance of the latter in the epidemiology of the disease. Particularly, we found a trend towards more diverse microbiomes in T. cruzi positive T. protracta specimens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe rumen microbiota provides essential services to its host and, through its role in ruminant production, contributes to human nutrition and food security. A thorough knowledge of the genetic potential of rumen microbes will provide opportunities for improving the sustainability of ruminant production systems. The availability of gene reference catalogs from gut microbiomes has advanced the understanding of the role of the microbiota in health and disease in humans and other mammals. In this work, we established a catalog of reference prokaryote genes from the bovine rumen.\\n\\nResultsUsing deep metagenome sequencing we identified 13,825,880 non-redundant prokaryote genes from the bovine rumen. Compared to human, pig and mouse gut metagenome catalogs, the rumen is larger and richer in functions and microbial species associated with the degradation of plant cell wall material and production of methane. Genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the breakdown of plant polysaccharides showed a particularly high richness that is otherwise impossible to infer from available genomes or shallow metagenomics sequencing. The catalog expands by several folds the dataset of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes described in the rumen. Using an independent dataset from a group of 77 cattle fed 4 common dietary regimes, we found that only <0.1% of genes were shared by all animals, which contrast with a large overlap for functions, i.e. 63% for KEGG functions. Different diets induced differences in the relative abundance rather than the presence or absence of genes explaining the great adaptability of cattle to rapidly adjust to dietary changes.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data bring new insights into functions, carbohydrate-degrading enzymes and microbes of the rumen that is complementing the available information on microbial genomes. The catalog is a significant biological resource enabling deeper understanding of phenotypes and biological processes and will be expanded as new data is made available.",

Among the parameters that regulate this program in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromatin structure has been at the center of attention without considering the contribution of transcription. Here, we revisit the replication initiation program in the light of pervasive transcription. We find that noncoding RNA transcription termination in the vicinity of replication origins or ARS (Autonomously Replicating Sequences) maximizes replication initiation by restricting transcriptional readthrough into ARS. Consistently, high natural nascent transcription correlates with low ARS efficiency and late replication timing. High readthrough transcription is also linked to chromatin features such as high levels of H3K36me3 and deacetylated nucleosomes. Moreover, forcing ARS readthrough transcription promotes these histone modifications. Finally, replication initiation defects induced by increased transcriptional readthrough are partially rescued in the absence of H3K36 methylation. Altogether, these observations indicate that natural pervasive transcription into ARS influences replication initiation through chromatin remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Although humans can understand speech using the auditory modality alone, in noisy environments visual speech information from the talkers mouth can rescue otherwise unintelligible auditory speech. To investigate the neural substrates of multisensory speech perception, we recorded neural activity from the human superior temporal gyrus using two very different techniques: either directly, using surface electrodes implanted in five participants with epilepsy (electrocorticography, ECOG), or indirectly, using blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) in six healthy control fMRI participants. Both ECOG and fMRI participants viewed the same clear and noisy audiovisual speech stimuli and performed the same speech recognition task. Both techniques demonstrated a sharp functional boundary in the STG, which corresponded to an anatomical boundary defined by the posterior edge of Heschls gyrus. On the anterior side of the boundary, cortex responded more strongly to clear audiovisual speech than to noisy audiovisual speech, suggesting that anterior STG is primarily involved in processing unisensory auditory speech. On the posterior side of the boundary, cortex preferred noisy audiovisual speech or showed no preference and showed robust responses to auditory-only and visual-only speech, suggesting that posterior STG is specialized for processing multisensory audiovisual speech. For both ECOG and fMRI, the transition between the functionally distinct regions happened within 10 mm of anterior-to-posterior distance along the STG. We relate this boundary to the multisensory neural code underlying speech perception and propose that it represents an important functional division within the human speech perception network.",

    "abstract": "ATP synthases populate the inner membranes of mitochondria, where they produce the majority of the ATP required by the cell. Cryo-electron tomograms of these membranes from yeast to vertebrates have consistently revealed a very precise organization of these enzymes. Rather than being scattered throughout the membrane, the ATP synthases form dimers, and these dimers are organized into rows that extend for hundreds of nanometers. These rows are only observed in the membrane invaginations known as cristae, specifically along their sharply curved edges. Although the presence of these macromolecular structures has been irrefutably linked to the proper development of cristae morphology, it has been unclear what drives the formation of the rows and why they are specifically localized in the cristae. We present the result of a quantitative molecular-simulation analysis that strongly suggests that the ATP synthase dimers organize into rows spontaneously, driven by a long-ranged attractive force that results from relief in the overall elastic strain of the membrane. This strain is caused by the V-like shape of the dimers, unique among membrane-protein complexes, which induces a strong deformation in the surrounding membrane. The process of row formation is therefore not a result of protein-protein interactions, or of a specific lipid composition of the membrane. We further hypothesize that once assembled, the ATP synthase dimer rows prime the inner mitochondrial membrane to develop folds and invaginations, by causing macroscopic membrane ridges that ultimately become the cristae edges. In this view, mitochondrial ATP synthases would contribute to the generation of a morphology that maximizes the surface area of the inner membrane, and thus ATP production. Finally, we outline the key experiments that would be required to verify or refute this hypothesis.",

Yet, this condition often requires fast and drastic stochastic shifts between good and bad years. We hypothesize that the host seed banking strategy can evolve in response to coevolution with parasites because the coevolutionary cycles promote a gradually changing environment over longer times than seed persistence. We study the evolution of host germination fraction as a quantitative trait using both pairwise competition and multiple mutant competition methods, while the germination locus can be genetically linked or unlinked with the host locus under coevolution. In a gene-for-gene model of coevolution, hosts evolve a seed bank strategy under unstable coevolutionary cycles promoted by moderate to high costs of resistance or strong disease severity. Moreover, when assuming genetic linkage between coevolving and germination loci, the resistant genotype always evolves seed banking in contrast to susceptible hosts. Under a matching-allele interaction, both hosts genotypes exhibit the same seed banking strategy irrespective of the genetic linkage between loci. We suggest host-parasite coevolution as an additional hypothesis for the evolution of seed banking as a temporal bet-hedging strategy.",

    "abstract": "Multiple nuclear markers provide genetic polymorphism data for molecular systematics and population genetic studies. They are especially required for the coalescent-based analyses that can be used to accurately estimate species trees and infer population demographic histories. However, in avian evolutionary studies, these powerful coalescent-based methods are hindered by the lack of a sufficient number of markers. In this study, we designed PCR primers to amplify 136 nuclear protein-coding loci (NPCLs) by scanning the published Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genomes. To test their utility, we amplified these loci in 41 bird species representing 23 Aves orders. The sixty-three best-performing NPCLs, based on high PCR success rates, were selected which had various mutation rates and were evenly distributed across 17 avian autosomal chromosomes and the Z chromosome. To test phylogenetic resolving power of these markers, we conducted a Neoavian phylogenies analysis using 63 concatenated NPCL markers derived from 48 whole genomes of birds. The resulting phylogenetic topology, to a large extent, is congruence with results resolved by previous whole genome data. To test the level of intraspecific polymorphism in these makers, we examined the genetic diversity in four populations of the Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) at 17 of NPCL markers chosen at random. Our results showed that these NPCL markers exhibited a level of polymorphism comparable with mitochondrial loci. Therefore, this set of pan-avian nuclear protein-coding loci has great potential to facilitate studies in avian phylogenetics and population genetics.",

    "abstract": "Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) lack common variants that lead to reproducible genome-wide disease associations. Here we used rare variant approaches to assess the disease associations of 85 orphan or understudied GPCRs in an unselected cohort of 51,289 individuals. Rare loss-of-function variants, missense variants predicted to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic, and a subset of rare synonymous variants were used as independent data sets for sequence kernel association testing (SKAT). Strong, phenome-wide disease associations shared by two or more variant categories were found for 39% of the GPCRs. Validating the bioinformatics and SKAT analyses, functional characterization of rare missense and synonymous variants of GPR39, a Family A GPCR, showed altered expression and/or Zn2+-mediated signaling for members of both variant classes. Results support the utility of rare variant analyses for identifying disease associations for genes that lack common variants, while also highlighting the functional importance of rare synonymous variants.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRare variant approaches have emerged as a viable way to identify disease associations for genes without clinically important common variants. Rare synonymous variants are generally considered benign. We demonstrate that rare synonymous variants represent a potentially important dataset for deriving disease associations, here applied to analysis of a set of orphan or understudied GPCRs. Synonymous variants yielded disease associations in common with loss-of-function or missense variants in the same gene. We rationalize their associations with disease by confirming their impact on expression and agonist activation of a representative example, GPR39. This study highlights the importance of rare synonymous variants in human physiology, and argues for their routine inclusion in any comprehensive analysis of genomic variants as potential causes of disease.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary and dynamical investigations on real viral populations indicate that RNA replication can range between two extremes given by so-called stamping machine replication (SMR) and geometric replication (GR). The impact of asymmetries in replication for single-stranded, (+) sense RNA viruses has been up to now studied with deterministic models. However, viral replication should be better described by including stochasticity, since the cell infection process is typically initiated with a very small number of RNA macromolecules, and thus largely influenced by intrinsic noise. Under appropriate conditions, deterministic theoretical descriptions of viral RNA replication predict a quasineutral coexistence scenario, with a line of fixed points involving different strands equilibrium ratios depending on the initial conditions. Recent research on the quasineutral coexistence in two competing populations reveals that stochastic fluctuations fundamentally alters the mean-field scenario, and one of the two species outcompetes the other one. In this manuscript we study this phenomenon for RNA viral replication modes by means of stochastic simulations and a diffusion approximation. Our results reveal that noise has a strong impact on the amplification of viral RNA, also causing the emergence of noise-induced bistability. We provide analytical criteria for the dominance of (+) sense strands depending on the initial populations on the line of equilibria, which are in agreement with direct stochastic simulation results. The biological implications of this noise-driven mechanism are discussed within the framework of the evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses with different modes of replication.",

In response, we describe tools that make it easy to capture, and assign identifiers to, data and code throughout the data lifecycle. We illustrate the use of these tools via a case study involving a multi-step analysis that creates an atlas of putative transcription factor binding sites from terabytes of ENCODE DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing data. We show how the tools automate routine but complex tasks, capture analysis algorithms in understandable and reusable forms, and harness fast networks and powerful cloud computers to process data rapidly, all without sacrificing usability or reproducibility--thus ensuring that big data are not hard-to-(re)use data. We compare and contrast our approach with other approaches to big data analysis and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Optimal growth temperature is a fundamental characteristic of all living organisms. Knowledge of this temperature is central to the study the organism, the thermal stability and temperature dependent activity of its genes, and the bioprospecting of its genome for thermally adapted proteins. While high throughput sequencing methods have dramatically increased the availability of genomic information, the growth temperatures of the source organisms are often unknown. This limits the study and technological application of these species and their genomes. Here, we present a novel method for the prediction of growth temperatures of prokaryotes using only genomic sequences. By applying the reverse ecology principle that an organisms genome includes identifiable adaptations to its native environment, we can predict a species optimal growth temperature with an accuracy of 4.69 {degrees}C root-mean-square error and a correlation coefficient of 0.908. The accuracy can be further improved for specific taxonomic clades or by excluding psychrophiles. This method provides a valuable tool for the rapid calculation of organism growth temperature when only the genome sequence is known.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains gene silencing by catalyzing methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3) within chromatin. By designing a system whereby PRC2-mediated repressive domains were collapsed and then reconstructed in an inducible fashion in vivo, a two-step mechanism of H3K27me2/3 domain formation became evident. First, PRC2 is stably recruited by the actions of JARID2 and MTF2 to a limited number of spatially interacting \\\"nucleation sites\\\", creating H3K27me3-forming polycomb foci within the nucleus. Second, PRC2 is allosterically activated via its binding to H3K27me3 and rapidly spreads H3K27me2/3 both in cis and in far-cis via long-range contacts. As PRC2 proceeds further from the nucleation sites, its stability on chromatin decreases such that domains of H3K27me3 remain proximal, and those of H3K27me2 distal, to the nucleation sites. This study demonstrates the principles of de novo establishment of PRC2-mediated repressive domains across the genome.",

    "abstract": "While widespread genome sequencing ushers in a new era of preventive medicine, the tools for predictive genomics are still lacking. Time and resource limitations mean that human diseases remain uncharacterised because of an inability to predict clinically relevant genetic variants. The structural or functional impact of a coding variant is mirrored by allele frequencies amongst the general population. Studies in protein function frequently target sites that are evolutionarily preserved. However, rare diseases are often attributable to variants in genes that are highly conserved. An immunological disorder exemplifying this challenge occurs through damaging mutations in RAG1 and RAG2. RAG deficiency presents at an early age with a distinct phenotype of life-threatening immunodeficiency or autoimmunity. Many tools exist for variant pathogenicity prediction but these cannot account for the probability of variant occurrence. We present variants in RAG1 and RAG2 proteins which are most likely to be seen clinically as disease-causing. Our method of mutation rate residue frequency builds a map of most probable mutations allowing preemptive functional analysis. We compare the accuracy of our predicted probabilities to functional measurements and provide the method for application to any monogenic disorder.\\n\\nFundingThis work is funded by the University of Leeds 110 Anniversary Research Scholarship and by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR, grant number RG65966).

    "abstract": "Release of the neuromodulator acetylcholine into cortical circuits supports cognition, although its precise role and mechanisms of action are not well-understood. Little is known about functional differences in cholinergic modulatory effects across cortical model systems, but anatomical evidence suggests that such differences likely exist because, for example, the expression of cholinergic receptors differs profoundly both within and between species. In the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys, cholinergic receptors are strongly expressed by inhibitory interneurons. Here, we examine m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expression by two subclasses of inhibitory interneurons--identified by their expression of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and calretinin--in the middle temporal extrastriate area (MT) of the macaque. Using dual-immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we find that the majority of calbindin-immunoreative neurons (55%) and only few calretinin-immunoreactive neurons (10%) express the m1 acetylcholine receptor. This differs from the pattern observed in V1 of the same species, lending further support to the notion that cholinergic modulation in cortex is tuned such that different cortical compartments will respond to acetylcholine release in different ways.",

    "abstract": "Oscillatory activity robustly correlates with task demands during many cognitive tasks. However, not only are the network mechanisms underlying the generation of these rhythms poorly understood, but it is also still unknown to what extent they may play a functional role, as opposed to being a mere epiphenomenon. Here we study the mechanisms underlying the influence of oscillatory drive on network dynamics related to cognitive processing in simple working memory (WM), and memory recall tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the frequency of oscillatory input interacts with the intrinsic dynamics in networks of recurrently coupled spiking neurons to cause changes of state: the neuronal correlates of the corresponding cognitive process. We find that slow oscillations, in the delta and theta band, are effective in activating network states associated with memory recall by virtue of the hysteresis in sweeping through a saddle-node bifurcation. On the other hand, faster oscillations, in the beta range, can serve to clear memory states by resonantly driving transient bouts of spike synchrony which destabilize the activity. We leverage a recently derived set of exact mean-field equations for networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons to systematically study the bifurcation structure in the periodically forced spiking network. Interestingly, we find that the oscillatory signals which are most effective in allowing flexible switching between network states are not smooth, pure sinusoids, but rather burst-like, with a sharp onset. We show that such periodic bursts themselves readily arise spontaneously in networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that the burst frequency can be tuned via changes in tonic drive. Finally, we show that oscillations in the gamma range can actually stabilize WM states which otherwise would not persist.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOscillations are ubiquitous in the brain and often correlate with distinct cognitive tasks. Nonetheless their role in shaping network dynamics, and hence in driving behavior during such tasks is poorly understood. Here we provide a comprehensive study of the effect of periodic drive on neuronal networks exhibiting multistability, which has been invoked as a possible circuit mechanism underlying the storage of memory states. We find that oscillatory drive in low frequency bands leads to robust switching between stored patterns in a Hopfield-like model, while oscillations in the beta band suppress sustained activity altogether. Furthermore, inputs in the gamma band can lead to the creation of working-memory states, which otherwise do not exist in the absence of oscillatory drive.",
