    "abstract": "Local adaptation is a key driver of ecological specialization and the formation of new species. Despite its importance, the evolution of gene regulatory divergence among locally-adapted populations is poorly understood, especially how that divergence manifests in nature. Here, we evaluate gene expression divergence and allele-specific gene expression responses for locally-adapted coastal perennial and inland annual accessions of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, in a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Overall, 6765 (73%) of surveyed genes were differentially expressed between coastal and inland habitats, while 7213 (77%) were differentially expressed between the coastal perennial and inland annual accessions. Further, 18% of transcripts had significant genotype x site (GxE) effects. Habitat-specific differential expression was found for 62% of the GxE transcripts (differential expression in one habitat, but not the other), while only 94 ([~]5%) GxE transcripts had crossing reaction norms. Cis-regulatory variation was pervasive, affecting 79% (5532) of differentially expressed genes. We detected trans effects for 52% (3611) of differentially expressed genes. Consistent with the supergene hypothesis of chromosome inversion evolution, a locally adaptive inversion was enriched for cis-regulatory divergence. These results provide multiple new insights into the evolution of transcriptome-wide gene regulatory divergence and plasticity among locally adapted populations.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100044).\\n\\nSex chromosomes have repeatedly evolved from a pair of autosomes1. Consequently, X and Y chromosomes initially have similar gene content, but ongoing Y degeneration leads to reduced Y gene expression and eventual Y gene loss. The resulting imbalance in gene expression between Y genes and the rest of the genome is expected to reduce male fitness, especially when protein networks have components from both autosomes and sex chromosomes. A diverse set of dosage compensating mechanisms that alleviates these negative effects has been described in animals2-4. However, the early steps in the evolution of dosage compensation remain unknown and dosage compensation is poorly understood in plants5. Here we show a novel dosage compensation mechanism in the evolutionarily young XY sex determination system of the plant Silene latifolia. Genomic imprinting results in higher expression from the maternal X chromosome in both males and females. This compensates for reduced Y expression in males but results in X overexpression in females and may be detrimental. It could represent a transient early stage in the evolution of dosage compensation. Our finding has striking resemblance to the first stage proposed by Ohno for the evolution of X inactivation in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis, and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how Fat1 exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissu-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation, but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner motor neurons. Here, we show that constitutive Fat1 disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. Fat1 is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue as a cell type in which Fat1 activity is required for the non-cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, Fat1 is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how Fat1 coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.\\n\\nAuthor summaryFat cadherins are evolutionarily conserved cell adhesion molecules playing key roles in modulating tissue morphogenesis, through the control of collective cell behavior and polarity. We previously identified the mouse Fat1 gene as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis. The present study explores how Fat1 influences neuromuscular morphogenesis in the context of development of a flat subcutaneous muscle, the cutaneous maximus muscle (CM), formed by migratory progenitors emerging from forelimb levels somites, and innervated by a pool of brachial spinal motor neurons (MNs). CM development involves the rostrocaudal planar migration of muscle progenitors and subsequent elongation of muscle fibers to form a fan-shaped muscle. We previously reported that Fat1 was required in muscle progenitors to modulate their migration polarity. Here, these results were expanded by exploring the contribution of Fat1 activities in two other cell types, mesenchymal cells and MNs. We show that Fat1 disruption in connective tissue robustly alters CM muscle morphogenesis, affecting not only progenitor migration and myofiber expansion, but also subsequently impairing axon growth and specification of cognate MNs. In parallel, Fat1 acts in MNs to modulate axonal growth and neuronal specification, modestly influencing muscle morphology. Together, these results show that Fat1 coordinates the coupling between muscle and neuronal development by playing complementary functions in mesenchyme, muscles and MNs. These findings could guide research on muscle pathologies associated with FAT1 alterations in humans.",

    "abstract": "This work presents an efficient framework, based on manifold approximation, for generating brain fingerprints from multi-modal data. The proposed framework represents images as bags of local features, which are used to build a subject proximity graph. Compact fingerprints are obtained by projecting this graph in a low-dimensional manifold, using spectral embedding. Experiments using the T1/T2-weighted MRI, diffusion MRI, and resting state fMRI data of 945 Human Connectome Project subjects demonstrate the benefit of combining multiple modalities, with multi-modal fingerprints more discriminative than those generated from individual modalities. Results also highlight the link between fingerprint similarity and genetic proximity, monozygotic twins having more similar fingerprints than dizygotic or non-twin siblings. This link is also reflected in the differences of feature correspondences between twin/sibling pairs, occurring in major brain structures and across hemispheres. The robustness of the proposed framework to factors like image alignment and scan resolution, as well as the reproducibility of results on retest scans, suggest the potential of multi-modal brain fingerprinting for characterizing individuals in a large cohort analysis. In addition, taking inspiration from the computer vision community, the proposed rank retrieval evaluation based on the task of twin/sibling identification and using Mean Average Precision (MAP) can be used for a standardized comparison of future brain fingerprints.",

    "abstract": "We developed the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline that detects co-linearity in gene arrangement among multiple closely related genomes; find ortholog groups; and encodes the evolutionary history of each ortholog group into a representative network (OrthNet). Using a search based on network topology, out of a total of 17,432 OrthNets in six Brassicaceae genomes, we identified 1,394 that included gene transposition-duplication (tr-d) events in one or more genomes. Occurrences of tr-d shared by subsets of Brassicaceae genomes mirrored the divergence times between the genomes and their repeat contents. The majority of tr-d events resulted in truncated open reading frames (ORFs) in the duplicated loci. However, the duplicates with complete ORFs were significantly more frequent than expected from random events. They also had a higher chance of being expressed and derived from older tr-d events. We also found an enrichment, compared to random chance, of tr-d events with complete loss of intergenic sequence conservation between the original and duplicated loci. Finally, we identified tr-d events uniquely found in two extremophytes among the six Brassicaceae genomes, including tr-d of SALT TOLERANCE 32 and ZINC TRANSPORTER 3. The CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline provides a flexible and a modular toolkit to compare gene order, encode and visualize evolutionary paths among orthologs as networks, and identify all gene loci that share the same evolutionary history using network topology searches.\\n\\nFunding source: This work was supported by National Science Foundation (MCB 1616827) and the Next Generation BioGreen21 Program (PJ011379) of the Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.\\n\\nOnline-only Supplementary materials includes supplementary text (S1-S10), methods (M1-M4), figures (S1-S7), and tables (S1-S3), in two PDF files, one for text and methods and the other for figures and tables.

This system has been successfully adapted for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by expressing Cas9 and the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) from a plasmid. In the procedures published to date, the cloning step that introduces a specific sgRNA target sequence into the plasmid is the most tedious and time-consuming. To increase the efficiency of applying the CRISPR/Cas9 system in fission yeast, we here developed a cloning-free procedure that uses gap repair in fission yeast cells to assemble two linear DNA fragments, a gapped Cas9-encoding plasmid and a PCR-amplified sgRNA insert, into a circular plasmid. Both fragments contain only a portion of the ura4 or bsdMX marker so that only the correctly assembled plasmid can confer uracil prototrophy or blasticidin resistance. We show that this gap-repair-based and cloning-free CRISPR/Cas9 procedure permits rapid and efficient point mutation knock-in, endogenous N-terminal tagging, and genomic sequence deletion in fission yeast.",

Although diet is among the most powerful available tools for affecting the health of humans and their relationship with their microbiota, investigation into the effects of diet on CDI has been limited. Here, we show in mice that the consumption of microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary plant polysaccharides has a significant impact on CDI. Specifically, using a model of antibiotic-induced CDI that typically resolves within 12 days of infection, we demonstrate that MAC-deficient diets perpetuate CDI.

Unlike the latter species, S. sisymbriifolium induces eggs of the cyst nematode, Globodera pallida, to hatch and migrate into its roots, but then arrests further nematode maturation. In order to provide researchers with a partial blueprint of its genetic make-up so that the mechanism of this response might be identified, we used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing to compile a high quality de novo transcriptome of 41,189 unigenes drawn from individually sequenced bud, root, stem, and leaf RNA populations. Functional annotation and BUSCO analysis showed that this transcriptome was surprisingly complete, even though it represented genes expressed at a single time point. By sequencing the 4 organ libraries separately, we found we could get a reliable snapshot of transcript distributions in each organ. A divergent site analysis of the merged transcriptome indicated that this species might have undergone a recent genome duplication and re-diploidization. Further analysis indicated that the plant then retained a disproportionate number of genes associated with photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism in comparison to genes with characteristics of R-proteins or involved in secondary metabolism. The former processes may have given S. sisymbriifolium a bigger competitive advantage than the latter did.",

The distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the sum of ionized and unionized species of a molecule distributed between a hydrophobic organic phase and an aqueous buffer phase. Since the pH affects the ionic state of a molecule, log D value (which is dependent on the concentrations of the ionized species) also becomes dependent on pH.

Using a unique combination of high-throughput binding assays and biochemical analyses, HTPP reveals a complex landscape of binding specificity and functional activity for the T7 primase, determined by sequences flanking the primase recognition site. We identified specific features, such as G/T-rich flanks, which increase primase-DNA binding up to 10-fold and, surprisingly, also increase the length of newly formed RNA (up to 3-fold). To our knowledge, variability in primer length has not been reported for this primase.

If pregabalin had come entirely off patent in September 2015, and Pfizer had not appealed, we estimate the NHS would have spent {pound}502m less on pregabalin to July 2017.\\n\\nConclusionNHS England instructions to GPs regarding branded prescription of pregabalin were widely ignored, and have created much debate around clinical independence in prescribing. Protecting revenue from \\\"skinny labels\\\" will pose a challenge. If Pfizers final appeal on the patent is unsuccessful the NHS can seek reimbursement of excess pregabalin prescribing costs, potentially {pound}502m.",

    "abstract": "PurposeManual review of aligned sequencing reads is required to develop a high-quality list of somatic variants from massively parallel sequencing data (MPS). Despite widespread use in analyzing MPS data, there has been little attempt to describe methods for manual review, resulting in high inter- and intra-lab variability in somatic variant detection and characterization of tumors.\\n\\nMethodsOpen source software was used to develop an optimal method for manual review setup. We also developed a systemic approach to visually inspect each variant during manual review.\\n\\nResultsWe present a standard operating procedures for somatic variant refinement for use by manual reviewers. The approach is enhanced through representative examples of 4 different manual review categories that indicate a reviewers confidence in the somatic variant call and 19 annotation tags that contextualize commonly observed sequencing patterns during manual review. Representative examples provide detailed instructions on how to classify variants during manual review to rectify lack of confidence in automated somatic variant detection.\\n\\nConclusionStandardization of somatic variant refinement through systematization of manual review will improve the consistency and reproducibility of identifying true somatic variants after automated variant calling.",

    "abstract": "Modeling-based methods are conventionally exploited to simulate and predict the dynamics of a system in various fields of engineering. However, due to the intricacy of biological systems, these methods were rarely utilized in bioengineering until recently. By developing advanced computers with the ability to cope with enormous calculations and extending our knowledge about biological systems, modeling-based approaches have been adopted to manipulate biological systems. While utilizing the models to investigate the behavior of a system has some advantages including lower cost and time consumption, such methods were used for tissue engineering scarcely. Exploiting modeling-based methods to tissue engineering field requires developing and utilizing efficient computational methods to model gene regulation and signaling networks, which determine cell response to environmental changes and cellular fate.\\n\\nIn the present work, a novel spatio-temporal method was proposed, predicated on locally uniform mesh refinement. A benchmark comparison was performed with the previously used method and the results indicated the better performance of the incipiently adopted method. Besides, the model was utilized to investigate the effect of a popular differentiating stimulator, namely electrical stimulation, on mesenchymal stem cells as a type of stem cells widely used in tissue engineering. The results of the simulations demonstrated the puissance of such computational models in analyzing and predicting the effect of biochemical and biophysical perturbations on the cells and hence, their potential utility in tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity of biological systems, their heterogeneity, and the internal regulation of each cell and its surrounding, mathematical models that take into account cell signalling, cell population behaviour and the extracellular environment are particularly helpful to understand such complex systems. However, very few of these tools, freely available and computationally efficient, are currently available. To fill this gap, we present here our open-source software, PhysiBoSS, which is built on two available software packages that focus on different scales: intracellular signalling using continuous-time markovian Boolean modelling (MaBoSS) and multicellular behaviour using agent-based modelling (PhysiCell).\\n\\nThe multi-scale feature of PhysiBoSS - its agent-based structure and the possibility to integrate any Boolean network to it - provide a flexible and computationally efficient framework to study heterogeneous cell population growth in diverse experimental set-ups. This tool allows one to explore the effect of environmental and genetic alterations of individual cells at the population level, bridging the critical gap from genotype to phenotype. PhysiBoSS thus becomes very useful when studying population response to treatment, mutations effects, cell modes of invasion or isomorphic morphogenesis events.\\n\\nTo illustrate potential use of PhysiBoSS, we studied heterogeneous cell fate decisions in response to TNF treatment in a 2-D cell population and in a tumour cell 3-D spheroid. We explored the effect of different treatment regimes and the behaviour and selection of several resistant mutants. We highlighted the importance of spatial information on the population dynamics by considering the effect of competition for resources like oxygen. PhysiBoSS is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/gletort/PhysiBoSS), and is distributed open source under the BSD 3-clause license. It is compatible with most Unix systems, and a Docker package (https://hub.docker.com/r/gletort/physiboss/) is provided to ease its deployment in other systems.",
