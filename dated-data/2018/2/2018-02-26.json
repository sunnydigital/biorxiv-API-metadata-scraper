    "abstract": "Perceptual experience results from a complex interplay of bottom-up input and prior knowledge about the world, yet the extent to which knowledge affects perception, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, and the stages of processing at which these two sources of information converge, are still unclear. In several experiments we show that language, in the form of verbal cues, both aids recognition of ambiguous \\\"Mooney\\\" images and improves objective visual discrimination performance in a match/non-match task. We then used electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the mechanisms of this effect. The improved discrimination of images previously labeled was accompanied by a larger occipital-parietal P1 evoked response to the meaningful versus meaningless target stimuli. Time-frequency analysis of the interval between the cue and the target stimulus revealed increases in the power of posterior alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillations when the meaning of the stimuli to be compared was trained. The magnitude of the pre-target alpha difference and the P1 amplitude difference were positively correlated across individuals. These results suggest that prior knowledge prepares the brain for upcoming perception via the modulation of alpha-band oscillations, and that this preparatory state influences early (~120 ms) stages of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in a given environment. Therefore, for any given trajectory one will observe a repeatable sequence of place cell activations as the animal explores. Interestingly, when the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation, although at a highly compressed rate, known as \\\"replays\\\". It is hypothesized that this replay underlies the process of memory consolidation whereby memories are \\\"transferred\\\" from hippocampus to cortex. However, it remains unclear how the memory of a particular environment is actually encoded in the place cell activity and what the mechanism for replay is. Here we study how plasticity during spatial exploration shapes the patterns of synaptic connectivity in model networks of place cells. Specifically, we show how plasticity leads to the emergence of patterns of activity which represent the spatial environment learned. These states become spontaneously active when the animal is quiescent, reproducing the phenomenology of replays. Interestingly, replay emerges most rapidly when place cell activity is modulated by an ongoing oscillation. The optimal oscillation frequency can be calculated analytically, is directly related to the plasticity rule, and for experimentally determined values of the plasticity window in rodent slices gives values in the theta range. A major prediction of this model is that the pairwise correlation of place cells which encode for neighboring locations should increase during initial exploration, leading up to the critical transition. We find such an increase in a population of simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from a rat exploring a novel track. Furthermore, in a rat in which hippocampal theta is reduced through inactivation of the medial septum we find no such increase. Our model is the first to show how theta-modulation can speed up learning by facilitating the emergence of environment-specific network-wide patterns of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal circuits.",

    "abstract": "Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animals behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. As a particular target, we applied this framework to C. elegans thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, the fed and starved worms prefer and avoid from the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient, respectively. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both absolute and temporal derivative of temperature and that their strategy comprised mixture of two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). The DM is a strategy that the worms efficiently reach to specific temperature, which explained thermotactic behaviors of the fed worms. The IM is a strategy that the worms track along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking well observed in previous studies. We also showed the neural basis underlying the strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. In contrast to fed animals, the strategy of starved animals indicated that they escaped the cultivation temperature using only absolute, but not temporal derivative of temperature. Thus, our IRL-based approach is capable of identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and will be applicable to wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making of other organisms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding animal decision-making has been a fundamental problem in neuroscience and behavioral ecology. Many studies analyze actions that represent decision-making in behavioral tasks, in which rewards are artificially designed with specific objectives. However, it is impossible to extend this artificially designed experiment to a natural environment, because in a natural environment, the rewards for freely-behaving animals cannot be clearly defined. To this end, we must reverse the current paradigm so that rewards are identified from behavioral data. Here, we propose a new reverse-engineering approach (inverse reinforcement learning) that can estimate a behavioral strategy from time-series data of freely-behaving animals. By applying this technique with thermotaxis in C. elegans, we successfully identified the reward-based behavioral strategy.",

    "abstract": "It is well-established that brain structures and cognitive functions change across the lifespan. A longstanding hypothesis called age differentiation additionally posits that the relations between cognitive functions also change with age. To date however, evidence for age-related differentiation is mixed, and no study has examined differentiation of the relationship between brain and cognition. Here we use multi-group Structural Equation Modeling and SEM Trees to study differences within and between brain and cognition across the adult lifespan (18-88 years) in a large (N>646, closely matched across sexes), population-derived sample of healthy human adults from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (www.cam-can.org). After factor analyses of grey-matter volume (from T1- and T2-weighted MRI) and white-matter organisation (fractional anisotropy from Diffusion-weighted MRI), we found evidence for differentiation of grey and white matter, such that the covariance between brain factors decreased with age. However, we found no evidence for age differentiation between fluid intelligence, language and memory, suggesting a relatively stable covariance pattern between cognitive factors. Finally, we observed a specific pattern of age differentiation between brain and cognitive factors, such that a white matter factor, which loaded most strongly on the hippocampal cingulum, became less correlated with memory performance in later life. These patterns are compatible with reorganization of cognitive functions in the face of neural decline, and/or with the emergence of specific subpopulations in old age.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe theory of age differentiation posits age-related changes in the relationships between brain structures and cognitive domains, either weakening (differentiation) or strengthening (de-differentiation), but evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. Using age-varying covariance models in a large cross-sectional adult lifespan sample, we found age-related reductions in the covariance among both brain measures (neural differentiation), but no covariance change between cognitive factors of fluid intelligence, language and memory. We also observed evidence of uncoupling (differentiation) between a white matter factor and cognitive factors in older age, most strongly for memory. Together, our findings support age-related differentiation as a complex, multifaceted pattern that differs for brain and cognition, and discuss several mechanisms that might explain the changing relationship between brain and cognition.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator in the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway and a cytoplasmic effector in cadherin-based cell adhesion. These functions are ancient within animals, but the earliest steps in {beta}-catenin evolution remain unresolved due to limited data from key lineages - sponges, ctenophores and placozoans. Previous studies in sponges have characterized {beta}-catenin expression dynamics and used GSK3B antagonists to ectopically activate the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway; both approaches rely upon untested assumptions about the conservation of {beta}-catenin function and regulation in sponges. Here, we test these assumptions using an antibody raised against {beta}-catenin from the sponge Ephydatia muelleri. We find that cadherin-complex genes co-precipitate with endogenous Em {beta}-catenin from cell lysates, but that Wnt pathway components do not. However, through immunostaining we detect both cell boundary and nuclear populations, and we find evidence that Em {beta}-catenin is a conserved substrate of GSK3B. Collectively, these data support conserved roles for Em {beta}-catenin in both cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. Additionally, we find evidence for an Em {beta}-catenin population associated with the distal ends of F-actin stress fibers in apparent cell-substrate adhesion structures that resemble focal adhesions. This finding suggests a fundamental difference in the adhesion properties of sponge tissues relative to other animals, in which the adhesion functions of {beta}-catenin are typically restricted to cell-cell adhesions.",

Here, we report the results of the spikefinder challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods.

However, the evolutionary robustness argument, based on the idea that anti-virulence treatments disarm rather than kill pathogens, is controversial. Here we probe the evolutionary robustness of two repurposed drugs, gallium and flucytosine, targeting the iron-scavenging pyoverdine of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\\n\\nMethodologyWe subjected replicated cultures of bacteria to two concentrations of each drug for 20 consecutive days in human serum as an ex-vivo infection model. We screened evolved populations and clones for resistance phenotypes, including the restoration of growth and pyoverdine production, and the evolution of iron uptake by-passing mechanisms. We whole-genome sequenced evolved clones to identify the genetic basis of resistance.\\n\\nResultsWe found that mutants resistant against anti-virulence treatments readily arose, but their selective spreading varied between treatments. Flucytosine resistance quickly spread in all populations due to disruptive mutations in upp, a gene encoding an enzyme required for flucytosine activation. Conversely, resistance against gallium arose only sporadically, and was based on mutations in transcriptional regulators, upregulating pyocyanin production, a redox-active molecule promoting siderophore-independent iron acquisition. The spread of gallium resistance could be hampered because pyocyanin-mediated iron delivery benefits resistant and susceptible cells alike.\\n\\nConclusions and implicationsOur work highlights that anti-virulence treatments are not evolutionarily robust per se. Instead, evolutionary robustness is a relative measure, with specific treatments occupying different positions on a continuous scale.",

    "abstract": "Feathers act as vibrotactile sensors that can detect mechanical stimuli during avian flight and tactile navigation, suggesting that they may also detect stimuli during social displays. In this study, we present the first measurements of the biomechanical properties of the feather crests found on the heads of birds, with an emphasis on those from the Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus). We show that in peafowl these crest feathers are coupled to filoplumes, small feathers known to function as mechanosensors. We also determined that airborne stimuli with the frequencies used during peafowl courtship and social displays couple efficiently via resonance to the vibrational response of their feather crests. Specifically, vibrational measurements showed that although different types of feathers have a wide range of fundamental resonant frequencies, peafowl crests are driven near-optimally by the shaking frequencies used by peacocks performing train-rattling displays. Peafowl crests were also driven to vibrate near resonance in a playback experiment that mimicked the effect of these mechanical sounds in the acoustic very near-field, reproducing the way peafowl displays are experienced at distances [&le;] 1.5m in vivo. When peacock wing-shaking courtship behaviour was simulated in the laboratory, the resulting airflow excited measurable vibrations of crest feathers. These results demonstrate that peafowl crests have mechanical properties that allow them to respond to airborne stimuli at the frequencies typical of this species social displays. This suggests a new hypothesis that mechanosensory stimuli could complement acoustic and visual perception and/or proprioception of social displays in peafowl and other bird species. We suggest behavioral studies to explore these ideas and their functional implications.",

    "abstract": "Application of metabolic magnetic resonance imaging measures such as cerebral blood flow in translational medicine is limited by the unknown link of observed alterations to specific neurophysiological processes. In particular, the sensitivity of cerebral blood flow to activity changes in specific neurotransmitter systems remains unclear. We address this question by probing cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers using seven established drugs with known dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms of action. We use a novel framework aimed at disentangling the observed effects to contribution from underlying neurotransmitter systems. We find for all evaluated compounds a reliable spatial link of respective cerebral blood flow changes with underlying neurotransmitter receptor densities corresponding to their primary mechanisms of action. The strength of these associations with receptor density is mediated by respective drug affinities. These findings suggest that cerebral blood flow is a sensitive brain-wide in-vivo assay of metabolic demands across a variety of neurotransmitter systems in humans.",

    "abstract": "The spatial localization of many DNA-protein interactions is now available thanks to the development of ChIP-Seq, and their investigation calls for adapted statistical methods. Many methods were developped for peak calling, but few were proposed for the downstream analysis of peak-like data, whereas the spatial structure of such data may contain relevant biological information, like binding constraints for instance. Associations between the occurrences of two genomic features are usually assessed by overlaps, but here we propose a statistical model to precisely quantify the spatial interactions between the location of binding events. Our methodology relies on a multivariate spatial process, the Hawkes model, that can also be interpreted in terms of a graphical model to highlight spatial dependencies between genomic features. Using our method, we explore the chromatinian landscape of replication origins, and we highlight attractive and repulsive patterns that can be related to the regulation of the spatial program of replication.",

    "abstract": "Tunable biomaterials that mimic selected features of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as its stiffness, protein composition, and dimensionality, are increasingly popular for studying how cells sense and respond to ECM cues. In the field, there exists a significant trade-off for how complex and how well these biomaterials represent the in vivo microenvironment, versus how easy they are to make and how adaptable they are to automated fabrication techniques. To address this need to integrate more complex biomaterials design with high-throughput screening approaches, we present several methods to fabricate synthetic biomaterials in 96-well plates and demonstrate that they can be adapted to semi-automated liquid handling robotics. These platforms include 1) glass bottom plates with covalently attached ECM proteins, and 2) hydrogels with tunable stiffness and protein composition with either cells seeded on the surface, or 3) laden within the three-dimensional hydrogel matrix. This study includes proof-of-concept results demonstrating control over breast cancer cell line phenotypes via these ECM cues in a semi-automated fashion. We foresee the use of these methods as a mechanism to bridge the gap between high-throughput cell-matrix screening and engineered ECM-mimicking biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Important traits in agricultural, natural, and human populations are increasingly being shown to be under the control of many genes that individually contribute only a small proportion of genetic variation. However, the majority of modern tools in quantitative and population genetics, including genome wide association studies and selection mapping protocols, are designed to identify individual genes with large effects. We have developed an approach to identify traits that have been under selection and are controlled by large numbers of loci. In contrast to existing methods, our technique utilizes additive effects estimates from all available markers, and relates these estimates to allele frequency change over time. Using this information, we generate a composite statistic, denoted[G] , which can be used to test for significant evidence of selection on a trait. Our test requires pre- and post-selection genotypic data but only a single time point with phenotypic information. Simulations demonstrate that[G] is powerful for identifying selection, particularly in situations where the trait being tested is controlled by many genes, which is precisely the scenario where classical approaches for selection mapping are least powerful. We apply this test to breeding populations of maize and chickens, where we demonstrate the successful identification of selection on traits that are documented to have been under selection.",

Yeast is one of the main models in genetics and genomics, yet large-scale approaches remain to be developed in this species because of low mutagenesis rates without donor DNA. We developed a double selection strategy based on co-selection that increases LOF mutation rates, both for CRISPR-Cas9 and the Target-AID base editor. We constructed the pDYSCKO vector, which is amenable to high throughput double selection for both approaches. Using modeling, we show that this improvement provides the required increased in detection power to measure the fitness effects of thousands of mutations in typical yeast pooled screens. We also show that multiplex genome editing with Cas9 causes programmable chromosomal translocations at high frequency, suggesting that multiplex editing should be performed with caution and that base-editors could be preferable tools for LOF screens.",

A network of molecular interactions is a graph in which the vertices are biological component and the edges correspond to the interactions between them. Many notions and approaches for network analysis came to systems biology from the theory of graphs - a field of mathematics that study graphs. We focused on the study of the shortest path approach in this work. We investigated whether this approach yields valid molecular paths. To perform this, the shortest paths in the human interactome (derived from HPRD and HIPPIE databases) were found between all relevant combinations of proteins taken from eight well-studied highly conserved signaling pathways from the KEGG database (NF-kappa B, MAPK, Jak-STAT, mTOR, ErbB, Wnt, TGF-beta and the signaling part of the apoptotic process). Canonical paths were systematically compared with the shortest counterparts and centrality of vertices and paths in subnetworks induced by the shortest paths were analyzed. We found that the sets of the shortest paths contain the canonical counterparts only for very short canonical paths (length 2-3 interactions). We also found that high centrality vertices tend to belong to canonical counterparts, to less extent this can also be said about high centrality paths.",

Importantly, several psychiatric disorders are associated with increased error rates in this paradigm. Despite this observation, there is no consensus about the mechanism behind antisaccade errors: while often explained as inhibition failures, some studies have suggested that errors are caused by deficits in the ability to initiate voluntary saccades. Using a computational model, we recently showed that under some conditions high latency or late errors can be explained by a race process between voluntary pro- and antisaccades. A limitation of our findings is that in our previous experiment the PVC signaled the trial type, whereas in most studies, subjects are informed about the trial type before the PVC is presented. We refer to these task designs as asynchronous (AC) and synchronous cues (SC) conditions. Here, we investigated to which extent differences in design affect the type and frequency of errors in the antisaccade task. Twenty-four subjects participated in mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials in both conditions. Our results demonstrate that error rates were highly correlated across task designs and a non-negligible fraction of them were classified as late errors in both conditions. In summary, our findings indicate that errors in the AC task are the result of both inhibition failures and inaccurate voluntary action initiation.",

In this respect, network analytical methods have provided a basis for exploring \\\"hub\\\" microbial species, which potentially organize community-scale processes of plant-microbe interactions.\\n\\nMethodsBy compiling Illumina sequencing data of root-associated fungi in eight forest ecosystems across the Japanese Archipelago, we explored hubs within \\\"metacommunity-scale\\\" networks of plant-fungus associations. In total, the metadata included 8,080 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected from 227 local populations of 150 plant species/taxa.\\n\\nResultsFew fungal OTUs were common across all the eight forests. However, in each metacommunity-scale network representing northern four localities or southern four localities, diverse mycorrhizal, endophytic, and pathogenic fungi were classified as \\\"metacommunity hubs\\\", which were detected from diverse host plant taxa throughout a climatic region. Specifically, Mortierella (Mortierellales), Cladophialophora (Chaetothyriales), Ilyonectria (Hypocreales), Pezicula (Helotiales), and Cadophora (incertae sedis) had broad geographic and host ranges across the northern (cool-temperate) region, while Saitozyma/Cryptococcus (Tremellales/Trichosporonales) and Mortierella as well as some arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were placed at the central positions of the metacommunity-scale network representing warm-temperate and subtropical forests in southern Japan.\\n\\nConclusionsThe network theoretical framework presented in this study will help us explore prospective fungi and bacteria, which have high potentials for agricultural application to diverse plant species within each climatic region. As some of those fungal taxa with broad geographic and host ranges have been known to increase the growth and pathogen resistance of host plants, further studies elucidating their functional roles are awaited.",

The primary objective was to use a validated lab tool, the five-item odor identification test, to assess variation in olfactory ability in different environments.\n\nMethodsUsing the five-item test, we conducted two repeated measures experiments that assessed participant ability to correctly identify an odor source in different odor environments. We also examined consistency in odor labelling due to documented potential bias from idiosyncrasies in odor terms.\n\nResultsWe found no variation in olfactory ability due to environment, but this may be due to methodological biases. First, subjective bias results from idiosyncratic differences in participant labelling and researcher coding of answer correctness. Second, better ability to learn odors may provide an advantage to women. Third, reducing positive female learning bias by analyzing consistency in response (regardless of correct odor source identification) fails to assess functional olfactory ability. Functional olfactory ability (naming correct odor source) is significantly better in females, especially in food-rich odor environments.\n\nConclusionsEnvironment was not a significant factor in olfactory ability in this study but that result may be confounded by methodological biases. We not recommend odor identification as a field tool. Functional olfactory ability exhibits a sex-based pattern but consistency in recognizing the same odor does not. Food-rich odors may enhance olfactory ability in females. We discuss evolutionary and ecological implications of superior female functional olfactory ability relative to food foraging activity.",

While it is clear that HIV exerts strong selection on the adaptive immune system, the characteristics of the somatic evolution that shape the immune response are still unknown. Traditional population genetics methods fail to distinguish chronic immune response from healthy repertoire evolution. Here, we infer the evolutionary modes of B-cell repertoires and identify complex dynamics with a constant production of better B-cell receptor mutants that compete, maintaining large clonal diversity and potentially slowing down adaptation. A substantial fraction of mutations that rise to high frequencies in pathogen engaging CDRs of B-cell receptors (BCRs) are beneficial, in contrast to many such changes in structurally relevant frameworks that are deleterious and circulate by hitchhiking. We identify a pattern where BCRs in patients who experience larger viral expansions undergo stronger selection with a rapid turnover of beneficial mutations due to clonal interference in their CDR3 regions. Using population genetics modeling, we show that the extinction of these beneficial mutations can be attributed to the rise of competing beneficial alleles and clonal interference. The picture is of a dynamic repertoire, where better clones may be outcompeted by new mutants before they fix.",

From C. elegans screens for mutants abnormally responding to cold-warming stimuli, we identify a molecular genetic pathway comprising ISY-1, a conserved uncharacterized protein, and ZIP-10, a bZIP-type transcription factor. ISY-1 gatekeeps the ZIP-10 transcriptional program by regulating the microRNA mir-60. Downstream of ISY-1 and mir-60, zip-10 levels rapidly and specifically increase upon transient cold-warming response. Prolonged zip-10 up-regulation induces several protease-encoding genes and promotes stress-induced organismic death, or phenoptosis, of C. elegans. zip-10 deficiency confers enhanced resistance to prolonged cold-warming stress, more prominently in adults than larvae. We conclude that the ZIP-10 genetic program mediates cold-warming response and may have evolved to promote wild population kin selection under resource-limiting and thermal stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPTumors are not static masses of cells but rather dynamic ecosystems where cancer cells experience constant turnover and evolve fitness-enhancing phenotypes. Selection for different phenotypes may vary with 1) the tumor niche (edge or core), 2) cell turnover rates, 3) the nature of the tradeoff between traits (proliferation vs migration), and 4) whether deaths occur in response to demographic or environmental stochasticity. In an agent based, spatially-explicit model, we observe how two traits (proliferation rate and migration speed) evolve under different trade-off conditions with different turnover rates. Migration rate is favored over proliferation at the tumors edge and vice-versa for the interior. Increasing cell turnover rates only slightly slows the growth of the tumor, but accelerates the rate of evolution for both proliferation and migration. The absence of a tradeoff favors ever higher values for proliferation and migration. A convex tradeoff tends to favor proliferation over migration while often promoting the coexistence of a generalist and specialist phenotype. A concave tradeoff slows the rate of evolution, and favors migration at low death rates and proliferation at higher death rates. Mortality via demographic stochasticity favors proliferation at the expense of migration; and vice-versa for environmental stochasticity. All of these factors and their interactions contribute to the ecology of the tumor, tumor heterogeneity, trait evolution, and phenotypic variation. While diverse, these effects may be predictable and empirically accessible.",

    "abstract": "While RNA secondary structure prediction from sequence data has made remarkable progress, there is a need for improved strategies for annotating the features of RNA secondary structures. Here we present bpRNA, a novel annotation tool capable of parsing RNA structures, including complex pseudoknot-containing RNAs, to yield an objective, precise, compact, unambiguous, easily-interpretable description of all loops, stems, and pseudoknots, along with the positions, sequence, and flanking base pairs of each such structural feature. We also introduce several new informative representations of RNA structure types to improve structure visualization and interpretation. We have further used bpRNA to generate a web-accessible meta-database, \\\"bpRNA-1m\\\", of over 100,000 single-molecule, known secondary structures; this is both more fully and accurately annotated and over 20-times larger than existing databases. We use a subset of the database with highly similar ([&ge;]90% identical) sequences filtered out to report on statistical trends in sequence, flanking base pairs, and length. Both the bpRNA method and the bpRNA-1m database will be valuable resources both for specific analysis of individual RNA molecules and large-scale analyses such as are useful for updating RNA energy parameters for computational thermodynamic predictions, improving machine learning models for structure prediction, and for benchmarking structure-prediction algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The regulatory role of the ribosome in gene expression has come into sharper focus. It has been proposed that ribosomes are dynamic complexes capable of changing their protein composition in response to enviromental stimuli. We applied both cryo-EM and mass spectrometry to identify such changes in S. cerevisiae 80S ribosomes. Cryo-EM shows a fraction (17%) of the ribosome population in yeast growing in glucose lack the ribosomal proteins RPL10 (ul16) and RPS1A/B (eS1). Unexpectedly, this fraction rapidly increases to 34% after the yeast are switched to growth in glycerol. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that the paralog yeast ribosomal proteins RPL8A (eL8A) and RPL8B (eL8B) change their relative proportions in the 80S ribosome when yeast are switched from growth in glucose to glycerol. Using yeast genetics and polysome profiling, we show that yeast ribosomes containing either RPL8A or RPL8B are not functionally interchangeable. Our combined cryo-EM and quantitative proteomic data support the hypothesis that ribosomes are dynamic complexes that alter their composition and functional activity in response to changes in growth or environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "HighlightAbrupt drought-flood alteration is a frequent meteorological disaster that occurs during summer in southern China and the Yangtze river basin, which often causes a large area reduction of rice yield. We previously reported abrupt drought-flood alteration effects on yield and its components, physiological characteristics, matter accumulation and translocation, rice quality of rice. However, the molecular mechanism of rice yield reduction caused by abrupt drought-flood alternation has not been reported.\\n\\nIn this study, four treatments were provided, no drought and no floods (control), drought without floods (duration of drought 10 d), no drought with floods (duration of floods 8 d), and abrupt drought-flood alteration (duration of drought 10 d and floods 8 d). The quantitative analysis of spike metabolites was proceeded by LC-MS (liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry) firstly. Then the Heat-map, PCA, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA and response ranking test of OPLS-DA model methods were used to analysis the function of differential metabolites (DMs) during the rice panicle differentiation stage under abrupt drought-flood alteration. In addition, relative quantitative analysis of spike total proteins under the treatment was conducted iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) and LC-MS. In this study, 5708 proteins were identified and 4803 proteins were quantified. The identification and analysis of DEPs function suggested that abrupt drought-flood alteration treatment can promote carbohydrate metabolic, stress response, oxidation-reduction, defense response, and energy reserve metabolic process, etc, during panicle differentiation stage. In this study relative quantitative proteomics, metabolomics and physiology data (soluble protein content, superoxide dismutase activity, hydrogen peroxidase activity, peroxidase activity, malondialdehyde content, free proline content, soluble sugar content and net photosynthetic rate) analysis were applied to explicit the response mechanism of rice panicle differentiation stage under abrupt drought-flood alteration and provides a theoretical basis for the disaster prevention and mitigation.\\n\\nAbstractAbrupt drought-flood alternation is a meteorological disaster that frequently occurs during summer in southern China and the Yangtze river basin, often causing a significant loss of rice production. In this study, a quantitative analysis of spike metabolites was conducted via liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and Heat-map, PCA, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, and a response ranking test of OPLS-DA model methods were used to analyze functions of differential metabolites (DMs) during the rice panicle differentiation stage under abrupt drought-flood alternation. The results showed that 102 DMs were identified from the rice spike between T1 (abrupt drought-flood alternation) and CK0 (control) treatment, 104 DMs were identified between T1 and CK1 (drought) treatment and 116 DMs were identified between T1 and CK2 (flood) treatment. In addition, a relative quantitative analysis of spike total proteins was conducted using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and LC-MS. The identification and analysis of DEPs functions indicates that abrupt drought-flood alternation treatment can promote carbohydrate metabolic, stress response, oxidation-reduction, defense response, and energy reserve metabolic process during the panicle differentiation stage.

    "abstract": "SummaryThe antiflorigenic signal SELF-PRUNING, which controls growth habit, exerts its effects through auxin transport, signaling and metabolism in tomato.\\n\\nAbstractThe SELF PRUNING (SP) gene is a key regulator of growth habit in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). It is an ortholog of TERMINAL FLOWER 1, a phosphatidyl-ethanolamine binding protein with anti-florigenic activity in Arabidopsis thaliana. A spontaneous loss-of-function sp mutation has been bred into a large number of industrial tomato cultivars, as it produces a suite of pleiotropic effects that are favorable for mechanical harvesting, including determinate growth habit, short plant stature and simultaneous fruit ripening. However, the physiological basis for these phenotypic differences has not been thoroughly explained. Here, we show that the sp mutation alters polar auxin transport as well as auxin responses such gravitropic curvature and elongation of excised hypocotyl segments. We further demonstrate that free auxin levels and auxin-regulated gene expression patterns are altered in sp, with epistatic effects of diageotropica, a mutation in a cyclophilin A protein-encoding gene. Our results indicate that SP impacts growth habit in tomato, at least in part, via changes in auxin transport and responsiveness. These findings hint at novel targets that could be manipulated in the control of growth habit and productivity.",

    "abstract": "Both low air (Tair) and root-zone (Troot) temperatures can inhibit resource (e.g. carbon and nutrients) acquisition by leaves and roots through various aspects, such as morphology, biomass allocation and assimilation/absorption capacity. However, it is still ambiguous whether Tair and Troot influence carbon (C) and nutrient acquisition via the same approach. To this end, in this study, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings were hydroponically grown under treatments arranged in complete factorial combination of two levels of Tair (26/18{degrees}C and 20/12{degrees}C, day/night) and two levels of Troot (19{degrees}C and 13{degrees}C, constant). In general, both Tair and Troot affected leaf and root sizes mainly by regulating their morphology rather than biomass investment. Under low Tair conditions (20/18{degrees}C), elevated Troot (compare 19{degrees}C versus 13{degrees}C) did not influence C acquisition, but increased nitrogen (N) acquisition mainly due to an increase in relative root length, resulting in decreased C : N acquisition ratio. However, under low Troot conditions (13{degrees}C), elevated Tair (compare 26/18{degrees}C versus 20/12{degrees}C) enhanced both C and N acquisition mainly because of an increase of both C assimilation in leaves and N absorption by roots, resulting in relatively constant C : N acquisition ratio. In addition, the Tair and Troot interaction was mainly observed in relative growth rate and root growth-related variables. Our results infer that Tair and Troot have distinct impacts on resource acquisition and carbon-nitrogen balance in plants.",

    "abstract": "Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders of childhood and therefore presents a very high prevalence rate. However the high rate of ADHD misdiagnosis makes the discovery of neurophysiological ADHD biomarkers an important clinical challenge. This study proposes a novel non-stationary ADHD biomarker based on Echo State Networks to quantify EEG dynamical changes between low attention/arousal states (resting with eyes closed, or EC) and normal attention/arousal states (resting with eyes open, or EO). Traditionally, EEG biomarkers have revealed an increase in stationary power in the theta band along with a decrease in beta, with these frequencies largely accepted to be altered in the ADHD population. We successfully verify the hypothesis that measured differences between these two conditions are altered in the ADHD population. Statistically significant differences between a group of ADHD subjects and an aged-matched control population were obtained in theta and beta rhythms. Our network discriminates between EO/EC EEG regimes in the ADHDs better than in controls, suggesting that differences in EEG patterns between low and normal arousal/attention states are larger in the ADHD population.",

    "abstract": "Chemostat experiments are employed to study predator-prey and other trophic interactions, frequently using phytoplankton-zooplankton systems. These experiments often use population dynamics as fingerprints of ecological and evolutionary processes, assuming that the contributions of all major actors to these dynamics are known. However, bacteria are often neglected although they are frequently present. We argue that even without external carbon sources bacteria may affect the experimental outcomes depending on experimental conditions and the physiological traits of bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton. Using a static carbon flux model and a dynamic simulation model we predict the minimum and maximum impact of bacteria on phytoplankton-zooplankton population dynamics. Under bacteria-suppressing conditions, we find that the effect of bacteria is indeed negligible and their omission justified. Under bacteria-favouring conditions, however, bacteria may strongly affect average biomasses. Furthermore, the population dynamics may become highly complex resulting in wrong conclusions if bacteria are not considered. Our model results provide suggestions to reduce the bacterial impact experimentally. Next to optimizing experimental conditions (e.g. the dilution rate) the appropriate choice of the zooplankton predator is decisive. Counterintuitively, bacteria have a larger impact if they are not ingested by the predator as high bacterial biomasses and complex population dynamics arise via competition for nutrients with the phytoplankton. Only if the predator is at least partly bacterivorous the impact of bacteria is minimized. Our results help to improve both the design of chemostat experiments and their interpretation and thus advance the study of ecological and evolutionary processes in aquatic food webs.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystems are widely inter-connected by spatial flows of resources1,2, yet primarily studied in a local context. Meta-ecosystem models suggest that cross-ecosystem subsidies can play an essential role in ecosystem functioning, notably by controlling local availability of resources for biological communities3-6. The general contribution of these resource connections to ecosystem functioning, however, remains unclear in natural systems, due to the heterogeneity and dispersion of data across the ecological literature. Here we provide the first quantitative synthesis on spatial flows of carbon connecting ecosystems worldwide. These cross-ecosystem subsidies range over eight orders of magnitude, between 10-3 and 105 gC m-2 yr-1, and are highly diverse in their provenance. We found that spatial carbon flows and local carbon fluxes are of the same order of magnitudes in freshwater and benthic ecosystems, suggesting an underlying dependency of these systems on resources provided by connected terrestrial and pelagic ecosystems respectively. By contrast, in terrestrial systems, cross-ecosystem subsidies were two to three orders of magnitude lower than local production (grasslands and forests), indicating a weaker quantitative influence on functioning. Those subsidies may still be qualitatively important, however, as some have high nutrient content7,8. We also find important gaps in carbon flow quantification, notably of cross-ecosystem subsidies driven by animal movements, which likely leads to general underestimations of the magnitude and direction of cross-ecosystem linkages9. Overall, we demonstrate strong ecosystem couplings, suggesting that ecosystems can be vulnerable to alterations of these flows and pointing to an urgent need to re-think ecosystem functioning in a spatial perspective.",

    "abstract": "In many insects, individuals primed with low doses of pathogens live longer after being exposed to the same pathogen later in life. Yet, our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological history of priming of immune response in natural insect populations is limited. Previous work demonstrated population-, sex- and- stage specific variation in the survival benefit of priming response in flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) infected with their natural pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. However, the evolutionary forces responsible for this natural variation remained unclear. Here, we tested whether the strength of the priming response (measured as the survival benefit after priming and subsequent infection relative to unprimed controls) was associated with multiple fitness parameters across 10 flour beetle populations. Our results suggest two major selective pressures that may explain the observed inter-population variation in priming: (A) Basal pathogen susceptibility - populations that were more susceptible to infection produced a stronger priming response, and (B) Reproductive success - populations where primed females produced more offspring had lower survival benefit, suggesting a trade-off between priming response and reproduction. Our work is the first empirical demonstration of multiple selective pressures that may govern the adaptive evolution of immune priming in the wild. We hope that this motivates further experiments to establish the role of pathogen-imposed selection and fitness costs in the evolution of priming in natural insect populations.",

Mice have a much shorter life expectancy than men, and therefore we hypothesized that the xenogeneic environment might greatly accelerate the epigenetic clock. We demonstrate that genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of normal human hematopoietic development are indeed recapitulated upon engraftment in mice - particularly those of normal early B cell progenitor cells. Furthermore, we tested three epigenetic aging signatures and none of them indicated that the murine environment accelerated age-associated DNA methylation changes. These results demonstrate that the murine transplantation model overall recapitulates epigenetic changes of human hematopoietic development, whereas epigenetic aging seems to occur cell intrinsically.",

These include the unidirectionality paradigm of regulation of phosphorylation, and differential spatial distribution of kinase-and phosphatase-dominated phosphotargets. Data also present first systemic analysis of targets of PP2A-modulating oncoproteins, CIP2A, PME-1, and SET; including targets via which PP2A may coordinately regulate activities of cancer drivers and tumor suppressors such as MYC or TP53. To validate functional utility of this dataset, PP2A dephosphorylome activity was correlated with cancer cell responses to over 300 drugs. Notably, we find that cancer therapy responses can be broadly classified based on PP2A dephosphorylome activity, both in quantitative and qualitative manner.

In addition, somatic BRCA1 gene loss was demonstrated to be a signature of PCa dissemination to regional lymph nodes and peripheral blood, and indicate worse clinical outcome. In order to substantiate the data for BRCA1 gene loss in PCa and to reveal its phenotypical background, BRCA1 gene status was assessed in a large cohort of PCa patients and compared to different molecular factors.\\n\\nMethodsBRCA1 gene dosage was assessed in 2398 tumor samples from 1199 PCa patients using fluorescent in situ hybridization. It was compared to clinic-pathological parameters, patients outcome as well as selected proteins (Ki-67, apoptosis marker, cytokeratins, vimentin, E- and N-cadherin, ALDH1 and EGFR) examined by immunohistcohemistry.\\n\\nResultsBRCA1 losses were found in 10%, whereas gains appeared in 7% of 603 informative PCa patients. BRCA1 losses correlated to higher T status (p=0.027), Gleason score (p=0.039), shorter time to biochemical recurrence in patients with Gleason score >7 independently of other factors (multivariate analysis, p=0.005) as well as expression of proteins regulating stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition i.e. ALDH1 (p=0.021) and EGFR (p=0.011), respectively. BRCA1 gains correlated to shorter time to metastasis (p=0.012) and expression of ALDH1 (p=0.014).\\n\\nConclusionsThe presented results support the assumption that BRCA1 gene losses contribute to a progressive and stem cell-like phenotype of PCa. Furthermore, they reveal that also BRCA1 gain might mark more invasive tumors.",

    "abstract": "The nonspecific divalent cation channel TRPM7 (transient receptor potential-melastatin-like 7) is involved in many Ca2+ and Mg2+-dependent cellular processes, including survival, proliferation and migration. TRPM7 expression predicts metastasis and recurrence in breast cancer and several other cancers. In cultured cells, it can induce an invasive phenotype by promoting Ca2+-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We previously showed that in neuroblastoma cells that overexpress TRPM7 moderately, stimulation with Ca2+-mobilizing agonists leads to a characteristic sustained influx of Ca2+. Here we report that sustained influx through TRPM7 is abruptly abrogated by elevating intracellular levels of cAMP. Using pharmacological inhibitors and overexpression studies we show that this blockage is mediated by the cAMP effector Protein Kinase A (PKA). Mutational analysis demonstrates that the Serine residue S1269, which is present proximal to the coiled-coil domain within the protein c-terminus, is responsible for sensitivity to cAMP.",

    "abstract": "Adult sex ratio (ASR) is a demographic key parameter, being essential for the survival and dynamics of a species populations. Biased ASR are adaptations to the environment on different scales, resulted by different mechanisms as inbreeding, mating behaviour, resource limitations, endosymbionts such as Wolbachia, and changes in density or spatial distribution. Parasitoid ASRs are also known to be strongly biased. But less information is available on large scale variable effects such as landscape composition or fragmentation. We aimed to study whether the landscape scale does affect the ASR of parasitoids belonging to the same tritrophic gall inducer community. We examined effects of characteristics on different scales as functional trait, local and landscape scale environment on parasitoid ASR. On species level ovipositor length, on local scale resource amount and density, while on landscape scale habitat amount, land use and landscape history were the examined explanatory variables. We controlled for the incidence and prevalence of Wolbachia infections. Parasitoid ASR is best explained by ovipositor length: with which increase ASR also increases; and available resource amount: with the gall diameter increase ASR decreases. On large scale the interaction of functional traits with habitat size also explained significantly the parasitoid ASRs. Our results support the hypothesis that large scale environmental characteristics affect parasitoid ASRs besides intrinsic and local characteristics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe Windover mortuary pond dates to the Early Archaic period (6,800-5,200 years ago) and constitutes one of the earliest archaeological sites with intact and well-preserved human remains in North America. Unlike many prehistoric egalitarian hunter-gatherers, the Windover people may not have practiced a sex-based division of labor, rather they may have shared the load. We explore how mobility and subsistence, as reconstructed from archaeological data, influenced hand and foot bone morphology at Windover.\\n\\nMethodsWe took length and width measurements on four carpal bones, four tarsal bones, and load- bearing tarsal areas (calcaneus load arm, trochlea of the talus). We analyzed lateralization using side differences in raw length and width measurements. For other hypothesis testing, we used log transformed length-width ratios to mitigate the confounding effects of sexual dimorphism and trait size variation; we tested between-sex differences in weight-bearing (rear foot) and shock-absorbing (mid foot) tarsal bones and between-sex differences in carpal bones.\\n\\nResultsWe identified no significant between-sex differences in rear and midfoot areas, suggesting similar biomechanical stresses. We identified no significant between-sex differences in carpal bones but the test was under-powered due to small sample sizes. Finally, despite widespread behavioral evidence on contemporary populations for human hand and foot lateralization, we found no evidence of either handedness or footedness.\\n\\nDiscussionThe lack evidence for footedness was expected due its minimal impact on walking gait but the lack of evidence for handedness was surprising given that ethnographic studies have shown strong handedness in hunter-gatherers during tool and goods manufacture. The reconstructed activity patterns suggested both sexes engaged in heavy load carrying and a shared division of labor. Our results support previous findings--both sexes had stronger weight-bearing bones. While male shock-absorbing bones exhibited a trend towards greater relative width (suggesting greater comparative biomechanical stress), this may simply some lingering hunting behavior with males walking greater distances at higher speeds than females. While there were no significant between-sex differences in carpal bones (supporting a shared work load model), females exhibited greater variation in index values, which may reflect a greater variety of and specialization in tasks compared to males. Because carpals and tarsals are so well- preserved at archaeological sites, we had surmised they might be useful proxies for activity in the absence of well-preserved long bones. Tarsals provide a stronger signal of past activity and may be useful in the absence or, or in addition to, preferred bones. Carpals, however, may not be useful as the effect size of biomechanical stress (in this study at least) is low and would require larger samples than may be possible at archaeological sites.",

Here data from seven gene regions (>5,500 base pairs) for more than 120 noctuid genera are used to infer a phylogeny for Amphipyrinae and related subfamilies. Sequence data for 57 amphipyrine genera--most represented by the type species of the genus--are examined. Presented here are: the first large-scale molecular phylogenetic study of Amphipyrinae and largest molecular phylogeny of Noctuidae to date; several proposed nomenclatural changes for well supported results; and the identification of areas of noctuid phylogeny where greater taxon sampling and/or genomic-scale data are needed. Adult and larval morphology, along with life history traits, for taxonomic groupings most relevant to the results are discussed. Amphipyrinae are significantly redefined; many former amphipyrines, excluded as a result of these analyses, are reassigned to other noctuid subfamily-level taxa. Four genera, Chamaeclea Grote, Heminocloa Barnes & Benjamin, Hemioslaria Barnes & Benjamin, and Thurberiphaga Dyar are transferred to the tribe Chamaecleini Keegan & Wagner New Tribe in Acontiinae. Stiriina is elevated to Stiriinae Revised Status, Grotellina is elevated to Grotellinae Revised Status, and Annaphilina is elevated to Annaphilini Revised Status.

We challenge this dogma and present a new approach designed specifically for heterozygous genomes. \\\"Trio binning\\\" uses short reads from two parental genomes to partition long reads from an offspring into haplotype-specific sets prior to assembly. Each haplotype is then assembled independently, resulting in a complete diploid reconstruction. On a benchmark human trio, this method achieved high accuracy and recovered complex structural variants missed by alternative approaches. To demonstrate its effectiveness on a heterozygous genome, we sequenced an F1 cross between cattle subspecies Bos taurus taurus and Bos taurus indicus, and completely assembled both parental haplotypes with NG50 haplotig sizes >20 Mbp and 99.998% accuracy, surpassing the quality of current cattle reference genomes. We propose trio binning as a new best practice for diploid genome assembly that will enable new studies of haplotype variation and inheritance.",

Here, we present a computational method to identify cohesin-and-CTCF binding sites that form intra-TAD DNA loops (subTADs). We show that predicted subTAD anchors are structurally indistinguishable from those of TADs regarding their binding partners, sequence conservation, and resistance to cohesin knockdown; further, the subTAD loops retain key functional features of TADs, including insulation of chromatin contacts, blockage of repressive histone mark spread, and ubiquity across tissues. We propose that subTADs form by the same loop extrusion mechanism as larger loops, and that their shorter length enables finer regulatory control over gene expression. 4C-seq analysis using an Alb promoter viewpoint illustrates the role of subTADs in restricting enhancer-promoter interactions. These findings elucidate the role of intra-TAD cohesin-and-CTCF binding in nuclear organization, and demonstrate that distal enhancer insulation by subTADs is widespread.",

Despite increasing cannabis consumption during pregnancy, the protracted consequences of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE) remain incompletely understood. Here we report sex-specific differences in behavioral and neuronal deficits in the adult progeny of rat dams exposed to low doses of cannabinoids during gestation. In males, PCE reduced social interaction, ablated endocannabinoid long-term depression (LTD) and heightened excitability of prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, while females were spared. Group 1 mGluR and endocannabinoid signaling regulate emotional behavior and synaptic plasticity. Notably, sex-differences following PCE included levels of mGluR1/5 and TRPV1R mRNA. Finally, positive allosteric modulation of mGlu5 and enhancement of anandamide levels restored LTD and social interaction in PCE adult males. Together, these results highlight marked sexual differences in the effects of PCE and introduce strategies for reversing detrimental effects of PCE.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations of sensory feedback evoke sensory prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory outcomes of movements), and reward prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted rewards and actual rewards). Sensory prediction errors result in obligatory remapping of the relationship between motor commands and predicted sensory outcomes. The role of reward prediction errors in sensorimotor adaptation is less clear. When moving towards a target, we expect to obtain the reward of hitting the target, and so we experience a reward prediction error if the perturbation causes us to miss it. These discrepancies between desired task outcomes and actual task outcomes, or \\\"task errors\\\", are thought to drive the use of strategic processes to restore success, although their role is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of task errors in sensorimotor adaptation: during target-reaching, we either removed task errors by moving the target mid-movement to align with cursor feedback of hand position, or enforced task error by moving the target away from the cursor feedback of hand position. Removing task errors not only reduced the rate and extent of adaptation during exposure to the perturbation, but also reduced the amount of post-adaptation implicit remapping. Hence, task errors contribute to implicit remapping resulting from sensory prediction errors. This suggests that the system which implicitly acquires new sensorimotor maps via exposure to sensory prediction errors is also sensitive to reward prediction errors.",

Approaching those systems experimentally to understand their dynamics is a complex task because of the plethora of compounds interacting in a web that combines intra and inter level elements such that a coordinate behavior come up. Such a characteristic points to the necessity of establishing principles that help on the description, categorization, classification, and the prediction of the behavior of biological systems. The theoretical machinery already available, or the ones to be discovered motivated by biological problems, can play an important role on that quest. Here we exemplify the applicability of theoretical tools by discussing some biological problems that we have approached mathematically: fluctuations in gene expression and cell proliferation in the context of loss of contact inhibition. We discuss the methods that we have employed aiming to provide the reader with a phenomenological, biologically motivated, perspective of the use of theoretical methods.

    "abstract": "Sex differences in liver gene expression and disease susceptibility are regulated by pituitary growth hormone secretion patterns, which activate sex-dependent liver transcription factors and establish sex-specific chromatin states. Ablation of pituitary hormone by hypophysectomy (hypox) has identified two major classes of liver sex-biased genes, defined by their sex-dependent positive or negative responses to hypox, respectively; however, the mechanisms that determine the hypox responsiveness of each gene class are unknown. Here, we sought to discover candidate regulatory long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that control hypox responsiveness. First, we used mouse liver RNA-seq data for 30 different biological conditions to discover gene structures and expression patterns for ~15,500 liver-expressed lncRNAs, including antisense and intragenic lncRNAs, as well as lncRNAs that overlap active enhancers, marked by enhancer RNAs. We identified >200 robust sex-specific liver lncRNAs, including 157 whose expression is regulated during postnatal liver development or is subject to circadian oscillations. Next, we utilized the high natural allelic variance of Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a multi-parental outbred population, to discover tightly co-expressed clusters of sex-specific protein-coding genes (gene modules) in male liver, and separately, in female liver. Sex differences in the gene modules identified were extensive. Remarkably, many gene modules were strongly enriched for male-specific or female-specific genes belonging to a single hypox-response classes, indicating that the genetic heterogeneity of DO mice captures responsiveness to hypox. Hypox-responsiveness was shown to be facilitated by multiple, distinct gene regulatory mechanisms, indicating its complex nature. Further, we identified 16 sex-specific lncRNAs whose expression across DO mouse livers showed an unexpected significant negative correlation with protein-coding gene modules enriched for genes of the opposite-sex bias and inverse hypox response class, indicating strong negative regulatory potential for these lncRNAs. Thus, we used a genetically diverse outbred mouse population to discover tightly co-expressed sex-specific gene modules that reveal broad characteristics of gene regulation related to responsiveness to hypox, and generated testable hypotheses for regulatory roles of sex-biased liver lncRNAs that control the sex-bias in liver gene expression.",

Toxoplasma secretes and exports effector proteins that modulate the host during infection and several of these proteins are processed by the Golgi-associated Aspartyl Protease 5 (ASP5). Here, we identify ASP5 substrates by selectively enriching N-terminally-derived peptides from wildtype and {Delta}asp5 parasites. We reveal over two thousand unique Toxoplasma N-terminal peptides, mapping to both natural N-termini and protease cleavage sites. Several of these peptides mapped directly downstream of the characterised ASP5-cleavage site, arginine-arginine-leucine (RRL). We validate candidates as true ASP5 substrates, revealing they are not processed in parasites lacking ASP5, nor in wild type parasites following mutation of the motif from RRL{longrightarrow}ARL. All new ASP5 substrates are dense granule proteins, and interestingly none appear to be exported, thus differing from the analogous system in related Plasmodium spp., instead revealing that the majority of substrates reside within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), and its membrane (the PVM), including two kinases and one phosphatase. Furthermore, we show that several of these ASP5-substrates are virulence factors, with their removal leading to attenuation in a mouse model, suggesting that phosphorylation at the host-parasite interface is important for virulence. Collectively, these data constitute the first in-depth analyses of the total list of ASP5 substrates, and shed new light on the role of ASP5 as a maturase of dense granule proteins during the Toxoplasma lytic cycle.",

Early events in the human lung in response to TB are difficult to probe and their impact on disease outcome is unknown. We have shown in mouse that a secreted alternatively-spliced variant of IL-12R{beta}1, lacking the transmembrane domain and termed {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1, promotes dendritic cell migration to the draining lymph node, augments T cell activation and limits dissemination of M. tuberculosis (Mtb). We show here that CBA/J and C3H/HeJ mice (both highly susceptible to Mtb) express higher levels of {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 than resistant C57BL6 mice and limit early dissemination of Mtb from the lungs. Both CD11c+ cells and T cells express {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 in humans, and mice unable to make {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 in either CD4 or CD11c expressing cells permit early dissemination from the lung. Analysis of publically available blood transcriptomes indicates that pulmonary TB is associated with high {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 expression and that of all IL-12 related signals, the {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 signal best predicts active disease. {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 expression reflects the heterogeneity of latent TB infection and has the capacity to discriminate between latent and active disease. In a new Chinese TB patient cohort, {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 effectively differentiates TB from latent TB, healthy controls and pneumonia patients. Finally, {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 expression drops in drug-treated individuals in the UK and China where infection pressure is low. We propose that {Delta}TM-IL-12R{beta}1 regulates early dissemination from the lung and that it has diagnostic potential and provides mechanistic insights into human TB.",

    "abstract": "During apoptosis, pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK are activated, causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP), caspase activation and cell death. However, even in the absence of caspase activity, cells usually die following MOMP. Such caspase-independent cell death is accompanied by inflammation that requires mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) activation of cGAS-STING signaling. Because the mitochondrial inner membrane is thought to remain intact during apoptosis, we sought to address how matrix mtDNA could activate the cytosolic cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Strikingly, using super-resolution imaging, we show that mtDNA is efficiently released from mitochondria following MOMP. In a temporal manner, we find that following MOMP, BAX/BAK-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane pores gradually widen over time. This allows extrusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane into the cytosol whereupon it permeablises allowing mtDNA release. Our data demonstrate that mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilisation can occur during cell death in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner. Importantly, by enabling the cytosolic release of mtDNA, inner membrane permeabilisation underpins the immunogenic effects of caspase-independent cell death.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal epithelium is maintained by a small number of self-renewing stem cells in homeostasis. In addition committed progenitors can contribute to the functional stem cell compartment at a low level during homeostasis and substantially during regeneration following tissue damage. However the mechanism of, and requirement for, progenitor plasticity in mediating pathological response has not been demonstrated. Here we show that multisite phosphorylation of the transcription factor Atoh1 is required both for the contribution of secretory progenitors to the intestinal stem cell pool and for a robust regenerative response following damage. In lineage tracing experiments Atoh1+ cells (Atoh1(WT)CreERT2 mice) show stem cell activity by giving rise to multilineage intestinal clones both in the steady state and after tissue damage. Notably in the colonic epithelium a single generation of Atoh1+ progenitors sustains 1 in 15 stem cells. In an activating Atoh1(9S/T-A)CreERT2 line, the loss of phosphorylation sites on the Atoh1 protein promotes secretory differentiation and inhibits the contribution of these cells to self-renewal. Finally, in a chemical colitis model the Atoh1+ cells of Atoh1(9S/T-A)CreERT2 mice have reduced clonogenic capacity that impacts overall regenerative response of the epithelium. Thus progenitor plasticity plays an integral part in maintaining robust self-renewal in the intestinal epithelium and the balance between stem and progenitor fate behaviour is directly co-ordinated by Atoh1 multi-site phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the genetic basis of adaptation to the local environment can improve our understanding of how the diversity of life has evolved. In this study we used a dense SNP array to identify candidate loci underlying fine-scale local adaptation within a large Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population. By combining outlier, gene-environment association, and haplotype homozygosity analyses, we identified multiple regions of the genome with strong evidence for diversifying selection. Several of these candidate regions had previously been identified in other studies, demonstrating that the same loci be adaptively important in Atlantic salmon at sub-drainage, regional and continental scales. Notably, we identified signals consistent with local selection around genes associated with variation in sexual maturation, energy homeostasis, behaviour, and immune defence. These included the large-effect age-at-matunty gene vgll3, the known obesity gene mc4r, and major histocompatibility complex II. Most strikingly, we confirmed a genomic region on Ssa09 that was extremely differentiated among subpopulations, and that is also a candidate for local selection over the global range of Atlantic salmon. This region co-localized with a genomic region strongly associated with spawning ecotype in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), with circumstantial evidence that the same gene (six6) may be the selective target in both cases. The phenotypic effect of this region in Atlantic salmon remains cryptic, although allelic variation is related to river flow volume and co-vanes with timing of the return spawning migration. Our results further inform management of Atlantic salmon and open multiple avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of proteins on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a ubiquitous post-translational modification that plays a key part of essentially every cell signaling process. It is reasonable to assume that inter-individual variation in protein phosphorylation may underlie phenotypic differences, as has been observed for practically any other molecular regulatory phenotype. However, we do not know much about the extent of inter-individual variation in phosphorylation because it is quite challenging to perform a quantitative high throughput study to assess inter-individual variation in any post-translational modification. To test our ability to address this challenge with current technology, we quantified phosphorylation levels for three genotyped human cell lines within a nested experimental framework, and found that genetic background is the primary determinant of phosphoproteome variation. We uncovered multiple functional, biophysical, and genetic associations with germline driven phosphopeptide variation. Variants affecting protein levels or structure were among these associations, with the latter presenting, on average, a stronger effect. Interestingly, we found evidence that is consistent with a phosphopeptide variability buffering effect endowed from properties enriched within longer proteins. Because the small sample size in this  pilot study may limit the applicability of our genetic observations, we also undertook a thorough technical assessment of our experimental workflow to aid further efforts. Taken together, these results provide the foundation for future work to characterize inter-individual variation in post-translational modification levels and reveal novel insights into the nature of inter-individual variation in phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "In Antarctica, summer is a time of extreme environmental shifts resulting in large coastal phytoplankton blooms fueling the food web. Despite the importance of the microbial loop in remineralizing biomass from primary production, studies of how microzooplankton communities respond to such blooms in the Southern Ocean are rather scarce. Microzooplankton (ciliates and dinoflagellates) communities were investigated combining microscopy and 18S rRNA sequencing analyses in the Amundsen Sea Polynya during an extensive summer bloom of Phaeocystis antarctica. The succession of microzooplankton was further assessed during a 15-day induced bloom microcosm experiment. Dinoflagellates accounted for up to 58% the microzooplankton biomass in situ with Gymnodinium spp., Protoperidium spp. and Gyrodinium spp. constituting 87% of the dinoflagellate biomass. Strombilidium spp., Strombidium spp. and tintinids represented 90% of the ciliates biomass. Gymnodinium, Gyrodinium and tintinnids are known grazers of Phaeocystis, suggesting that this prymnesiophyte selected for the key microzooplankton taxa. Availability of other potential prey, such as diatoms, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and bacteria, also correlated to changes in microzooplankton community structure. Overall, both heterotrophy and mixotrophy appeared to be key trophic strategies of the dominant microzooplankton observed, suggesting that they influence carbon flow in the microbial food web through top-down control on the phytoplankton community.",

    "abstract": "The New World avian family Polioptilidae (gnatcatchers and gnatwrens) is distributed from Argentina to Canada and includes 15 species and more than 60 subspecies. No study to date has evaluated phylogenetic relationships within this family and the historical pattern of diversification within the group remains unknown. Moreover, species limits, particularly in widespread taxa that show geographic variation, remain unclear. In this study, we delimited species and estimated phylogenetic relationships using multilocus data for the entire family. We then used the inferred diversity along with alternative taxonomic classification schemes to evaluate how lumping and splitting of both taxa and geographical areas influenced biogeographic inference. Species-tree analyses grouped Polioptilidae into four main clades: Microbates, Ramphocaenus, a Polioptila guianensis complex, and the remaining members of Polioptila. Ramphocaenus melanurus was sister to the clade containing M. cinereiventris and M. collaris, which formed a clade sister to all species within Polioptila. Polioptila was composed of two clades, the first of which included the P. guianensis complex; the other contained all remaining species in the genus. Using multispecies coalescent modeling, we inferred a more than 3-fold increase in species diversity, of which 87% represent currently recognized species or subspecies. Much of this diversity corresponded to subspecies that occur in the Neotropics. We identified three polyphyletic species, and delimited 4-6 previously undescribed candidate taxa. Probabilistic modeling of geographic ranges on the species tree indicated that the family likely had an ancestral origin in South America, with all three genera independently colonizing North America. Support for this hypothesis, however, was sensitive to the taxonomic classification scheme used and the number of geographical areas allowed. Our study proposes the first phylogenetic hypothesis for Polioptilidae and provides genealogical support for the reclassification of species limits. Species limits and the resolution of geographical areas that taxa inhabit influence the inferred spatial diversification history.",

In our experimental conditions in xenopus oocytes, in the presence or in the absence of external chloride, NPF6.3/NRT1.1 behaves as a non-electrogenic and pure low-affinity transporter. Moreover, further functional characterization of a NPF6.3/NRT1.1 point mutant, P492L, allowed us to hypothesize that NPF6.3/NRT1.1 is regulated by internal nitrate concentration and that the internal perception site involves the P492 residue.",

    "abstract": "The MYC oncogene promotes tumorigenesis in part by facilitating cell cycle entry thus driving cellular proliferation. Tumors that overexpress MYC frequently demonstrate aneuploidy, numerical chromosome alterations associated with highly aggressive cancers, rapid tumor evolution, and poor patient outcome. While the role of MYC in overcoming the G1/S checkpoint is well established, it remains poorly understood whether MYC induces chromosomal instability (CIN). Here, we identify a direct influence of MYC on mitotic progression. MYC overexpression induces defects in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly promoting chromosome segregation defects, micronuclei and CIN. We examined which mitotic regulators are required for the survival of MYC-overexpressing cells and found a reliance on high TPX2 expression. TPX2, a master microtubule regulator, is overexpressed together with MYC in multiple cell lines, in mouse tumor models and in aggressive human breast cancers. High TPX2 expression is permissive for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation in cells with deregulated MYC, whereas TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death and prevents tumor growth. Importantly, attenuation of MYC expression reverses the mitotic defects observed, even in established tumor cell lines, implicating an ongoing role for high MYC in the persistence of a CIN phenotype in tumors. Here, we implicate the MYC oncogene as a regulator of spindle assembly and dynamics and identify a new MYC-TPX2 synthetic-lethal interaction that could represent a future therapeutic strategy in MYC-overexpressing cancers. Our studies suggest that blocking MYC activity can attenuate the emergence of CIN and tumor evolution.",

Both topography of the subcomponents and their variation with experimental conditions were very similar but different from other negative ERP components N1 and N2. The two N3 subcomponents were maximally negative over midfrontal areas but positive over the parietal and particularly over the posterior temporal cortex. Both frontal negativity and posterior positivity exhibited clear oddball effects, i.e., they were larger to deviants than to standards. Positive components P3a and P3b were also analyzed, which replicated the previously known effects.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous, non-coding RNAs that form covalently closed continuous loops and are both highly conserved and abundant in the mammalian brain. A role for circRNAs in sponging microRNAs (miRNAs) has been proposed, but the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction networks in human brain cells have not been defined. Therefore, we identified circRNAs in RNA sequencing data previously generated from astrocytes microdissected from the posterior cingulate (PC) of Alzheimers disease (AD) patients (N=10) and healthy elderly controls (N=10) using four circRNA prediction algorithms - CIRI, CIRCexplorer, find_circ and KNIFE.\\n\\nResultsOverall, utilizing these four tools, we identified a union of 4,438 unique circRNAs across all samples, of which 70.3% were derived from exonic regions. Notably, the widely reported CDR1as circRNA was detected in all samples across both groups by find_circ. Given the putative miRNA regulatory function of circRNAs, we identified potential miRNA targets of circRNAs, and further, delineated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks using in silico methods. Pathway analysis of the genes regulated by these miRNAs identified significantly enriched immune response pathways, which is consistent with the known function of astrocytes as immune sensors in the brain.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study, we performed circRNA detection on cell-specific transcriptomic data and identified potential circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks in PC astrocytes. Given the known function of astrocytes in cerebral innate immunity and our identification of significantly enriched immune response pathways, the circRNAs we identified may be associated with such key functions. While we did not detect recurrent differentially expressed circRNAs in the context of healthy controls or Alzheimers, we report for the first time circRNAs and their potential regulatory impact in a cell-specific and region-specific manner in aged subjects. These predicted regulatory network and pathway analyses may help provide new insights into transcriptional regulation in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons perform diverse functions in motivation and cognition, but their precise roles in addiction-related behaviors are still debated. Here, we targeted VTA DA neurons for bidirectional chemogenetic modulation during specific tests of cocaine reinforcement, demand, and relapse-related behaviors, querying the roles of DA neuron inhibitory and excitatory G-protein signaling in these processes. Designer receptor stimulation of Gq-, but not Gs-signaling in DA neurons enhanced cocaine seeking via functionally distinct projections to forebrain limbic regions. In contrast, engaging inhibitory Gi/o signaling in DA neurons blunted cocaines reinforcing and priming effects, reduced stress-potentiated reinstatement, and altered cue-induced cocaine seeking strategy, but not the motivational impact of cocaine cues per se. Results demonstrate that DA neurons play several distinct roles in cocaine seeking, depending on behavioral context, G-protein signaling, and DA neuron efferent target, highlighting their multifaceted roles in addiction.\\n\\nSignificance StatementG-protein coupled receptors are crucial modulators of VTA dopamine neuron activity, but how metabotropic signaling impacts dopamines complex roles in reward and addiction is poorly understood. Here, we bidirectionally modulate dopamine neuron G-protein signaling with DREADDs during a variety of cocaine seeking behaviors, revealing nuanced, pathway-specific roles in cocaine reward, effortful seeking, and relapse-like behaviors. Gq- and Gs-stimulation activated dopamine neurons, but only Gq stimulation robustly enhanced cocaine seeking. Gi/o inhibitory signaling altered the response strategy employed during cued reinstatement, and reduced some, but not all types of cocaine seeking. Results show that VTA dopamine neurons modulate numerous distinct aspects of cocaine addiction- and relapse-related behaviors, and indicate potential new approaches for intervening in these processes to treat addiction.",

    "abstract": "The demands of foraging are a major driver in the evolution of cognitive faculties. To successfully pursue a mobile prey that is attempting to avoid capture, the ability to predict its flight path can provide a crucial advantage. We hypothesized that, during pursuit, rhesus macaques exploit patterns in preys behavior to predict the preys future positions. We modeled behavior of three macaques in a joystick-controlled pursuit task in which prey follow simple escape algorithms that involve repulsion from the subject and from the walls of the virtual enclosure. We find that, even in this artificial task, macaques actively predict and aim towards preys future positions, increasing their foraging success. Their predictions are derived from the three core variables in Newtonian dynamics: position, velocity, and acceleration. Even after extensive training, subjects favored these principles and ignored other regularities in prey behavior. Most notably, they ignored the effects their own actions would have on the prey, despite extensive training and even though doing so would have further improved performance. We conjecture that subjects have a strong bias towards using physical principles to pursue fleeing prey, possibly reflecting an evolved physics module. The observed predictive behavior suggests that foraging demands facilitate the development of prospection.",

Our 2.5 [A] resolution crystal structure of human MTHFR reveals a unique architecture, appending the well-conserved catalytic TIM-barrel to a eukaryote-only SAM-binding domain. The latter domain of novel fold provides the predominant interface for MTHFR homo-dimerization, positioning the N-terminal serine-rich phosphorylation region into proximity with the C-terminal SAM-binding domain. This explains how MTHFR phosphorylation, identified on 11 N-terminal residues (16-total), increases sensitivity to SAM binding and inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate the 25-amino-acid inter-domain linker enables conformational plasticity and propose it to be a key mediator of SAM regulation.",

By taking advantage of the available data, it is possible to identify the biomarkers and signatures to distinguish subtypes of a specific cancer in the context of clinical trials. This requires sophisticated methods to retrieve the information out of the data, and various algorithms have been recently devised.\\n\\nResultsHere, we applied the prize-collecting Steiner tree (PCST) approach to obtain a gene expression signature for the classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The PCST is a network-based approach to capture new insights about genomic data by incorporating an interaction network landscape. Moreover, we adopted the ElasticNet incorporating PCA as a classification method. We used seven public gene expression profiling datasets (three for training, and four for testing) available in the literature, and obtained 10 genes as signature. We tested these genes by employing ElasticNet, and compared the performance with the DAC algorithm as current golden standard. The performance of the PCST signature with ElasticNet outperformed the DAC in distinguishing the subtypes. In addition, the gene expression signature was able to accurately stratify DLBCL patients on survival data.\\n\\nConclusionsWe developed a network-based optimization technique that performs unbiased signature selection by integrating genomic data with biological networks. Our classifier trained with the obtained signature outperformed the state-of-the-art method in subtype distinction and survival data stratification in DLBCL.

    "abstract": "Genome-scale studies using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies generate substantial lists of differentially expressed genes under different experimental conditions. These gene lists need to be further mined to narrow down biologically relevant genes and associated functions in order to guide downstream functional genetic analyses. A popular approach is to determine statistically overrepresented genes in a user-defined list through enrichment analysis tools, which rely on functional annotations of genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Here, we propose a new approach, GenFam, which allows classification and enrichment of genes based on their gene family, thus simplifying identification of candidate gene families and associated genes that may be relevant to the query. GenFam and its integrated database comprises of three-hundred and eighty-four unique gene families and supports gene family classification and enrichment analyses for sixty plant genomes. Four comparative case studies with plant species belonging to different clades and families were performed using GenFam which demonstrated its robustness and comprehensiveness over preexisting functional enrichment tools. To make it readily accessible for plant biologists, GenFam is available as a web-based application where users can input gene IDs and export enrichment results in both tabular and graphical formats. Users can also customize analysis parameters by choosing from the various statistical enrichment tests and multiple testing correction methods.

    "abstract": "Oxygen plays a central role in cellular metabolism, in both healthy and tumour tissue. The presence and concentration of molecular oxygen in tumours has a substantial effect on both radiotherapy response and tumour evolution, and as a result the oxygen micro-environment is an area of intense research interest. Multicellular tumour spheroids closely mimic real avascular tumours, and in particular they exhibit physiologically relevant heterogeneous oxygen distribution. This property has made them a vital part of in vitro experimentation. For ideal spheroids, their heterogeneous oxygen distributions can be predicted from theory, allowing determination of cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and anoxic extent. However, experimental tumour spheroids often depart markedly from perfect sphericity. There has been little consideration of this reality. To date, the question of how far an ellipsoid can diverge from perfect sphericity before spherical assumptions breakdown remains unanswered. In this work we derive equations governing oxygen distribution (and more generally, nutrient and drug distribution) in both prolate and oblate tumour ellipsoids, and quantify the theoretical limits of the assumption that the spheroid is a perfect sphere. Results of this analysis yield new methods for quantifying OCR in ellipsoidal spheroids, and how this can be applied to markedly increase experimental throughput and quality.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMulticellular tumour spheroids (MCTS) are an increasingly important tool in cancer research, exhibiting non-homogeneous oxygen distributions and central necrosis. These are more similar to in situ avascular tumours than conventional 2D biology, rendering them exceptionally useful experimental models. Analysis of spheroids can yield vital information about cellular oxygen consumption rates, and the heterogeneous oxygen contribution. However, such analysis pivots on the assumption of perfect sphericity, when in reality spheroids often depart from such an ideal. In this work, we construct a theoretical oxygen diffusion model for ellipsoidal tumour spheroids in both prolate and oblate geometries. With these models established, we quantify the limits of the spherical assumption, and illustrate the effect of this assumption breaking down. Methods of circumventing this breakdown are also presented, and the analysis here suggests new methods for expanding experimental throughput to also include ellipsoidal data.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying sex-specific additive genetic variance (VA) in fitness, and the cross-sex genetic correlation (rA), is pre-requisite to predicting evolutionary dynamics and the magnitude of sexual conflict. Quantifying VA and rA in underlying fitness components, and multiple genetic consequences of immigration and resulting gene flow, is required to identify mechanisms that maintain VA in fitness. However, these key parameters have rarely been estimated in wild populations experiencing natural environmental variation and immigration. We used comprehensive pedigree and life-history data from song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to estimate VA and rA in sex-specific fitness and underlying fitness components, and to estimate additive genetic effects of immigrants as well as inbreeding depression. We found substantial VA in female and male fitness, with a moderate positive cross-sex rA. There was also substantial VA in adult reproductive success in males but not females, and moderate VA in juvenile survival but not adult survival. Immigrants introduced alleles for which additive genetic effects on local fitness were negative, potentially reducing population mean fitness through migration load, yet alleviating expression of inbreeding depression. Substantial VA for fitness can consequently be maintained in the wild, and be concordant between the sexes despite marked sex-specific VA in reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic and symbiotic relationships govern vast nutrient and energy flows1,2, but controversy surrounds their longevity. Enduring relationships may engender parallel phylogenies among hosts and parasites3,4, but so may more ephemeral relationships when parasites disproportionately colonize related hosts5. When considering these relationships temporal durability, it would be useful to understand whether parasite and host populations have grown and contracted in concert. Here, we devised methods to compare demographic histories, derived from genomic data6. We used these methods to compare the historical growth of the agent of severe human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, to human and primate histories7,8 and to that of their mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae9, thereby discerning long-term parallels and anthropogenic population explosions10,11. The growth history of Trichinella spiralis, a zoonotic parasite disseminated by swine domestication12,13, proved regionally-specific, paralleling distinctive growth histories for wild boar in Asia and Europe14. Parallel histories were inferred for an anemone and its algal symbiont (Aiptasia pallida15 and Symbiodinium minutum16). Concerted growth in potatoes and the agent of potato blight (Solanum tuberosum17 and Phytophthora infestans18) did not commence until the age of potato domestication, helping date the acquisition of this historically consequential fungal plant pathogen. Therefore, comparative historical demography provides a powerful new means by which to interrogate the history of myriad ecological relationships, enriching our understanding of their origins and durability.",

For Ser49Gly polymorphisms, there were no differences between AA genotype and AG/GG genotype of baseline clinical features and echocardiographic parameters as well as one-year incidence of MACE. For Arg389Gly polymorphisms, there were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics, LVDd and LVEF among the three genotypes.

    "abstract": "Plant growth, development, and nutritional quality depends upon amino acid homeostasis, especially in seeds. However, our understanding of the underlying genetics influencing amino acid content and composition remains limited, with only a few candidate genes and quantitative trait loci identified to date. Improved knowledge of the genetics and biological processes that determine amino acid levels will enable researchers to use this information for plant breeding and biological discovery. Towards this goal, we used genomic prediction to identify biological processes that are associated with, and therefore potentially influence, free amino acid (FAA) composition in seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Markers were split into categories based on metabolic pathway annotations and fit using a genomic partitioning model to evaluate the influence of each pathway on heritability explained, model fit, and predictive ability. Selected pathways included processes known to influence FAA composition, albeit to an unknown degree, and spanned four categories: amino acid, core, specialized, and protein metabolism. Using this approach, we identified associations for pathways containing known variants for FAA traits, in addition to finding new trait-pathway associations. Markers related to amino acid metabolism, which are directly involved in the FAA regulation, improved predictive ability for branched chain amino acids and histidine. The use of genomic partitioning also revealed patterns across biochemical families, in which serine-derived FAAs were associated with protein related annotations and aromatic FAAs were associated with specialized metabolic pathways. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that genomic partitioning is a viable strategy to uncover the relative contributions of biological processes to FAA traits in seeds, offering a promising framework to guide hypothesis testing and narrow the search space for candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAging is accompanied with loss of tissue homeostasis and accumulation of cellular damages. As one of the important metabolic centers, aged liver shows altered lipid metabolism, impaired detoxification pathway, increased inflammation and oxidative stress response. However, the mechanisms for these age-related changes still remain unclear. In fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, liver-like functions are controlled by two distinct tissues, fat body and oenocytes. Although the role of fat body in aging regulation has been well studied, little is known about how oenocytes age and what are their roles in aging regulation. To address these questions, we used cell-type-specific ribosome profiling (RiboTag) to study the impacts of aging and oxidative stress on oenocyte translatome in Drosophila.\\n\\nResultsWe show that aging and oxidant paraquat significantly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adult oenocytes of Drosophila, and aged oenocytes exhibited reduced sensitivity to paraquat treatment. Through RiboTag sequencing, we identified 3324 and 949 differentially expressed genes in oenocytes under aging and paraquat treatment, respectively. Aging and paraquat exhibit both shared and distinct regulations on oenocyte translatome. Among all age-regulated genes, mitochondrial, proteasome, peroxisome, fatty acid metabolism, and cytochrome P450 pathways were down-regulated, whereas DNA replication and glutathione metabolic pathways were up-regulated. Interestingly, most of the peroxisomal genes were down-regulated in aged oenocytes, including peroxisomal biogenesis factors and beta-oxidation genes. Further analysis of the oenocyte translatome showed that oenocytes highly expressed genes involving in liver-like processes (e.g., ketogenesis). Many age-related transcriptional changes in oenocytes are similar to aging liver, including up-regulation of Ras/MAPK signaling pathway and down-regulation of peroxisome and fatty acid metabolism.\\n\\nConclusionsOur oenocyte-specific translatome analysis identified many genes and pathways that are shared between Drosophila oenocytes and mammalian liver, highlighting the molecular and functional similarities between the two tissues. Many of these genes are altered in both aged oenocytes and aged liver, suggesting a conserved molecular mechanism underlying oenocyte and liver aging. Thus, our translatome analysis will contribute significantly to the understanding of oenocyte biology, and its role in lipid metabolism, stress response and aging regulation.",

Correctly organising sequenced fragments such as contigs and scaffolds in relation to each other is a critical and often challenging step in the construction of robust genome references. We previously identified misoriented regions in the mouse and human reference assemblies using Strand-seq, a single cell sequencing technique that preserves DNA directionality1, 2. Here we demonstrate the ability of Strand-seq to build and correct full-length chromosomes, by identifying which scaffolds belong to the same chromosome and determining their correct order and orientation, without the need for overlapping sequences. We demonstrate that Strand-seq exquisitely maps assembly fragments into large related groups and chromosome-sized clusters without using new assembly data. Using template strand inheritance as a bi-allelic marker, we employ genetic mapping principles to cluster scaffolds that are derived from the same chromosome and order them within the chromosome based solely on directionality of DNA strand inheritance. We prove the utility of our approach by generating improved genome assemblies for several model organisms including the ferret, pig, Xenopus, zebrafish, Tasmanian devil and the Guinea pig.",

Based on the association of CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA cleavage with cellular lethality, we systematically profiled sgRNA activity by co-expressing a genome-scale library (~70,000 sgRNAs) with Cas9 or its specificity-improved mutant in E. coli. Based on this large-scale dataset, we constructed a comprehensive and high-density sgRNA activity map, which enables selecting highly active sgRNAs for any locus across the genome in this model organism. We also identified  resistant genomic loci with respect to CRISPR/Cas9 activity, notwithstanding the highly accessible DNA in bacterial cells. Moreover, we found that previous sgRNA activity prediction models that were trained on mammalian cell datasets were inadequate when coping with our results, highlighting the key limitations and biases of previous models. We hence developed an integrated algorithm to accurately predict highly effective sgRNAs, aiming to facilitate the design of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering or screenings in bacteria. We also isolated the important sgRNA features that contribute to DNA cleavage and characterized their key differences among wild type Cas9 and its mutant, shedding light on the biophysical mechanisms of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.",

Here we show that the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus Ribonuclease (RNase) E assembles RNP LLPS droplets that we term bacterial RNP-bodies (BR-bodies) similar to eukaryotic P-bodies and stress granules. RNase E requires RNA to assemble a BR-body, and disassembly requires RNA cleavage, suggesting BR-bodies provide localized sites of RNA degradation. The unstructured C-terminal domain of RNase E is both necessary and sufficient to assemble the core of the BR-body, is functionally conserved in related -proteobacteria, and influences mRNA degradation. BR-bodies are rapidly induced under cellular stresses and provide enhanced cell growth under stress. To our knowledge, Caulobacter RNase E is the first bacterial protein identified that forms LLPS droplets, providing an effective strategy for subcellular organization in cells lacking membrane bound compartments.",

Particularly, the collection of environmental DNA (eDNA) which can be collected without needing to encounter the target animal, facilitates the genetic analysis of cryptic and threatened species. One method that has been applied to these types of sample is target capture and enrichment which overcomes the issue of high proportions of exogenous (non-host) DNA from these lower quality samples. We tested whether target capture of mitochondrial DNA from sampled feeding traces of wild aye-ayes would yield mitochondrial DNA sequences for population genetic monitoring. We sampled gnawed wood from feeding traces where aye-ayes excavate wood-boring insect larvae from trees. We designed RNA probes complementary to the aye-ayes mitochondrial genome and used these to isolate aye-aye DNA from other non-target DNA in these samples. We successfully retrieved six near-complete mitochondrial genomes from two sites within the aye-ayes geographic range that had not been sampled previously. This method can likely be applied to alternative foraged remains to sample species other than aye-ayes. Our method demonstrates the application to next-generation molecular techniques to species of conservation concern.",

    "abstract": "Stolonization in syllid annelids is a unique mode of reproduction among animals. During the breeding season, a structure resembling the adult but containing only gametes, called stolon, is formed at the posterior end of the animal. When the stolons mature, they detach from the adult and the gametes are released into the water column. The process is synchronized within each species, and it has been reported to be under environmental and endogenous control, probably via endocrine regulation. To further understand the reproduction in syllids and to elucidate the molecular toolkit underlying stolonization, we generated Illumina RNA-seq data from different tissues of reproductive and non-reproductive individuals of Syllis magdalena, and characterized gene expression during the stolonization process. Several genes involved in gametogenesis (ovochymase, vitellogenin, testis-specific serine/threonine-kinase), immune response (complement receptor 2), neuronal development (tyrosine-protein kinase Src42A), cell proliferation (alpha-1D adrenergic receptor), and steroid metabolism (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2) were found differentially expressed in the different tissues and conditions analyzed. In addition, our findings suggest that several neurohormones, such as methyl farnesoate, dopamine and serotonin, might trigger the stolon formation, the correct maturation of gametes and the detachment of stolons when gametogenesis is complete. The process seems to be under circadian control, as indicated by the expression patterns of r-opsins. Overall, our results shed light into the genes that orchestrate the onset of gamete formation, and improve our understanding of how some hormones, previously reported to be involved in reproduction and metamorphosis processes in other invertebrates, seem to also regulate reproduction via stolonization.",

    "abstract": "Spatial normalization--the process of aligning anatomical or functional data acquired from different individuals to a common stereotaxic atlas--is routinely used in the vast majority of functional neuroimaging studies, with important consequences for scientific inference and reproducibility. Although several approaches exist, multi-step techniques that leverage the superior contrast and spatial resolution afforded by T1-weighted anatomical images to normalize echo planar imaging (EPI) functional data acquired from the same individuals (T1EPI) is now standard. Yet, recent work suggests that direct alignment of functional data to a T2*-weighted template without recourse to an anatomical image--an EPI only (EPIO) approach--enhances normalization precision. This counterintuitive claim is intriguing, suggesting that a change in standard practices may be warranted. Here, we re-visit these conclusions, extending prior work to encompass newly developed measures of normalization precision, accuracy, and  real-world statistical performance for the standard EPIO and T1EPI pipelines implemented in SPM12, a recently developed variant of the EPIO pipeline, and a novel T1EPI pipeline incorporating  best practice tools from multiple software packages. The multi-tool T1EPI pipeline was consistently the most precise, most accurate, and resulted in the largest t values at the group level, in some cases dramatically so. The three SPM-based pipelines exhibited more modest and variable differences in performance relative to each another, with the widely used T1EPI pipeline showing the second best overall precision and accuracy, and the recently developed EPIO pipeline generally showing the poorest overall performance. The results demonstrate that standard pipelines can be easily improved and we encourage researchers to invest the resources necessary to do so. The multi-tool pipeline presented here provides a framework for doing so. In addition, the novel performance metrics described here should prove useful for reporting and validating future methods for pre-processing functional neuroimaging data.",

    "abstract": "Hypoglycemia is a major barrier to good glucose control in type 1 diabetes and frequent exposure to hypoglycemia can impair awareness to subsequent bouts of hypoglycemia. The neural changes that occur to reduce a persons awareness of hypoglycemia are poorly defined. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms by which glial cells contribute to hypoglycemia sensing and glucose counterregulation require further investigation. To test whether glia, specifically astrocytes, could detect changes in glucose, we utilized human primary astrocytes (HPA) and U373 astrocytoma cells and exposed them to recurrent low glucose (RLG) in vitro. This allowed measurement, with high specificity and sensitivity, of changes in cellular metabolism following RLG. We report that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated over a pathophysiologically-relevant glucose concentration range. We observed an increased dependency on fatty acid oxidation for basal mitochondrial metabolism and hallmarks of mitochondrial stress including increased proton leak and reduced coupling efficiency. Relative to glucose availability, lactate release increased during low glucose but this was not modified by RLG, nor were glucose uptake or glycogen levels. Taken together, these data indicate that astrocyte mitochondria are dysfunctional following recurrent low glucose exposure, which could have implications for hypoglycemia glucose counterregulation and/or hypoglycemia awareness.",

    "abstract": "Several key transcription factors have unusually short half-lives compared to other cellular proteins. Here, we explore the utility of active degradation in shaping how a master regulator coordinates its downstream targets. We focus our studies on the multi-antibiotic resistance activator MarA, which controls a variety of stress response genes in Escherichia coli. We modify its half-life either by knocking down the protease that targets it via CRISPRi or by engineering MarA to protect it from degradation. Our experimental, analytical, and computational results indicate that active degradation can impact both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. Trade-offs between these properties show that perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist.",

    "abstract": "The impact of fluorescence microscopy has been limited by the difficulties of express-ing measurements of fluorescent proteins in numbers of molecules. Absolute numbers enable the integration of results from different laboratories, empower mathematical modelling, and are the bedrock for a quantitative, predictive biology. Here we develop a general algorithm to infer numbers of molecules from fluctuations in the photobleaching of proteins tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein. To untangle measurement noise from stochastic fluctuations, we use the linear noise approximation and Kalman filtering within a framework of Bayesian inference. Not only do our results agree with biochemical measurements for multiple proteins in budding yeast, but we also provide a statistically verified model of measurement noise for fluorescence microscopes. The experiments we require are straightforward and use only a wide-field fluorescence microscope. As such, our approach has the potential to become standard for those practising quantitative fluorescence microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregates such as those formed in neurodegenerative diseases can be degraded via autophagy. To assess changes in autophagic flux in zebrafish models of familial Alzheimers disease (fAD) mutations, we first developed a transgene, polyQ80-GFP-v2A-GFP, expressing equimolar amounts of aggregating polyQ80-GFP and a free GFP internal control in zebrafish embryos and larvae. This assay detects changes in autophagic flux by comparing the relative strength of polyQ80-GFP and free GFP moiety signals on western immunoblots probed with an antibody detecting GFP. However, the assays application is limited by the toxicity of polyQ80-GFP, and because aggregation of this protein may, itself, induce autophagy. To overcome these issues, we subsequently developed a similar ratiometric assay where expression of a GFP-Lc3a-GFP transgene generates initially equimolar amounts of GFP-Lc3a (directed to autophagic degradation) and a free GFP internal control. The sensitivity of this latter assay is reduced by a cellular protease activity that separates Lc3a from GFP-Lc3a, thus contributing to the apparent free GFP signal and somewhat masking decreases in autophagic flux. Nevertheless, the assay demonstrates significantly decreased autophagic flux in zebrafish lacking presenilin2 gene activity supporting that the Presenilin2 protein, like human PRESENILIN1, plays a role(s) in autophagy. Zebrafish heterozygous for a typical fAD-like, reading-frame-preserving mutation in psen1 show decreased autophagic flux consistent with observations in mammalian systems. Unexpectedly, a zebrafish model of the only confirmed reading-frame-truncating fAD mutation in a human PRESENILIN gene, the K115Efs mutation of human PSEN2, shows possibly increased autophagic flux in young zebrafish (larvae).",

    "abstract": "Mathematical frameworks circumventing the need of mechanistic detail to build models of signal transduction networks include graphs, hypergraphs, Boolean Networks, and Petri Nets. Predicting how a signal transduces in a signaling network is essential to understand cellular functions and disease. Different formalisms exist to describe how a signal transduces in a given intracellular signaling network represented in the aforementioned modeling frameworks: elementary signaling modes, T-invariants, extreme pathway analysis, elementary flux modes, and simple paths. How do these formalisms compare?\\n\\nWe present an overview of how signal transduction networks have been modelled using graphs, hypergraphs, Boolean Networks, and Petri Nets in the literature. We provide a review of the different formalisms for capturing signal transduction in a given model of an intracellular signaling network. We also discuss the existing translations between the different modeling frameworks, and the relationships between their corresponding signal transduction representations that have been described in the literature. Furthermore, as a new formalism of signal transduction, we show how minimal functional routes proposed for signaling networks modeled as Boolean Networks can be captured by computing topological factories, a methodology found in the metabolic networks literature. We further show that in the case of signaling networks represented with an acyclic B-hypergraph structure, the definitions are equivalent. In signaling networks represented as directed graphs, it has been shown that computations of elementary modes via its incidence matrix correspond to computations of simple paths and feedback loops. We show that computing elementary modes based on the incidence matrix of a B-hypergraph fails to capture minimal functional routes.",
