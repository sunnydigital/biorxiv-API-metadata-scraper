    "abstract": "Non-typhoidal Salmonella disease contributes towards significant morbidity and mortality across the world. Host factors including IFN-{gamma}, TNF- and gut microbiota, significantly influence the outcome of Salmonella pathogenesis. However, the entire repertoire of host protective mechanisms contributing to Salmonella pathogenicity is not completely appreciated. Here, we have investigated the roles of receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) that is predominantly expressed in the intestine, and regulates intestinal cell proliferation and fluid-ion homeostasis. Mice deficient in GC-C (Gucy2c-/-) displayed accelerated mortality following infection via the oral route, in spite of possessing comparative systemic Salmonella infection burden. Survival following intra-peritoneal infection remained similar, indicating that GC-C offered protection via a gut-mediated response. Serum cortisol was higher in Gucy2c-/- mice, in comparison to wild type (Gucy2c+/+) mice, and an increase in infection-induced thymic atrophy, with loss in immature CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes, was observed. Accelerated and enhanced damage in the ileum, including submucosal edema, epithelial cell damage, focal tufting and distortion of villus architecture, was seen in Gucy2c-/- mice, concomitant with a larger number of ileal tissue-associated bacteria. Transcription of key mediators in Salmonella-induced inflammation (IL-22/Reg3{beta}) were altered in Gucy2c-/- mice in comparison to Gucy2c+/+ mice. A reduction in fecal Lactobacilli, which are protective against Salmonella infection, was observed in Gucy2c-/- mice. Gucy2c-/- mice cohoused with wild type mice continued to show reduced Lactobacilli and increased susceptibility to infection. Our study therefore suggests that receptor GC-C confers a survival advantage during gut-mediated S. Typhimurium pathogenesis, presumably by regulating Salmonella-effector mechanisms and maintaining a beneficial microbiome.",

    "abstract": "By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (Delphinium spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyers larkspur (D. geyeri). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial insects live in teeming societies with thousands of their kin. In this crowded environment, workers combat disease by removing or burying their dead or diseased nestmates. For honey bees, we found that hygienic brood-removal behavior is triggered by two odorants - {beta}-ocimene and oleic acid - which are released from brood upon freeze-killing. {beta}-ocimene is a co-opted pheromone that normally signals larval food-begging, whereas oleic acid is a conserved necromone across arthropod taxa. Interestingly, the odorant blend can induce hygienic behavior more consistently than either odorant alone. We suggest that the volatile {beta}-ocimene flags hygienic workers attention, while oleic acid is the death cue, triggering removal. Bees with high hygienicity detect and remove brood with these odorants faster than bees with low hygienicity, and both molecules are strong ligands for hygienic behavior-associated odorant binding proteins (OBP16 and OBP18). Odorants that induce low levels of hygienic behavior, however, are weak ligands for these OBPs. We are therefore beginning to paint a picture of the molecular mechanism behind this complex behavior, using odorants associated with freeze-killed brood as a model.",

The transcriptional profile showed global similarities to canonical cases. Coding lesions were predominantly clonal and almost entirely targeting alleles reported in human genetic variation databases with a notable exception in the mismatch repair gene, MSH2. There were no rare germline alleles or somatic mutations affecting proof-reading polymerase genes POLE or POLD1, however there was a predicted damaging mutation in the error prone replicative polymerase, POLK. The patients diagnostic leukemia transcriptome was depleted of rare and low-frequency germline alleles due to loss-of-heterozygosity, while somatic point mutations targeted low-frequency and common human alleles in proportions that offset this discrepancy. Somatic signatures of ultra-mutations were highly correlated with germline single nucleotide polymorphic sites indicating a common role for 5-methylcytosine deamination, DNA mismatch repair and DNA adducts.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest similar molecular processes shaping population-scale human genome variation also underlies the rapid evolution of an infant ultra-mutated leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Cold-induced thermogenesis increases energy expenditure and can reduce body weight in mammals, so the genes involved in it are thought to be potential therapeutic targets for treating obesity and diabetes. In the quest for more effective therapies, a great deal of research has been conducted to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of cold-induced thermogenesis. Over the last decade, a large number of genes that can enhance or suppress cold-induced thermogenesis have been discovered, but a comprehensive list of these genes is lacking. To fill this gap, we examined all of the annotated human and mouse genes and curated those demonstrated to enhance or suppress cold-induced thermogenesis by in vivo or ex vivo experiments in mice. The results of this highly accurate and comprehensive annotation are hosted on a database called CITGeneDB, which includes a searchable web interface to facilitate broad public use. The database will be updated as new genes are found to enhance or suppress cold-induced thermogenesis. It is expected that CITGeneDB will be a valuable resource in future explorations of the molecular mechanism of cold-induced thermogenesis, helping pave the way for new obesity and diabetes treatments.

The measurement of thousands of datapoints on single samples has become routine but relating  big data datasets to the complexities of human pathobiology is an area of ongoing research. Complicating this is the fact that many publically available datasets use bulk transcriptomics data from complex tissues like blood. The most prevalent analytic approaches derive molecular  signatures of disease states or apply modular analysis frameworks to the data. Here we show, using a network-based data integration method using clinical phenotype and microarray data as inputs, that we can reconstruct multiple features (or endophenotypes) of disease states at various scales of organization, from transcript abundance patterns of individual genes through co-expression patterns of groups of genes to patterns of cellular behavior in whole blood samples, both in single experiments as well as in a meta-analysis of multiple datasets.",

IL7R mRNA is induced in stimulated monocytes in a genetically determined manner, yet a role for IL7R in monocyte biology remains unexplored. Here we characterize genetic regulation of IL7R at the protein level across multiple cell subsets and conditions in healthy individuals. We find monocyte surface and soluble IL7R (sIL7R) protein are markedly expressed in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We further demonstrate alleles of rs6897932, a non-synonymous IL7R polymorphism associated with susceptibility to Multiple Sclerosis, Ankylosing Spondylitis and Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, form the key determinant of both surface IL7R and sIL7R in the context of inflammation. No effect of this allele was observed in unstimulated monocytes or across lymphoid subsets. Production of sIL7R by monocytes greatly exceeded that of CD4+ T-cells, and was strongly associated with both rs6897932 genotype and expression of the splicing factor gene DDX39A. Stimulated monocytes were sensitive to exogenous IL-7, which elicits a defined transcriptional signature. Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing of synovial fluid derived monocytes from patients with spondyloarthritis showed an enlarged subset of IL7R+ monocytes with a unique transcriptional profile that markedly overlaps that induced by IL-7 in-vitro and shows similarity to the previously described  Mono4 subset. These data demonstrate disease-associated genetic variants at IL7R specifically impact monocyte surface IL7R and sIL7R following innate immune stimulation, suggesting a previously unappreciated key role for monocytes in IL-7 pathway biology and IL7R-associated diseases.",

We introduce a hybrid method, Golden Gate-Gibson (3G), that takes advantage of modular part libraries introduced by type IIS restriction enzyme systems and isothermal assembly s ability to build large DNA constructs in single pot reactions. Our method is highly efficient and rapid, facilitating construction of entire multi-gene circuits in a single day. Additionally, 3G allows generation of variant libraries enabling efficient screening of different possible circuit constructions. We characterize the efficiency and accuracy of 3G assembly for various construct sizes, and demonstrate 3G by characterizing variants of an inducible cell-lysis circuit.",

Their axons innervate one of four lobula plate layers. How T4/T5 neurons with layer-specific representation of motion-direction preferences are specified during development is unknown. We show that diffusible Wingless (Wg) between adjacent neuroepithelia induces its own expression to form secondary signaling centers. These activate Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling in adjacent lateral tertiary neuroepithelial domains dedicated to producing layer 3/4-specific T4/T5 neurons. T4/T5 neurons derived from the core domain devoid of Dpp signaling adopt the default layer 1/2 fate. Dpp signaling induces the expression of the T-box transcription factor Optomotor-blind (Omb), serving as a relay to postmitotic neurons. Omb-mediated repression of Dachshund transforms layer 1/2-into layer 3/4-specific neurons. Hence, spatio-temporal relay mechanisms, bridging the distances between neuroepithelial domains and their postmitotic progeny, implement T4/T5 neuron-subtype identity.",

    "abstract": "DNA-binding proteins utilise different recognition mechanisms to locate their DNA targets. Some proteins recognise specific nucleotide sequences, while many DNA repair proteins interact with specific (often bent) DNA structures. While sequence-specific DNA binding mechanisms have been studied extensively, structure-specific mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we study structure-specific DNA recognition by examining the structure and dynamics of DNA polymerase I (Pol) substrates both alone and in Pol-DNA complexes. Using a rigid-body docking approach based on a network of 73 distance restraints collected using single-molecule FRET, we determined a novel solution structure of the singlenucleotide-gapped DNA-Pol binary complex. The structure was highly consistent with previous crystal structures with regards to the downstream primer-template DNA substrate; further, our structure showed a previously unobserved sharp bend (~120{degrees}) in the DNA substrate; we also showed that this pronounced bending of the substrate is present in living bacteria. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations and single-molecule quenching assays revealed that 4-5 nt of downstream gap-proximal DNA are unwound in the binary complex. Coarsegrained simulations on free gapped substrates reproduced our experimental FRET values with remarkable accuracy (<{Delta}FRET> = -0.0025 across 34 independent distances) and revealed that the one-nucleotide-gapped DNA frequently adopted highly bent conformations similar to those in the Pol-bound state ({Delta}G < 4 kT); such conformations were much less accessible to nicked (> 7 kT) or duplex (>> 10 kT) DNA. Our results suggest a mechanism by which Pol and other structure-specific DNA-binding proteins locate their DNA targets through sensing of the conformational dynamics of DNA substrates.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMost genetic processes, including DNA replication, repair and transcription, rely on DNA-binding proteins locating specific sites on DNA; some sites contain a specific sequence, whereas others present a specific structure. While sequence-specific recognition has a clear physical basis, structure-specific recognition mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we use single-molecule FRET and computer simulations to show that the conformational dynamics of an important repair intermediate (1nt-gapped DNA) act as central recognition signals for structure-specific binding by DNA polymerase I (Pol). Our conclusion is strongly supported by a novel solution structure of the Pol-DNA complex wherein the gapped-DNA is significantly bent. Our iterative approach combining precise single-molecule measurements with molecular modelling is general and can elucidate the structure and dynamics for many large biomachines.",

    "abstract": "Taastrup virus (TV) is a novel virus belonging to Mononegavirales and with filovirus-like morphology. In adult Psammotettix alienus infected with TV, the highest concentration of virus particles was found in salivary glands, consisting of a principal gland (type I-VI-cells) and an accessory gland. Examination of thin sections revealed enveloped particles, about 1300 nm long and 62 nm in diameter, located singly or in paracrystalline arrays in canaliculi of type III- and IV-cells. In gland cells with TV particles in canaliculi, granular masses up to 15 micrometer in diameter are present in the cytoplasm. These masses are believed to be viroplasms, the sites for viral replication. TV particles were observed at the connection between a canaliculus and the salivary duct system.",

    "abstract": "The human de novo iron-sulfur (Fe-S) assembly complex consists of the cysteine desulfurase NFS1, accessory protein ISD11, scaffold protein ISCU, and allosteric activator frataxin (FXN). FXN has been shown to bind the NFS1-ISD11-ISCU complex (SDU), to activate the desulfurase activity and thus Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. Conversely, in the absence of FXN, the NFS1-ISD11 (SD) complex was reported to be inhibited by the binding of recombinant ISCU. Here, we show that recombinant ISCU binds zinc(II) ion, and that the presence of zinc in as-isolated ISCU has impacts on the SDU desulfurase activity as measured by sulfide production. Indeed, the removal of this zinc(II) ion from ISCU causes a moderate but significant increase in activity compared to SD alone, and FXN can activate both zinc-depleted and zinc-bound forms of ISCU complexed to SD. Recent yeast studies have reported a substitution on the yeast ISCU orthologue Isu, at position Met141 (Met140 in human numbering of precursor protein) to Ile, Leu, Val, or Cys that could bypass the requirement of FXN for Fe-S cluster assembly and cell viability. Using recombinant human proteins, we report no significant differences in the biochemical and biophysical properties observed between wild-type and variants M140I, M140 L, and M140 V of ISCU. Importantly, in the absence of FXN, ISCU variants behaved like wild-type and did not stimulate the desulfurase activity of the SD complex. This study therefore identifies an important regulatory role for ISCU-bound zinc in modulation of the human Fe-S assembly system in vitro but no  FXN bypass effect on mutations at position Met140 in human ISCU.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

    "abstract": "The ribosome translates nucleotide sequences of messenger RNA to proteins through selection of cognate transfer RNA according to the genetic code. To date, structural studies of ribosomal decoding complexes yielding high-resolution data have predominantly relied on experiments performed at cryogenic temperatures. New lightsources like the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) have enabled data collection from macromolecular crystals at ambient temperature. Here, we report an X-ray crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit decoding complex to 3.45 [A] resolution using data obtained at ambient temperature at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). We find that this ambient-temperature structure is largely consistent with existing cryogenic-temperature crystal structures, with key residues of the decoding complex exhibiting similar conformations, including adenosine residues 1492 and 1493. Minor variations were observed, namely an alternate conformation of cytosine 1397 near the mRNA channel and the A-site. Our serial crystallography experiment illustrates the amenability of ribosomal microcrystals to routine structural studies at ambient temperature, thus overcoming a long-standing experimental limitation.",

    "abstract": "Faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis I depends upon the formation of connections between homologous chromosomes. Crossovers between homologs connect the partners allowing them to attach to the meiotic spindle as a unit, such that they migrate away from one another at anaphase I. Homologous partners also become connected by pairing of their centromeres in meiotic prophase. This centromere pairing can promote proper segregation at anaphase I of partners that have failed to become joined by a crossover. Centromere pairing is mediated by synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins that persist at the centromere when the SC disassembles. Here, using mouse spermatocyte and yeast model systems, we tested the role of shugoshin in promoting meiotic centromere pairing by protecting centromeric synaptonemal components from disassembly. The results show that shugoshin protects centromeric SC in meiotic prophase and, in anaphase, promotes the proper segregation of partner chromosomes that are not linked by a crossover.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMeiotic crossovers form a connection between homologous chromosomes that allows them to attach to the spindle as a single unit in meiosis I. In humans, failures in this process are a leading cause of aneuploidy. A recently described process, called centromere pairing, can also help connect meiotic chromosome partners in meiosis. Homologous chromosomes become tightly joined by a structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) in meiotic prophase. After the SC disassembles, persisting SC proteins at the centromeres mediate their pairing. Here, studies in mouse spermatocytes and yeast are used to show that the shugoshin protein helps SC components persist at centromeres and helps centromere pairing promote the proper segregation of yeast chromosomes that fail to become tethered by crossovers.",

    "abstract": "Containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection requires T cell recognition of infected macrophages. Mtb has evolved to tolerate, evade, and subvert host immunity. Despite a vigorous and sustained CD8+ T cell response during Mtb infection, CD8+ T cells make limited contribution to protection. Here, we ask whether the ability of Mtb-specific T cells to restrict Mtb growth is related to their capacity to recognize Mtb-infected macrophages.\\n\\nWe derived CD8+ T cell lines that recognized the Mtb immunodominant epitope TB10.44-11 and compared them to CD4+ T cell lines that recognized Ag85b240-254 or ESAT63-17. While the CD4+ T cells recognized Mtb-infected macrophages and inhibited Mtb growth in vitro, the TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells neither recognized Mtb-infected macrophages nor restricted Mtb growth. TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells recognized macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes expressing TB10.4. However, over-expression of TB10.4 in Mtb did not confer recognition by TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells. Importantly, CD8+ T cells recognized macrophages pulsed with irradiated Mtb, indicating that macrophages can efficiently cross-present the TB10.4 protein and raising the possibility that viable bacilli might suppress cross-presentation. Importantly, polyclonal CD8+ T cells specific for Mtb antigens other than TB10.4 recognized Mtb-infected macrophages in a MHC-restricted manner.\\n\\nAs TB10.4 elicits a dominant CD8+ T cell response that poorly recognizes Mtb-infected macrophages, we propose that TB10.4 acts as a decoy antigen. Moreover, it appears that this response overshadows subdominant CD8+ T cell response that can recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. The ability of Mtb to subvert the CD8+ T cell response may explain why CD8+ T cells make a disproportionately small contribution to host defense compared to CD4+ T cells. The selection of Mtb antigens for vaccines has focused on antigens that generate immunodominant responses. We propose that establishing whether vaccine-elicited, Mtb-specific T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages could be a useful criterion for preclinical vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Species respond to global climatic changes in a local context. Understanding this process is paramount due to the pace of these changes. Tree species are particularly interesting to study in this regard due to their long generation times, sedentarism, and ecological and economic importance. Quercus suber L. is an evergreen forest tree species of the Fagaceae family with an essentially Western Mediterranean distribution. Despite frequent assessments of the species evolutionary history, large-scale genetic studies have mostly relied on plastidial markers, whereas nuclear markers have been used on studies with locally focused sampling strategies. The potential response of Q. suber to global climatic changes has also been studied, under ecological modelling. In this work, \\\"Genotyping by Sequencing\\\" (GBS) is used to derive 2,547 SNP markers to assess the species evolutionary history from a nuclear DNA perspective, gain insights on how local adaptation may be shaping the species genetic background, and to forecast how Q. suber may respond to global climatic changes from a genetic perspective. Results reveal an essentially unstructured species, where a balance between gene flow and local adaptation keeps the species gene pool somewhat homogeneous across its distribution, but at the same time allows variation clines for the individuals to cope with local conditions. \\\"Risk of Non-Adaptedness\\\" (RONA) analyses, suggest that for the considered variables and most sampled locations, the cork oak does not require large shifts in allele frequencies to survive the predicted climatic changes.

    "abstract": "Parent-of-origin effects (POEs) in mammals typically arise from maternal effects or from imprinting. Mutations in imprinted genes have been associated with psychiatric disorders, as well as with changes in a handful of animal behaviors. Nonetheless, POEs on complex traits such as behavior remain largely uncharacterized. Furthermore, although perinatal environmental exposures, such as nutrient deficiency, are known to modify both behavior and epigenetic effects generally, the architecture of environment-by-POE is almost completely unexplored. To study POE and environment-by-POE, we employ a relatively neglected but maximally powerful POE-detection system: a reciprocal F1 hybrid population. We exposed female NOD/ShiLtJxC57Bl/6J and C57Bl/6JxNOD/ShiLtJ mice, in utero, to one of four different diets, then after weaning recorded their whole-brain gene expression, as well as a set of behaviors that model psychiatric disease. Microarray expression data revealed an imprinting-enriched set of over a dozen genes subject to POE; the POE on the most significantly affected gene, Carmil1 (a.k.a. Lrrc16a), was validated using qPCR in the same and in a new set of mice. Several behaviors, especially locomotor behaviors, also showed POE. Interestingly, Bayesian mediation analysis suggests Carmil1 expression suppresses behavioral POE, and Airn suppresses POE on Carmil1 expression. A significant diet-by-POE was observed on one behavior, one imprinted gene, and over a dozen non-imprinted genes. Beyond our particular results, our study demonstrates a reciprocal F1 hybrid framework for studying POE and environment-by-POE on behavior.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by nucleotide repeat expansions, but most expansions, like the C9orf72  GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat that causes approximately 5-7% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, are too long to sequence using short-read sequencing technologies. It is unclear whether long-read sequencing technologies can traverse these long, challenging repeat expansions. Here, we demonstrate that two long-read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), can sequence through disease-causing repeats cloned into plasmids, including the FTD/ALS-causing G4C2 repeat expansion. We also report the first long-read sequencing data characterizing the C9orf72 G4C2 repeat expansion at the nucleotide level in two symptomatic expansion carriers using PacBio whole-genome sequencing and a no-amplification (No-Amp) targeted approach based on CRISPR/Cas9.\\n\\nResults: Both the PacBio and ONT platforms successfully sequenced through the repeat expansions in plasmids. Throughput on the MinlON was a challenge for whole-genome sequencing; we were unable to attain reads covering the human C9orf72 repeat expansion using 15 flow cells. We obtained 8x coverage across the C9orf72 locus using the PacBio Sequel, accurately reporting the unexpanded allele at eight repeats, and reading through the entire expansion with 1324 repeats (7941 nucleotides). Using the No-Amp targeted approach, we attained >800x coverage and were able to identify the unexpanded allele, closely estimate expansion size, and assess nucleotide content in a single experiment. We estimate the individuals repeat region was >99% G4C2 content, though we cannot rule out small interruptions.\\n\\nConclusions: Our findings indicate that long-read sequencing is well suited to characterizing known repeat expansions, and for discovering new disease-causing, disease-modifying, or risk-modifying repeat expansions that have gone undetected with conventional short-read sequencing. The PacBio No-Amp targeted approach may have future potential in clinical and genetic counseling environments. Larger and deeper long-read sequencing studies in C9orf72 expansion carriers will be important to determine heterogeneity and whether the repeats are interrupted by non-G4C2 content, potentially mitigating or modifying disease course or age of onset, as interruptions are known to do in other repeat-expansion disorders. These results have broad implications across all diseases where the genetic etiology remains unclear.",

To connect diet and molecular changes, here we performed short- and long-term feeding of mice with standard chow diet (SCD) and high-fat diet (HFD), with or without glucose or fructose supplementation, and quantified liver metabolites, 861 proteins, and 1,815 protein level-corrected mitochondrial acetylation and succinylation sites. Nearly half the acylation sites were altered by at least one diet; nutrient-specific changes in protein acylation sometimes encompass entire pathways. Although acetyl-CoA is an intermediate in both sugar and fat metabolism, acetyl-CoA had a dichotomous fate depending on its source; chronic feeding of dietary sugars induced protein hyperacetylation, whereas the same duration of HFD did not. Instead, HFD resulted in citrate accumulation, anaplerotic metabolism of amino acids, and protein hypo-succinylation. Together, our results demonstrate novel connections between dietary macronutrients, protein post-translational modifications, and regulation of fuel selection in liver.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/263426_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (53K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1419c64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82a874org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16023org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4ed44e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

Using this model, and employing the quantitative notion of Shannon entropy which assigns high values to low-dose metronomic (LDM) therapies, and low values to maximum tolerated dose (MTD) therapies, we show that low-dose metronomic strategies can outperform maximum tolerated dose strategies, particularly for faster growing tumors.

    "abstract": "Dna2 is a nuclease and helicase that functions redundantly with other proteins in Okazaki fragment processing, double strand break (DSB) resection and checkpoint kinase activation. Dna2 is an essential enzyme, required for yeast and mammalian cell viability. Here we report that numerous mutations affecting the DNA damage checkpoint suppress dna2{Delta} lethality in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. dna2{Delta} cells are also suppressed by deletion of helicases, PIF1 and MPH1, and by deletion of POL32, a subunit of DNA polymerase {delta}. All dna2{Delta} cells are temperature sensitive, have telomere length defects, and low levels of telomeric 3 single stranded DNA (ssDNA). Interestingly, Rfa1, a subunit of the major ssDNA binding protein RPA, and the telomere specific ssDNA binding protein Cdc13, often co-localize in dna2{Delta} cells. This suggests that telomeric defects often occur in dna2{Delta} cells. There are several plausible explanations for why the most critical function of Dna2 is at telomeres. Telomeres modulate the DNA damage response (DDR) at chromosome ends, inhibiting resection, ligation and cell cycle arrest. We suggest that Dna2 nuclease activity contributes to modulating the DNA damage response at telomeres by removing telomeric C-rich ssDNA and thus preventing checkpoint activation.",

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange Syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by limb truncations, craniofacial abnormalities, and cognitive delays. This syndrome is a member of a class of developmental disorders referred to as cohesinopathies, which result from mutations in the genes encoding subunits or regulators of the cohesin complex. The phenotypic consequences of these mutations may reflect the critical role that cohesin plays in chromosome structure, its ability to tether sister chromatids together during cell cycle progression, or some combination of both. Here we show that a sensitized assay for chromosome loss in budding yeast can be used to assess the impact of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS)-associated mutations in the core cohesin subunit Smc1 on cohesin function. We find that the CdLS-associated mutations can be grouped into two classes based on their impact on chromosome segregation. One class of mutations includes those that are defective in promoting accurate chromosome segregation, some no better than the null allele. Another class promotes both accurate chromosome cohesion and segregation. Strikingly, the mutations that have no impact chromosome dynamics in this assay are clustered near each other in the context of the folded SMC1 protein suggesting a previously uncharacterized region of functional importance in higher eukaryotes. This analysis illustrates how budding yeast can be used to elucidate mechanisms important in human health and development.",
