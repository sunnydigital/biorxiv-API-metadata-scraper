    "abstract": "The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch of the Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health assembled a large collection of frozen post-mortem human brains from individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and other psychiatric diagnoses, as well as matched control individuals. Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 expression array data was collected from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the data deposited at dbGaP (Study ID: phs000979). We report an analysis of the data from the 189 adult schizophrenics and 206 adult controls in that cohort.\\n\\nTranscripts from 633 genes are differentially expressed in the DLPFC of schizophrenics as compared to the controls at levels of statistical significance which survive Bonferroni correction. Seventeen of those genes are differentially expressed at a level of statistical significance less than 10-8 after Bonferroni correction.\\n\\nWeighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) of the schizophrenic subjects using differentially expressed gene module eigengenes divides them into two groups, \\\"type 1\\\" and \\\"type 2.\\\" There are 2,635 genes differentially expressed in the DLPFC of type 2 schizophrenics at a level of statistical significance which survives Bonferroni correction. Of them 221 have P-values less than 10-15 after Bonferroni correction. In the type 1 schizophrenics however, only 6 genes are differentially expressed in the DLPFC at a level of statistical significance which survives Bonferroni correction. This striking difference in their DLPFC transcriptomes emphasizes the fundamental biologic difference between these two groups of patients.",

    "abstract": "People have long pondered the evolution of language and the origin of words. Here, we investigate how conventional spoken words might emerge from imitations of environmental sounds. Does the repeated imitation of an environmental sound gradually give rise to more word-like forms? In what ways do these forms resemble the original sounds that motivated them (i.e., exhibit iconicity)? Participants played a version of the childrens game \\\"Telephone\\\". The first generation of participants imitated recognizable environmental sounds (e.g., glass breaking, water splashing). Subsequent generations imitated the previous generation of imitations for a maximum of 8 generations. The results showed that the imitations became more stable and word-like, and later imitations were easier to learn as category labels. At the same time, even after 8 generations, both spoken imitations and their written transcriptions could be matched above chance to the category of environmental sound that motivated them. These results show how repeated imitation can create progressively more word-like forms while continuing to retain a resemblance to the original sound that motivated them, and speak to the possible role of human vocal imitation in explaining the origins of at least some spoken words.",

We propose a novel methodology that combines predictions from epidemiological models with phylogenetic and structural analyses to identify such targets. Epidemiological models predict that strong immune selection can cause antigenic variants to exist in non-overlapping combinations. A corollary of this theory is that targets of immunity may be identified by searching for non-overlapping associations among antigenic variants. We applied this concept to the AMA-1 protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and found strong signatures of immune selection among certain regions of low variability which could render them ideal vaccine candidates.",

Meta-analyses were performed using effect-size and p-value based methods, as applicable.\\n\\nResultsAfter screening 599 publications we identified 47 datasets eligible for meta-analysis. On these, we performed 160 meta-analyses on microRNAs quantified in brain (n=125), blood (n=31), or CSF samples (n=4). Twenty-one meta-analyses were performed using effect sizes. We identified 13 significantly (Bonferroni-adjusted =3.13x10-4) differentially expressed microRNAs in brain (n=3) and blood (n=10) with consistent effect directions across studies.

In this work, liquid and solid fractions of grass biomass were used separately for semicontinuous batch methanation using sewage sludge as seed sludge. During 6 months of incubation, the amount of input COD was increased gradually, and the underlying methanogenic microbiome was assessed by means of microscopy-based automated cell counting and full-length 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. In this sense, we prove for the first time the suitability of the ONTMinION platform as a monitoring tool for anaerobic digestion systems. According to our results, solid-fed batches were highly unstable at higher COD input concentrations, and kept Methanosaeta spp. typically associated to sewage sludge-as the majoritary methanogenic archaea. In contrast, liquid-fed batches developed a more stable microbiome, proved enriched in Methanosarcina spp, and resulted in higher methanogenic yield. This work demonstrates the high repowering potential of microbiomes from sewage sludge digesters, and highlight the effectiveness of liquefied substrates for increasing biogas productivity in anaerobic digestions.",

    "abstract": "Animals have access to many alternative information sources when making decisions, such as private information (e.g. memory) and social information. Social insects make extensive use of social information. However, when intentional social information (e.g. pheromone trails in ants) conflicts with private information (e.g. route memories), insects often follow their private information. Why is this? We propose that an asymmetry in the type of information provided by these two information sources drives the neglect of social information: In ants, workers with certain information about the quality of a food source (memory) ignore valuable social information (pheromone trails) because the pheromone trails encode only a very ambiguous measure of food quality. This leads to a testable hypothesis: the addition of unambiguous quality information should rescue social information following. To test this, we trained ants to a poor quality (0.25M sucrose) food source, and then provided an alternative path along with either 1) no information, 2) a pheromone trail, 3) a 0.2l 1.5M sucrose droplet, providing unambiguous quality information, or 4) both a trail and a droplet. When either no or only one information source was provided (1-3), most ants (60-75%) continued following their own memory. However, the addition of unambiguous quality information (4) rescued trail following: when both a trail and a droplet were provided, 75% of ants followed the trail. In further experiments, we show that quality information gleaned from direct contact with fed nestmates produced similar effects. Using florescence microscopy, we demonstrate that food (and information) flows from fed workers to outgoing foragers, explaining the frequent contacts on trails. We propose that the type of information an information source can convey, and its ambiguity, is a strong driver of which source of information is attended to.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for a number of different human infections and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat due to a number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the organisms propensity to form multicellular biofilms. Epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa often dominate within the lungs of individual CF patients, but how they achieve this is poorly understood. One of the ways strains of P. aeruginosa can compete, is by producing chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, called pyocins. Three major classes of pyocin have been identified in P. aeruginosa: soluble pyocins (S-types) and tailocins (R- and F-types). In this study, we investigated the distribution of S- and R-type pyocins in 24 clinical strains isolated from individual CF patients and then focused on understanding their roles on inter-strain competition. We found that (i) each strain produced only one R-pyocin type, but the number of S-pyocins varied between strains; (ii) R-pyocins were generally important for strain dominance during competition assays in planktonic cultures and biofilm communities in strains with both disparate R and S pyocin sub-types. (iii) purified R-pyocins demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against established biofilms. Our work provides support for a key role played by R-pyocins in the competition between P. aeruginosa strains, and may help explain why certain strains and lineages of P. aeruginosa dominate and displace others during CF lung infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting R-pyocins for therapeutic gains in an era when antibiotic resistance is a global concern.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEA major clinical problem caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is chronic biofilm infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Epidemic P. aeruginosa strains dominate and displace others during CF infection, but these intra-species interactions remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that R-pyocins (bacterocins) are important factors in driving competitive interactions in biofilms between P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different CF patients. In addition, we found that these phage-like pyocins are inhibitory against mature biofilms of susceptible strains. This highlights the potential of R-pyocins as antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents, at a time when new antimicrobial therapies are desperately needed.",

    "abstract": "Developmental pathways must be responsive to the environment. Phosphorylation of eIF2 enables a family of stress sensing kinases to trigger the integrated stress response (ISR), which has pro-survival and developmental consequences. Mutations of the ISR kinase GCN2 have been implicated in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension, a disorder known to be associated with defects of BMP signaling, but how the ISR and BMP signaling might interact is unknown. Here we show in Drosophila that GCN2 antagonises BMP signaling through direct effects on translation and indirectly via the transcription factor crc (dATF4). Expression of a constitutively active GCN2 or loss of the eIF2 phosphatase dPPP1R15 impair developmental BMP signaling in flies. In cells, inhibition of translation by GCN2 blocks downstream BMP signaling. Moreover, loss of d4E-BP, a target of crc, augments BMP signaling in vitro and rescues tissue development in vivo. These results identify a novel mechanism by which the ISR modulates BMP signaling during development. Since abnormalities of both GCN2 and BMP signaling lead to pulmonary hypertension, these findings may have wider relevance for the development of therapies for this disease.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization has recently gained considerable interest both as a unique window for observing speciation mechanisms and as a potential engine of speciation. The latter remains a controversial topic. It was recently hypothesized that the reciprocal sorting of genetic incompatibilities from parental species could result in hybrid speciation, when the hybrid population maintains a mixed combination of the parental incompatibilities that prevents further gene exchange with both parental populations. However, the specifics of the purging/sorting process of multiple incompatibilities have not been examined theoretically.\\n\\nWe here investigate the allele-frequency dynamics of an isolated hybrid population that results from a single hybridization event. Using models of 2 or 4 loci, we investigate the fate of one or two genetic incompatibilities of the Dobzhansky-Muller type (DMIs). We study how various parameters affect both the sorting/purging of the DMIs and the probability of observing hybrid speciation by reciprocal sorting. We find that the probability of hybrid speciation is strongly dependent on the linkage architecture (i.e. the order and recombination distance between loci along chromosomes), the population size of the hybrid population, and the initial relative contribution of the parental populations to the hybrid population. We identify a Goldilocks zone for specific linkage architectures and intermediate recombination rates, in which hybrid speciation becomes highly probable. Whereas an equal contribution of parental populations to the hybrid populations maximizes the hybrid speciation probability in the Goldilocks zone, other linkage architectures yield unintuitive asymmetric maxima. We provide an explanation for this pattern, and discuss our results both with respect to the best conditions for observing hybrid speciation in nature and their implications regarding patterns of introgression in hybrid zones.\\n\\nSummaryHybridization is observed ubiquitously in nature. Its outcome can range from extinction to the creation of new species. With respect to the latter, the probability of homoploid hybrid speciation, i.e. the formation of a new species as a result of an hybridization event without changes in the ploidy of the organism, is a hotly debated topic. Here, we analyze a minimal model for homoploid hybrid speciation, in which reproductive isolation is achieved by means of (postzygotic) Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. When these postzygotic genetic incompatibilities are resolved in the hybrid population, their reciprocal sorting can result in reproductive isolation from both parental populations, thus creating a hybrid species. We show that, in accordance with the current literature, hybrid speciation tends to be rare. However, specific arrangements of the genes responsible for reproductive isolation can make reciprocal sorting almost unavoidable and thus create barriers to the parental population in an almost deterministic matter. We discuss the implications of these results for hybrid speciation and patterns of introgression in nature.",

    "abstract": "Extended parental care (XPC) is a complex reproductive strategy in which progenitors actively look after their offspring up to - or beyond - the first juvenile stage in order to maximize their fitness. Although the euarthropod fossil record has produced several examples of brood-care, the appearance of XPC within this phylum remains poorly constrained given the scarcity of developmental data for Palaeozoic stem-group representatives that would link juvenile and adult forms in an ontogenetic sequence. Here, we describe the post-embryonic growth of Fuxianhuia protensa from the early Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstatte, and show parental care in this stem-group euarthropod. We recognize fifteen distinct ontogenetic stages based on the number and shape of the trunk tergites, and their allocation between the morphologically distinct thorax and abdomen. Our data demonstrate anamorphic post-embryonic development in F. protensa, in which tergites were sequentially added from a posterior growth zone. A life assemblage consisting of a sexually mature F. protensa adult alongside four ontogenetically coeval juveniles, constitutes the oldest occurrence of XPC in the panarthropod fossil record. These findings provide the most phylogenetically basal evidence of anamorphosis in the evolutionary history of total-group Euarthropoda, and reveal a complex post-embryonic reproductive ecology for its early representatives.",

Ablation of network edges using a library targeting 93 miRNA target sites in 71 genes reveals numerous edges that control, with variable importance, cellular survival under stress. To compare the impact of removing nodes versus edges in a biological network, we dissect a specific p53-microRNA pathway.

    "abstract": "Suicide accounts for nearly 800,000 deaths per year worldwide with rates of both deaths and attempts rising. Family studies have estimated substantial heritability of suicidal behavior; however, collecting the sample sizes necessary for successful genetic studies has remained a challenge. We utilized two different approaches in independent datasets to characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. The first is a patient reported suicide attempt phenotype from genotyped samples in the UK Biobank (337,199 participants, 2,433 cases). The second leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC, 2.8 million patients, 3,250 cases) and machine learning to derive probabilities of attempting suicide in 24,546 genotyped patients. We identified significant and comparable heritability estimates of suicide attempt from both the patient reported phenotype in the UK Biobank (h2SNP = 0.035, p = 7.12x10-4) and the clinically predicted phenotype from VUMC (h2SNP = 0.046, p = 1.51x10-2). A significant genetic overlap was demonstrated between the two measures of suicide attempt in these independent samples through polygenic risk score analysis (t = 4.02, p = 5.75x10-5) and genetic correlation (rg = 1.073, SE = 0.36, p = 0.003). Finally, we show significant but incomplete genetic correlation of suicide attempt with insomnia (rg = 0.34 - 0.81) as well as several psychiatric disorders (rg = 0.26 - 0.79). This work demonstrates the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt.

    "abstract": "Computing and memory in living cells are central to encoding next-generation therapies and studying in situ biology, but existing strategies have limited encoding capacity and are challenging to scale. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed a highly scalable, robust and compact platform for encoding logic and memory operations in living bacterial and human cells. This platform, named DOMINO for DNA-based Ordered Memory and Iteration Network Operator, converts DNA in living cells into an addressable, readable, and writable computation and storage medium via a single-nucleotide resolution read-write head that enables dynamic and highly efficient DNA manipulation. We demonstrate that the order and combination of DNA writing events can be programmed by biological cues and multiple molecular recorders can be coordinated to encode a wide range of order-independent, sequential, and temporal logic and memory operations. Furthermore, we show that these operators can be used to perform both digital and analog computation, and record signaling dynamics and cellular states in a long-term, autonomous, and minimally disruptive fashion. Finally, we show that the platform can be functionalized with gene regulatory modules and interfaced with cellular circuits to continuously monitor cellular phenotypes and engineer gene circuits with artificial learning capacities. We envision that highly scalable, compact, and modular DOMINO operators will lay the foundation for building robust and sophisticated synthetic gene circuits for numerous biotechnological and biomedical applications.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA programmable read-write head with single-nucleotide-resolution for genomic DNA enables robust and scalable computing and memory operations in living cells.",

RecBCD enzyme is essential for P. syringae growth at low temperature, and it protects cells from low temperature induced replication arrest. In this study, we show that the RecBCDPs enzyme displays distinct biochemical behaviors. Unlike E. coli RecBCD enzyme, the RecD subunit is indispensable for RecBCDPs function. The RecD motor activity is essential for the Chi-like fragments production in P. syringae, highlighting a distinct role for P. syringae RecD subunit in DNA repair and recombination process. Further, the ssDNA-dependent endonuclease activity is notably absent in RecBCDPs enzyme. Here, we demonstrate that the RecBCDPs enzyme recognizes a unique octameric DNA sequence, 5'-GCTGGCGC-3' (ChiPs) that attenuates nuclease activity of the enzyme when it enters dsDNA from the 3'-end. We propose that the reduced translocation activities manifested by motor-defective mutants cause cold sensitivity in P. syrinage; emphasizing the importance of DNA processing and recombination functions in rescuing low temperature induced replication fork arrest.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Several models have been proposed to explain how eukaryotic cells control the length of their cilia and flagella. Here, we investigated this process in the protist Trypanosoma brucei, an excellent system for cells with stable cilia like photoreceptors or spermatozoa. We show that the total amount of intraflagellar transport material (IFT, the machinery responsible for flagellum construction) increases during flagellum elongation, consistent with constant delivery of precursors and the previously reported linear growth. Reducing the IFT frequency by RNAi knockdown of the IFT kinesin motors slows down the elongation rate and results in the assembly of shorter flagella. These keep on elongating after cell division but fail to reach the normal length. This failure is neither due to an absence of precursors nor to a morphogenetic control by the cell body. We propose that the flagellum is locked after cell division, preventing further elongation or shortening. This is supported by the fact that subsequent increase in the IFT rate does not lead to further elongation. The distal tip FLAM8 protein was identified as a marker for the locking event. It is initiated prior cell division, leading to an arrest of elongation in the daughter cell. Here, we propose a new model termed grow-and-lock where the flagellum elongates until a locking event takes place in a timely defined manner hence fixing length. Alteration in the growth rate and/or in the timing of the locking event would lead to the formation of flagella of different lengths.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic apoptosis is critical for normal physiology including the prevention of tumor formation. BAX and BAK are essential for mediating this process and for the cytotoxic action of many anticancer drugs. BAX and BAK are thought to act in a functionally redundant manner and are considered to be regulated similarly. From an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified VDAC2 (voltage-dependent anion channel 2) as essential for BAX, but not BAK, to function. The genetic deletion of VDAC2 abrogated the association of BAX and BAK with mitochondrial complexes that contain VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3. By disrupting its localization to mitochondria, BAX is rendered completely ineffective. Moreover, we defined an interface unique to VDAC2 that is required to drive BAX activity. Consequently, interfering with this interaction or deleting VDAC2 phenocopied the loss of BAX, including impairing the killing of tumor cells by anti-cancer agents such as the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Furthermore, the ability of BAX to prevent tumor formation was attenuated in the absence of VDAC2. Taken together, our studies show for the first time that BAX-mediated apoptosis, but not BAK-mediated apoptosis, is critically dependent on VDAC2, hence revealing the differential regulation of BAX and BAK.",

They are expressed in overlapping domains along the antero-posterior (A-P) axis of the blastoderm embryo. While gap domains cover the entire length of the A-P axis in Drosophila, there is a region in the blastoderm of the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata, which lacks canonical gap gene expression. Is a non-canonical gap gene functioning in this area? Here, we characterize tarsal-less (tal) in C. albipunctata. The homolog of tal in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (called milles-pattes, mlpt) is a bona fide gap gene. We find that Ca-tal is expressed in the region previously reported as lacking gap gene expression. Using RNA interference, we study the interaction of Ca-tal with gap genes. We show that Ca-tal is regulated by gap genes, but only has a very subtle effect on tailless (Catll), while not affecting other gap genes at all. Moreover, cuticle phenotypes of Ca-tal depleted embryos do not show any gap phenotype. We conclude that Ca-tal is expressed and regulated like a gap gene, but does not function as a gap gene in C. albipunctata.",

    "abstract": "During the development of a multicellular organism, cells coordinate their activities to generate mechanical forces, which in turn drives tissue deformation and eventually defines the shape of the adult tissue. Broadly speaking, it is recognized that mechanical forces can be generated through differential growth and the activity of the cytoskeleton. Based on quantitative analyses of live imaging of the Drosophila dorsal thorax, we suggest a novel mechanism that can generate contractile forces within the plane of an epithelia - via cell proliferation in the absence of growth. Utilizing force inference techniques, we demonstrate that it is not the gradient of junction tension but the divergence of junction-tension associated stresses that induces the area constriction of the proliferating tissue. Using the vertex model simulations, we show that the local averaged stresses can be roughly elevated by a fold of p 2 per cell division without growth. Moreover, this mechanism is robust to disordered cell shapes and the division anisotropy, but can be dominated by growth. In competition with growth, we identify the parameter regime where this mechanism is effective and suggest experiments to test this new mechanism.",

Using a unique combination of high-throughput binding assays and biochemical analyses, HTPP reveals a complex landscape of binding specificity and functional activity for the T7 primase, determined by sequences flanking the primase recognition site. We identified specific features, such as G/T-rich flanks, which increase primase-DNA binding up to 10-fold and, surprisingly, also increase the length of newly formed RNA (up to 3-fold). To our knowledge, variability in primer length has not been reported for this primase. We expect that applying HTPP to additional enzymes will reveal new insights into the effects of DNA sequence composition on the DNA recognition and functional activity of primases.",

Cohesion between epithelial cells provides this key feature. In order to better understand fundamental limits of this cohesion, we study the epithelium mechanics of an ultra-thin (~25 um) primitive marine animal Trichoplax adhaerens, composed essentially of two flat epithelial layers. With no known extra-cellular-matrix and no nerves or muscles, T. adhaerens was claimed the \\\"simplest known living animal\\\", yet is still capable of coordinated locomotion and behavior. Here we report the discovery of the fastest epithelial cellular contractions to date to be found in T. adhaerens dorsal epithelium (50% shrinkage of apical cell area within one second, at least an order of magnitude faster than known examples). Live imaging reveals emergent contractile patterns that are mostly sporadic single-cell events, but also include propagating contraction waves across the tissue. We show that cell contraction speed can be explained by current models of non-muscle actin-myosin bundles without load, while the tissue architecture and unique mechanical properties are softening the tissue, minimizing the load on a contracting cell. We propose a hypothesis, in which the physiological role of the contraction dynamics is to avoid tissue rupture (\\\"active cohesion\\\"), a novel concept that can be further applied to engineering of active materials.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe report the fastest epithelial cell contractions known to date, show they fit the kinematics arising from current cytoskeletal models, and suggest the extreme tissue dynamics is a means to actively avoid rupture.",

Each recruitment mechanism may be associated with distinct motifs and may also result in distinct characteristic patterns in high-resolution protein-DNA binding assays. For example, the ChIP-exo protocol precisely characterizes protein-DNA crosslinking patterns by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with 5 [-&gt;] 3 exonuclease digestion. Since different regulatory complexes will result in different protein-DNA crosslinking signatures, analysis of ChIP-exo tag enrichment patterns should enable detection of multiple protein-DNA binding modes for a given regulatory protein. However, current ChIP-exo analysis methods either treat all binding events as being of a uniform type or rely on motifs to cluster binding events into subtypes.\\n\\nResultsTo systematically detect multiple protein-DNA interaction modes in a single ChIP-exo experiment, we introduce the ChIP-exo mixture model (ChExMix). ChExMix probabilistically models the genomic locations and subtype memberships of binding events using both ChIP-exo tag distribution patterns and DNA motifs. We demonstrate that ChExMix achieves accurate detection and classification of binding event subtypes using in silico mixed ChIP-exo data. We further demonstrate the unique analysis abilities of ChExMix using a collection of ChIP-exo experiments that profile the binding of key transcription factors in MCF-7 cells. In these data, ChExMix identifies possible recruitment mechanisms of FoxA1 and ER, thus demonstrating that ChExMix can effectively stratify ChIP-exo binding events into biologically meaningful subtypes.\\n\\nAvailabilityChExMix is available from https://github.com/seqcode/chexmix\\n\\nContactmahony@psu.edu",

In 2016 the US government updated the results reporting requirements to ClinicalTrials.gov for trials covered under the FDA Amendments Act 2007. We set out to develop and deliver an online tool which publicly monitors compliance with these reporting requirements, facilitates open public audit, and promotes accountability.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a review of the relevant legislation to extract the requirements on reporting results. Specific areas of the statutes were operationalized in code based on the results of our policy review, publicly available data from ClinicalTrials.gov, and communications with ClinicalTrials.gov staff. We developed methods to identify trials required to report results, using publicly available registry data; to incorporate additional relevant information such as key dates and trial sponsors; and to determine when each trial became due. This data was then used to construct a live tracking website.\n\nResultsThere were a number of administrative and technical hurdles to successful operationalization of our tracker. Decisions and assumptions related to overcoming these issues are detailed along with clarifications directly from ClinicalTrials.gov. The FDAAA TrialsTracker was successfully launched in February 2018 and provides users with an overview of results reporting compliance.\n\nDiscussionClinical trials continue to go unreported despite numerous guidelines, commitments, and legal frameworks intended to address this issue. In the absence of formal sanctions from the FDA and others, we argue tools such as ours - providing live data on trial reporting - can improve accountability and performance. In addition, our service helps sponsors identify their own individual trials that have not yet reported results: we therefore offer positive practical support for sponsors who wish to ensure that all their completed trials have reported.",

    "abstract": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) exerts multiple functions on target neurons throughout development. The recent discovery of a point mutation leading to a change from arginine to tryptophan at residue 100 in the mature NGF{beta} sequence (NGFR100W) in patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, type V (HSAN V), made it possible to distinguish the signaling mechanisms that lead to two functionally different outcomes of NGF: trophic versus nociceptive. We performed extensive biochemical, cellular and live imaging experiments to examine the binding and signaling properties of NGFR100W. Our results show that, similar to the wildtype NGF (wtNGF), the naturally occurring NGFR100W mutant was capable of binding to and activating the TrkA receptor and its downstream signaling pathways to support neuronal survival and differentiation. However, NGFR100W failed to bind and stimulate the 75kD neurotrophic factor receptor (p75NTR)-mediated signaling cascades (i.e. the RhoA-Cofilin pathway). Intraplantar injection of NGFR100W into adult rats induced neither TrkA-mediated thermal nor mechanical acute hyperalgesia, but retained the ability to induce chronic hyperalgesia based on agonism for TrkA signaling. Taken together, our studies provide evidence that NGFR100W retains trophic support capability through TrkA and one aspect of its nociceptive signaling, but fails to engage p75NTR signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that wtNGF acts through TrkA to regulate the delayed priming of nociceptive responses. The integration of both TrkA and p75NTR signaling thus appears to regulate neuroplastic effects of NGF in peripheral nociception.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn the present study, we characterized the naturally occurring NGFR100W mutant that is associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, type V. We have demonstrated for the first time that NGFR100W retains trophic support capability through TrkA but fails to engage p75NTR signaling pathways.

We have also provided evidence that the integration of both TrkA-and p75NTR-mediated signaling thus appears to regulate neuroplastic effects of NGF in peripheral nociception. Our study with NGFR100W suggests that it is possible to uncouple trophic effect from nociceptive function, both induced by wildtype NGF.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors have been considered causative agents for schizophrenia (SZ). However, no single gene has been shown responsible for the development of SZ. Furthermore, the pathophysiological roles of environmental factors including psychological stress, autoimmunity, and microbial infection have not been fully understood. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of one of the human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), HERV-W, in SZ. In this study, prevalence of antibodies against the HERV-W Syncytin-1 protein was examined using a newly developed ELISA test. Fifty percent of patients with SZ (24 out of 48 cases) were antibody-positive, with a specificity of greater than 95% (less than 5% of control cases, 3 out of 79). No significant effect of medication was evident, nor did any SZ cases become seropositive after diagnosis. These findings indicate a possible involvement of HERV-W expression in the development of SZ and support its applicability to laboratory diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Here we used mouse models of heart and brain ischemia to compare the inflammatory response to ischemia in the heart, a protein rich organ, to the inflammatory response to ischemia in the brain, a lipid rich organ. We report that ischemia-induced inflammation resolves between 1 and 4 weeks in the heart compared to between 8 and 24 weeks in the brain. Importantly, we discovered that a second burst of inflammation occurs in the brain between 4 and 8 weeks following ischemia, which coincided with the appearance of cholesterol crystals within the infarct. This second wave shares a similar cellular and molecular profile with atherosclerosis and is characterized by high levels of osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In order to test the role of OPN in areas of liquefactive necrosis, OPN-/- mice were subjected to brain ischemia. We found that at 7 weeks following stroke, the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins and MMPs was profoundly reduced in the infarct of the OPN-/- mice, although the number of cholesterol crystals was increased. OPN-/- mice exhibited faster recovery of motor function and a higher number of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) positive cells in the peri-infarct area at 7 weeks following stroke. Based on these findings we propose that the brain liquefies after stroke because phagocytic cells in the infarct are unable to efficiently clear cholesterol rich myelin debris, and that this leads to the perpetuation of an OPN-dependent inflammatory response characterized by high levels of degradative enzymes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe inflammatory response to ischemia in the brain is different to the response to ischemic injury in other organs. In the brain, and for unknown reasons, dead tissue liquefies in response to ischemia by the process of liquefactive necrosis. However, the data we present here demonstrate that there is overlap between the pathophysiology of liquefactive necrosis and atherosclerosis. Specifically, we show that chronic stroke infarcts contain foamy macrophages, cholesterol crystals, high levels of OPN and MMPs, and a similar cytokine profile to atherosclerosis. Therefore, because cholesterol is a central component of myelin, liquefactive necrosis in response to stroke may be caused by an inflammatory response to cholesterol-rich myelin debris that is driven in large part by OPN and MMPs.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained activity patterns, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are thought to reflect underlying neural representations. Multivariate analysis techniques, such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), can be used to test models of brain representation by quantifying the representational geometry (the collection of pair-wise dissimilarities between activity patterns). One important caveat, however, is that non-linearities in the coupling between neural activity and the fMRI signal may lead to significant distortions in the representational geometry estimated from fMRI activity patterns. Here we tested the stability of representational dissimilarity measures in primary sensory-motor (S1 and M1) and early visual regions (V1/V2) across a large range of activation levels. Subjects were visually cued with different letters to perform single finger presses with one of the 5 fingers at a rate of 0.3-2.6 Hz. For each stimulation frequency, we quantified the difference between the 5 activity patterns in M1, S1, and V1/V2. We found that the representational geometry remained stable, even though the average activity increased over a large dynamic range. These results indicate that the representational geometry of fMRI activity patterns can be reliably assessed, largely independent of the average activity in the region. This has important methodological implications for RSA and other multivariate analysis approaches that use the representational geometry to make inferences about brain representations.",

The neurons soma and dendrites are thought to drive the extracellular action potential (EAP), while the axon is usually ignored. However, by recording voltages of single neurons in dissociated rat cortical cultures and Purkinje cells in acute mouse cerebellar slices at hundreds of sites, we find instead that the axon initial segment dominates the EAP, and, surprisingly, the soma shows little or no influence. As expected, this signal has negative polarity (charge entering the cell) and initiates at the distal end. Interestingly, signals with positive polarity (charge exiting the cell) occur near some but not all dendritic branches and occur after a delay. Such basic knowledge about which neuronal compartments contribute to the extracellular voltage field is important for interpreting results from all electrical readout schemes. Moreover, this finding shows that changes in the AIS position and function can be observed in high spatiotemporal detail by means of high-density extracellular electrophysiology.\\n\\nKey points summaryO_LIThe neurons soma and dendrites are thought to give rise to its extracellular voltage signal, while signals from the axon are usually considered negligible.\\nC_LIO_LIInstead, we found that the largest amplitude of the extracellular signal originates from the axon initial segment, not from the soma.\\nC_LIO_LIThis finding shows that changes in the AIS position and function can be observed in high spatiotemporal detail by means of high-density extracellular electrophysiology.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Red cell formation begins with the hematopoietic stem cell, but the manner by which it gives rise to erythroid progenitors, and their subsequent developmental path, remain unclear. Here we combined single-cell transcriptomics of murine hematopoietic tissues with fate potential assays to infer a continuous yet hierarchical structure for the hematopoietic network. We define the erythroid differentiation trajectory as it emerges from multipotency and diverges from 6 other blood lineages. With the aid of a new flow-cytometric sorting strategy, we validated predicted cell fate potentials at the single cell level, revealing a coupling between erythroid and basophil/mast cell fates. We uncovered novel growth factor receptor regulators of the erythroid trajectory, including the proinflammatory IL-17RA, found to be a strong erythroid stimulator; and identified a global hematopoietic response to stress erythropoiesis. We further identified transcriptional and high-purity FACS gates for the complete isolation of all classically-defined erythroid burst-forming (BFU-e) and colony-forming progenitors (CFU-e), finding that they express a dedicated transcriptional program, distinct from that of terminally-differentiating erythroblasts. Intriguingly, profound remodeling of the cell cycle is intimately entwined with CFU-e developmental progression and with a sharp transcriptional switch that extinguishes the CFU-e stage and activates terminal differentiation. Underlying these results, our work showcases the utility of theoretic approaches linking transcriptomic data to predictive fate models, providing key insights into lineage development in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Background. A large animal model of pancreatic cancer would permit development of diagnostic and interventional technologies not possible in murine models, and also would provide a more biologically-relevant platform for penultimate testing of novel therapies, prior to human testing. Here, we describe our initial studies in the development of an autochthonous, genetically-defined, large animal model of pancreatic cancer, using immunocompetent pigs.\\n\\nMethods. Primary pancreatic epithelial cells were isolated from pancreatic duct of domestic pigs; epithelial origin was confirmed with immunohistochemistry. Three transformed cell lines subsequently were generated from these primary cells using expression of oncogenic KRAS and dominant negative p53, with/without knockdown of p16 and SMAD4. We tested these cell lines using in vitro and in vivo assays of transformation and tumorigenesis.\\n\\nResults. The transformed cell lines outperformed the primary cells in terms proliferation, population doubling time, soft agar growth, 2D migration, and Matrigel invasion, with the greatest differences observed when all four genes (KRAS, p53, p16, and SMAD4) were targeted. All three transformed cell lines grew tumors when injected subcutaneously in nude mice, demonstrating undifferentiated morphology, mild desmoplasia, and staining for both epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Injection into the pancreas of nude mice resulted in distant metastases, particularly when all four genes were targeted.\\n\\nConclusions. Tumorigenic porcine pancreatic cell lines were generated. Inclusion of four genetic \\\"hits\\\" (KRAS, p53, p16, and SMAD4) appeared to produce the best results in our in vitro and in vivo assays. The next step will be to perform autologous or syngeneic implantation of these cell lines into the pancreas of immunocompetent pigs. We believe that the resultant large animal model of pancreatic cancer could supplement existing murine models, thus improving preclinical research on diagnostic, interventional, and therapeutic technologies.",

Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multi stability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and the champion of all pairwise competitions may not dominate in a mixed community. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations due to pleiotropy and non-genetic variation, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.",

    "abstract": "Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is an autoinflammatory bone disease. While some patients exhibit bone lesions at single sites, most patients develop chronically active or recurrent bone inflammation at multiple sites, and are then diagnosed with recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Chronic multifocal osteomyelitis (CMO) mice develop IL-1{beta}-driven sterile bone lesions reminscent of severe CRMO. Mechanistically, CMO disease arises due to loss of PSTPIP2, a negative regulator of macrophages, osteoclasts and neutrophils. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential involvement of mast cells in CMO/CRMO disease pathophysiology. Here, we show that mast cells accumulate in the inflamed tissues from CMO mice, and mast cell protease Mcpt1 was detected in the peripheral blood. The role of mast cells in CMO disease was investigated using a transgenic model of connective tissue mast cell depletion (Mcpt5-Cre:Rosa26-Stopfl/fl-DTa) that was crossed with CMO mice. The resulting CMO/MC-mice showed a significant delay in disease onset compared to age-matched CMO mice. At 5-6 months of age, CMO/MC- mice had fewer bone lesions and immune infiltration in the popliteal lymph nodes that drain the affected tail and paw tissues. To test the relevance of mast cells to human CRMO, we tested serum samples from a cohort of healthy controls or CRMO patients at diagnosis. Interestingly, mast cell chymase was elevated in CRMO patients as well as patients with oligoclonal juvenile arthritis. Tryptase-positive mast cells were also detected in bone lesions from CRMO patients as well as patients with bacterial osteomyelitis. Taken together, our results identify mast cells as cellular contributors to bone inflammation in CMO/CRMO. Observations of this study promise potential for mast cells and derived mediators as future biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.",

We investigated the mechanistic links between promoter DNA sequence, nucleosome positioning and transcription. Our results indicate that precise positioning of the transcription start site-associated +1 nucleosome in yeast is critical for efficient TBP binding, and is driven by two key factors, the essential chromatin remodeler RSC and a small set of ubiquitous pioneer transcription factors. We find no evidence for recruitment of RSC by pioneer factors, but show instead that the strength and directionality of RSC action on nucleosomes depends upon the arrangement of two specific DNA motifs that promote its binding and nucleosome displacement activity at promoters. Thus, despite their widespread co-localization, RSC and pioneer factors predominantly act independently to generate accessible chromatin.

    "abstract": "The maximum entropy production (MEP) conjecture posits that systems with many degrees of freedom will likely organize to maximize the rate of free energy dissipation. Previous work indicates that biological systems can outcompete abiotic systems by maximizing free energy dissipation over time by utilizing temporal strategies acquired and refined by evolution, and over space via cooperation. In this study, we develop an MEP model to describe biogeochemistry observed in Siders Pond, a phosphate limited meromictic system located in Falmouth, MA that exhibits steep chemical gradients due to density-driven stratification that supports anaerobic photosynthesis as well as microbial communities that catalyze redox cycles involving O, N, S, Fe and Mn. The MEP model uses a metabolic network to represent microbial redox reactions, where biomass allocation and reaction rates are determined by solving an optimization problem that maximizes entropy production over time and a 1D vertical profile constrained by an advection-dispersion-reaction model. We introduce a new approach for modeling phototrophy and explicitly represent aerobic photoautotrophs, anoxygenic photoheterotrophs and anaerobic photoautotrophs. The metabolic network also includes reactions for heterotrophic bacteria, sulfate reducing bacteria, sulfide oxidizing bacteria and aerobic and anaerobic grazers. Model results were compared to observations of biogeochemical constituents collected over a 24 hour period at 8 depths at a single 15 m deep station in Siders Pond. Maximizing entropy production over long (3 d) intervals produced results more similar to field observations than short (0.25 d) interval optimizations, which support the importance of temporal strategies for maximizing entropy production over time. Furthermore, we found that entropy production must be maximized locally instead of globally where energy potentials are degraded quickly by abiotic processes, such as light absorption by water. This combination of field observations with modeling results show that microbial systems in nature can be accurately described by the maximum entropy production conjecture applied over time and space.",

    "abstract": "The increasing impairment of lotic ecosystems has promoted a growing effort into assessing their ecological status by means of biological indicators. While community-based approaches have proven valuable to assess ecosystem integrity, they mostly reflect long-term changes and might not be suitable for tracking and monitoring short-term events. Responses to rapid changes in environmental conditions have been rarely studied under natural conditions. Biomarkers offer the benefit of integrating biological responses at different time scales. Here we used a field experiment to test how the synthesis of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and Haemoglobin (Hb) in laboratory-reared larvae of Chironomus riparius (Diptera, Chironomidae) were influenced by short-term changes to water temperature and oxygen concentration in a lowland stream. Our aim was to determine whether HSP70 mRNA expression and Hb content could be used as an in situ \\\"early warning system\\\" for freshwater habitats undergoing environmental change. HSP70 exhibited a clear response to changes in temperature measured over a one-day period, confirming its suitability as an indicator of environmental stress. Hb concentration was related to oxygen concentration, but not to temperature. Our findings support the hypothesis that depletion in oxygen induces Hb synthesis in C. riparius larvae. Because tolerance to low oxygen is not only related to total Hb, but also to a more efficient uptake (binding to Hb, e.g. Bohr effect) and release of oxygen to the cell (Root effect), we cannot discern from our data whether increased efficiency played a role. We suggest that C. riparius is a suitable model organism for monitoring sub-lethal stress in the field and that the approach could be applied to other species as more genomic data are available for non-model organisms.",

    "abstract": "5 mediated cytoplasmic RNA decay is a conserved cellular process in eukaryotes. While the functions of the structured core domains in this pathway are understood, the role of abundant intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) is lacking. Here we reconstitute the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex containing a portion of the disordered C-terminus and show its activity is autoinhibited by linear interaction motifs. Enhancers of decapping (Edc) 1 and 3 cooperate to activate decapping by different mechanisms: Edc3 alleviates auto-inhibition by binding IDRs and destabilizing an inactive form of the enzyme, whereas Edc1 stabilizes the transition state for catalysis. Both activators are required to fully stimulate an autoinhibited Dcp1:Dcp2 as Edc1 alone cannot overcome the decrease in activity attributed to the C-terminal extension. Our data provide a mechanistic framework for combinatorial control of decapping by protein cofactors, a principle that is likely conserved in multiple 5 mRNA decay pathways.",

However, measurements of the intrinsic force, velocity and ATPase activityof myosin have not provided a consistent mechanism to link mutations to muscle pathology. An alternative modelpositsthat mutations in myosin affect the stability ofa sequestered, super-relaxed state (SRX) of the proteinwith very slow ATP hydrolysis and thereby change the number of myosin heads accessible to actin. Here, using a combination of biochemical and structural approaches, we show that purified myosin enters aSRX thatcorresponds to a folded-back conformation, which in muscle fibersresults insequestration of heads around the thick filament backbone. Mutations that cause HCM destabilize this state, while the small molecule mavacamtenpromotes it.

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization super-resolution microscopy (SMLM) techniques like STORM and PALM have transformed cellular microscopy by substantially increasing spatial resolution. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for a critical part of the SMLM process: estimating the number and locations of the fluorophores in a single frame. Our algorithm can analyze a 20000-frame experimental 3D SMLM dataset in about one second -- substantially faster than real-time and existing algorithms. Our approach is straightforward but very different from existing algorithms: we train a neural network to minimize the Bayes risk under a generative model for single SMLM frames. The neural network maps a frame directly to a collection of fluorophore locations, which we compare to the ground truth using a novel loss function. While training the neural network takes several hours, it only has to be done once for a given experimental setup. After training, localizing fluorophores in new images is extremely fast -- orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. Faster recovery opens the door to real-time calibration and accelerated acquisition, and future work could tackle more complicated optical systems and more realistic simulators.",

    "abstract": "While Langevin integrators are popular in the study of equilibrium properties of complex systems, it is challenging to estimate the timestep-induced discretization error: the degree to which the sampled phase-space or configuration-space probability density departs from the desired target density due to the use of a finite integration timestep. In [1], Sivak et al. introduced a convenient approach to approximating a natural measure of error between the sampled density and the target equilibrium density, the KL divergence, in phase space, but did not specifically address the issue of configuration-space properties, which are much more commonly of interest in molecular simulations. Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.",

Here, we show that ATR signaling is increased in human cells after depletion of the RNAPII phosphatase PNUTS-PP1, which dephosphorylates RNAPII on Ser 5 of its carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) (pRNAPII S5). Increased ATR signaling was observed in the presence and absence of ionizing radiation or replication stress and even in G1 phase after depletion of PNUTS. Vice versa, ATR signaling was reduced, in a PNUTS dependent manner, after inhibition of the CDK7 kinase mediating pRNAPII S5. Furthermore, CDC73, a well-known RNAPII-CTD binding protein, was required for the high ATR signaling after depletion of PNUTS and co-immunoprecipitated with RNAPII and ATR. These results suggest a novel pathway involving RNAPII, PNUTS-PP1 and CDC73 in ATR signaling and give new insight into the diverse functions of ATR.",

While the pathways governing antero-posterior and dorso-ventral patterning are well conserved among different phyla, divergent mechanisms have been implicated in the specification of LR asymmetry in vertebrates and invertebrates. A cilia-driven, directional fluid flow is important for symmetry breaking in numerous vertebrates, including zebrafish1-10. Alternatively, LR asymmetry can be established independently of motile cilia, notably through the intrinsic chirality of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton11-18. Here we show that MyosiniD (Myo1D), which has been previously identified as a key determinant of LR asymmetry in Drosophila12,13, is essential for the formation and the function of the zebrafish LR Organizer (LRO). We show that Myo1D controls the polarity of LRO cilia and interacts functionally with the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) gene VanGogh-like2 (Vangl2)19, to promote the establishment of a functional LRO flow. Our findings identify Myo1D as the first evolutionarily conserved determinant of LR asymmetry, and show that functional interactions between Myo1D and PCP are central to the establishment of animal LR asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Tau is a developmentally regulated protein found in axons, whose physiological role is to stabilize and bundle microtubules (MTs). Hyper-phosphorylation of tau is thought to cause its detachment from MTs and subsequent aggregation into pathological fibrils that have been implicated in Alzheimers disease pathogenesis. Despite its known MT binding role, there is no consensus regarding which tau residues are crucial for tau-MT interactions, where on the MT tau binds, and how binding results in MT stabilization. We have used cryo-EM to visualize the interaction of different tau constructs with MTs at high resolution (3.2-4.8 [A]) and used computational approaches to generate atomic models of tau-tubulin interactions. Our work shows that the highly conserved tubulin-binding repeats within tau adopt very similar structures in their interactions with the MT. Each tau repeat binds the MT exterior and adopts an extended structure along the crest of the protofilament (PF), interacting with both - and {beta}-tubulin, thus stabilizing the interface between tubulin dimers. Our structures agree with and explain previous biochemical data concerning the effect of phosphorylation on MT affinity and lead to a model in which tau repeats bind in tandem along a PF, tethering together tubulin dimers and stabilizing longitudinal polymerization interfaces. These structural findings could establish a basis of future treatments aiming at the selective stabilization of tau-MT interactions.",

We used affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry and an improved data analysis protocol to obtain the first large-scale quantitative characterization of yeast NMD complexes in yeast (112 experiments). Unexpectedly, we identified two distinct complexes associated with Upf1: Detector (Upf1/2/3) and Effector. Effector contained the mRNA decapping enzyme, together with Nmd4 and Ebs1, two proteins that globally affected NMD and were critical for RNA degradation mediated by the Upf1 C-terminal helicase region.
