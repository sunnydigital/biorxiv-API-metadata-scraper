    "abstract": "We studied the response to aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone and spironolactone of human, chicken, alligator, frog and zebrafish full-length mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and truncated MRs, lacking the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA-binding domain (DBD), in which the hinge domain and ligand binding domain (LBD) were fused to a GAL4-DBD. Compared to full-length MRs, some vertebrate MRs required higher steroid concentrations to activate GAL4-DBD-MR-hinge/LBD constructs. For example, 11-deoxycortisol activated all full-length vertebrate MRs, but did not activate truncated terrestrial vertebrate MRs and was an agonist for truncated zebrafish MR. Progesterone, 19-norProgesterone and spironolactone did not activate full-length and truncated human, alligator and frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs; at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, while retaining activity for truncated zebrafish MRs, evidence that regulation of progestin activation of chicken MR resides in NTD/DBD and of zebrafish MR in hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser810 in human MR, required for its antagonism by progesterone, suggesting novel regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. Progesterone may be a physiological activator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.",

    "abstract": "The limited supply of fossil fuels and the establishment of new environmental policies shifted research in industry and academia towards sustainable production of the 2nd generation of biofuels, with Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) being one promising fuel candidate. MEK is a commercially valuable petrochemical with an extensive application as a solvent. However, as of today, a sustainable and economically viable production of MEK has not yet been achieved despite several attempts of introducing biosynthetic pathways in industrial microorganisms. We used BNICE.ch as a retrobiosynthesis tool to discover all novel pathways around MEK. Out of 1325 identified compounds connecting to MEK with one reaction step, we selected 3-oxopentanoate, but-3-en-2-one, but-1-en-2-olate, butylamine, and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-butanenitrile for further study. We reconstructed 3679610 novel biosynthetic pathways towards these 5 compounds. We then embedded these pathways into the genome-scale model of E. coli, and a set of 18622 were found to be most biologically feasible ones based on thermodynamics and their yields. For each novel reaction in the viable pathways, we proposed the most similar KEGG reactions, with their gene and protein sequences, as candidates for either a direct experimental implementation or as a basis for enzyme engineering. Through pathway similarity analysis we classified the pathways and identified the enzymes and precursors that were indispensable for the production of the target molecules. These retrobiosynthesis studies demonstrate the potential of BNICE.ch for discovery, systematic evaluation, and analysis of novel pathways in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering studies.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/209569_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (27K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15bb5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bfc12borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1230500org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d74d2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe relationship between aging and epigenetic profiles has been highlighted in many recent studies. Models using somatic cell methylomes to predict age have been successfully constructed. However, gamete aging is quite distinct and as such age prediction using sperm methylomes is ineffective with current techniques.\\n\\nResultsWe have produced a model that utilizes human sperm DNA methylation signatures to predict chronological age by utilizing methylation array data from a total of 329 samples. The dataset used for model construction includes infertile patients, sperm donors, and individuals from the general population. Our model is capable of accurately predicting age with an R2 of 0.928 in our test data set. We additionally investigated the repeatability of prediction by processing the same sample on 6 different arrays and found very robust age prediction with an average standard deviation of only 0.877 years. Additionally, we found that smokers have approximately 5% increased age profiles compared to  never smokers.\\n\\nConclusionsThe predictive model described herein was built to offer researchers the ability to assess \\\"germ line age\\\" by accessing sperm DNA methylation signatures at genomic regions affected by age. Our data suggest that this model can predict an individuals chronological age with a high degree of accuracy regardless of fertility status and with a high degree of repeatability. Additionally, our data appear to show age acceleration patterns as a result of smoking suggesting that the aging process in sperm may be impacted by environmental factors, though this effect appears to be quite subtle.",

    "abstract": "Behaviour is the ultimate output of an animals nervous system and choosing the right action at the right time can be critical for survival. The study of the organisation of behaviour in its natural context, ethology, has historically been a primarily qualitative science. A quantitative theory of behaviour would advance research in neuroscience as well as ecology and evolution. However, animal posture typically has many degrees of freedom and behavioural dynamics vary on timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, presenting both technical and conceptual challenges. Here we review 1) advances in imaging and computer vision that are making it possible to capture increasingly complete records of animal motion and 2) new approaches to understanding the resulting behavioural data sets. With the right analytical approaches, these data are allowing researchers to revisit longstanding questions about the structure and organisation of animal behaviour and to put unifying principles on a quantitative footing. Contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are leading to the emergence of a physics of behaviour and the prospect of discovering laws and developing theories with broad applicability. We believe that there now exists an opportunity to develop theories of behaviour which can be tested using these data sets leading to a deeper understanding of how and why animals behave.",

    "abstract": "Life on Earth was dominated by bacteria for billions of years1. About 600 million years ago, animal life emerged and micro-organisms played a crucial role in shaping animal development, physiology and evolution2-4. The two partners committed to a symbiotic relationship that persists in nearly all animals today. Such beneficial interactions are pervasive throughout nature and have been extensively characterized5,6. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that drive the emergence and evolution of the symbiont benefits to their animal hosts remain largely elusive. Here we show that the host nutritional environment, instead of the host, is a predominant driving force in this evolutionary process and we identify a mechanism resulting from the bacterial adaptation to the diet, which confers improved functional benefit to the host. By applying experimental evolution to a model of host-bacteria beneficial symbiosis: Drosophila melanogaster associated with Lactobacillus plantarum, one of its growth promoting symbiotic bacteria7,8, we found that the de novo mutations in the same acetate kinase (ackA) locus invariably emerge first, rapidly become fixed, and such evolution occurs with or without the host. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ackA mutations trigger the increased production of N-acetyl-glutamine, which is sufficient to confer improved host growth capabilities to the evolved bacterial strains. Our study therefore identifies a specific mechanism by which a symbiotic bacterium increases its benefit to its animal host and reveals that adaptation to the host diet is a foremost step in the determination of the evolutionary course of symbiosis between an animal and its gut microbes.",

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy type 1 (Na-1) and 2 (Na-2) are characterized by an inability to sustain wakefulness and are likely caused by degeneration of orexin neurons. Near complete orexin neurodegeneration depletes orexin-A from the cerebrospinal fluid and produces Na-1. The pathophysiology of Na-2 is less understood, but has been hypothesized to be due to less extensive loss of orexin neurotransmission. The orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A mouse allows conditional control over the extent and timing of orexin neurodegeneration. To evaluate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, orexin-A positive cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes (determined by piezoelectric monitoring) were correlated within individual mice after different protocols of diet-controlled neurodegeneration. Partial ablations that began during the first 8 days of study were 14% larger than partial ablations induced during the last 8 days of study, six weeks later and prior to sacrifice of all mice, suggesting orexin-A positive cell death continued despite the resumption of conditions intended to keep orexin neurons intact. Sleep/wake of mice with 71.0% orexin-A positive cell loss, initiated at the beginning of study, resembled that of orexin-intact controls more than mice with near complete neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with 56.6% orexin-A positive cell loss, created at the end of study, had sleep/wake phenotypes that were similar to those of mice with near complete orexin-A positive cell loss. Collectively, these results suggest that compensatory wake-promotion develops in mice that have some critical portion of their orexinergic system remaining after partial ablation.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2 is poorly understood but has been hypothesized to be due, at least in part, to degeneration of a smaller proportion of the orexin neuronal field than occurs in narcolepsy type 1. To evaluate a transgenic mouse model of narcolepsy type 2, we correlated the sleep/wake phenotypes of individual, male and female adult mice that received diet-induced conditional ablations of orexin neurons with their orexin cell counts. Using a translatable measure of narcolepsy sleepiness severity, we demonstrated that compensatory wake-promoting responses developed in mice concurrent with progressive orexin neurodegeneration. These results provide important details necessary for preclinical drug discovery for therapeutic areas characterized by orexin insufficiency, such as narcolepsy, Parkinsons disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Transformations between sensory representations are shaped by neural mechanisms at the cellular and the circuit level. In the insect olfactory system encoding of odor information undergoes a transition from a dense spatio-temporal population code in the antennal lobe to a sparse code in the mushroom body. However, the exact mechanisms shaping odor representations and their role in sensory processing are incompletely identified. Here, we investigate the transformation from dense to sparse odor representations in a spiking model of the insect olfactory system, focusing on two ubiquitous neural mechanisms: spike-frequency adaptation at the cellular level and lateral inhibition at the circuit level. We find that cellular adaptation is essential for sparse representations in time (temporal sparseness), while lateral inhibition regulates sparseness in the neuronal space (population sparseness). The interplay of both mechanisms shapes dynamical odor representations, which are optimized for discrimination of odors during stimulus onset and offset. In addition, we find that odor identity is stored on a prolonged time scale in the adaptation levels but not in the spiking activity of the principal cells of the mushroom body, providing a testable hypothesis for the location of the so-called odor trace.",

    "abstract": "Small animals use sensory information to navigate their environment in order to reach more favorable conditions. in gradients of light, temperature, odors and CO2, Drosophila larvae alternate periods of runs and turns, regulating the frequency size and direction of turns, to move in a favorable direction. Whether larvae use the same strategies when navigating in response to somatosensory input is unknown. Further, while many of the sensory neurons that mediate navigation behaviors have been described, where and how these navigational strategies are implemented in the central nervous system and controlled by neuronal circuit elements is not well known. Here we characterize for the first time the navigational strategies of Drosophila larvae in gradients of air-current speeds using high-throughput behavioral assays and quantitative behavioral analysis. We find that larvae extend runs towards favorable directions and shorten runs in unfavorable directions, and that larvae regulate both the direction and amplitudes of turns. These results suggest similar central decision-making mechanisms underlie navigation behaviors in somatosensory and other sensory modalities. By silencing the activity of individual neurons and very sparse expression patterns (2 or 3 neuron types), we further identify the sensory neurons and circuit elements in the ventral nerve cord and brain of the larva required for navigational decisions during anemotaxis. The phenotypes of these central neurons are consistent with a mechanism where the increase of the turning rate in unfavorable conditions and decrease in turning rate in favorable conditions are independently controlled. In addition, we find phenotypes that suggest that the decisions of whether and which way to turn are controlled independently. Our study reveals that different neuronal modules in the nerve cord and brain mediate different aspects of navigational decision making. The neurons identified in our screen provide a basis for future detailed mechanistic understanding of the circuit principles of navigational decisionmaking.",

However, the underlying synaptic and cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. While synaptically released acetylcholine (ACh) can recruit nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) expressed in distinct types of interneurons, previous work has not defined a clear role for muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) in the fast cholinergic control of cortical activity. To address this question, we employed a slice model of cortical activity and used optogenetics to selectively activate cholinergic afferents. We found that transient ACh increases led to a rapid and persistent suppression of cortical activity, mediated by mAChRs in layer 4 and by nAChRs in layer 2/3. Furthermore, mAChR-dependent cholinergic control was mediated at least in part by a short-latency and long-lasting inhibition of layer 4 excitatory neurons. Thus, the activation of postsynaptic mAChRs is central to the flexible cholinergic control of cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia is a common disorder linked with adverse long-term medical and psychiatric outcomes, but underlying pathophysiological processes and causal relationships with disease are poorly understood. Here we identify 57 loci for self-reported insomnia symptoms in the UK Biobank (n=453,379) and confirm their impact on self-reported insomnia symptoms in the HUNT study (n=14,923 cases, 47,610 controls), physician diagnosed insomnia in Partners Biobank (n=2,217 cases, 14,240 controls), and accelerometer-derived measures of sleep efficiency and sleep duration in the UK Biobank (n=83,726). Our results suggest enrichment of genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, phototransduction and muscle development pathways and of genes expressed in multiple brain regions, skeletal muscle and adrenal gland. Evidence of shared genetic factors is found between frequent insomnia symptoms and restless legs syndrome, aging, cardio-metabolic, behavioral, psychiatric and reproductive traits. Evidence is found for a possible causal link between insomnia symptoms and coronary heart disease, depressive symptoms and subjective well-being.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe identify 57 genomic regions associated with insomnia pointing to the involvement of phototransduction and ubiquitination and potential causal links to CAD and depression.",

The range of sequences that CRISPR endonucleases can recognize, however, is constrained by the need for a specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target site. In this study, we demonstrate the natural PAM plasticity of a highly-similar, yet previously uncharacterized, Cas9 from Streptococcus canis (ScCas9) through rational manipulation of distinguishing motif insertions. To this end, we report a divergent affinity to 5-NNGT-3 PAM sequences and demonstrate the editing capabilities of the ortholog in both bacterial and human cells. Finally, we build an automated bioinformatics pipeline, the Search for PAMs by ALignment Of Targets (SPAMALOT), which further explores the microbial PAM diversity of otherwise-overlooked Streptococcus Cas9 orthologs. Our results establish that ScCas9 can be utilized both as an alternative genome editing tool and as a functional platform to discover novel Streptococcus PAM specificities.",

Our results can thus be used to find an optimal retention time prediction algorithm for specific analytes or protocols.

    "abstract": "Translational biomedical research is generating exponentially more data: thousands of whole-genome sequences (WGS) are now available; brain data are doubling every two years. Analyses of Big Data, including imaging, genomic, phenotypic, and clinical data, present qualitatively new challenges as well as opportunities. Among the challenges is a proliferation in ways analyses can fail, due largely to the increasing length and complexity of processing pipelines. Anomalies in input data, runtime resource exhaustion or node failure in a distributed computation can all cause pipeline hiccups that are not necessarily obvious in the output. Flaws that can taint results may persist undetected in complex pipelines, a danger amplified by the fact that research is often concurrent with the development of the software on which it depends. On the positive side, the huge sample sizes increase statistical power, which in turn can shed new insight and motivate innovative analytic approaches. We have developed a framework for Big Data Quality Control (BDQC) including an extensible set of heuristic and statistical analyses that identify deviations in data without regard to its meaning (domain-blind analyses). BDQC takes advantage of large sample sizes to classify the samples, estimate distributions and identify outliers. Such outliers may be symptoms of technology failure (e.g., truncated output of one step of a pipeline for a single genome) or may reveal unsuspected \\\" signal\\\" in the data (e.g., evidence of aneuploidy in a genome). We have applied the framework to validate real-world WGS analysis pipelines. BDQC successfully identified data outliers representing various failure classes, including genome analyses missing a whole chromosome or part thereof, hidden among thousands of intermediary output files. These failures could then be resolved by reanalyzing the affected samples. BDQC both identified hidden flaws as well as yielded new insights into the data. BDQC is designed to complement quality software development practices. There are multiple benefits from the application of BDQC at all pipeline stages. By verifying input correctness, it can help avoid expensive computations on flawed data. Analysis of intermediary and final results facilitates recovery from aberrant termination of processes. All these computationally inexpensive verifications reduce cryptic analytical artifacts that could seriously preclude clinical-grade genome interpretation.

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing is rapidly being adopted in reference labs and hospitals for bacterial outbreak investigation and diagnostics where time is critical. Seven gene multi-locus sequence typing is a standard tool for broadly classifying samples into sequence types, allowing, in many cases, to rule a sample in or out of an outbreak, or allowing for general characteristics about a bacterial strain to be inferred. Long read sequencing technologies, such as from PacBio or Oxford Nanopore, can produce read data within minutes of an experiment starting, unlike short read sequencing technologies which require many hours/days. However, the error rates of raw uncorrected long read data are very high. We present Krocus which can predict a sequence type directly from uncorrected long reads, and which was designed to consume read data as it is produced, providing results in minutes. It is the only tool which can do this from uncorrected long reads. We tested Krocus on over 600 samples sequenced with using long read sequencing technologies from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. It provides sequence types on average within 90 seconds, with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 97%, directly from uncorrected raw sequence reads.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe last decade has witnessed dramatic improvements in whole-genome sequencing capabilities coupled to drastically decreased costs, leading to an inundation of high-quality de novo genomes. For this reason, continued development of genome quality metrics is imperative. The current study utilized the recently updated Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) genome and annotation to evaluate a proteomics-based metric of genome accuracy.\\n\\nResultsProteomic analysis of six tissues provided experimental confirmation of 10 402 proteins from 4 711 protein groups, almost 1/3 of the possible predicted proteins in the genome. There was an increased median molecular weight and number of identified peptides per protein using the current T. truncatus annotation versus the previous annotation. Identification of larger proteins with more identified peptides implied reduced database fragmentation and improved gene annotation accuracy. A metric is proposed, NP10, that attempts to capture this quality improvement. When using the new T. truncatus genome there was a 21 % improvement in NP10. This metric was further demonstrated by using a publicly available proteomic data set to compare human genome annotations from 2004, 2013 and 2016, which had a 33 % improvement in NP10.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate that new whole-genome sequencing techniques can rapidly generate high quality de novo genome assemblies and emphasizes the speed of advancing bioanalytical measurements in a non-model organism. Moreover, proteomics may be a useful metrological tool to benchmark genome accuracy, though there is a need for reference proteomic datasets to facilitate this utility in new de novo and existing genomes.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions. However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity.\\n\\nResults: Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.\\n\\nAvailability: Source code and preprocessed datasets are at: http://snap.stanford.edu/decagon.\\n\\nContact: jure@cs.stanford.edu",

The requirement of attachment bone for the appearance of replacement teeth has been hypothesized but not yet investigated. The transcription factor sp7 (osterix) is known in mammals to play an important role during odontoblast differentiation and root formation. Here we study tooth replacement in the absence of attachment bone using sp7 zebrafish mutants. We analysed the pattern of tooth replacement at different stages of development and demonstrated that in zebrafish lacking sp7, attachment bone is never present, independent of the stage of tooth development or fish age, yet replacement is not interrupted. Without bone of attachment we observed abnormal orientation of teeth, and abnormal connection of pulp cavities of predecessor and replacement teeth. Mutants lacking sp7 show arrested dentinogenesis, with non-polarization of odontoblasts and only a thin layer of dentin deposited. Osteoclast activity was observed in sp7 mutants; due to the lack of bone of attachment, remodelling was diminished but nevertheless present along the pharyngeal bone. We conclude that tooth replacement is ongoing in the sp7 mutant despite poor differentiation and defective attachment. Without bone of attachment tooth orientation and pulp organization are compromised.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale diversity data are increasingly available in a variety of biological systems, and can be used to reconstruct the past evolutionary history of species divergence. However, extracting the full demographic information from these data is not trivial, and requires inferential methods that account for the diversity of coalescent histories throughout the genome. Here, we evaluate the potential and limitations of one such approach. We reexamine a well-known system of mussel sister species, using the joint site frequency spectrum (jSFS) of synonymous mutations computed either from exome capture or RNA-seq, in an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We first assess the best sampling strategy (number of: individuals, loci, and bins in the jSFS), and show that model selection is robust to variation in the number of individuals and loci. In contrast, different binning choices when summarizing the joint site frequency spectrum, strongly affect the results: including classes of low and high frequency shared polymorphisms can more effectively reveal recent migration events. We then take advantage of the flexibility of ABC to compare more realistic models of speciation, including variation in migration rates through time (i.e. periodic connectivity) and across genes (i.e. genome-wide heterogeneity in migration rates). We show that these models were consistently selected as the most probable, suggesting that mussels have experienced a complex history of gene flow during divergence and that the species boundary is semi-permeable. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of ABC demographic inference in mussels based on the coding site frequency spectrum, and supplies guidelines for employing different sequencing techniques and sampling strategies. We emphasize, perhaps surprisingly, that inferences are less limited by the volume of data, than by the way in which they are analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we discovered that a member of the Saccharibacteria/TM7 phylum (strain TM7x) isolated from the human oral cavity, has an ultra-small cell size (200-300nm), a highly reduced genome (705 Kbp) with limited de novo biosynthetic capabilities, and a very novel lifestyle as an obligate epibiont on the surface of another bacterium 1. There has been considerable interest in uncultivated phyla, particularly those that are now classified as the proposed candidate phyla radiation (CPR) reported to include 35 or more phyla and are estimated to make up nearly 15% of the domain Bacteria. Most members of the larger CPR group share genomic properties with Saccharibacteria including reduced genomes (<1Mbp) and lack of biosynthetic capabilities, yet to date, strain TM7x represents the only member of the CPR that has been cultivated and is one of only three CPR routinely detected in the human body. Through small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene surveys, members of the Saccharibacteria phylum are reported in many environments as well as within a diversity of host species and have been shown to increase dramatically in human oral and gut diseases. With a single copy of the 16S rRNA gene resolved on a few limited genomes, their absolute abundance is most often underestimated and their potential role in disease pathogenesis is therefore underappreciated. Despite being an obligate parasite dependent on other bacteria, six groups (G1-G6) are recognized using SSU rRNA gene phylogeny in the oral cavity alone. At present, only genomes from the G1 group, which includes related and remarkably syntenic environmental and human oral associated representatives1, have been uncovered to date. In this study we systematically captured the spectrum of known diversity in this phylum by reconstructing completely novel Class level genomes belonging to groups G3, G6 and G5 through cultivation enrichment and/or metagenomic binning from humans and mammalian rumen. Additional genomes for representatives of G1 were also obtained from modern oral plaque and ancient dental calculus. Comparative analysis revealed remarkable divergence in the host-associated members across this phylum. Within the human oral cavity alone, variation in as much as 70% of the genes from nearest oral clade (AAI 50%) as well as wide GC content variation is evident in these newly captured divergent members (G3, G5 and G6) with no environmental relatives. Comparative analyses suggest independent episodes of transmission of these TM7 groups into humans and convergent evolution of several key functions during adaptation within hosts. In addition, we provide evidence from in vivo collected samples that each of these major groups are ultra-small in size and are found attached to larger cells.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is an incurable age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by irreversible progressive cognitive deficits and extensive brain damage. The identification of candidate biomarkers before beta amyloid plaque deposition occurs is therefore of great importance for the early intervention of AD. Urine, which is not regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, theoretically accumulates changes associated with AD earlier than cerebrospinal fluid and blood. In this study, an APP (swe)/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mouse model was used to identify candidate biomarkers for early AD. Urine samples were collected from 4-, 6-, and 8-month-old transgenic mouse models, and the urinary proteomes were profiled using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The levels of 33 proteins differed significantly between wild-type and 4-month-old mice, which had not started to deposit beta amyloid plaque. Among these proteins, 16 have been associated with the mechanisms of AD, while 9 have been suggested as AD biomarkers. Our results indicated that urine proteins enable detecting AD before beta amyloid plaque deposition, which may present an opportunity for intervention.",

    "abstract": "In pursuit of palatable food, hungry animals mobilize significant energy resources and overcome obstacles, exhaustion and fear. Their perseverance depends on metabolic state, internal motivation and the expected benefit. Sustained commitment to a trying task is crucial, however, disengagement from one behavior to engage into another can be essential for optimal adaptation and survival. How neural circuits allow prioritizing perseverance over withdrawal based on the animals need is not understood. Using a single fly spherical treadmill, we show that hungry flies display increasing perseverance to track a food odor in the repeated absence of the predicted food reward. While this perseverance is mediated by a group of dopaminergic neurons, a subset of neurons expressing octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, provide reward feedback and counteract dopamine-motivated food seeking. Our data and modeling suggest that two important neuromodulators tally internal and external signals to coordinate motivation-dependent antagonistic behavioral drives: perseverance vs. change of behavior.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=87 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/259119_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (21K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9833e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7616d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d4e8bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc615c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LILack of reward stimulates perseverance, and not quitting.\\nC_LIO_LIDopaminergic neurons previously implicated in aversive learning promote perseverance.\\nC_LIO_LISugar responsive octopaminergic neurons directly counteract perseverant odor tracking through a downstream inhibitory neuron.\\nC_LIO_LIComputational modeling supports a simple neural circuit featuring antagonistic functions for dopamine and octopamine as tallies of expense and gain.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Eumycetoma is a chronic infectious disease characterized by a large subcutaneous mass, often caused by the fungus Madurella mycetomatis. A combination of surgery and prolonged medication is needed to treat this infection with a success rate of only 30%. There is, therefore, an urgent need to find more effective drugs for the treatment of this disease. In this study, we screened 800 diverse drug-like molecules and identified 215 molecules that were active in vitro. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for the 13 most active compounds. One of the most potent compounds, a fenarimol analogue for which a large analogue library is available, led to the screening of an additional 35 compounds for their in vitro activity against M. mycetomatis hyphae, rendering four further hit compounds. To assess the in vivo potency of these hit compounds, a Galleria mellonella larvae model infected with M. mycetomatis was used. Several of the compounds identified in vitro demonstrated promising efficacy in vivo in terms of prolonged larval survival and/or reduced fungal burden. The results presented in this paper are the starting point of an Open Source Mycetoma (MycetOS) approach in which members of the global scientific community are invited to participate and contribute as equal partners. We hope that this initiative, coupled with the promising new hits we have reported, will lead to progress in drug discovery for this most neglected of neglected tropical diseases.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMycetoma is a poverty-associated disease that was recently recognised as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This disease can be caused by either bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). The most common causative agent of mycetoma is the fungus Madurella mycetomatis. Actinomycetoma can be easily treated, but for eumycetoma, the current and only antifungal drug used is only able to successfully treat 30% of patients. Treatment often involves prolonged medication use and amputation of the affected area. This disease is disfiguring and is a social stigma for patients in endemic countries. To improve treatment for patients, we have looked at over 800 diverse drug-like molecules and compounds in hope to develop new drugs in this study. We have identified 215 compounds with activity against M. mycetomatis in vitro and several in vivo with our Galleria mellonella larvae model. We have chosen an open source approach with this study and placed our findings in an online database and made it available to the public. We invite the global scientific community to participate in our study and contribute as equal partners as long as an open source approach is held in hopes to fast track and boost drug discovery for Eumycetoma.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium parasite, a representative member of phylum Apicomplexa is a causative agent of malaria in human as well as other animals. To infect host cells, Plasmodium first finds receptors on the host cell surface, then binds specifically, and finally penetrates host cell membrane to acquire the host cellular resources. The motility for moving on the cell surface is equipped by the precise and tight control of actin treadmill. Several regulators are required to achieve precision and robustness in the control of actin treadmill. However, the mechanistic detail of the treadmill regulatory network and the cross-talk among regulators are not well understood. We developed a stochastic model of treadmill regulation and explored the dynamics of filament growth, nucleation time, and elongation time. Our study mainly highlighted on how and what helps cells to maintain an average size of the actin filaments within a species. This is particularly important, since, excessive growth of filament can lead to cell lysis. Moreover, we also explore how the regulators interact to fine-tune the control elements in the actin treadmill.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of changes in protein levels and in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can be highly informative about the phenotypic consequences of genetic differences or about the dynamics of cellular processes. Typically, such proteomic profiles are interpreted intuitively or by simple correlation analysis. Here, we present a computational method to generate causal explanations for proteomic profiles using prior mechanistic knowledge in the literature, as recorded in cellular pathway maps. To demonstrate its potential, we use this method to analyze the cascading events after EGF stimulation of a cell line, to discover new pathways in platelet activation, to identify influential regulators of oncoproteins in breast cancer, to describe signaling characteristics in predefined subtypes of ovarian and breast cancers, and to highlight which pathway relations are most frequently activated across 32 cancer types. Causal pathway analysis, that combines molecular profiles with prior biological knowledge captured in computational form, may become a powerful discovery tool as the amount and quality of cellular profiling rapidly expands.

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) treatment represents one of the largest unmet medical needs. Developing drugs capable of preventing A{beta} aggregation is an excellent approach to prevent and treat AD. Here, we show that gallic acid (GA), a naturally occurring polyphenolic small molecule rich in grape seeds and fruits, has the capacity to alleviate cognitive decline of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse through reduction of A{beta}1-42 aggregation and neurotoxicity. Oral administration of GA not only improved the spatial reference memory and spatial working memory of early stage AD mice (4-month-old), but also significantly reduced the more severe deficits in spatial learning, reference memory, short-term recognition and spatial working memory of the late stage AD mice (9-month-old). The hippocampal long-term-potentiation (LTP) was also significantly elevated in the GA-treated late stage APP/PS1 AD mice. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence densitometry analyses showed that GA can reduce A{beta}1-42 aggregation from forming toxic oligomers and fibrils. Indeed, pre-incubating GA with oligomeric A{beta}1-42 reduced A{beta} 1-42-mediated intracellular calcium influx and neurotoxicity. Molecular docking studies identified that the 3,4,5-hydroxyle groups of GA were essential in noncovalently stabilizing GA binding to the Lys28-Ala42 salt bridge and the -COOH group is critical for disrupting the salt bridge of A{beta}1-42. The predicated covalent interaction through Schiff-base formation between the carbonyl group of the oxidized product and {varepsilon}-amino group of Lys16 is also critical for the disruption of A{beta}1-42 S-shaped triple-{beta}-motif and toxicity. Together, these studies demonstrated that GA can prevent and protect the AD brain through disrupting A{beta}1-42 aggregation.",

    "abstract": "During spring, utilising multiple cues allow temperate tree species to coordinate their bud burst and leaf out, at the right moment to capitalise on favourable conditions for photosynthesis. Whilst the effect of blue light (400-500nm) has been shown to increase percentage bud burst of axillary shoots of Rosa sp, the effects of blue light on spring-time bud burst of temperate deciduous tree species has not previously been reported. We tested the hypotheses that blue light would advance spring bud burst in temperate tree species, and that late-successional species would respond more than early-successional species, whos bud burst is primarily determined by temperature. The bud development of Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, and Quercus robur branches, cut from dormant trees, was monitored under two light treatments of equal photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and temperature, either with or without blue light, under controlled environmental conditions. In the presence of blue light, the mean time required to reach 50% bud burst was reduced by 3.3 days in Betula pendula, 6 days in Alnus glutinosa, and 6.3 days in Quercus robur. This result highlights the potential of the blue region of the solar spectrum to be used as an extra cue that could help plants to regulate their spring phenology, alongside photoperiod and temperature. Understanding how plants combine photoreceptor-mediated cues with other environmental cues such as temperature to control phenology is essential if we are to accurately predict how tree species might respond to climate change.\\n\\nKey MessageAn LED spectrum containing blue light advanced bud burst in branches of Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Quercus robur compared with a spectrum without blue light in a controlled environment.",

Our analysis of conservation revealed many exon-skipping events conserved between mice and humans. In addition, our splicing signature comparison analysis using the psoriasis datasets and our curated splicing factor perturbation RNA-Seq database, SFMetaDB, identified nine candidate splicing factors that may be important in regulating splicing in the psoriasis mouse model dataset. Three of the nine splicing factors were confirmed upon analyzing the human data. Our computational methods have generated predictions for the potential role of splicing in psoriasis. Future experiments on the novel candidates predicted by our computational analysis are expected to provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of psoriasis and to pave the way for new therapeutic treatments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTrombidid mites have a unique lifecycle in which only the larval stage is ectoparasitic. In the superfamily Trombiculoidea (\\\"chiggers\\\"), the larvae feed preferentially on vertebrates, including humans. Species in the genus Leptotrombidium are vectors of a potentially fatal bacterial infection, scrub typhus, which affects 1 million people annually. Moreover, chiggers can cause pruritic dermatitis (trombiculiasis) in humans and domesticated animals. In the Trombidioidea (velvet mites), the larvae feed on other arthropods and are potential biological control agents for agricultural pests. Here, we present the first trombidid mites genomes, obtained both for a chigger, Leptotrombidium deliense, and for a velvet mite, Dinothrombium tinctorium.\\n\\nResultsSequencing was performed using Illumina technology. A 180 Mb draft assembly for D. tinctorium was generated from two paired-end and one mate-pair library using a single adult specimen. For L. deliense, a lower-coverage draft assembly (117 Mb) was obtained using pooled, engorged larvae with a single paired-end library. Remarkably, both genomes exhibited evidence of ancient lateral gene transfer from soil-derived bacteria or fungi. The transferred genes confer functions that are rare in animals, including terpene and carotenoid synthesis. Thirty-seven allergenic protein families were predicted in the L. deliense genome, of which nine were unique. Preliminary proteomic analyses identified several of these putative allergens in larvae.\\n\\nConclusionsTrombidid mite genomes appear to be more dynamic than those of other acariform mites. A priority for future research is to determine the biological function of terpene synthesis in this taxon and its potential for exploitation in disease control.",

Here we used GDC-0152, a small molecule IAP inhibitor, to explore how IAPs participate in glioblastoma stem-like cell maintenance and fate under both hypoxic and normoxic environments. In hypoxia, IAPs inhibition triggered stem-like cells apoptosis and decreased proliferation in four human glioblastoma cell lines, whereas in normoxia it induced a loss of stemness and differentiation. In addition, we characterized a 3D glioblastoma spheroid model. By using MALDI images we validated that GDC-0152 penetrates in the entire sphere. TOF-SIMS analyses revealed an oxygen gradient correlated with spatial cellular heterogeneity with proliferative and apoptotic cells located close to the hypoxic core and GFAP+ cells at the periphery. Notably, Serine-Threonine Kinases activation analysis revealed that oxygen level affects signaling pathways activated by GDC-0152. In hypoxia, IAPs inhibition activated ATR whereas in normoxia it activated NF-{kappa}B.

    "abstract": "The patterning of peripheral innervation is accomplished through the tissue expression, in specific space and timeframe, of attractive or repulsive axonal guidance cues. At the bone microenvironment, neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, netrin-1 and others were described to regulate the nerve ingrowth towards the bone compartment, by acting directly on receptors expressed at the nerve terminals. Interestingly, besides the gradient of soluble factors, neurons were described to be responsive to extracellular vesicles (EV) derived from myelinating cells and mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nHere we provide evidence on a new mechanism by which peripheral innervation can be coordinated. We show that sensory nerves outgrowth and electric signal propagation are dependent on the EV secreted by osteoclasts, the bone resorbing cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the axonal sprouting is achieved through the activation of epidermal-growth factor receptor (EGFR) family signaling pathway. We proved that the EV-depleted osteoclast secretome leads to a significant decrease of neurons firing rate and axonal sprouting, concomitant with a decrease of EGFR/ErbB2 activation levels. Excitingly, the proteomic analysis of the osteoclast-derived EV cargo shows a high correlation with synaptic components reinforcing the role on sensory neurons/osteoclast crosstalk.\n\nOur findings that osteoclast-derived EV hold effect in axonal outgrowth, contributing actively to the dynamics of the sensory neurons sprouting and electrophysiology, is a step toward unraveling target mechanisms to control electrical signal propagation and nerve fibers sprouting and consequently open new avenues for the development of innovative therapies to control bone pain.\n\nSignificance StatementSensory nerve fibers sprouting in bone pathologies is highly associated with pain. Thus, understanding the mechanisms behind sensory nerves ingrowth, sprouting and electrical activity, within the bone compartment, is essential for improving the strategies to overcome pain in bone disorders. We provide a new mechanism on the sensory nerves sprouting, indicating that the effect is dependent on the extracellular vesicles (EV) released by osteoclasts, through the epidermal growth factor receptor family targeting, by integrin independent pathways. We show different electrophysiology patterns being triggered in the presence of osteoclasts secretome and the abolishment of sensory neurons firing rate in EV-depleted conditions. Overall, our results elucidate novel mechanisms on the peripheral nerves sprouting, essential for pursuing new targets for bone pain therapies.",

    "abstract": "CLIC4 is a cytosolic protein implicated in diverse actin-based processes, including integrin trafficking, cell adhesion and tubulogenesis. CLIC4 is rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane by G12/13-coupled receptor agonists and then partly co-localizes with {beta}1 integrins. Receptor-mediated CLIC4 translocation depends on actin polymerization, but the mechanism and functional significance of CLIC4 trafficking are unknown. Here we show that RhoA activation by either LPA or EGF is necessary and sufficient for CLIC4 translocation, with a regulatory role for the RhoA effector mDia2, an inducer of actin polymerization. We find that CLIC4 directly interacts with the G-actin-binding protein Profilin-1 via conserved residues that are required for CLIC4 trafficking and lie in a concave surface. Consistently, silencing of Profilin-1 impaired CLIC4 trafficking induced by either LPA or EGF. CLIC4 knockdown promoted the formation of long integrin-dependent filopodia, a phenotype rescued by wild-type CLIC4 but not by trafficking-incompetent CLIC4(C35A). Our results establish CLIC4 as a Profilin-1-binding protein and suggest that CLIC4 translocation provides a feedback mechanism to modulate mDia2/Profilin-1-driven cortical actin assembly and membrane protrusion.",

Unlike most pro-apoptotic Bax family members, Bax{Delta}2 mediates cell death through a non-mitochondrial caspase 8-dependent pathway. In the scope of analyzing the distribution of Bax{Delta}2 expression in human tissues, we examined a panel of human brain samples. Here, we report 4 cerebellar cases in which the subjects had no neurological disorder or disease documented. We found Bax{Delta}2 positive cells scattered in all areas of the cerebellum, but most strikingly concentrated in Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites. Two out the four subjects tested had strong Bax{Delta}2- positive staining in nearly all Purkinje cells; one was mainly negative; and one had various levels of positive staining within the same sample. Further genetic analysis of the Purkinje cell layer, collected by microdissection from two subjects, showed that the samples contained G7 and G9 Bax microsatellite mutations. Both subjects were young and had no diseases reported at the time of death. As the distribution of Bax{Delta}2 is consistent with that known for Baxa, but in a less ubiquitous manner, these results may imply a potential function of Bax{Delta}2 in Purkinje cells.",

    "abstract": "Many areas of biological research rely heavily on fluorescence microscopy to observe and quantify the inner workings of the cell. Traditionally, multiple types of cellular structures or biomolecules are visualized simultaneously with spectrally distinct fluorescent labels. A high degree of multiplexing is desirable as it affords the experiment greater information content, speeding up research timelines. Multiplexing can be increased by imaging a larger number of spectral channels, however, the wide emission spectra of most fluorophores limits multiplexing to four or five labels in standard fluorescence microscopes. Further multiplexing requires another dimension of contrast. Here, we show that photostability differences can be used to distinguish between fluorescent labels. By combining photobleaching characteristics with a novel unmixing algorithm, we resolve up to three fluorescent labels in a single spectral channel and unmix fluorescent labels with nearly identical emission spectra. We apply our technique to organic dyes, autofluorescent biomolecules and fluorescent proteins, and show that the latter are particularly well suited to our method as their bleaching is often reversible. Our approach has the potential to triple the multiplexing capabilities of any digital widefield or confocal fluorescence microscope with no additional hardware, making it readily accessible to a wide range of researchers.",

    "abstract": "The three dimensional organization of chromosomes within the cell nucleus is highly regulated. It is known that CTCF is an important architectural protein to mediate long-range chromatin loops. Recent studies have shown that the majority of CTCF binding motif pairs at chromatin loop anchor regions are in convergent orientation. However, it remains unknown whether the genomic context at the sequence level can determine if a convergent CTCF motif pair is able to form chromatin loop. In this paper, we directly ask whether and what sequence-based features (other than the motif itself) may be important to establish CTCF-mediated chromatin loops. We found that motif conservation measured by \\\"branch-of-origin\\\" that accounts for motif turn-over in evolution is an important feature. We developed a new machine learning algorithm called CTCF-MP based on word2vec to demonstrate that sequence-based features alone have the capability to predict if a pair of convergent CTCF motifs would form a loop. Together with functional genomic signals from CTCF ChIP-seq and DNase-seq, CTCF-MP is able to make highly accurate predictions on whether a convergent CTCF motif pair would form a loop in a single cell type and also across different cell types. Our work represents an important step further to understand the sequence determinants that may guide the formation of complex chromatin architectures.",

    "abstract": "The preservation of germ cell sexual identity is essential for gametogenesis. Here we show that H3K9me3-mediated gene silencing is integral to female fate maintenance in Drosophila germ cells. Germ cell-specific loss of the H3K9me3 pathway members, the trimethyltransferase SETDB1, its binding partner WDE, and the H3K9 binding protein HP1a, cause the inappropriate expression of testis genes. SETDB1 is required for H3K9me3 accumulation on a select subset of the silenced testis genes. Interestingly, these SETDB1-dependent H3K9me3 domains are highly localized and do not spread into neighboring loci. Regional deposition is especially striking at the phf7 locus, a key regulator of male germ cell sexual fate. phf7 is primarily regulated by alternative promoter usage and transcription start site (TSS) selection. We find H3K9me3 accumulation is restricted to the silenced testis-specific TSS region in ovaries. Furthermore, its recruitment to phf7 and repression of the testis-specific transcript is dependent on the female sex determination gene Sxl. These findings demonstrate that female identity is secured by a pathway in which Sxl is the upstream female-specific regulator, SETDB1 is the required chromatin writer and phf7 is one of the critical SETDB1 target genes. This function of SETDB1 is unrelated to its canonical role in piRNA biogenesis and silencing of transposable elements. Collectively our findings support a novel model in which female fate is preserved by deposition of H3K9me3 repressive marks on key spermatogenesis genes and suggest that this strategy for securing cell fate may be widespread.",

In order to further understand the Xist locus in reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), we tested transcription-factor-like effectors (TALE)-based designer transcriptional factors (dTFs), which were specific to numerous regions at the Xist locus. We report that the selected dTF repressor 6 (R6) binding the intron 1 of Xist, which did not affect Xist expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), substantially improved the iPSC generation and the SCNT preimplantation embryo development. Conversely, the dTF activator targeting the same genomic region of R6 decreased iPSC formation, and blocked SCNT-embryo development. These results thus uncover the critical requirement for the Xist locus in epigenetic resetting, which is not directly related to Xist transcription. This may provide a unique route to improving the reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "One of the most fundamental rules of molecular evolution is that the rate of neutral evolution equals the mutation rate and is independent of effective population size. This result lies at the heart of the Neutral Theory, and is the basis for numerous analytic approaches that are widely applied to infer the action of natural selection across the genome and through time, and for dating divergence events using the molecular clock. However, this result was derived under the assumption that evolution is strongly mutation-limited, and it has not been known whether it generalizes across the range of mutation pressures or the spectrum of mutation types observed in natural populations. Validated by both simulations and exact computational analyses, we present a direct and transparent theoretical analysis of the Wright-Fisher model of population genetics, which shows that some of the most important rules of molecular evolution are fundamentally changed by considering recurrent mutations full effect. Surprisingly, the rate of the neutral molecular clock is found to have population-size dependence and to not equal the mutation rate in general. This is because, for increasing values of the population mutation rate parameter ({theta}), the time spent waiting for mutations quickly becomes smaller than the cumulative time mutants spend segregating before a substitution, resulting in a net deceleration compared to classical theory that depends on the population mutation rate. Furthermore, selection exacerbates this effect such that more adaptive alleles experience a greater deceleration than less adaptive alleles, introducing systematic bias in a wide variety of methods for inferring the strength and direction of natural selection from across-species sequence comparisons. Critically, the classical weak mutation approximation performs well only when{theta} < 0.1, a threshold that many biological populations seem to exceed.",

In evolutionary game theory, models of fixation have typically focused on fixed population sizes and frequency-dependent selection. A combination of demographic fluctuations with frequency-dependent interactions such as Lotka-Volterra dynamics has received comparatively little attention. We consider a stochastic, competitive Lotka-Volterra model with higher order interactions between two traits. The emerging individual based model allows for stochastic fluctuations in the frequencies of the two traits and the total population size. We calculate the fixation probability of a trait under differing competition coefficients. This fixation probability resembles qualitatively the deterministic evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, we partially disentangle the selection effects into their ecological and evolutionary components. We find that changing the evolutionary selection strength also changes the population dynamics and vice versa. Thus, a clean separation of the ecological and evolutionary effects is not possible. The entangled eco-evolutionary processes thus cannot be ignored when determining fixation properties in a co-evolutionary system.",

Using a very conservative approach we estimated an origin of butterflies at 107.6 Ma, approximately equivalent to the Early Cretaceous-Late Cretaceous boundary, with a credibility interval ranging from 89.5 Ma (mid Late Cretaceous) to 129.5 Ma (mid Early Cretaceous).

Given that actin-based cell protrusions can exert mechanical forces on their environment and Notch receptor activation is mechanically sensitive, how might cytoskeletal contractility contribute to Notch signaling? We identify a pool of basal non-muscle myosin II (myosin II) that regulates protrusion dynamics, promotes Notch signaling, and is required in signal sending and receiving cells for Notch-dependent patterning. We show that interactions between protrusions are extensive and subject to actomyosin contractility. The effects of reducing myosin II activity are more pronounced for protrusion-mediated signaling than for signaling at lateral cell contacts.

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that the percentage of naive T cells and diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire decrease with age, with some findings likewise suggesting that increased repertoire diversity may be associated with longer lifespan and healthy aging. In this work, we have analyzed peripheral TCR diversity from humans, mice, and blind mole-rats (Spalax spp.)--long-lived, hypoxia- and cancer-tolerant rodents. We employed a quantitative approach to TCR repertoire profiling based on 5RACE with unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to achieve accurate comparison of repertoire diversity, which also required development of specific wet lab protocol and TCR gene reference for Spalax. Our direct comparison reveals a striking phenomenon. Whereas TCR diversity of mice and humans decreases with age, resulting primarily from the shrinkage of the naive T cell pool, Spalax TCR diversity remains stable even for the animals that reach extreme old age (15-17 years). This indicates that T cell immunity does not meaningfully age in long-lived rodents, at least in terms of the classical understanding of immunosenescence, which is associated with the accumulation of large numbers of memory clones. We suggest that the extraordinary longevity of Spalax may be attributable at least in part to the distinctive organization of their T cell immunity. Our findings should therefore encourage a close re-examination of the contribution of immunosenescence to life span in mammals.",

    "abstract": "The ability to erect rationally-engineered reproductive barriers in animal or plant species promises to enable a number of biotechnological applications such as the creation of genetic firewalls, the containment of gene drives or novel population replacement and suppression strategies for genetic control. However, to date no experimental data exist that explores this concept in a multicellular organism. Here we examine the requirements for building artificial reproductive barriers in the metazoan model Drosophila melanogaster by combining CRISPR-based genome editing and transcriptional transactivation (CRISPRa) of the same loci. We directed 13 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to the promoters of 7 evolutionary conserved genes and used 11 drivers to conduct a miss-activation screen. We identify dominant-lethal activators of the eve locus and find that they disrupt development by strongly activating eve outside its native spatio-temporal context. We employ the same set of sgRNAs to isolate, by genome editing, protective INDELs that render these loci resistant to transactivation without interfering with target gene function. When these sets of genetic components are combined we find that complete synthetic lethality, a prerequisite for most applications, is achievable using this approach. However, our results suggest a steep trade-off between the level and scope of dCas9 expression, the degree of genetic isolation achievable and the resulting impact on fly fitness. The genetic engineering strategy we present here allows the creation of single or multiple reproductive barriers and could be applied to other multicellular organisms such as disease vectors or transgenic organisms of economic importance.",

    "abstract": "Identifying (hyper)active kinases in cancer patient tumors is crucial to enable individualized treatment with specific inhibitors. Conceptually, kinase activity can be gleaned from global protein phosphorylation profiles obtained with mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics. A major challenge is to relate such profiles to specific kinases to identify (hyper)active kinases that may fuel growth/progression of individual tumors. Approaches have hitherto focused on phosphorylation of either kinases or their substrates. Here, we combine kinase-centric and substrate-centric information in an Integrative Inferred Kinase Activity (INKA) analysis. INKA utilizes label-free quantification of phosphopeptides derived from kinases, kinase activation loops, kinase substrates deduced from prior experimental knowledge, and kinase substrates predicted from sequence motifs, yielding a single score. This multipronged, stringent analysis enables ranking of kinase activity and visualization of kinase-substrate relation networks in a biological sample. As a proof of concept, INKA scoring of phosphoproteomic data for different oncogene-driven cancer cell lines inferred top activity of implicated driver kinases, and relevant quantitative changes upon perturbation. These analyses show the ability of INKA scoring to identify (hyper)active kinases, with potential clinical significance.",
