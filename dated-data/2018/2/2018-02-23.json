    "abstract": "There is a strong need for procedures that enable context and application dependent validation of antibodies. Here we describe the foundation for a resource aiding more detailed assessment antibody selectivity for capturing endogenous proteins from human plasma. In 414 immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments with EDTA plasma, data was generated by mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with 157 antibodies (targeting 120 unique proteins). Out of a total of 1,313 unique proteins, 426 proteins (33%) were detected in > 20% of the assays and indicate a background comprised of mainly proteins from the complement system. For all proteins identified either in heat-treated or untreated EDTA plasma, frequencies of occurrence were derived. We determined z-scores for each IP as a measure of enrichment to annotate the antibodies into four categories (ON-target, CO-target, OFF-target and NO-target). For 45% (70/157) of the tested antibodies, the expected target proteins were enriched (z-score [&ge;]3) above background. There were 84% (59/70) of binders that co-enriched other proteins beside the intended target, either due to OFF-target binding or predicted interactions. Comparing several antibodies raised against IGFBP2, the established library allowed us to describe protein complexes in plasma, and we employed multiplexed sandwich immunoassays to confirm these. In summary, the generated resource of plasma enrichment profiles and background proteins adds a very useful and yet lacking starting point for the assessment of antibody selectivity in this clinically important body fluid. The provided insights will contribute to a more informed use of validated affinity reagents and may lead to further advancements of plasma proteomics assays.",

    "abstract": "Despite a dramatic increase in our ability to catalogue variation among pathogen genomes, we have made far fewer advances in using this information to identify targets of protective immunity. We propose a novel methodology that combines predictions from epidemiological models with phylogenetic and structural analyses to identify such targets. Epidemiological models predict that strong immune selection can cause antigenic variants to exist in non-overlapping combinations. A corollary of this theory is that targets of immunity may be identified by searching for non-overlapping associations among antigenic variants. We applied this concept to the AMA-1 protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and found strong signatures of immune selection among certain regions of low variability which could render them ideal vaccine candidates.",

Variations in cell-substrate adhesion strengths can be probed through biophysical measurements of cell detachment from substrates upon the application of an external force. Here, we investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the detachment of cells adhered to substrates when these cells are subjected to fluid shear. We present a theoretical framework within which we calculate the fraction of detached cells as a function of shear stress for fast ramps as well as for the decay in the fraction of detached cells at fixed shear stress as a function of time. Using HEK and 3T3 fibroblast cells as experimental model systems, we extract characteristic force scales for cell adhesion as well as characteristic detachment times. We estimate force-scales of ~ 500 pN associated to a single focal contact, and characteristic time-scales of 190 [&le;]{tau} [&le;] 350s representing cell-spread-area dependent mean first passage times to the detached state at intermediate values of the shear stress. Variations in adhesion across cell types are especially prominent when cell detachment is probed by applying a time-varying shear stress.

    "abstract": "A key challenge in quantitative ChIP-seq is the normalisation of data in the presence of genome-wide changes in occupancy. Analysis-based normalisation methods were developed for transcriptomic data and these are dependent on the underlying assumption that total transcription does not change between conditions. For genome-wide changes in transcription factor binding, these assumptions do not hold true. The challenges in normalisation are confounded by experimental variability during sample preparation, processing, and recovery.\\n\\nWe present a novel normalisation strategy utilising an internal standard of unchanged peaks for reference. Our method can be readily applied to monitor genome-wide changes by ChIP-seq that are otherwise lost or misrepresented through analytical normalisation. We compare our approach to normalisation by total read depth and two alternative methods that utilise external experimental controls to study transcription factor binding. We successfully resolve the key challenges in quantitative ChIP-seq analysis and demonstrate its application by monitoring the loss of Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) binding upon fulvestrant treatment, ER binding in response to estrodiol, ER mediated change in H4K12 acetylation and profiling ER binding in Patient-Derived Xenographs. This is supported by an adaptable pipeline to normalise and quantify differential transcription factor binding genome-wide and generate metrics for differential binding at individual sites.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/182261_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (46K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177285borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa7d79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@43d17forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6eff8d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGRAPHICAL ABSTRACTC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., J. Mol. Biol., 406:228-256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody-antigen complexes, using two design strategies - optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody-antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAntibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to attack infections and cancer and are also used as drugs to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. The mechanism that has evolved to produce them is able to make 10s of millions of different antibodies, each with a different surface used to bind the foreign or mutated molecule. We have developed a method to design antibodies computationally, based on the 1000s of experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of antibodies available. The method works by treating pieces of these structures as a collection of parts that can be combined in new ways to make better antibodies. Our method has been implemented in the protein modeling program Rosetta, and is called RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD). We tested RAbD both computationally and experimentally. The experimental test shows that we can improve existing antibodies by 10 to 50 fold, paving the way for design of entirely new antibodies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Almost every cell in the human body extends a primary cilium. Defective cilia function leads to a set of disorders known as ciliopathies characterised by debilitating developmental defects affecting many tissues. Here we report a new role for regulator of calcineurin 2, RCAN2, in primary cilia function. It localises to centrioles and the basal body and is required to maintain normal cilia length. RCAN2 was identified as the most strongly upregulated gene from a comparative RNAseq analysis of cells in which expression of the Golgi matrix protein giantin had been abolished by gene editing. In contrast to previous work where we showed that depletion of giantin by RNAi results in defects in ciliogenesis and in cilia length control, giantin knockout cells generate normal cilia on serum withdrawal. Furthermore, giantin knockout zebrafish show increased expression of RCAN2. Importantly, suppression of RCAN2 expression in giantin knockout cells results in the same defects in cilia length control seen on RNAi of giantin itself. Together these data define RCAN2 as a regulator of cilia function that can compensate for loss of giantin function.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary rescue describes a situation where adaptive evolution prevents the extinction of a population facing a stressing environment. Models of evolutionary rescue could in principle be used to predict the level of stress beyond which extinction becomes likely for species of conservation concern, or conversely the treatment levels most likely to limit the emergence of resistant pests or pathogens. Stress levels are known to affect both the rate of population decline (demographic effect) and the speed of adaptation (evolutionary effect), but the latter aspect has received less attention. Here, we address this issue using Fishers Geometric Model of adaptation. In this model, the fitness effects of mutations depend both on the genotype and the environment in which they arise. In particular, the model introduces a dependence between the level of stress, the proportion of rescue mutants, and their costs before the onset of stress. We obtain analytic results under a strong-selection-weak-mutation regime, which we compare to simulations. We show that the effect of the environment on evolutionary rescue can be summarized into a single composite parameter quantifying the effective stress level, which is amenable to empirical measurement. We describe a narrow characteristic stress window over which the rescue probability drops from very likely to very unlikely as the level of stress increases. This drop is sharper than in previous models, as a result of the decreasing proportion of stress-resistant mutations as stress increases. We discuss how to test these predictions with rescue experiments across gradients of stress.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genome evolution is characterized by gains, losses, and rearrangements of functional genetic segments. The extent to which genotype-phenotype relationships are influenced by large-scale genomic alterations has not been investigated in a high-throughput manner. In the symbiotic soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, the genome is composed of a chromosome and two large extrachromosomal replicons (pSymA and pSymB, which together constitute 45% of the genome). Massively parallel transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) was employed to evaluate contributions of chromosomal genes to fitness in both the presence and absence of these extrachromosomal replicons. Ten percent of chromosomal genes from diverse functional categories are shown to genetically interact with pSymA and pSymB. These results demonstrate the pervasive robustness provided by the extrachromosomal replicons, which is further supported by constraint-based metabolic modelling. A comprehensive picture of core S. meliloti metabolism was generated through a Tn-seq-guided in silico metabolic network reconstruction, producing a core network encompassing 726 genes. This integrated approach facilitated functional assignments for previously uncharacterized genes, while also revealing that Tn-seq alone misses over a quarter of wild type metabolism. This work highlights the strong functional dependencies and epistatic relationships that may arise between bacterial replicons and across a genome, while also demonstrating how Tn-seq and metabolic modelling can be used together to yield insights not obtainable by either method alone.",

Here, we examined training-dependent and off-line changes of two sub-processes of procedural learning: namely, sequence learning and statistical learning. Whereas sequence learning requires the acquisition of order-based relationships between the elements of a sequence, statistical learning is based on the acquisition of probabilistic associations between elements. Seventy-eight healthy young adults (58 females and 20 males) completed the modified version of the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task that was designed to measure Sequence and Statistical Learning simultaneously. After training, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: active wakefulness, quiet rest, or daytime sleep. We examined off-line changes in Sequence and Statistical Learning as well as further improvements after extended practice. Performance in Sequence Learning increased during training, while Statistical Learning plateaued relatively rapidly. After the off-line period, both the acquired sequence and statistical knowledge was preserved, irrespective of the vigilance state (awake, quiet rest or sleep). Sequence Learning further improved during extended practice, while Statistical Learning did not. Moreover, within the sleep group, cortical oscillations and sleep spindle parameters showed differential associations with Sequence and Statistical Learning. Our findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes of multiple parallel learning and consolidation processes that occur during procedural memory formation.",

The current literature on the axonal structure is based on the analysis of two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections, which, as we demonstrate, is precarious. To be able to quantify three-dimensional (3D) axonal morphology, we developed a novel pipeline for automated 3D segmentation and morphometric analysis (ACSON) of the white matter ultrastructure. The automated pipeline eliminates the need for time-consuming manual segmentation of 3D datasets. ACSON segments myelin, myelinated and unmyelinated axons, mitochondria, cells and vacuoles, and analyzes the morphology of axons. We applied the pipeline to serial block-face scanning electron microscopy images of the corpus callosum of sham-operated (n = 2) and brain injured (n = 3) rats 5 months after the injury. The 3D morphometry showed that axonal cross-sections were elliptic rather than spherical, and their diameter varied substantially along axons. It also showed a significant reduction in the axonal diameter of the ipsilateral corpus callosum of rats 5 months after brain injury, indicating ongoing axonal alterations even at this chronic time-point.",

Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL>=3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCultured neuronal networks are widely used to study and characterize neuronal network activity. Among the many uses of neuronal cultures are the capabilities to evaluate neurotoxicity and the effects of pharmacological compounds on cellular physiology. Multi-well microelectrode arrays (MEAs) can collect high-throughput data from multiple neuronal cultures simultaneously, and thereby make possible hypotheses-driven inquiries into neurobiology and neuropharmacology. The analysis of MEA-derived information presents many computational challenges. High frequency data recorded simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes can be difficult to handle. The need to compare network activity across various drug treatments or genotypes recorded on the same plate from experiments lasting several weeks presents another challenge. These challenges inspired us to develop meaRtools; an MEA data analysis package that contains new methods to characterize network activity patterns, which are illustrated here using examples from a genetic mouse model of epilepsy. Among the highlights of meaRtools are novel algorithms designed to characterize neuronal activity dynamics and network properties such as bursting and synchronization, options to combine multiple recordings and use a robust statistical framework to draw appropriate statistical inferences, and finally data visualizations and plots. In summary, meaRtools provides a platform for the analyses of singular and longitudinal MEA experiments.",

Cell identities of samples derived from heterogeneous subpopulations are routinely determined by clustering of scRNA-seq data. Computational cell identities are then used in downstream analysis, feature selection, and visualization. However, how can we examine if cell identities are accurately inferred? To this end, we introduce non-parametric methods to evaluate cell identities by testing cluster memberships of single cell samples in an unsupervised manner. We propose posterior inclusion probabilities for cluster memberships to select and visualize samples relevant to subpopulations. Beyond simulation studies, we examined two scRNA-seq data - a mixture of Jurkat and 293T cells and a large family of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrated probabilistic feature selection and improved t-SNE visualization.

    "abstract": "Molecular competition is ubiquitous, essential and multifunctional throughout diverse biological processes. Competition brings about trade-offs of shared limited resources among the cellular components, and it thus introduce a hidden layer of regulatory mechanism by connecting components even without direct physical interactions. By abstracting the analogous competition mechanism behind diverse molecular systems, we built a unified coarse-grained competition motif model to systematically compare experimental evidences in these processes and analyzed general properties shared behind them. We could predict in what molecular environments competition would reveal threshold behavior or display a negative linear dependence. We quantified how competition can shape regulator-target dose-response curve, modulate dynamic response speed, control target expression noise, and introduce correlated fluctuations between targets. This work uncovered the complexity and generality of molecular competition effect, which might act as a hidden regulatory mechanism with multiple functions throughout biological networks in both natural and synthetic systems.",

    "abstract": "Human Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) is an acute phase protein with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Infection models in hGIIA transgenic mice have suggested the importance of hGIIA as an innate defense mechanism against the human pathogens Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Compared to other Gram-positive bacteria, GAS is remarkably resistant to hGIIA activity. To identify GAS resistance mechanisms, we exposed a highly saturated GAS M1 transposon library to recombinant human hGIIA and compared relative mutant abundance with library input through transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq). Based on transposon prevalence in the output library, we identified nine genes, including dltA and lytR, conferring increased hGIIA susceptibility. In addition, seven genes conferred increased hGIIA resistance, which included two genes, gacH and gacI that are located within the Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) gene cluster. Using GAS 5448 wild-type and the isogenic gacI mutant and gacI-complemented strains, we demonstrate that loss of the GAC N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chain in the{Delta} gacI mutant increases hGIIA resistance approximately 10-fold, a phenotype that is conserved across different GAS serotypes. Increased resistance is associated with delayed penetration of hGIIA through the cell wall. Correspondingly, loss of the Lancefield Group B Carbohydrate (GBC) rendered GBS significantly more resistant to hGIIA-mediated killing. This suggests that the streptococcal Lancefield antigens, which are critical determinants for streptococcal physiology and virulence, are required for the human bactericidal enzyme hGIIA to exert its bactericidal function.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe human immune system is capable of killing invading bacteria by secreting antimicrobial proteins. Cationic human Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) is especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria by degrading the bacterial membrane. HGIIA requires binding to negatively charged surface structures before it can penetrate through the thick peptidoglycan layer and reach the target phospholipid membrane. HGIIA is constitutively expressed at high concentrations at sites of possible bacterial entry, e.g. in tears, skin and small intestine. In serum, normal concentrations are low but can increase up to 1,000-fold upon inflammation or infection. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments suggest an important role for hGIIA in defense against two human pathogens, Group A and Group B Streptococcus (GAS, GBS). We demonstrate that the Lancefield cell wall polysaccharides that are expressed by these bacteria, the Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) for GAS and the Group B Carbohydrate (GBC) for GBS, are required for optimal hGIIA bactericidal efficacy by facilitating penetration through the peptidoglycan layer. Given the increased hGIIA resistance of antigen-modified or antigen-deficient streptococci, it will be of interest to determine potential regulatory mechanisms regarding expression of streptococcal Lancefield polysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "Scientists reuse figure elements sometimes appropriately, e.g. when comparing methods, and sometimes inappropriately, e.g. when presenting an old experiment as a new control. To understand such reuse, automatically detecting it would be important. Here we present an analysis of figure element reuse on a large dataset comprising 760 thousand open access articles and 2 million figures. Our algorithm detects figure region reuse, while being robust to rotation, cropping, resizing, and contrast changes, and estimates which of the reuses have biological meaning. Then a three-person panel analyzes how problematic these biological reuses are using contextual information such as captions and full texts. Based on the panel reviews, we estimate that 9% of the biological reuses would be unanimously perceived as at least suspicious. We further estimate that 0.6% of all articles would be unanimously perceived as fraudulent, with inappropriate reuses occurring 43% across articles, 28% within article, and 29% within a figure. Our tool rapidly detects image reuse at scale, promising to be useful to a broad range of people that campaign for scientific integrity. We suggest that a great deal of scientific fraud will be, sooner or later, detectable by automatic methods.",

Previous studies brought to light a role for the phosphorylated Pol II CTD in activation of co-transcriptional capping; however, CTD phosphorylation alone could not account for the observed magnitude of activation. Here, we exploit a defined Pol II transcription system that supports both CTD phosphorylation and robust activation of capping to dissect the mechanism of co-transcriptional capping.

We focused on rare pathogenic variants found in the ClinVar database and used penalized logistic regression to identify genes in which such variants are enriched in cases. All statistical tests were two-sided.\\n\\nResultsWe observed an overall enrichment of rare, deleterious germline variants in Fanconi Anemia genes in cases with SqCC (joint analysis OR=3.08, p=1.4e-09, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.2-4.3). Consistent with previous studies, BRCA2 in particular exhibited an increased overall burden of rare, deleterious variants (joint OR=3.2, p=8.7e-08, 95% CI=2.1-4.7). More importantly, rare deleterious germline variants were enriched in Fanconi Anemia genes even without the BRCA2 rs11571833 variant that is strongly enriched in lung SqCC cases (joint OR=2.76, p=7.0e-04, 95% CI=1.6-4.7).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings can be used towards the development of a genetic diagnostic test in the clinic to identify SqCC high-risk individuals, who can benefit from personalized programs, improving prognosis.",

However, we have little knowledge of how the gut microbiome is colonised and develops in non-model organisms, and to what extent microbial diversity and specific taxa influence changes in fitness-related traits. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to describe the successional development of the faecal microbiota in juvenile ostriches (Struthio camelus; n = 71) over their first three months of life, during which time a five-fold difference in weight was observed. We found a gradual increase in microbial diversity with age, an overall convergence in community composition among individuals, multiple colonisation and extinction events, and major taxonomic shifts coinciding with the cessation of yolk absorption. In addition, we discovered significant but complex associations between juvenile growth and microbial diversity, and identified distinct bacterial groups that had positive (Bacteroidaceae) and negative (Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae) correlations with the growth of individuals at specific ages. These results have broad implications for our understanding of the development of gut microbiota and its association with juvenile growth.",

In lung EIT the identification of the breath phases is central for generating tidal impedance variation images, subsequent data analysis and clinical evaluation. The optimisation of these algorithms is particularly important in neonatal care since the existing breath detectors developed for adults may give insufficient reliability in neonates due to their very irregular breathing pattern.\\n\\nApproachOur approach is generic in the sense that it relies on the definition of a gold standard and the associated definition of detector sensitivity and specificity, an optimisation criterion and a set of detector parameters to be investigated. The gold standard has been defined by 11 clinicians with previous experience with EIT and the performance of our approach is described and validated using a neonatal EIT dataset acquired within the EU-funded CRADL project.\\n\\nMain resultsThree different algorithms are proposed that are improving the breath detector performance by adding conditions on 1) maximum tidal breath rate obtained from zero-crossings of the EIT breathing signal, 2) minimum tidal impedance amplitude and 3) minimum tidal breath rate obtained from Time-Frequency (TF) analysis.\\n\\nSignificanceBased on the gold standard, the most crucial parameters of the proposed algorithms are optimised by using a simple exhaustive search and a weighted metric defined in connection with the Receiver Operating Characterics (ROC). This provides a practical way to achieve any desirable trade-off between the sensitivity and the specificity of the detectors.",

The M1-potentiation of NMDAR masked a previously unknown coincident TRPV1-mediated long-term depression (LTD). In addition, strong pharmacological activation of M1 mAChR induced canonical retrograde LTD, mediated by presynaptic CB1R. In the fmr1-/y mouse model of Fragile X, we found that CB1R but not TRPV1 M1-LTD was impaired. Finally, pharmacological blockade of the degradation of anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, the two principal eCBs restored fmr1-/y LTD to wild type levels.

    "abstract": "Gene duplication and loss contribute to gene content differences as well as phenotypic divergence across species. However, the extent to which gene content varies among closely related plant species and the factors responsible for such variation remain unclear. Here, we used the Solanaceae family as a model to investigate differences in gene family size and the likely factors contributing to these differences. We found that genes in highly variable families have high turnover rate and tend to be involved in processes that have diverged between Solanaceae species, whereas genes in low-variability families tend to have housekeeping roles. In addition, genes in high-and low-variability gene families tend to be duplicated by tandem and whole genome duplication, respectively. This finding together with the observation that genes duplicated by different mechanisms experience different selection pressures suggests that duplication mechanism impacts gene family turnover. We explored using pseudogene number as a proxy for gene loss but discovered that a substantial number of pseudogenes are actually products of pseudogene duplication, contrary to the expectation that most plant pseudogenes are remnants of once-functional duplicates. Our findings reveal complex relationships between variation in gene family size, gene functions, duplication mechanism, and evolutionary rate. The patterns of lineage-specific gene family expansion within the Solanaceae provide the foundation for a better understanding of the genetic basis underlying phenotypic diversity in this economically important family.",

    "abstract": "Most organisms transcript and protein level only moderately correlate for various reasons, such as regulation of transcription and protein degradation. Better prediction and understanding the correlation between gene expression and protein abundance has been possible by harnessing the matching RNA/protein datasets produced by modern high-throughput RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry methods. In this work, we have utilized some well-studied matching RNA/protein datasets, and explored for the first time a bi-clustering method to cluster genes that have consistent correlation patterns between gene expression and protein abundance. The clustering results have been interpreted from the perspective of both transcriptomic and proteomic features, which show that mRNA half-life, protein half-life and protein structure in concert significantly affect the correlation of gene expression and protein abundance. With these and other carefully selected features, a prediction model based on individual clusters, called Cluster-based Linear prediction Model (CLM), was built and tested on mouse liver mitochondrial, mouse brainstem mitochondrial, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Danio rerio datasets. CLM could find genes for which protein abundance can be predicted from mRNA data. In summary, based on bi-clustering, feature selection and CLM model, we have established a new and valuable cluster-based protein abundance prediction method.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTranscriptomic profiling classifies pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) into several molecular subtypes with distinctive histological and clinical characteristics. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that define each subtype and their correlation with clinical outcome. Mutant KRAS is the most prominent driver in PDAC, present in over 90% of tumors, but the dependence of tumors on oncogenic KRAS signaling varies between subtypes. In particular, squamous subtype are relatively independent of oncogenic KRAS signaling and typically display much more aggressive clinical behavior versus progenitor subtype. Here, we identified that YAP1 activation is enriched in the squamous subtype and associated with poor prognosis. Activation of YAP1 in progenitor subtype cancer cells profoundly enhanced malignant phenotypes and transformed progenitor subtype cells into squamous subtype. Conversely, depletion of YAP1 specifically suppressed tumorigenicity of squamous subtype PDAC cells. Mechanistically, we uncovered a significant positive correlation between WNT5A expression and the YAP1 activity in human PDAC, and demonstrated that WNT5A overexpression led to YAP1 activation and recapitulated YAP1-dependent but Kras-independent phenotype of tumor progression and maintenance. Thus, our study identifies YAP1 oncogene as a major driver of squamous subtype PDAC and uncovers the role of WNT5A in driving PDAC malignancy through activation of the YAP pathway.",

However such a focus often neglects the stochastic events that individuals experience throughout their lives that also influence survival and reproduction. With an illustrative example, we quantify and illustrate the influence of such non-selective demographic variability on population dynamics using size-structured matrix models of an experimental population of Plantago lanceolata. Our analysis shows that variation in survival and reproduction among individuals explained by environment, genes, and their interaction was modest compared to the stochastic variation in lifespan and reproduction. We illustrate how expectations on population growth, based on expected lifetime reproduction and generation time, can be misleading when variance in reproduction among individuals of the same genotype (full sibs) was large. Such large within genotype variance can lower population growth, fitness. Our results accompany recent investigations that call for more focus on stochastic variation in survival and reproduction, rather than dismissal of this variation as uninformative noise.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we evaluate using genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) data to perform parentage assignment in lieu of traditional array data. The use of GBS data raises two issues: First, for low-coverage GBS data, it may not be possible to call the genotype at many loci, a critical first step for detecting opposing homozygous markers. Second, the amount of sequencing coverage may vary across individuals, making it challenging to directly compare the likelihood scores between putative parents. To address these issues we extend the probabilistic framework of Huisman (2017) and evaluate putative parents by comparing their (potentially noisy) genotypes to a series of proposal distributions. These distributions describe the expected genotype probabilities for the relatives of an individual. We assign putative parents as a parent if they are classified as a parent (as opposed to e.g., an unrelated individual), and if the assignment score passes a threshold. We evaluated this method on simulated data and found that (1) high-coverage GBS data performs similarly to array data and requires only a small number of markers to correctly assign parents and (2) low-coverage GBS data (as low as 0.1x) can also be used, provided that it is obtained across a large number of markers. When analysing the low-coverage GBS data, we also found a high number of false positives if the true parent is not contained within the list of candidate parents, but that this false positive rate can be greatly reduced by hand tuning the assignment threshold. We provide this parentage assignment method as a standalone program called AlphaAssign.",

We deployed an autonomous rover in a mission-relevant Martian drilling scenario with manual sample validation. Subsurface communities were delineated by depth related to sediment moisture.

    "abstract": "Fast, efficient and more importantly accurate serial dilution is a requirement for many chemical and biological microfluidic-based applications. Over the last decade, a large number of microfluidic devices has been proposed, each demonstrating either a different type of dilution technique or complex system architectures based on various flow source combinations. In this work, a novel serial dilution architecture is demonstrated, implemented on a commercially fabricated printed circuit board (PCB). The proposed single layer, stepwise serial diluter comprises an optimised microfluidic network, where identical dilution ratio per stage can be ensured, either by applying equal pressure or equal flow rates at both inlets. The advantages of the proposed serial diluter are twofold. Firstly, it is structured as a modular unit cell, simplifying the required fluid driving mechanism to a single source for both sample and buffer solution. Thus, this unit cell can be seen as a fundamental microfluidic building block, which can form multistage serial dilution cascades, once combined appropriately with itself or other similar unit cells. Secondly, the serial diluter has been fabricated entirely using commercial PCB technologies, allowing the device to be interfaced with standard electronic components, if more complex miniature point-of-care (PoC) systems are desired, where the small footprint and accuracy of the device is of paramount importance.",

In order to obtain functional insights into the hypoxic response in a data-driven way, we attempted a meta-analysis of the RNA-seq data from the hypoxic transcriptomes archived in public databases. In view of methodological variability of archived data in the databases, we first manually curated RNA-seq data from appropriate pairs of transcriptomes before and after hypoxic stress. These included 128 human and 52 murine transcriptome pairs. We classified the results of experiments for each gene into three categories: upregulated, downregulated, and unchanged. Hypoxic transcriptomes were then compared between humans and mice to identify common hypoxia-responsive genes. In addition, meta-analyzed hypoxic transcriptome data were integrated with public ChIP-seq data on the known human HIFs HIF-1 and HIF-2 to provide insights into hypoxia-responsive pathways involving direct transcription factor binding. This study provides a useful resource for hypoxia research. It also demonstrates the potential of a meta-analysis approach to public gene expression databases for selecting candidate genes from gene expression profiles generated under various experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays important roles in morphological differentiation and development in eukaryotes. In filamentous fungi, however, little is known about lncRNAs and their roles in sexual development. Here we describe sexual stage-induced lncRNAs during the formation of perithecia, the sexual fruiting bodies of Fusarium graminearum. We have identified 547 lncRNAs whose expression was developmental stage-specific, with about 40% of which peaked during the development of asci, the sac-like structures containing meiospores. A large fraction of the lncRNAs were found to be antisense to mRNAs, forming 300 sense-antisense pairs. Although small RNAs (sRNAs) were produced from these overlapping loci, most of the antisense lncRNAs appeared not to be involved in gene silencing pathways. Genome-wide analysis of sRNA clusters identified many silenced loci at the meiotic stage. However, we found transcriptionally-active sRNA clusters, many of which were associated with lncRNAs. Also, we observed that many antisense lncRNAs and their respective sense transcripts were induced in parallel as the perithecia matured. To identify regulatory components for lncRNA expression, we analyzed mutants defective in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. A subset of the lncRNAs appeared to be targeted by the NMD before the perithecia formation, suggesting a suppressive role of the NMD in lncRNA expression during vegetative stage. This research provides fundamental genomic resources that will spur further investigations on developmental lncRNAs that may play important roles in shaping the fungal fruiting bodies.",

    "abstract": "Cells in developing tissues need to sense their environment for their accurate targeting to specific destinations. This occurs in developing muscles, which need to attach to their respective tendon cell before muscle contractions can begin. Elongating myotube tips form filopodia, which are presumed to have sensory roles, and are later suppressed upon building the attachment site. Here, we use live imaging and quantitative image analysis of lateral transverse (LT) myotubes in Drosophila to show that filopodia suppression occurs as a result of integrin signaling. Loss of the integrin subunits PS2 and {beta}PS increased filopodia number and length at stages when they are normally suppressed. Conversely, inducing integrin signaling, achieved by expression of constitutively dimerised {beta}PS cytoplasmic domain (di{beta}), prematurely suppressed filopodia. We discovered that the integrin signal is transmitted through the ArfGAP and scaffolding protein Git (G-protein receptor coupled interacting protein) and its downstream kinase Pak (p21-activated kinase). Absence of these proteins causes profuse filopodia formation and prevents filopodial inhibition by di{beta}. Thus, integrin signaling switches off the exploratory behaviour of myotubes seeking tendons, enabling the actin machinery to focus on forming a strong attachment and assembling the contractile apparatus.",

    "abstract": "In externally fertilizing animals, such as sea urchins and frogs, prolonged depolarization of the egg immediately after fertilization inhibits the entry of additional sperm - a phenomenon known as the fast block to polyspermy. In the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, this depolarization is driven by a Ca2+-activated Cl- efflux. Although the prominent Ca2+-activated Cl- currents generated by immature X. laevis oocytes are conducted by xTMEM16A channels, little is known about which channels contribute to fertilization-competency in mature eggs. Moreover, the gamete undergoes a gross transformation as it matures from an immature oocyte into a fertilization-competent egg. Here we report the results of our approach to identify the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel that triggers the fast block. Querying published proteomics and RNA-seq data, we identified two Ca2+-activated Cl- channels expressed in fertilization-competent X. laevis eggs: xTMEM16A and xBEST2A. Furthermore, transcripts for these channels increase in abundance during gamete maturation. To determine if either of these mediates the fast block, we characterized exogenously expressed xTMEM16A and xBEST2A using pharmacologic inhibitors. None of the inhibitors tested blocked xBEST2A currents specifically. However, Ani9 and MONNA each reduced xTMEM16A currents by more than 70%, while only nominally inhibiting those generated by xBEST2A. Using whole-cell recordings during fertilization, we found that Ani9 and MONNA effectively diminished fertilization-evoked depolarizations. These results indicate that fertilization activates TMEM16A channels in X. laevis eggs and induces the earliest known event triggered by fertilization: the fast block to polyspermy.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIProtein for the channels xBEST2A and xTMEM16A is present in X. laevis eggs.\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_LIThe inhibitors MONNA and Ani9 effectively block xTMEM16A compared to xBEST2A.\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_LIXenopus laevis fertilization opens TMEM16A to trigger egg depolarization.\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_LIThe TMEM16A-mediated depolarization is critical for the fast block to polyspermy.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Olfactory communication can be of critical importance for mate choice decisions. Lepidoptera are key model systems for understanding olfactory communication, particularly considering sex pheromone signaling in the context of sexual selection. Solvent extraction or rinsing of pheromone-producing structures is a widespread method for quantifying sex pheromones, but such measures reflect what is stored and may not represent what is actually emitted by an individual during courtship. Here, we address this point for the first time by quantifying the components of the male sex pheromone (MSP) of interacting Bicyclus anynana butterflies, a species for which much information is available onthe role played by MSPs in affecting mating success. Using headspace sampling during courtship and solvent extraction after completion of experiments using the same males, we were able to track individual traits. Our results show that solvent extracts do not reflect quantities of MSP components emitted by live butterflies. We further show that MSP amounts obtained using headspace sampling correlated with male mating success, but solvent extracts did not. Our results further strongly suggest that males actively control MSP emission when faced with increased male-male competition. Common practice solvent extracts may thus not serve as an adequate proxy for male sex pheromone signaling as they are perceived by choosy females. Our study serves as a proof of principle that quantification of male sex pheromone components depends on the method of collection, which could apply to many other insects using short-range chemical signals. This affects our understanding of how sexual selection shapes the evolution of sexually-selected chemical traits.",

    "abstract": "Chitin is a highly abundant polysaccharide and linked to fungal infection and asthma. Unfortunately, its polymeric structure has hampered the identification of immune receptors directly binding chitin and signaling immune activation and inflammation, because purity, molecular structure and molarity are not well definable for a polymer typically extracted from biomass. Therefore, by using defined chitin (N-acetyl-glucosamine) oligomers, we identified six subunit long chitin chains as the smallest immunologically active motif and the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 as the primary fungal chitin receptor on human and murine immune cells. Chitin oligomers directly bound TLR2 with nanomolar affinity and showed both overlapping and distinct signaling outcomes compared to known mycobacterial TLR2 ligands. Conversely, chitin oligomers shorter than 6 subunits were inactive or showed antagonistic effects on chitin/TLR2-mediated signaling, hinting to a size-dependent sensing/activation system unexpectedly conserved in plants and humans. Since blocking the chitin-TLR2 interaction effectively prevented chitin-mediated inflammation in vitro and in vivo, our study highlights the chitin TLR2 interaction as a potential target for developing novel therapies in chitin-related pathologies and fungal disease.",

The preferred way to grow these bacteria in industrial settings is in large-scale fermenters. Growth of streptomycetes under these conditions is characterized by the formation of complex mycelial particles, called pellets. While the process of pellet formation is well characterized, little is known about their disintegration. Here, we use a qualitative and quantitative approach to show that pellet fragmentation in Streptomyces lividans is initiated when cultures enter the stationary phase, which coincides with a remarkable change in pellet architecture. Unlike young pellets, aging pellets have a less dense appearance and are characterized by the appearance of filaments protruding from their outer edges. These morphological changes are accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of mycelial fragments in the culture broth. In the presence of fresh nutrients, these fragments are able to aggregate with other small fragments, but not with disintegrating pellets, to form new mycelial particles. Altogether, our work indicates that fragmentation might represent an escape mechanism from the environmental stress caused by nutrient scarcity, with striking similarities to the disassembly of bacterial biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular microelectrodes have been widely used to measure brain activity, yet there are still basic questions about the requirements for a good extracellular microelectrode. One common source of confusion is how an electrodes impedance affects the amplitude of extracellular spikes and background noise.\\n\\nHere we discuss how an electrodes impedance affects data quality in extracellular recordings, which is crucial for both the detection of spikes and their assignment to the correct neurons. This study employs commercial polytrodes containing 32 electrodes (177 m2) arranged in a dense array. This allowed us to directly compare, side-by-side, the same extracellular signals measured by modified low impedance (~100 kOhm) microelectrodes with unmodified high impedance (~1 MOhm) microelectrodes. We begin with an evaluation of existing protocols to lower the impedance of the electrodes. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS) electrodeposition protocol is a simple, stable, and reliable method for decreasing the impedance of a microelectrode up to tenfold. We next record in vivo using polytrodes that are modified in a  chess board pattern, such that the signal of one neuron is detected by multiple coated and non-coated electrodes. The performance of the coated and non-coated electrodes is then compared on measures of background noise and amplitude of the detected action potentials.\\n\\nIf the proper recording system is used, then the impedance of a microelectrode within the range of standard polytrodes (~ 0.1 to 2 MOhm) does not significantly affect data quality and spike sorting. This study should encourage neuroscientists to stop worrying about one more unknown.",

Although they validated PI20 in several ways and it may serve as a quick and cost-effective measure for estimating DP risk (Livingston & Shah, in press; Shah et al., 2015), they did not formally evaluate its validity against a pre-existing alternative questionnaire (Kennerknecht et al., 2008) even though they criticized the weak relationship of the pre-existing questionnaire to actual behavioral face recognition performance. Thus, we administered the questionnaires to a large population (N = 855) and found a very strong correlation (r = 0.82 [95% confidence interval: 0.80, 0.84]), a principal component that accounted for more than 90% of the variance, and comparable reliability between the questionnaires. These results show unidimensionality and equivalence between the two questionnaires, or at least, a very strong common latent factor underlying them. The PI20 may not be greater than the pre-existing questionnaire; the two questionnaires measured essentially the same trait. The intrinsic equivalence between the questionnaires necessitates a revision of the view that the PI20 overcomes the weakness of the pre-existing questionnaire. Because both questionnaires contained unreliable items, we suggest, instead of using either questionnaire alone, that selection of a set of items with high reliability may offer a more robust approach to capture face recognition ability.",

Testing all newly diagnosed CRC for MMR protein deficiency, known as universal testing, has recently emerged as the preferred approach to identify potential Lynch syndrome individuals. All newly diagnosed CRCs were screened for MMR protein expression by immunohistochemistry. A 2-step approach was used: PMS2 and MSH6 testing followed by the testing of the respective MMR protein partner if one of the proteins is lost. We retrospectively searched our pathology database for MMR protein expression results across a 5-year period (2012-2016) when universal testing was performed. Clinical and pathological data were extracted from the pathology report. A total of 2077 consecutive CRCs were tested for MMR protein expression. Mean age at diagnosis was 68.4 years. MMR protein deficiency was identified in 399 cases (19.2%). The vast majority of CRC with MLH1/PMS2 loss were diagnosed in patients older than 70 years (84%), most of them are likely to be secondary to sporadic MLH1 methylation. MMR protein deficiency patterns suggestive of a defect in MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 comprised 42 cases, of which 37 were found in individuals aged 50 years or older. CRCs with MSH2/MSH6 loss were most commonly found in patients older than 70 years (57%). In summary, universal testing for MMR protein deficiency in CRC identifies abnormal patterns of expression suggestive of Lynch syndrome in all age groups. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the actual rate of Lynch syndrome individuals identified from this initial screening.",

The molecular basis of heterochrony in mammalian tissues is poorly understood. We report that Hedgehog signaling activates a heterochronic pathway that controls differentiation timing in multiple lineages. A differentiation trajectory from second heart field cardiac progenitors to first heart field cardiomyocytes was identified by single-cell transcriptional profiling in mouse embryos. A survey of developmental signaling pathways revealed specific enrichment for Hedgehog signaling targets in cardiac progenitors. Removal of Hh signaling caused loss of progenitor and precocious cardiomyocyte differentiation gene expression in the second heart field in vivo. Introduction of active Hh signaling to mESC-derived progenitors, modelled by transient expression of the Hh-dependent transcription factor GLI1, delayed differentiation in cardiac and neural lineages in vitro. A shared GLI1-dependent network in both cardiac and neural progenitors was enriched with FOX family transcription factors. FOXF1, a GLI1 target, was sufficient to delay onset of the cardiomyocyte differentiation program in progenitors, by epigenetic repression of cardiomyocyte-specific enhancers. Removal of active Hh signaling or Foxf1 expression from second heart field progenitors caused precocious cardiac differentiation in vivo, establishing a mechanism for resultant Congenital Heart Disease. Together, these studies suggest that Hedgehog signaling directly activates a gene regulatory network that functions as a heterochronic switch to control differentiation timing across developmental lineages.",

We show that cell-shape dependent self-organisation of cortical microtubule arrays is crucial for determining planes of early tissue-generating divisions and forms the basis for robust control of cell division orientation in the embryo. To achieve this, we simulate microtubules on actual cell surface shapes from which we derive a minimal set of three rules for proper array orientation. The first rule captures the effects of cell shape alone on microtubule organisation, the second rule describes the regulation of microtubule stability at cell edges and the third rule includes the differential effect of auxin on local microtubule stability. These rules explain early embryonic division plane orientations and offer a framework for understanding patterned cell divisions in plant morphogenesis.",

The most common weight for dairy cattle presented in current literature is 600 kg, but this is not evidenced by data. For the first time, we provide an evidence-based estimate of the average weight of UK dairy cattle to better inform decisions by farmers, veterinarians and the scientific community.\\n\\nMethodsWe collected data for 2,747 dairy cattle from 20 farms in the UK, 19 using Lely Automatic Milking Systems with weigh floors and 1 using a crush with weigh scales. These data covered farms with different breed types, including Holstein, Friesian, Holstein-Friesian and Jersey, as well as farms with dual purpose breeds and cross-breeds. Data were used to calculate a mean weight for dairy cattle by breed, and a UK-specific mean weight was generated by scaling to UK-specific breed proportions. Trends in weight by lactation number, DIM and production level were also explored using individual cattle-level data.\\n\\nResultsMean weight for adult dairy cattle included in this study was 617 kg (standard deviation (sd) 85.6 kg). Mean weight varied across breeds, with a range of 466 kg (sd=56.0 kg, Jersey) to 636 kg (sd=84.1, Holsteins). When scaled to UK breed proportions, the estimated mean UK dairy cattle weight was 620 kg. Overall, first-lactation heifers weighed 9% less than cows. Mean weight declined for the first 30 days post-calving, before steadily increasing. For cattle at peak production, mean weight increased with production level.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study is the first to calculate a mean weight of adult dairy cattle in the UK based on on-farm data. Overall mean weight was higher than that most often proposed in the literature (600 kg). Evidence-informed weights are crucial as the UK works to better monitor and report metrics to monitor antimicrobial use and are useful to farmers and veterinarians to inform dosing decisions.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic disorder is much more abundant in eukaryotic than in prokaryotic proteins. However, the reason behind this is unclear. It has been proposed that the disordered regions are functionally important for regulation in eukaryotes, but it has also been proposed that the difference is a result of lower selective pressure in eukaryotes. Almost all studies intrinsic disorder is predicted from the amino acid sequence of a protein. Therefore, there should exist an underlying difference in the amino acid distributions between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins causing the predicted difference in intrinsic disorder. To obtain a better understanding of why eukaryotic proteins contain more intrinsically disordered regions we compare proteins from complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes.\\n\\nHere, we show that the difference in intrinsic disorder origin from differences in the linker regions. Eukaryotic proteins have more extended linker regions and, in particular, the eukaryotic linker regions are more disordered. The average eukaryotic protein is about 500 residues long; it contains 250 residues in linker regions, of which 80 are disordered. In comparison, prokaryotic proteins are about 350 residues long and only have 100-110 residues in linker regions, and less than 10 of these are intrinsically disordered.\\n\\nFurther, we show that there is no systematic increase in the frequency of disorder-promoting residues in eukaryotic linker regions. Instead, the difference in frequency of only three amino acids seems to lie behind the difference. The most significant difference is that eukaryotic linkers contain about 9% serine, while prokaryotic linkers have roughly 6.5%. Eukaryotic linkers also contain about 2% more proline and 2-3% fewer isoleucine residues. The reason why primarily these amino acids vary in frequency is not apparent, but it cannot be excluded that the difference is serine is related to the increased need for regulation through phosphorylation and that the proline difference is related to increase of eukaryotic specific repeats.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundSequencing of amplified genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene, have been extensively used to characterize microbial community composition. Recent studies suggested that Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASV) should replace the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), given the arbitrary definition of sequence identity thresholds used to define units. Alignment-free methods are an interesting alternative for the taxonomic classification of the ASVs, preventing the introduction of biases from sequence identity thresholds.\\n\\nResultsHere we present TAG.ME, a novel alignment-independent and amplicon-specific method for taxonomic assignment based on genetic markers. TAG.ME uses a multilevel supervised learning approach to create predictive models based on user-defined genetic marker genes. The predictive method can assign taxonomy to sequenced amplicons efficiently and effectively. We applied our method to assess gut and soil sample classification, and it outperformed alternative approaches, identifying a substantially larger proportion of species. Benchmark tests performed using the RDP database, and Mock communities reinforced the precise classification into deep taxonomic levels.\\n\\nConclusionTAG.ME presents a new approach to assign taxonomy to amplicon sequences accurately. Our classification model, trained with amplicon specific sequences, can address resolution issues not solved by other methods and approaches that use the whole 16S rRNA gene sequence.

    "abstract": "MOTIVATIONParticle tracking coupled with time-lapse microscopy is critical for understanding the dynamics of intracellular processes of clinical importance. Spurred on by advances in the spatiotemporal resolution of microscopy and automated computational methods, this field is increasingly amenable to multi-dimensional high-throughput data collection schemes (Snijder et al., 2012). Typically, complex particle tracking datasets generated by individual laboratories are produced with incompatible methodologies that preclude comparison to each other. There is therefore an unmet need for data management systems that facilitate data standardization, meta-analysis, and structured data dissemination. The integration of analysis, visualization, and quality control capabilities into such systems would eliminate the need for manual transfer of data to diverse downstream analysis tools. At the same time, it would lay the foundation for shared trajectory data, particle tracking, and motion analysis standards.\n\nRESULTSHere, we present Open Microscopy Environment inteGrated Analysis (OMEGA), a cross-platform data management, analysis, and visualization system, for particle tracking data, with particular emphasis on results from viral and vesicular trafficking experiments. OMEGA provides intuitive graphical interfaces to implement integrated particle tracking and motion analysis workflows while providing easy to use facilities to automatically keep track of error propagation, harvest data provenance and ensure the persistence of analysis results and metadata. Specifically, OMEGA: 1) imports image data and metadata from data management tools such as the Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects (OMERO; Allan et al., 2012); 2) tracks intracellular particles movement; 3) facilitates parameter optimization and trajectory results inspection and validation; 4) performs downstream trajectory analysis and motion type classification; 5) estimates the uncertainty propagating through the motion analysis pipeline; and, 6) facilitates storage and dissemination of analysis results, and analysis definition metadata, on the basis of our newly proposed FAIRsharing.org complainant Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments (MIAPTE; Rigano and Strambio-De-Castillia, 2016; 2017) guidelines in combination with the OME-XML data model (Goldberg et al., 2005). In so doing, OMEGA maintains a persistent link between raw image data, intermediate analysis steps, the overall analysis output, and all necessary metadata to repeat the analysis process and reproduce its results.\n\nAvailability and implementationOMEGA is a cross-platform, open-source software developed in Java.

    "abstract": "We characterize the morphogenic process of convergent thickening (CT), which occurs in the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) during gastrulation of Xenopus, the African clawed frog. CT was described previously as the tendency of explants of the ventral IMZ of Xenopus to converge their circumblastoporal dimension and thicken their radial dimension (Keller and Danilchik 1988). Here we show that CT occurs from the onset of gastrulation, initially throughout the pre-involution IMZ. We suggest that CT is driven by an increase in the interfacial tension between the deep IMZ and its epithelium, resulting in cells of the deep IMZ tending to minimize their surface area. In explants, this results in a progressive shortening (convergence) of the IMZ along its longer mediolateral axis and thickening in the orthogonal planes, and can generate tensile force (Shook et al. 2018). In vivo, convergence of the annular IMZ generates circumferential tension, closing the blastopore. These results provide the first clear example of a tensile morphogenic force from a Holtfreterian/Steinbergian change in tissue affinity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesWe know little about human olfactory ability in natural settings because current knowledge derives from lab-based studies using non-representative samples of convenience. The primary objective was to use a validated lab tool, the five-item odor identification test, to assess variation in olfactory ability in different environments.\n\nMethodsUsing the five-item test, we conducted two repeated measures experiments that assessed participant ability to correctly identify an odor source in different odor environments. We also examined consistency in odor labelling due to documented potential bias from idiosyncrasies in odor terms.\n\nResultsWe found no variation in olfactory ability due to environment, but this may be due to methodological biases. First, subjective bias results from idiosyncratic differences in participant labelling and researcher coding of answer correctness. Second, better ability to learn odors may provide an advantage to women. Third, reducing positive female learning bias by analyzing consistency in response (regardless of correct odor source identification) fails to assess functional olfactory ability. Functional olfactory ability (naming correct odor source) is significantly better in females, especially in food-rich odor environments.\n\nConclusionsEnvironment was not a significant factor in olfactory ability in this study but that result may be confounded by methodological biases. We not recommend odor identification as a field tool. Functional olfactory ability exhibits a sex-based pattern but consistency in recognizing the same odor does not. Food-rich odors may enhance olfactory ability in females. We discuss evolutionary and ecological implications of superior female functional olfactory ability relative to food foraging activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCryptosporidium, an apicomplexan protozoa, is a leading contributor to diarrheal morbidity and mortality in children under five years old worldwide. As there is no vaccine and no approved drug for Cryptosporidium spp. in young children, preventing parasite transmission is crucial. We undertook a pilot case-control study to define the extent of person-to-person transmission of cryptosporidiosis within families in an urban and rural community in Bangladesh.\\n\\nMethodsWe enrolled 48 case families with a Cryptosporidium-infected child aged 6-18 months. Controls were age-sex matched Cryptosporidium-negative children (n=12). Once children were identified, we enrolled all household members. We then followed these individuals for 8 weeks, with weekly surveillance stools and testing with qPCR for Cryptosporidium spp.\\n\\nFindingsIn the 48 case families, the rate of secondary infections with Cryptosporidium was 18.6% (22/118) compared to 0 new infections (0/35) in the 12 control families. In the 22 urban Mirpur households, the secondary attack rate was 30% (18/60) in cases compared to 0% (0/14) in controls (chi-square p = 0.018). In contrast, in the 21 rural Mirzapur households, the secondary attack rate was 6.9% (4/58) in case households compared to 0% (0/21) in controls (chi-square p = 0.22). Genotyping by gp60 demonstrated infection with the same subspecies in five of six families. Serologic response to Cryptosporidium infection was associated with younger age, longer duration of infection, and C hominis gp60_IbA9G3R2 infection.\\n\\nInterpretationThe high rate of secondary infection in Mirpur suggests that person-to-person transmission is likely a major source of Cryptosporidium infection for young children living in this region. GP 60 genotyping demonstrated direction of infection in 2 households, and concurrent infection in five households. Further work is needed to understand the differences in parasite transmissibility and immunity to different genotypes.",

    "abstract": "The widely projecting catecholaminergic (norepinephrine and dopamine) neurotransmitter systems profoundly shape the state of neuronal networks in the forebrain. Current models posit that the effects of catecholaminergic modulation on network dynamics are homogenous across the brain. However, the brain is equipped with a variety of catecholamine receptors with distinct functional effects and heterogeneous density across brain regions. Consequently, catecholaminergic effects on brain-wide network dynamics might be more spatially specific than assumed. We tested this idea through the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements performed in humans (19 females, 5 males) at  rest under pharmacological (atomoxetine-induced) elevation of catecholamine levels. We used a linear decomposition technique to identify spatial patterns of correlated fMRI signal fluctuations that were either increased or decreased by atomoxetine. This yielded two distinct spatial patterns, each expressing reliable and specific drug effects. The spatial structure of both fluctuation patterns resembled the spatial distribution of the expression of catecholamine receptor genes: 1 norepinephrine receptors (for the fluctuation pattern: placebo > atomoxetine),  D2-like dopamine receptors (pattern: atomoxetine > placebo), and {beta} norepinephrine receptors (for both patterns, with correlations of opposite sign). We conclude that catecholaminergic effects on the forebrain are spatially more structured than traditionally assumed and at least in part explained by the heterogeneous distribution of various catecholamine receptors. Our findings link catecholaminergic effects on large-scale brain networks to low-level characteristics of the underlying neurotransmitter systems. They also provide key constraints for the development of realistic models of neuromodulatory effects on large-scale brain network dynamics.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe catecholamines norepinephrine and dopamine are an important class of modulatory neurotransmitters. Because of the widespread and diffuse release of these neuromodulators, it has commonly been assumed that their effects on neural interactions are homogenous across the brain. Here, we present results from the human brain that challenge this view. We pharmacologically increased catecholamine levels and imaged the effects on the spontaneous covariations between brain-wide fMRI signals at  rest. We identified two distinct spatial patterns of covariations: one that was amplified and another that was suppressed by catecholamines. Each pattern was associated with the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the expression of distinct catecholamine receptor genes. Our results provide novel insights into the catecholaminergic modulation of large-scale human brain dynamics.",

Damaged nodes represent health deficits. The Frailty Index (FI) assesses age-related damage as the proportion of health deficits an individual has accumulated, from a selection of attributes. Here, we use computational, information-theoretic, and mean-field approaches to show that the degree distribution and degree correlations of the underlying network are important to the models ability to recover the behavior of observational health data.

We find that the behavior of different classes of observational health deficits (laboratory or clinical) is similar to the behavior of nodes of low or high degree in the model, respectively.

    "abstract": "Protein modeling quality is an important part of protein structure prediction. We have for more than a decade developed a set of methods for this problem. We have used various types of description of the protein and different machine learning methodologies. However, common to all these methods has been the target function used for training. The target function in ProQ describes the local quality of a residue in a protein model. In all versions of ProQ the target function has been the S-score. However, other quality estimation functions also exist, which can be divided into superposition- and contact-based methods. The superposition-based methods, such as S-score, are based on a rigid body superposition of a protein model and the native structure, while the contact-based methods compare the local environment of each residue. Here, we examine the effects of retraining our latest predictor, ProQ3D, using identical inputs but different target functions. We find that the c ntact-based methods are easier to predict and that predictors trained on these measures provide some advantages when it comes to identifying the best model. One possible reason for this is that contact based methods are better at estimating the quality of multi-domain targets. However, training on the S-score gives the best correlation with the GDT_TS score, which is commonly used in CASP to score the global model quality. To take the advantage of both of these features we provide an updated version of ProQ3D that predicts local and global model quality estimates based on different quality estimates.",

To escape from the circularity of descriptive classifications based purely on gene signatures I describe a biological classification based on a model of the mammary lineage. In this model I propose that the third group is a tumour derived from a mammary hormone-sensing cell that has undergone apocrine metaplasia. I first split tumours into hormone sensing and milk secreting cells based on the expression of transcription factors linked to cell identity (the luminal progenitor split), then split the hormone sensing group into luminal and apocrine groups based on oestrogen receptor activity (the luminal-apocrine split). I show that the luminal-apocrine-basal (LAB) approach can be applied to microarray data (186 tumours) from an EORTC trial and to RNA-seq data from TCGA (674 tumours), and compare results obtained with the LAB and PAM50 approaches. Unlike pure signature-based approaches, classification based on an explicit biological model has the advantage that it is both refutable and capable of meaningful improvement as biological understanding of mammary tumorigenesis improves.",

Using precisely staged larvae of the crustacean, Thamnocephalus platyurus, we systematically examined cell division patterns and morphometric changes associated with posterior elongation during segmentation. We show that cell division is required for normal elongation but that cells in the growth zone need only divide ~1.5 times to meet that requirement; correspondingly, direct measures of cell division in the growth zone are low. Morphometric measurements of the growth zone and of newly formed segments suggest tagma-specific features of segment generation. Using methods for detecting two different phases in the cell cycle, we show distinct domains of synchronized cells in the posterior. Borders of cell cycle domains correlate with domains of segmental gene expression, suggesting an intimate link between segment generation and cell cycle regulation.\\n\\nSummary StatementPosterior growth zone has synchronized cell cycle domains but shows little cell division during segment addition in a crustacean.

Epigenetic modifications are poised at the interface between genes and environment and are predicted to reveal insight into the gene networks, cell types, and developmental timing of NDD etiology. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to examine DNA methylation in 49 human cortex samples from three different NDDs (autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, and Dup15q syndrome) and matched controls. Integration of methylation differences across NDDs with relevant genomic and genetic datasets revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) unique to each type of NDD but with shared regulatory functions in neurons and microglia. DMRs were significantly enriched for known NDD genetic risk factors, including both common inherited and rare de novo variants. Weighted region co-methylation network analysis revealed a module related to NDD diagnosis and enriched for microglial regulatory regions. Together, these results demonstrate an epigenomic signature of NDDs in human cortex shared with known genetic and immune etiological risk. Epigenomic insights into cell types and gene regulatory regions will aid in defining therapeutic targets and early biomarkers at the interface of genetic and environmental NDD risk factors.",

    "abstract": "1AbstractOver the last few years, as more and more sequencing studies have been performed, it has become apparent that the identification of pathogenic mutations is, more often than not, a complex issue. Here, with a focus on neurodegenerative diseases, we have performed a survey of coding genetic variability that is unlikely to be pathogenic.\\n\\nWe have performed whole-exome sequencing in 478 samples derived from several brain banks in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Samples were included when subjects were, at death, over 60 years of age, had no signs of neurological disease and were subjected to a neuropathological examination, which revealed no evidence of neurodegeneration. This information will be valuable to studies of genetic variability as a causal factor for neurodegenerative syndromes. We envisage it will be particularly relevant for diagnostic laboratories as a filter step to the results being produced by either genome-wide or gene-panel sequencing. We have made this data publicly available at www.alzforum.org/exomes/hex.",

    "abstract": "Sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) restricts human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in non-dividing cells by degrading intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). SAMHD1 is highly expressed in resting CD4+ T-cells that are important for the HIV-1 reservoir and viral latency; however, whether SAMHD1 affects HIV-1 latency is unknown. Recombinant SAMHD1 binds HIV-1 DNA or RNA fragments in vitro, but the function of this binding remains unclear. Here we investigate the effect of SAMHD1 on HIV-1 gene expression and reactivation of viral latency. We found that endogenous SAMHD1 impaired HIV-1 LTR activity in monocytic THP-1 cells and HIV-1 reactivation in latently infected primary CD4+ T-cells. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) SAMHD1 suppressed HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene expression at the level of transcription. SAMHD1 overexpression also suppressed LTR activity from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), but not from murine leukemia virus (MLV), suggesting specific suppression of retroviral LTR-driven gene expression. WT SAMHD1 bound to proviral DNA and impaired reactivation of HIV-1 gene expression in latently infected J-Lat cells. In contrast, a nonphosphorylated mutant (T592A) and a dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) inactive mutant (H206D/R207N, or HD/RN) of SAMHD1 failed to efficiently suppress HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and reactivation of latent virus. Purified recombinant WT SAMHD1, but not T592A and HD/RN mutants, bound to fragments of the HIV-1 LTR in vitro. These findings suggest that SAMHD1-mediated suppression of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression contributes to regulation of viral latency in CD4+ T-cells.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEA critical barrier to developing a cure for HIV-1 infection is the long-lived viral reservoir that exists in resting CD4+ T-cells, the main targets of HIV-1. The viral reservoir is maintained through a variety of mechanisms, including regulation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. The host protein SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 replication in non-dividing cells, but its role in HIV-1 latency remains unknown. Here we report a new function of SAMHD1 in regulating HIV-1 latency. We found that SAMHD1 suppressed HIV-1 LTR promoter-driven gene expression and reactivation of viral latency in cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells. Furthermore, SAMHD1 bound to the HIV-1 LTR in vitro and in a latently infected CD4+ T-cell line, suggesting that the binding may negatively modulate reactivation of HIV-1 latency. Our findings indicate a novel role for SAMHD1 in regulating HIV-1 latency, which enhances our understanding of the mechanisms regulating proviral gene expression in CD4+ T-cells.",

    "abstract": "Urination may occur either reflexively in response to a full bladder or deliberately irrespective of immediate need. Voluntary control is desired because it ensures that waste is expelled when consciously desired and socially appropriate1,2. Urine release requires two primary components: bladder pressure and urethral relaxation1-3. Although the bladder contracts during urination, its slow smooth muscle is not under direct voluntary control and its contraction alone is not sufficient for voiding. The decisive action of urination is at the urethral sphincter, where striated muscle permits fast control. This sphincter is normally constricted, but relaxes to enable urine flow. Barringtons nucleus (Bar, or pontine micturition center) in the brainstem is known to be essential for the switch from urine storage to elimination4-7, and a subset of Bar neurons expressing corticotropin releasing hormone (BarCRH) have recently been shown to promote bladder contraction8-10. However, Bar neurons that relax the urethral sphincter to enable urination behavior have not been identified. Here we describe novel brainstem neurons that control the external urethral sphincter. We find that scent marking behavior in male mice depends upon a subpopulation of spatially clustered Bar neurons that express high levels of estrogen receptor 1 (BarESR1). These neurons are glutamatergic, project to urinary nuclei in the spinal cord with a bias towards sphincter-inhibiting interneurons, and their activity correlates with natural urination. Optogenetic stimulation of BarESR1 neurons rapidly initiates sphincter bursting and efficient voiding in absence of sensory cues in anesthetized and behaving animals. Conversely, inhibiting the activity of these neurons prevents olfactory cues from promoting scent marking behavior. The identification of BarESR1 cells provides an expanded model for the supraspinal control of urination and its dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Genomic enhancer elements regulate gene expression programs important for neuronal fate and function and are implicated in brain disease states. Enhancers undergo bidirectional transcription to generate non-coding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, eRNA function remains controversial. Here, we combined ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets from three distinct neuronal culture systems in two activity states, enabling genome-wide enhancer identification and prediction of putative enhancer-gene pairs based on correlation of transcriptional output. Notably, stimulus-dependent enhancer transcription preceded mRNA induction, and CRISPR- based activation of eRNA synthesis increased mRNA at paired genes, functionally validating enhancer-gene predictions. Focusing on enhancers surrounding the Fos gene, we report that targeted eRNA manipulation bidirectionally modulates Fos mRNA, and that Fos eRNAs directly interact with the histone acetyltransferase domain of the enhancer-linked transcriptional co-activator CBP. Together, these results highlight the unique role of eRNAs in neuronal gene regulation and demonstrate that eRNAs can be used to identify putative target genes.",
