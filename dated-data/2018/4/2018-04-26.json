    "abstract": "Semi-automated genome annotation methods such as Segway enable understanding of chromatin activity. Here we present chromatin state annotations of 164 human cell types using 1,615 genomics data sets. To produce these annotations, we developed a fully-automated annotation strategy in which we train separate unsupervised annotation models on each cell type and use a machine learning classifier to automate the state interpretation step. Using these annotations, we developed a measure of the importance of each genomic position called the \\\"conservation-associated activity score,\\\" which we use to aggregate information across cell types into a multi-cell type view. The aggregated conservation-associated activity score provides a measure of importance directly attributable to a specific activity in a specific set of cell types. In contrast to evolutionary conservation, this measure is not biased to detect only elements shared with related species. Using the conservation-associated activity score, we combined all our annotations into a single, cell type-agnostic encyclopedia that catalogs all human transcriptional and regulatory elements, enabling easy and intuitive interpretation of the effect of genome variants on phenotype, such as in disease-associated, evolutionarily conserved or positively selected loci. These resources, including cell type-specific annotations, encyclopedia, and a visualization server, are available at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/encyclopedia.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenome annotation algorithms are an effective class of tools for understanding the function of the genome. These algorithms take as input a set of genome-wide measurements about the activity at each base pair in a given tissue, such as where a given protein is binding or how accessible the DNA is to being read by a protein. The genome is then partitioned and each segment is assigned a label such that positions with the same label exhibit similar patterns in the input data. Such annotations are widely used for many applications, such as to understand the mechanism of impact of a given genetic variant. Here we present, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive set of genome annotations created so far, encompassing 164 human cell types and including 1,615 genomics data sets. These comprehensive annotations are made possible by a strategy that automates the previous interpretation step. Furthermore, we present several methodological innovations that make these genome annotations more useful.",

    "abstract": "Focal seizure propagation is classically thought to be spatially contiguous. However, distribution of seizures through a large-scale epileptic network has been theorized. Here, we used a multielectrode array, wide field calcium imaging, and two-photon calcium imaging to study focal seizure propagation pathways in an acute rodent neocortical 4-aminopyridine model. Although ictal neuronal bursts did not propagate beyond a 2-3 mm region, they were associated with hemisphere-wide field potential fluctuations and parvalbumin-positive interneuron activity outside the seizure focus. While bicuculline surface application enhanced contiguous seizure propagation, focal bicuculline microinjection at sites distant to the 4-aminopyridine focus resulted in epileptic network formation with maximal activity at the two foci. Our study suggests that both classical and epileptic network propagation can arise from localized inhibition defects, and that the network appearance can arise in the context of normal brain structure without requirement for pathological connectivity changes between sites.",

    "abstract": "Whilst next generation sequencing is frequently used to whole genome sequence bacteria from cultures, its rarely applied directly to clinical samples. Therefore, this study addresses the issue of applying NGS microbial diagnostics directly to blood samples. To demonstrate the potential of direct from blood sequencing a bacteria spiked blood model was developed. Horse blood was spiked with clinical samples of E. coli and S. aureus, and a process developed to isolate bacterial cells whilst removing the majority of host DNA. One sample of each isolate was then amplified using {phi}29 multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and sequenced. The total processing time, from sample to amplified DNA ready for sequencing was 3.5 hours, significantly faster than the 18-hour overnight culture step which is typically required. Both bacteria showed 100% survival through the processing. The direct from sample sequencing resulted in greater than 92% genome coverage of the pathogens whilst limiting the sequencing of host genome (less than 7% of all reads). Analysis of de novo assembled reads allowed accurate genotypic antibiotic resistance prediction. The sample processing is easily applicable to multiple sequencing platforms. Overall this model demonstrates potential to rapidly generate whole genome bacterial data directly from blood.",

    "abstract": "Genetic correlation is a key population parameter that describes the shared genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. It can be estimated by current state-of-art methods, i.e. linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML). The massively reduced computing burden of LDSC compared to GREML makes it an attractive tool, although the accuracy (i.e., magnitude of standard errors) of LDSC estimates has not been thoroughly studied. In simulation, we show that the accuracy of GREML is generally higher than that of LDSC. When there is genetic heterogeneity between the actual sample and reference data from which LD scores are estimated, the accuracy of LDSC decreases further. In real data analyses estimating the genetic correlation between schizophrenia (SCZ) and body mass index, we show that GREML estimates based on ~150,000 individuals give a higher accuracy than LDSC estimates based on ~400,000 individuals (from combined meta-data). A GREML genomic partitioning analysis reveals that the genetic correlation between SCZ and height is significantly negative for regulatory regions, which whole genome or LDSC approach has less power to detect. We conclude that LDSC estimates should be carefully interpreted as there can be uncertainty about homogeneity among combined meta-data sets. We suggest that any interesting findings from massive LDSC analysis for a large number of complex traits should be followed up, where possible, with more detailed analyses with GREML methods, even if sample sizes are lesser.",

    "abstract": "Expression levels of retinoic acid receptor gamma (NR1B3/RARG, encodes RAR{gamma}), are commonly reduced in prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore we sought to establish the cellular and gene regulatory consequences of reduced RAR{gamma} expression, and determine RAR{gamma} regulatory mechanisms. RARG shRNA approaches in non-malignant (RWPE-1 and HPr1-AR) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate models revealed that reducing RAR{gamma} levels, rather than adding exogenous retinoid ligand, had the greatest impact on prostate cell viability and gene expression. ChIP-Seq defined the RAR{gamma} cistrome which was significantly enriched at active enhancers associated with AR binding sites. Reflecting a significant genomic role for RAR{gamma} to regulate androgen signaling, RAR{gamma} knockdown in HPr1-AR cells significantly regulated the magnitude of the AR transcriptome. RAR{gamma} down-regulation was explained by increased miR-96 in PCa cell and mouse models, and TCGA PCa cohorts. Biochemical approaches confirmed that miR-96 directly regulated RAR{gamma} expression and function Capture of the miR-96 targetome by biotin-miR96 identified that RAR{gamma} and a number of RAR{gamma} interacting co-factors including TACC1 were all targeted by miR-96, and expression of these genes were prominently altered, positively and negatively, in the TCGA-PRAD cohort. Differential gene expression analyses between tumors in the TCGA-PRAD cohort with lower quartile expression levels of RARG and TACC1 and upper quartile miR-96, compared to the reverse, identified a gene network including several RAR{gamma} target genes (e.g. SOX15) that significantly associated with worse disease free survival (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.88, p=0.015). In summary, miR-96 targets a RAR{gamma} network to govern AR signaling, PCa progression and disease outcome.\\n\\nConflict of interestThe authors certify that they have NO affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements), or non-financial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.\\n\\nFUNDINGLESC acknowledges support, in part, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center-University of Pittsburg Cancer Institute Ovarian Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence National Institutes of Health [P50CA159981-01A1].\\n\\nMDL acknowledges support of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics NRSA T32 program [T32CA009072] held at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.\\n\\nMJC and DJS acknowledges support in part from the Prostate program of the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs [W81XWH-14-1-0608, W81XWH-11-2-0033] and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant P30CA016056 involving the use of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centers Genomic Shared Resource.\\n\\nMJC, GL, AR, HW and PvdB acknowledges support from the European Union-United States Atlantis Program [P116J090011].\\n\\nMJC and LESC acknowledge support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant P30CA016056 involving the use of OSUCCC The James, CCSG P30CA016058",

    "abstract": "Admixture between populations provides opportunity to study biological adaptation and phenotypic variation. Admixture studies rely on local ancestry inference for admixed individuals, which consists of computing at each locus the number of copies that originate from ancestral source populations. Existing software packages for local ancestry inference are tuned to provide accurate results on human data and recent admixture events. Here, we introduce Loter, an open-source software package that does not require any biological parameter besides haplotype data in order to make local ancestry inference available for a wide range of species. Using simulations, we compare the performance of Loter to HAPMIX, LAMP-LD, and RFMix. HAPMIX is the only software severely impacted by imperfect haplotype reconstruction. Loter is the less impacted software by increasing admixture time when considering simulated and admixed human genotypes. For simulations of admixed Populus genotypes, Loter and LAMP-LD are robust to increasing admixture times by contrast to RFMix. When comparing length of reconstructed and true ancestry tracts, Loter and LAMP-LD provide results whose accuracy is again more robust than RFMix to increasing admixture times. We apply Loter to individuals resulting from admixture between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera and lengths of ancestry tracts indicate that admixture took place around 100 generations ago. We expect that providing a rapid and parameter-free software for local ancestry inference will make more accessible genomic studies about admixture processes.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative interactions among species, termed mutualisms, have played a crucial role in the evolution of life on Earth. However, despite key potential benefits to partners, there are many cases where two species cease to cooperate, and mutualisms break down. What factors drive the evolutionary breakdown of mutualism? We examined the pathways towards breakdowns of the mutualism between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using a comparative approach, we identify ~25 independent cases of complete mutualism breakdown across global seed plants. We found that breakdown of cooperation was only stable when host plants either: (i) partner with other root symbionts or (ii) evolve alternative resource acquisition strategies. Our results suggest that key mutualistic services are only permanently lost if hosts evolve alternative symbioses or adaptations.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCooperative interactions among species - mutualisms - are major sources of evolutionary innovation. However, despite their importance, two species that formerly cooperated sometimes cease their partnership. Why do mutualisms breakdown? We asked this question in the partnership between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and their plant hosts, one of the most ancient mutualisms. We analyse two potential trajectories towards evolutionary breakdown of their cooperation, symbiont switching and mutualism abandonment. We find evidence that plants stop interacting with AM fungi when they switch to other microbial mutualists or when they evolve alternative strategies to extract nutrients from the environment. Our results show vital cooperative interactions can be lost - but only if successful alternatives evolve.",

    "abstract": "The human whipworm Trichuris trichiura is a parasite that infects around 500 million people globally, with consequences including damage to physical growth and educational performance. Current drugs such as mebendazole have a notable lack of efficacy against whipworm, compared to other soil-transmitted helminths. Mass drug administration programs are therefore unlikely to achieve eradication and new treatments for trichuriasis are desperately needed. All current drug control strategies focus on post-infection eradication, targeting the parasite in vivo. Here we propose developing novel anthelmintics which target the egg stage of the parasite in the soil as an adjunct environmental strategy. As evidence in support of such an approach we describe the actions of a new class of anthelmintic compounds, the 2,4-diaminothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines (DATPs). This compound class has found broad utility in medicinal chemistry, but has not previously been described as having anthelmintic activity. Importantly, these compounds show efficacy against not only the adult parasite, but also both the embryonated and unembryonated egg stages and thereby may enable a break in the parasite lifecycle.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe human whipworm, Trichuris trichiura, infects around 500 million people globally, impacting on their physical growth and educational performance. There are currently huge mass drug administration (MDA) programs aiming to control whipworm, along with the other major soil transmitted helminths, Ascaris and hookworm. However single doses of albendazole and mebendazole, which are used in MDA, have particularly poor effectiveness against whipworm, with cure rates less than 40%. This means that MDA may not be able to control and eliminate whipworm infection, and risks the spread of resistance to albendazole and mebendazole in the parasite population.\\n\\nWe are attempting to develop new treatments for parasitic worm infection, particularly focused on whipworm. We report the identification of a class of compounds, diaminothienopyrimidines (DATPs), which have not previously been described as anthelmintics. These compounds are effective against adult stages of whipworm, and also block the development of the model nematode C. elegans.\\n\\nOur DATP compounds reduce the ability of treated eggs to successfully establish infection in a mouse model of human whipworm. These results support a potential environmental spray to control whipworm by targeting the infectious egg stage in environmental hotspots.",

It has been previously demonstrated that higher-order statistical moments of luminance distributions influence perception of static surfaces and textures. Here, we tested whether the brain also represents higher-order moments of dynamic stimuli. We constructed random dot kinematograms where dots moved according to probability distributions that selectively differed in terms of their mean, variance, skewness, or kurtosis. When viewing these stimuli, human observers were sensitive to the mean direction of coherent motion and to the variance of the individual dot displacement angles, but they were insensitive to skewness and kurtosis. Observer behavior accorded with a model of directional motion energy, suggesting that information about higher-order moments is discarded early in the visual processing hierarchy. These results demonstrate that use of higher-order moments is not a general property of visual perception.",

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment (EE) is widely used to study the effects of external factors on brain development, function and health in rodent models, but very little is known of the effects of EE on the brain in a large animal model such as the pig. Twenty-four young pigs (aged 5 weeks at start of study, 1:1 male: female ratio) were housed in environmentally enriched (EE) pens and provided with additional enrichment stimulation (a bag filled with straw) once daily. Litter, weight and sex matched controls n= (24) were housed in barren (B) conditions. Behaviour was recorded on alternate days from study day 10. After 21 days, RNA-sequencing of the frontal cortex of male piglets culled one hour after the enrichment stimulation, but not those at 4 hours after stimulation, showed upregulation of genes involved in neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity in the EE compared to the B condition. This result is mirrored in the behavioural response to the stimulation which showed a peak in activity around the 1 hour time-point. By contrast, EE piglets displayed a signature consistent with a relative decrease in microglial activity compared to those in the B condition. These results confirm those from rodents, suggesting that EE may also confer neuronal health benefits in large mammal models, through a potential relative reduction in neuroinflammatory process and increase in neuroprotection driven by an enrichment-induced increase in behavioural activity.",

    "abstract": "RfaH, a transcription regulator of the universally conserved NusG/Spt5 family, utilizes a unique mode of recruitment to elongating RNA polymerase to activate virulence genes. RfaH function depends critically on an ops sequence, an exemplar of a consensus pause, in the non-template DNA strand of the transcription bubble. We used structural and functional analyses to elucidate the role of ops in RfaH recruitment. Our results demonstrate that ops induces pausing to facilitate RfaH binding and establishes direct contacts with RfaH. Strikingly, the non-template DNA forms a hairpin in the RfaH: ops complex structure, flipping out a conserved T residue that is specifically recognized by RfaH.

    "abstract": "High throughput single-cell gene expression profiling has enabled the characterization of novel cell types and developmental trajectories. Visualizing these datasets is crucial to biological interpretation, and the most popular method is t-Stochastic Neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which visualizes local patterns better than other methods, but often distorts global structure, such as distances between clusters. We developed Similarity Weighted Nonnegative Embedding (SWNE), which enhances interpretation of datasets by embedding the genes and factors that separate cell states alongside the cells on the visualization, captures local structure better than t-SNE and existing methods, and maintains fidelity when visualizing global structure. SWNE uses nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose the gene expression matrix into biologically relevant factors, embeds the cells, genes and factors in a 2D visualization, and uses a similarity matrix to smooth the embeddings. We demonstrate SWNE on single cell RNA-seq data from hematopoietic progenitors and human brain cells.",

Specifically, how can self-replicating entities develop spontaneously from chemical reaction systems in which no reaction is self-replicating? Previous models either supply a framework for minimal living systems or only consider catalyzed reactions, and thus fail to provide a comprehensive theory. We establish a general model for chemical reaction systems that properly accounts for energetics, kinetics and conservation laws. We find that (1) some systems are collectively-catalytic (e.g., the citric acid cycle), while others self-replicate as a whole (e.g., the formose reaction); (2) side reactions do not always inhibit such systems; (3) many alternative chemical universes often contain one or more such systems; (4) in some self-replicating systems, the entropy of certain parts spontaneously decreases; (5) complex self-replicating molecules emerge spontaneously from simple reaction systems through a sequence of transitions. Together these results start to explain origins of prebiotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities have adapted to greatly variable environments in order to survive both short-term perturbations and permanent changes. The diauxic shift of Escherichia coli, growing first on glucose and, after it is exhausted, on acetate, is still today actively studied. As a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation, we are interested in understanding if diauxie in monocultures of E. coli is a coordinated and uniform metabolic shift, or rather the observable emergent result of individual sub-populations behavior. To do so we first develop a modeling framework that integrates dynamic models (ordinary differential equation systems) with structural models (metabolic networks), providing an open source modeling framework that is suitable to investigate the dynamics of microbial communities. We apply our methods to model E. coli either as having an average, unique metabolic state or as being the combination of two E. coli populations adapted to one of the two carbon sources. Our results are in strong agreement with previously published data and suggest that rather than a coordinated metabolic shift, diauxie could be the emergent pattern resulting from a survival strategy where individual cells differentiate for optimal growth on different substrates in view of environmental fluctuations. This work offers a new perspective on how to use dynamic metabolic modeling to investigate population dynamics, as the proposed approach can be easily transfered to studies on other multi-species communities as well as single cells.\\n\\nImportanceEscherichia coli diauxie is a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation that has not yet been completely understood, and to this aim approaches integrating experimental and theoretical biology are needed. We present a novel dynamic metabolic modeling approach that captures diauxie as an emergent property of sub-population dynamics rather than a homogeneous metabolic shift in E. coli monocultures. Without fine tuning of the parameters of E. coli core genome-scale model we obtain good agreement with published data. Our results suggest a change of paradigm in using single organism metabolic models, which can only to a certain approximation represent the average population metabolic state. We finally provide an open source modeling framework that can be applied to model multi-organism dynamics in variable environments.",

The use of antibiotics can alter gut microbiota composition, which can cause complications of various kinds. Here we report a whole genome sequencing metagenomic study of the intestinal microbiota changes caused by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. We have found the decrease in taxonomic alpha-diversity due to the therapy. The changes observed were more extensive for patients with duodenal ulcer and female ones. As well across the patients under the therapy we have detected the shifts in the metabolic potential and resistome. Seven KEGG pathways associated with quorum sensing, genetic Information processing and environmental Information processing were increased, while metabolic pathways related with metabolism of cofactors and vitamins and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism decreased. Changes in the resistome profile have also been identified. We observed perturbations in intraspecies structures, which were higher in group of patients under the therapy than in control group of people without treatment. The Eubacterium rectale pangenome extracted from metagenomic data were changed. We also isolated and sequenced Enterococcus faecium strains from two patients before and after eradication therapy. After the therapy this bacterium increased as the antibiotic resistance in vitro, as well the number of ARGs to macrolides and tetracyclines and metagenomic relative abundance in comparison with strains before therapy. In summary, microbial community demonstrated shift to reduce metabolic potential and to increased mechanisms, which mediate more survival condition through intraspecies perturbations.\\n\\nImportanceThe human gut microbiome plays an important role both in health and disease. The use of antibiotics can alter gut microbiota composition, which can cause complications of various kinds. H. pylori eradication therapy causes multiple shifts and alterations (including intraspecies changes) of the intestinal microbiota structure and leads to the accumulation of genes which determine resistance to macrolides. Since these changes are not the same for patients with various diseases, patients with duodenal ulcer may be further paid special attention for reducing side effects, such as antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Also, study of antibiotic treatment in terms of its impact upon the human gut microbiota allows shedding light on of the complex processes that cause accumulation and spread of antibiotic resistance. An identification and understanding of these complicated processes may help to constrain antibiotic resistance spread, which is of great importance for human health care.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput RNA-seq has revolutionized the process of small RNA (sRNA) discovery, leading to a rapid expansion of sRNA categories. In addition to the previously well-characterized sRNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), recent emerging studies have spotlighted on tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived sRNAs (rsRNAs) as new categories of sRNAs that bear versatile functions. Since existing software and pipelines for sRNA annotation are mostly focused on analyzing miRNAs or piRNAs, here we developed the sRNA annotation pipeline optimized for rRNA- and tRNA- derived sRNAs (SPORTS1.0). SPORTS1.0 is optimized for analyzing tsRNAs and rsRNAs from sRNA-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical sRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs. Moreover, SPORTS1.0 can predict potential RNA modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within sRNAs. SPORTS1.0 is precompiled to annotate sRNAs for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users input. For demonstration, by analyzing sRNA datasets using SPORTS1.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in tsRNAs and rsRNAs from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other sRNA species, tsRNAs bear the highest mismatch rate which is consistent with their highly modified nature. SPORTS1.0 is an open-source software and can be publically accessed at https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.0.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.To support the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the IPBES Expert Group on Scenarios and Models is carrying out an intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM). The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e. natures contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to explore a wide range of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the rationale for scenarios selection, the process of harmonizing input data for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem service models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of this collaborative modelling project will support the ongoing global assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modelling processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its development of a post-2020 strategic plans and conservation goals, and inform the development of a new generation of nature-centred scenarios.",

Using automated homecage training and a novel forelimb sensor, we trained freely-moving mice to initiate forelimb sequences with clearly resolved submillimeter-scale micromovements followed by millimeter-scale reaches to learned spatial targets. Hundreds of thousands of trajectories were decomposed into millions of kinematic primitives, while closed-loop photoinhibition was used to test roles of motor cortical areas. Inactivation of contralateral motor cortex reduced primitive peak speed but, surprisingly, did not substantially affect primitive direction, initiation, termination, or complexity, resulting in isomorphic, spatially contracted trajectories that undershot targets. Our findings demonstrate separable loss of a single kinematic parameter, speed, and identify conditions where loss of cortical drive reduces the gain of motor primitives but does not affect their generation, timing or direction. The combination of high precision forelimb sensing with automated training and neural manipulation provides a system for studying how motor sequences are constructed from elemental building blocks.",

    "abstract": "Automated data acquisition is now used widely for the single-particle averaging approach to reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) volumes of biological complexes preserved in vitreous ice and imaged in a transmission electron microscope (cryo-EM). Automation has become integral to this method because of the very large number of particle images required to be averaged in order to overcome the typically low signal-to-noise ratio of these images.\\n\\nFor optimal efficiency, all automated data acquisition software packages employ some degree of beam-image shift because this method is fast and accurate (+/- 0.1 m). Relocation to a targeted area under low-dose conditions can only be achieved using stage movements in combination with multiple iterations or long relaxation times, both reducing efficiency. It is, however, well known that applying beam-image shift induces beam-tilt and hence structure phase error. A {pi}/4 phase error is considered as the worst that can be accepted, and is used as an argument against the use of any beam-image shift for high resolution data collection.\\n\\nIn this study, we performed cryo-EM single-particle reconstructions on a T20S proteasome sample using applied beam-image shifts corresponding to beam tilts from 0 to 10 mrad. To evaluate the results we compared the FSC values, and examined the water density peaks in the 3D map. We conclude that the {pi}/4 phase error does not limit the validity of the 3D reconstruction from single-particle averaging beyond the {pi}/4 resolution limit.",

In land plants, however, the identity of motors responsible for transport is poorly understood, as genes encoding cytoplasmic dynein are missing. How other functions of dynein are brought about in plants also remains unknown. Here, we show that a subclass of the kinesin-14 family, KCH--which can also bind actin--drives MT minus end-directed nuclear transport in the moss Physcomitrella patens. When all four KCH genes were deleted, the nucleus was not maintained in the cell centre but was translocated to the apical end of protonemal cells. In the knockout (KO) line, apical cell tip growth was also severely suppressed. KCH was localised on MTs, including at the MT focal point near the tip where MT plus ends coalesced with actin filaments. MT focus was not persistent in KCH KO lines, whereas actin destabilisation also disrupted the focus despite KCH remaining on unfocused MTs. Functions of nuclear transport and tip growth were distinct, as a truncated KCH construct restored nuclear transport activity but not tip growth retardation of the KO line. Thus, our study identified KCH as a long-distance retrograde transporter as well as a cytoskeletal crosslinker, reminiscent of the versatile animal dynein.",

    "abstract": "Many biological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, are driven by mechanical sorting. However, the primary mechanical drivers of cell sorting remain controversial, in part because there remains a lack of appropriate threedimensional computational methods to probe the mechanical interactions that drive sorting. To address this important issue, we developed a three-dimensional, local force-based simulation method to enable such investigation into the sorting mechanisms of multicellular aggregates. Our method utilises the subcellular element method, in which cells are modeled as collections of locally-interacting force-bearing elements, accommodating cell growth and cell division. We define two different types of intracellular elements, assigning different attributes to boundary elements to model a cell cortex, which mediates the interfacial interaction between different cells. By tuning interfacial adhesion and tension in each cell cortex, we can control and predict the degree of sorting in cellular aggregates. The method is validated by comparing the interface areas of simulated cell doublets to experimental data and to previous theoretical work. We then define numerical measures of sorting and investigate the effects of mechanical parameters on the extent of sorting in multicellular aggregates. Using this method, we find that a minimum adhesion is required for differential interfacial tension to produce inside-out sorting of two cell types with different mechanical phenotypes. We predict the value of the minimum adhesion, which is in excellent agreement with observations in several developmental systems. We also predict the level of tension asymmetry needed for robust sorting. The generality and flexibility of the method make it applicable to tissue self-organization in a myriad of biological processes, such as tumorigenesis and embryogenesis.",

This modification is catalyzed by the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases including MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, SET1A and SET1B. Catalytic activity of MLL proteins is dependent on interactions with additional conserved proteins but the structural basis for subunit assembly and the mechanism of regulation is not well understood. We used a hybrid methods approach to study the assembly and biochemical function of the minimally active MLL1 complex (MLL1, WDR5 and RbBP5). A combination of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), NMR spectroscopy, and computational modeling were used to generate a dynamic ensemble model in which subunits are assembled via multiple weak interaction sites. We identified a new interaction site between the MLL1 SET domain and the WD40 repeat domain of RbBP5, and demonstrate the susceptibility of the catalytic function of the complex to disruption of individual interaction sites.",

    "abstract": "CHC22 clathrin plays a key role in intracellular membrane traffic of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in humans. We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding CLTCL1 gene, revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages, after arising from gene duplication. All vertebrates retained the paralogous CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin, which mediates endocytosis. For vertebrates retaining CLTCL1, strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality. All human populations maintained two high frequency CLTCL1 allelic variants, encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316. Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316, which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers, has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic, attenuating its insulin-regulated response. These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22s role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response.",

Here we tested the perceptual attributes of edge orientation processing when participants actively touched the stimulus. Our participants moved their finger over two pairs of edges-one pair parallel and the other nonparallel to varying degrees-and were asked to identify which of the two pairs was nonparallel. In addition to the psychophysical estimates of edge orientation acuity, we measured the speed at which participants moved their finger and the forces they exerted when moving their finger over the stimulus. We report four main findings. First, edge orientation acuity during active touch averaged 12.4{degrees}, similar to that previously reported during passive touch. Second, on average, participants moved their finger over the stimuli at 23.9 mm/s and exerted contact forces of 0.47 N. Third, across participants, there was no clear relationship between how people moved their finger or how they pressed on the stimulus and their edge orientation acuity. However, within participants, there appeared to be a weak effect of speed on performance whereby error trials included slightly faster finger movements; no equivalent effect was found for contact force. Fourth, consistent with previous work testing spatial acuity, we found significant correlation between fingertip size and orientation acuity such that people with smaller fingertips tended to have better orientation acuity.",

Towards this goal, we engineered an information transfer system for inter-cellular communication, using native gut Escherichia coli and attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Specifically, we have taken two genetic circuits-one for signaling from the quorum sensing system and the other for memory from the bacteriophage genetic switch-and integrated them into a robust system that can report on successful communication in the mammalian gut. Our system provides a basis for the construction of a programmable gut consortia as well as a basis for further understanding of bacterial interactions in an otherwise hard-to-study environment.",

Objectives To evaluate the plausibility of sunlight as a factor in populations average cholesterol and blood pressure Methods We analyzed World Health Organization data including 180 or more countries age-standardized average cholesterol, age-standardized mean systolic blood pressure (BP), and age-standardized prevalence of raised BP, by geographic latitude, over decades. We also performed analysis by ultraviolet B light (UVB) exposure. Results Mean cholesterol increases with the distance of a country from the Equator. This relationship has changed very little since 1980. Similarly, in 1975, mean systolic BP and prevalence of raised BP were higher in countries farther from the Equator. However, the relationship between latitude and BP has changed dramatically; by 2015, the opposite pattern was observed in women. Countries average UVB exposure has a stable relationship with cholesterol over recent decades, but a changing relationship with BP. Conclusions Since sunlight exposure in a country is relatively fixed and its relationship with BP has changed dramatically in recent decades, countries average sunlight exposure is an unlikely explanation for contemporary country-level variation in BP. However, our findings are consistent with a putative effect of sunlight on countries average cholesterol, as well as a no longer detectable effect on BP decades ago. A parsimonious potential explanation for the relationship between light and cholesterol is that 7-dehydrocholesterol can be converted to cholesterol, or in the presence of ultraviolet light, can instead be converted to vitamin D.",

These models exploit correlations between historical data, rather than explicitly describing relationships between cause and response variables. Therefore, they are unsuitable for capturing impacts beyond historically observed variability and cannot be employed to assess interventions. In this study, we integrate environmental and epidemiological processes into a new mechanistic model, taking the widespread parasitic disease of fasciolosis as an example. The model simulates environmental suitability for disease transmission, explicitly linking the parasite life-cycle to key weather-water-environment conditions. First, using epidemiological data, we show that the model can reproduce observed infection levels in time and space over two case studies in the UK. Second, to overcome data limitations, we propose a calibration approach based on Monte Carlo sampling and expert opinion, which allows constraint of the model in a process-based way, including a quantification of uncertainty. Finally, comparison with information from the literature and a widely-used empirical risk index shows that the simulated disease dynamics agree with what has been traditionally observed, and that the new model gives better insight into the time-space patterns of infection, which will be valuable for decision support.",

In this work, we produced vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles pseudotyped with the Gn and Gc glycoproteins of PUUV and applied site-directed mutagenesis to dissect the structure of neutralizing epitopes. Replacement of cysteine amino acid (aa) residues with alanines resulted in pseudotype particles with diminished (16 to 18%) neut-titers; double Cys[-&gt;]Ala mutants, as well as mutants with bulky aromatic and charged residues replaced with alanines, have shown even stronger reduction in neut-titers (from 25% to the escape phenotype). In silico modelling of the neut-epitopes supported the hypothesis that these critical residues are located on the surface of viral glycoprotein molecules and thus can be recognized by the antibodies indeed. Similar pattern was observed in experiments with mutant pseudotypes and sera collected from patients suggesting that these neut-epitopes are utilized in a course of human PUUV infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCENeutralization of viruses by antibodies is one of the key events in infection.

    "abstract": "Tropical Calcific Pancreatitis (TCP) is a neglected juvenile form of chronic non-alcoholic pancreatitis. Cathepsin B (CTSB), a lysososmal protease involved in cellular degradation process, is recently been studied as a potential candidate gene in the pathogenesis of TCP. According to cathepsin B hypothesis, mutated CTSB can lead to premature intracellular activation of trypsinogen, which is a key regulatory mechanism in pancreatitis. So far, CTSB mutations have been studied in pancreatitis and neurodegenerative disorders but little is known about the structural and functional effect of variants in CTSB. In this study, we investigated the effect of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with TCP, using molecular dynamics and simulation algorithms. There were two non-synonymous variants in the coding region (L26V and S53G) of CTSB, located in the propeptide region. We tried to predict the effect of these variants on structure and function using multiple algorithms: SIFT, Polyphen2, Panther, SDM sever, i-Mutant2.0 suite, mCSM algorithm and Vadar. Further, using databases like miRdbSNP, PolymiRTS and miRNASNP, two SNPs in 3UTR region were predicted to affect the miRNA binding sites. Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot. The results showed that the models (L26V and S53G) were of high accuracy. The 3D mutated structures were simulated using GROMACS 5.0 to predict the impact of these SNPs on protein stability. The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein. Hence, the structural and functional analysis results have given interim conclusions that these variants can have deleterious effect in TCP and thus should be screen in samples from all TCP patients to decipher its distribution in patient population.",

We first investigate the utility of this method for the prediction of essential genes and various unusual features in the genome of E. coli. We then apply the screen to discover E. coli genes required by phages {lambda}, T4 and 186 to kill their host. In particular, we show that colanic acid capsule is a barrier to all three phages. Finally, cloning the library on a plasmid that can be packaged by {lambda} enables to identify genes required for the formation of functional {lambda} capsids. This study demonstrates the usefulness and convenience of pooled genome-wide CRISPR-dCas9 screens in bacteria in order to identify genes linked to a given phenotype.",

We demonstrate here that this life extension is linked to the repression of cytoplasmic protein translation. Clk-1 mutations inhibit polyribosome formation similarly to daf-2 mutations that dampen insulin signaling. Comparisons of total versus polysomal RNAs in clk-1 mutants reveal a reduction in the translational efficiencies of mRNAs coding for elements of the translation machinery and an increase in those coding for the oxidative phosphorylation and autophagy pathways. Knocking down the transcription initiation factor TAF-4, a protein that becomes sequestered in the cytoplasm during early embryogenesis to induce transcriptional silencing, ameliorates the clk-1 inhibition of polyribosome formation. These results underscore a prominent role for the repression of cytoplasmic protein translation in eukaryotic lifespan extension, and suggest that mutations impairing mitochondrial function are able to exploit this repression similarly to reductions of insulin signaling. Moreover, this report reveals an unexpected role for TAF-4 as a repressor of polyribosome formation when ubiquinone biosynthesis is compromised.",

Using live imaging and novel morphometric methods we show that in addition to apical constriction, radially oriented directional intercalation of placodal cells plays a major contribution to the early stages of invagination of the salivary gland tube in the Drosophila embryo. Extending analyses in 3D, we find that near the pit of invagination, isotropic apical constriction leads to strong cell wedging, and further from the pit cells interleave circumferentially, suggesting apically driven behaviours. Supporting this, junctional myosin is enriched in, and neighbour exchanges biased towards the circumferential orientation. In a mutant failing pit specification, neither are biased due to an inactive pit. Thus, tube budding depends on a radially polarised pattern of apical myosin leading to radially oriented 3D cell behaviours, with a close mechanical interplay between invagination and intercalation.",

    "abstract": "Growing recognition of the pivotal role microglia play in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders has accentuated the need to better characterize their function in health and disease. Studies in mouse, have applied transcriptome-wide profiling of microglia to reveal key features of microglial ontogeny, functional profile and phenotypic diversity. Whilst similar in many ways, human microglia exhibit clear differences to their mouse counterparts, underlining the need to develop a better understanding of the human microglial profile. On examining published microglia gene signatures, little consistency was observed between studies. Hence, we set out to define a conserved microglia signature of the human central nervous system (CNS), through a comprehensive meta-analysis of existing transcriptomic resources. Nine datasets derived from cells and tissue, isolated from different regions of the CNS across numerous donors, were subjected independently to an unbiased correlation network analysis. From each dataset, a list of coexpressing genes corresponding to microglia was identified. Comparison of individual microglia clusters showed 249 genes highly conserved between them. This core gene signature included all known markers and improves upon published microglial signatures. The utility of this signature was demonstrated by its use in detecting qualitative and quantitative region-specific alterations in aging and Alzheimers disease. These analyses highlighted the reactive response of microglia in vulnerable brain regions such as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, additionally implicating pathways associated with disease progression. We believe this resource and the analyses described here, will support further investigations in the contribution of human microglia towards the CNS in health and disease.\\n\\nTable of ContentsMain points O_LIPublished microglial transcriptional signatures in mouse and human show poor consensus.\\nC_LIO_LIA core transcriptional signature of human microglia with 249 genes was derived and found conserved across brain regions, encompassing the CNS.\\nC_LIO_LIThe signature revealed region-dependent microglial alterations in Alzheimers, highlighting susceptible CNS regions and the involvement of TYROBP signaling.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The biosynthesis of yeast phosphatidylglycerol (PG) takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Outside mitochondria, the abundance of PG is low. Here we present evidence that the subcellular distribution of PG is maintained by locally controlled enzymatic activity of the PG-specific phospholipase, Pgc1. We document that the Pgc1 absence leads to spreading of PG over various cellular membranes. Fluorescently labeled Pgc1 protein strongly accumulates at the surface of lipid droplets (LD). We show, however, that LD are not only dispensable for Pgc1-mediated PG degradation, but even host no phospholipase activity of Pgc1. Our in vitro assays document the capability of LD-accumulated Pgc1 to degrade PG upon entry to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and even of artificial phospholipid vesicles. FRAP analysis confirms continuous exchange of GFP-Pgc1 within individual LD in situ, suggesting that a steady-state equilibrium exists between LD and membranes to regulate immediate phospholipase activity of Pgc1. In this model, LD serve as storage place and shelter Pgc1 preventing untimely degradation, while both phospholipase activity and degradation of the enzyme occur in membranes.",

    "abstract": "Postzygotic single-nucleotide mosaicisms (pSNMs) have been extensively studied in tumors and are known to play critical roles in tumorigenesis. However, the patterns and origin of pSNMs in normal organs of healthy humans remain largely unknown. Using whole-genome sequencing and ultra-deep amplicon re-sequencing, we identified and validated 164 pSNMs from 27 postmortem organ samples obtained from five healthy donors. The mutant allele fractions ranged from 1.0% to 29.7%. Inter- and intra-organ comparison revealed two distinctive types of pSNMs, with about half originating during early embryogenesis (embryonic pSNMs) and the remaining more likely to result from clonal expansion events that had occurred more recently (clonal expansion pSNMs). Compared to clonal expansion pSNMs, embryonic pSNMs had higher proportion of C>T mutations with elevated mutation rate at CpG sites. We observed differences in replication timing between these two types of pSNMs, with embryonic and clonal expansion pSNMs enriched in early- and late-replicating regions, respectively. An increased number of embryonic pSNMs were located in open chromatin states and topologically associating domains that transcribed embryonically. Our findings provide new insights into the origin and spatial distribution of postzygotic mosaicism during normal human development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenomic mosaicism led by postzygotic mutation is the major cause of cancers and many non-cancer developmental disorders. Theoretically, postzygotic mutations should be accumulated during the developmental process of healthy individuals, but the genome-wide characterization of postzygotic mosaicisms across many organ types of the same individual remained limited. In this study, we identified and validated two types of postzygotic mosaicism from the whole-genomes of 27 organs obtained from five healthy donors. We further found that the postzygotic mosaicisms arising during early embryogenesis and later clonal expansion events show distinct genomic patterns in mutation spectrum, replication timing, and chromatin status.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous transcription factor Specificity protein 1 (SP1) is heavily modified post-translationally. These modifications are critical for switching its functions and modulation of its transcriptional activity, DNA-binding and stability. However the mechanism governing the stability of SP1 by cellular signaling pathways is not well understood. Here, we provide biochemical and functional evidences that SP1 is an integral part of the Wnt signaling pathway. We identified a phosphodegron motif in SP1 that is specific to mammals. In absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3{beta} kinase mediated phosphorylation and {beta}-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase mediated ubiquitination is required to induce SP1 degradation. When Wnt signaling is on, SP1 is stabilized in {beta}-catenin-dependent manner. SP1 directly interacts with {beta}-catenin and Wnt signaling induces the stabilization of SP1 by impeding its interaction with {beta}-TrCP and AXIN1, components of the destruction complex. Wnt signaling suppresses ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation of SP1. Furthermore, SP1 regulates Wnt-dependent stability of {beta}-catenin and their mutual stabilization is critical for target gene expression, suggesting a feedback mechanism. Upon stabilization SP1 and {beta}-catenin co-occupy the promoters of TCFL2/{beta}-catenin target genes. Collectively, this study uncovers a direct link between SP1 and {beta}-catenin in Wnt signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Information is encoded within neural networks through synaptic weight changes. Synaptic learning rules involve a combination of rapid Hebbian plasticity with slower homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) that regulates neuronal activity through global synaptic scaling. While Hebbian plasticity has been extensively investigated, much less is known about HSP. Here we investigate the structural and functional consequences of HSP at dendritic spines of mouse hippocampal neurons. We find that prolonged activity blockade induces spine growth, paralleling synaptic strength increases. Following activity blockade, glutamate uncaging-mediated long-term potentiation at single spines leads to size-dependent structural plasticity: smaller spines undergo robust growth, while larger spines remain unchanged. Moreover, we find that neighboring spines in the vicinity of the stimulated spine exhibit volume changes following HSP, indicating that plasticity has spread across a group of synapses. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity shape neural connectivity through coordinated structural plasticity of clustered inputs.",

    "abstract": "Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a massively multiplexed, phage-display based methodology for analyzing antibody binding specificities, with several advantages over existing techniques, including the uniformity and completeness of proteomic libraries, as well as high sample throughput and low cost. Data generated by the PhIP-Seq assay are unique in many ways. The only published analytical approach for these data suffers from important limitations. Here, we propose a new statistical framework with several improvements. Using a set of replicate mock immunoprecipitations (negative controls lacking antibody input) to generate background binding distributions, we establish a statistical model to quantify antibody-dependent changes in phage clone abundance. Our approach incorporates robust regression of experimental samples against the mock IPs as a means to calculate the expected phage clone abundance, and provides a generalized model for calculating each clones expected abundance-associated standard deviation. In terms of bias removal and detection sensitivity, we demonstrate that this z-score algorithm outperforms the previous approach. Further, in a large cohort of autoantibody-defined Sjogrens Syndrome (SS) patient sera, PhIP-Seq robustly identified Ro52, Ro60, and SSB/La as known autoantigens associated with SS. In an effort to identify novel SS-specific binding specificities, SS z-scores were compared with z-scores obtained by screening Ropositive sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This analysis did not yield any commonly targeted SS-specific autoantigens, suggesting that if they exist at all, their epitopes are likely to be discontinuous or post-translationally modified. In summary, we have developed an improved algorithm for PhIP-Seq data analysis, which was validated using a large set of sera with clinically characterized autoantibodies. This z-score approach will substantially improve the ability of PhIP-Seq to detect and interpret antibody binding specificities.

    "abstract": "Edible bananas result from interspecific hybridization between Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, as well as among subspecies in M. acuminata. Four particular M. acuminata subspecies have been proposed as the main contributors of edible bananas, all of which radiated in a short period of time in southeastern Asia. Clarifying the evolution of these lineages at a whole-genome scale is therefore an important step toward understanding the domestication and diversification of this crop. This study reports the de novo genome assembly and gene annotation of a representative genotype from three different subspecies of M. acuminata. These data are combined with the previously published genome of the fourth subspecies to investigate phylogenetic relationships and genome evolution. Analyses of shared and unique gene families reveal that the four subspecies are quite homogenous, with a core genome representing at least 50% of all genes and very few M. acuminata species-specific gene families. Multiple alignments indicate high sequence identity between homologous single copy-genes, supporting the close relationships of these lineages. Interestingly, phylogenomic analyses demonstrate high levels of gene tree discordance, due to both incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. This pattern suggests rapid radiation within Musa acuminata subspecies that occurred after the divergence with M. balbisiana. Introgression between M. a. ssp. malaccensis and M. a. ssp. burmannica was detected across a substantial portion of the genome, though multiple approaches to resolve the subspecies tree converged on the same topology. To support future evolutionary and functional analyses, we introduce the PanMusa database, which enables researchers to exploration of individual gene families and trees.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites are auxotrophic for a range of amino acids which must be salvaged from their host cells, either through direct uptake or degradation of host proteins. Here, we describe a family of plasma membrane-localized amino acid transporters, termed the Apicomplexan Amino acid Transporters (ApiATs), that are ubiquitous in apicomplexan parasites. Functional characterization of the ApiATs of Toxoplasma gondii indicate that several of these transporters are important for intracellular growth of the tachyzoite stage of the parasite, which is responsible for acute infections. We demonstrate that the ApiAT protein TgApiAT5-3 is an exchanger for aromatic and large neutral amino acids, with particular importance for L-tyrosine scavenging and amino acid homeostasis, and that TgApiAT5-3 is critical for parasite virulence. Our data indicate that T. gondii expresses additional proteins involved in the uptake of aromatic amino acids, and we present a model for the uptake and homeostasis of these amino acids. Our findings identify a family of amino acid transporters in apicomplexans, and highlight the importance of amino acid scavenging for the biology of this important phylum of intracellular parasites.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Apicomplexa comprise a large number of parasitic protozoa that have obligate intracellular lifestyles and cause significant human and animal diseases, including malaria, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis in poultry, and various cattle fevers. Apicomplexans must scavenge essential nutrients from their hosts in order to proliferate and cause disease, including a range of amino acids. The direct uptake of these nutrients is presumed to be mediated by transporter proteins located in the plasma membrane of intracellular stages, although the identities of these proteins are poorly defined. Using a combination of bioinformatic, genetic, cell biological, and physiological approaches, we have characterized a family of plasma membrane-localized transporter proteins that we have called the Apicomplexan Amino acid Transporters (ApiATs). The family is found in apicomplexans and their closest free-living relatives. We show that TgApiAT5-3, a member of the family in the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii, is an exchanger for aromatic and large neutral amino acids. In particular, it is critical for uptake of tyrosine, and for parasite virulence in a mouse infection model. We conclude that ApiATs are a family of plasma membrane transporters that play crucial roles in amino acid scavenging by apicomplexan parasites.",

Precursor lesions of PDAC, specifically, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) represent a bona fide pathway to invasive neoplasia, although the molecular correlates of progression remain to be fully elucidated. Single cell transcriptomics provides a unique avenue for dissecting both the epithelial and microenvironmental heterogeneity that accompany multistep progression from non-invasive IPMNs to PDAC.\\n\\nMethodsSingle cell RNA-sequencing was performed through droplet-based sequencing on 5,403 cells from two low-grade IPMNs (LGD-IPMN), two high-grade IPMNs (HGD-IPMN), and two PDACs (all surgically resected).\\n\\nResultsAnalysis of single cell transcriptomes revealed heterogeneous alterations within the epithelium and the tumor microenvironment during the progression of non-invasive dysplasia to invasive cancer. While HGD-IPMNs expressed many core-signaling pathways described in PDAC, LGD-IPMNs harbored subsets of single cells with a transcriptomic profile that overlapped with invasive cancer. Notably, a pro-inflammatory immune component was readily seen in low-grade IPMNs, comprised of cytotoxic T-cells, activated T-helper cells, and dendritic cells, which was progressively depleted during neoplastic progression, accompanied by infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Finally, stromal myofibroblast populations were heterogeneous, and acquired a previously described tumor-promoting and immune-evading phenotype during invasive carcinogenesis.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the ability to perform high resolution profiling of the transcriptomic changes that occur during multistep progression of cystic PDAC precursors to cancer. Notably, single cell analysis provides an unparalleled insight into both the epithelial and microenvironmental heterogeneity that accompany early cancer pathogenesis, and might be a useful substrate to identify targets for cancer interception.",

Neural representation of stimulus AM is successively transformed while processed by a cascade of brain regions in the auditory system.

We modelled the function of the auditory system with a deep neural network (DNN) optimized for natural sound recognition. Neurophysiological analysis of the DNN revealed that AM representation similar to the auditory system emerged during the optimization. The better-recognizing DNNs exhibited larger similarity to the auditory system. The control experiments suggest that the cascading architecture, the data structure, and the optimization objective may be essential factors for the lower, middle and higher regions, respectively.

Here, we show that PSM1 and PSM4, involved in biofilm structuring, form canonical cross-{beta} amyloid fibrils wherein {beta}-sheets tightly mate through steric zipper interfaces, conferring high stability. Contrastingly, a truncated PSM3 has antibacterial activity, forms reversible fibrils, and reveals two polymorphic and atypical {beta}-rich fibril architectures. These architectures are radically different from both the cross- fibrils formed by full-length PSM3, and from the canonical cross-{beta} fibrils.

Correlation between characters can originate from intra-organismal features, shared phylogenetic history or forced by particular character-state coding schemes. Although the two first sources can be investigated by biologists a posteriori and the third one can be avoided a priori with good practices, phylogenetic software do not distinguish between any of them.\\n\\nIn this study, we propose a new metric of raw character difference as a proxy for character correlation. Using thorough simulations, we test the effect of increasing or decreasing character differences on tree topology. Overall, we found an expected positive effect of reducing character correlations on recovering the correct topology. However, this effect is less important for matrices with a small number of taxa (25 in our simulations) where reducing character correlation is not more effective than randomly drawing characters. Furthermore, in bigger matrices (350 characters), there is a strong effect of the inference method with Bayesian trees being consistently less affected by character correlation than maximum parsimony trees.\\n\\nThese results suggest that ignoring the problem of character correlation or independence can often impact topology in phylogenetic analysis.

    "abstract": "The functionality of distinct types of protein networks depends on the patterns of protein-protein interactions. A problem to solve is understanding the fragility of protein networks to predict system malfunctioning due to mutations and other errors. Spectral graph theory provides tools to understand the structural and dynamical properties of a system based on the mathematical properties of matrices associated with the networks. We combined two of such tools to explore the fragility to cascading effects of the network describing protein interactions within a key macromolecular complex, the spliceosome. Using S. cerevisiae as a model system we show that the spliceosome network has more indirect paths connecting proteins than random networks. Such multiplicity of paths may promote routes to cascading effects to propagate across the network. However, the modular network structure concentrates paths within modules, thus constraining the propagation of such cascading effects, as indicated by analytical results from the spectral graph theory and by numerical simulations of a minimal mathematical model parameterized with the spliceosome network. We hypothesize that the concentration of paths within modules favors robustness of the spliceosome against failure, but may lead to a higher vulnerability of functional subunits which may affect the temporal assembly of the spliceosome. Our results illustrate the utility of spectral graph theory for identifying fragile spots in biological systems and predicting their implications.",

    "abstract": "Integration of electronic health records with systems-level biomolecular data has led to the discovery that GlycA, a complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy biomarker, predicts long-term risk of disease onset and death from myriad causes. To determine the molecular underpinnings of the disease risk of the heterogeneous GlycA signal, we used machine learning to build imputation models for GlycAs constituent glycoproteins, then estimated glycoprotein levels in 11,861 adults across two population-based cohorts with long-term follow-up. While alpha-1-acid glycoprotein had the strongest correlation with GlycA, our analysis revealed that alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) was the most predictive of morbidity and mortality for the widest range of diseases, including heart failure (HR=1.60 per s.d., P=1x10-10), influenza and pneumonia (HR=1.37, P=6x10-10), and liver diseases (HR=1.81, P=1x10-6). Despite emerging evidence of AAT's role in suppressing inflammation, transcriptional analyses revealed elevated expression of diverse inflammatory immune pathways with elevated AAT levels, suggesting AAT is elevating to compensate for low-grade chronic inflammation. This study clarifies the molecular underpinnings of the GlycA biomarker and its associated disease risk, and indicates a previously unrecognised association between elevated AAT and severe disease onset and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin can enhance empathy although it is unclear which specific behavioral and neural aspects are influenced, and whether the effects are modulated by culture, sex and trait autism. Based on previous findings in Caucasian men, we hypothesized that a single intranasal dose of oxytocin would specifically enhance emotional empathy via modulatory effects on the amygdala in an Asian (Chinese) population and explored the modulatory role of sex and trait autism on the effects. We first conducted a double-blind, randomized between-subject design experiment using a modified version of the multifaceted empathy task (MET) to determine whether oxytocins facilitation of emotional empathy can be replicated in Chinese men (n = 60). To further explore neural mechanisms behind and potential sex differences, functional MRI and skin conductance measures were acquired in an independent experiment incorporating men and women (n = 72). Oxytocin enhanced emotional empathy across experiments and sex, an effect that was accompanied by reduced amygdala activity and increased skin conductance responses. On the network level oxytocin enhanced functional coupling of the right amygdala with the insula and posterior cingulate cortex for positive valence stimuli but attenuated coupling for negative valence stimuli. The effect of oxytocin on amygdala functional connectivity with the insula was modulated by trait autism. Overall, our findings provide further support for the role of oxytocin in facilitating emotional empathy and demonstrate that effects are independent of culture and sex and involve modulatory effects on the amygdala and its interactions with other key empathy regions.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity in the premotor and motor cortex shows prominent structure in the beta frequency range (13-30 Hz). Currently, the behavioral relevance of beta band activity (BBA) in premotor and motor regions is not well understood. The underlying source of motor BBA and how it changes as a function of cortical depth is also unknown. Here, we addressed these unresolved questions by investigating BBA recorded using laminar electrodes in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of two male rhesus macaques performing a visual reaction time (RT) reach discrimination task. We observed robust BBA before and after the onset of the visual stimulus but not during the arm movement. While post-stimulus BBA was positively correlated with RT throughout the beta frequency range, pre-stimulus correlation varied by frequency. Low beta frequencies (~15 to 20 Hz) were positively correlated with RT and high beta frequencies (~25 to 30 Hz) were negatively correlated with RT. Simulations suggested that these frequency-dependent correlations could be due to a shift in the component frequencies of the pre-stimulus BBA as a function of RT, such that faster RTs are accompanied by greater power in high beta frequencies. We also observed a laminar dependence of BBA, with deeper electrodes demonstrating stronger power in low beta frequencies both pre- and post-stimulus. The heterogeneous nature of BBA and the changing relationship between BBA and RT in different task epochs may be a sign of the differential network dynamics involved in expectation, decision-making, and motor preparation.",

    "abstract": "Specific antibody reactivities are routinely used as biomarkers but the use of antibody repertoire profiles is still awaiting recognition. Here we suggest to expedite the adoption of this class of system level biomarkers by rationally designing a peptide array as an efficient probe for an appropriately chosen repertoire compartment. Most IgM antibodies are characterized by few somatic mutations, polyspecificity and physiological autoreactivity with housekeeping function. Previously, probing this repertoire with a set of immunodominant self-proteins provided only coarse information on repertoire profiles. In contrast, here we describe the rational selection of a peptide mimotope set, appropriately sized as a potential diagnostic, that also represents optimally the diversity of the human public IgM reactivities. A 7-mer random peptide phage display library was panned on pooled human IgM. Next generation sequencing of the selected phage yielded a non-exhaustive set of 224087 mimotopes which clustered in 790 sequence clusters. A set of 594 mimotopes, representative of the most significant clusters, was used to demonstrate that this approach samples symmetrically the space of IgM reactivities. When probed with diverse patients sera in an oriented peptide array, this set produced a higher and more dynamic signal as compared to 1) random peptides, 2) random peptides purged of mimotope-like sequences and 3) mimotopes from a small subset of clusters. In this respect, the representative library is an optimized probe of the human IgM diversity. Proof of principle predictors for randomly selected diagnoses based on the optimized library demonstrated that it contains more than 1070 different profiles with the capacity to correlate with diverse pathologies. Thus, an optimized small library of IgM mimotopes is found to address very efficiently the dynamic diversity of the human IgM repertoire providing informationally dense and structurally interpretable IgM reactivity profiles.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe presence in the blood of antibodies specific for a particular infectious agent is used routinely as a diagnostic tool. The overall profile of available antibody reactivities (or their repertoire) in an individual has been studied much less. As an omics approach to immunity it can be a rich source of information about the system beyond just the individual history of antigenic exposure. Using a subset of antibodies - IgM, which are involved also in housekeeping functions like removing dead cells, and bacteriophage based techniques for selection of specific peptides, we managed to define a non-exhaustive set of 224087 peptides recognized by IgM antibodies present in most individuals. They were found to group naturally in 790 structural groups. Limiting these to the most outstanding 594 groups, we used one representative from each group to assemble a reasonably small set of peptides that extracts the maximum information from the antibody repertoire at a minimum cost per test. We demonstrate, that this representative peptide library is a better probe of the human IgM diversity than comparably sized libraries constructed on other principles. The optimized library contains more than 1070 different potentially profiles useful for the diagnosis, prognosis or monitoring of inflammatory and infectious conditions, tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, etc.",

To address these challenges, we developed an interactive web application that enables exploration of the chemical-biological interaction space. Compound-target interaction data from public resources were quantified for over 280,000 molecules. Each molecule was annotated with a name and chemical structure, and every target was annotated with gene identifiers. The Drug-Target Explorer allows users to query molecules within this database of experimentally-derived and curated compound-target interactions and identify structurally similar molecules. It also enables network-based visualizations of the compound-target interaction space, and incorporates comparisons to publicly-available in vitro HTS datasets. Users can also identify compounds given one or more targets of interest. The Drug Target Explorer is a multifunctional platform for exploring chemical space as it relates to biological targets, and may be useful at several steps along the drug development pipeline including target discovery, structure-activity relationship, and lead compound identification studies.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial functional photoacoustic (fPA) voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging promises to overcome current temporal and spatial limitations of current neuroimaging modalities. The technique previously distinguished global seizure activity from control neural activity in groups of rats. To validate the focal specificity of transcranial fPA neuroimaging in vivo, we now present proofs-of-concept that the results differentiate between low- and high-dose N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) evoked neural activity in rat hippocampus. Concurrent quantitative EEG (qEEG) and microdialysis recorded real-time circuit dynamics and glutamate concentration change, respectively. We hypothesized that location-specific fPA VSD contrast would identify the neural dynamics in hippocampus with the correlation to NMDA evoked focal glutamate release and time-specific EEG signals. To test the hypothesis, we infused 0.3 to 3.0 mM NMDA at 2 l/min over 60 min via an implanted microdialysis probe. The dialysate samples collected every 20 min during the infusion were analyzed for focal changes in extracellular glutamate release. Transcranial fPA VSD imaging provided NMDA-evoked VSD responses with positive correlation to extracellular glutamate concentration change at the contralateral side of the microdialysis probe. The graded response represents the all-or-none gating system of the dentate gyrus (DG) in hippocampus. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) successfully confirmed induction of focal seizure activity during NMDA infusion. We conclude that transcranial fPA VSD imaging distinguished graded DG gatekeeping functions, based on the VSD redistribution mechanism sensitive to electrophysiologic membrane potential. The results suggest the potential future use of this emerging technology in clinics and science as an innovative and significant functional neuroimaging modality.",

    "abstract": "Monophasic and biphasic TMS pulses and coil orientations produce different responses in terms of motor output and sensory perception. Those differences have been attributed to the activation of specific neural populations. However, up to date, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is still missing since studies were mostly based on indirect measures of cortical activation, i.e., motor evoked potentials or phosphenes. Here, we investigated for the first time the impact of different coil orientations and waveforms on a non-primary cortical area, namely the premotor cortex, by measuring TMS evoked EEG potentials (TEPs). We aimed at determining whether TEPs produced by differently oriented biphasic and monophasic TMS pulses diverge and whether these differences are underpinned by the activation of specific neural populations. To do so, we applied TMS over the right premotor cortex with monophasic or biphasic waveforms oriented perpendicularly (in the anterior-posterior direction and vice-versa) or parallel (latero-medial or medio-laterally) to the target gyrus. EEG was concurrently recorded from 60 electrodes. We analyzed TEPs at the level of EEG sensors and cortical sources both in time and time-frequency domain. Biphasic pulses evoked larger early TEP components, which reflect cortical excitability properties of the underlying cortex, in both parallel directions when compared to the perpendicular conditions. Conversely, monophasic pulses, when oriented perpendicularly to the stimulated gyrus, elicited a greater N100, which is a reliable TEP component linked to GABAb-mediated inhibitory processes, than when parallel to the gyrus. Our results provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that TMS pulse waveform and TMS coil orientations affect which neural population is engaged.",

To investigate the role of transformation in the acquisition of resistance determinants by this species, the susceptible strain A118 was exposed to genomic DNA of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp). Resistant transformants were obtained and an increase in the resistance level to all {beta}-lactam antibiotics was observed. Whole genome analysis of transformant clones demonstrated the acquisition of CRKp DNA. The most frequently acquired genes correspond to mobile elements, antibiotic resistance genes, and operons involved in metabolism. Bioinformatic analyses and in silico gene flow prediction strengthen our findings, showing that a continuing exchange of genetic material between A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae occurs when they share the same niche. Our results reinforce the idea that natural transformation may play a key role in the increasing emergence of A. baumannii MDR.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESince the characterization of antibiotic resistance in the late  50s, antibiotic resistance propagation was classically associated with horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by plasmids bearing multiple resistance genes.

    "abstract": "Occupational exposure to harmful bioaerosols in industrial environments is a real treat to the workers. In particular, dairy-farm workers are exposed to high levels of fungal bioaerosols on a daily basis. Associating bioaerosol exposure and health problems is challenging and adequate exposure monitoring is a top priority for aerosol scientists. Using only culture-based tools do not express the overall microbial diversity and underestimate the large spectrum of microbes in bioaerosols and therefore the identification of new airborne etiological agents. The aim of this study was to provide an in-depth characterization of fungal exposure at Eastern Canadian dairy farms using qPCR and next-generation sequencing methods. Concentrations of Penicillium/Aspergillus ranged from 4.6 x 106 to 9.4 x 106 gene copies/m3 and from 1 x 104 gene copies/m3 to 4.8 x 105 gene copies/m3 for Aspergillus fumigatus. Differences in the diversity profiles of the five dairy farms support the idea that the novel approach identifies a large number of fungal taxa. These variations may be explained by the presence of different and multiple sources of fungal bioaerosols at dairy farms. The presence of a diverse portrait of fungi in air may represent a health risk for workers who are exposed on a daily basis. In some cases, the allergen/infective activity of the fungi may not be known and can increase the risks to workers. The broad spectrum of fungi detected in this study includes many known pathogens and proves that adequate monitoring of bioaerosol exposure is necessary to evaluate and minimize risks.\\n\\nImportanceWhile bioaerosols are a major concern for public health, accurately assessing human exposure is challenging. Highly contaminated environments, such as agricultural facilities, contain a broad diversity of aerosolized fungi that may impact human health. Effective bioaerosol monitoring is increasingly recognized as a strategic approach for achieving occupational exposure description. Workers exposure to diverse fungal communities is certain, as fungi are ubiquitous in the environments and the presence of potential sources increase their presence in the air. Applying new molecular approaches to describe occupational exposure is a necessary work around the traditional culture approaches and the biases they introduce to such studies. The importance of the newly developed approach can help to prevent workers health problems.",

    "abstract": "Hormones such as glucocorticoids (colloquially referred to as \"stress hormones\") have important effects on animal behavior and life history traits, yet most of this understanding has come through correlative studies. While experimental studies offer the ability to assign causality, there are important methodological concerns that are often not considered when manipulating hormones, including glucocorticoids, in wild animals. In this study, we examined how experimental elevations of cortisol concentrations in wild North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) affected their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity, and life history traits including body mass, litter survival, and adult survival. The effects of exogenous cortisol on plasma cortisol concentrations depended on the time between treatment consumption and blood sampling. In the first nine hours after consumption of exogenous cortisol, individuals had significantly higher true baseline plasma cortisol concentrations, but adrenal gland function was impaired as indicated by their dampened response to capture and handling and to injections of adrenocorticotropic hormone compared to controls. Approximately 24 hours after consumption of exogenous cortisol, individuals had much lower plasma cortisol concentrations than controls, but adrenal function was restored. Corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) concentrations were also significantly reduced in squirrels treated with cortisol. Despite these profound shifts in the functionality of the HPA axis, squirrel body mass, offspring survival, and adult survival were unaffected by experimental increases in cortisol concentrations. Our results highlight that even short-term experimental increases in glucocorticoids can affect adrenal gland functioning and CBG concentrations but without other side-effects.",
