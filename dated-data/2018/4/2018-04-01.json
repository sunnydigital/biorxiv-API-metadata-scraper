    "abstract": "Ventral visual stream neural responses are dynamic, even for static image presentations. However, dynamical neural models of visual cortex are lacking as most progress has been made modeling static, time-averaged responses. Here, we studied population neural dynamics during face detection across three cortical processing stages. Remarkably, ~30 milliseconds after the initially evoked response, we found that neurons in intermediate level areas decreased their preference for faces, becoming anti-face preferring on average even while neurons in higher level areas achieved and maintained a face preference. This pattern of hierarchical neural dynamics was inconsistent with extensions of standard feedforward circuits that implemented recurrence within a cortical stage. Rather, recurrent models computing errors between stages captured the observed temporal signatures. Without additional parameter fitting, this model of neural dynamics, which simply augments the standard feedforward model of online vision to encode errors, also explained seemingly disparate dynamical phenomena in the ventral stream.",

    "abstract": "Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryResting state fMRI has become a ubiquitous tool for measuring connectivity in normal and diseased brains. Current dominant models of connectivity are based on coarse-scale connectivity among brain regions, ignoring fine-scale structure within those regions. We developed a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome that captures both coarse and fine-scale structure of connectivity shared across brains. We showed that this shared fine-scale structure is related to fine-scale distinctions in representation of information, and our model accounts for substantially more shared variance of connectivity compared to previous models. Our model opens new territory -- shared fine-scale structure, a dominant but mostly unexplored component of the human connectome -- for analysis and study.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity plays a central role in tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. Experiments are shedding light on this diversity at ever finer scales, but interpretation is challenging. Using recent progress in numerical models, we simulate macroscopic tumors to investigate the interplay between growth dynamics, microscopic composition, and circulating tumor cell cluster diversity. We find that modest differences in growth parameters can profoundly change microscopic diversity. Simple outwards expansion leads to spatially segregated clones and low diversity, as expected. However, a modest cell turnover can result in an increased number of divisions and mixing among clones resulting in increased microscopic diversity in the tumor core. Using simulations to estimate power to detect such spatial trends, we find that multiregion sequencing data from contemporary studies is marginally powered to detect the predicted effects. Slightly larger samples, improved detection of rare variants, or sequencing of smaller biopsies or circulating tumor cell clusters would allow one to distinguish between leading models of tumor evolution. The genetic composition of circulating tumor cell clusters, which can be obtained from non-invasive blood draws, is therefore informative about tumor evolution and its metastatic potential.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LINumerical and theoretical models show interaction of front expansion, mutation, and clonal mixing in shaping tumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LICell turnover increases intratumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LISimulated circulating tumor cell clusters and microbiopsies exhibit substantial diversity with strong spatial trends.\\nC_LIO_LISimulations suggest attainable sampling schemes able to distinguish between prevalent tumor growth models.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroDatas MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ({approx}6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies--much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.",

    "abstract": "Behavior relies on the ability of sensory systems to infer properties of the environment from incoming stimuli. The accuracy of inference depends on the fidelity with which behaviorally-relevant properties of stimuli are encoded in neural responses. High-fidelity encodings can be metabolically costly, but low-fidelity encodings can cause errors in inference. Here, we discuss general principles that underlie the tradeoff between encoding cost and inference error. We then derive adaptive encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this tradeoff. These optimal encodings tend to increase the fidelity of the neural representation following a change in the stimulus distribution, and reduce fidelity for stimuli that originate from a known distribution. We predict dynamical signatures of such encoding schemes and demonstrate how known phenomena, such as burst coding and firing rate adaptation, can be understood as hallmarks of optimal coding for accurate inference.",

    "abstract": "Type IV pili are expressed by a wide range of prokaryotes, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These flexible fibres mediate twitching motility, biofilm maturation, surface adhesion, and virulence. The pilus is composed mainly of major pilin subunits while the low abundance minor pilins FimU-PilVWXE and the putative adhesin PilY1 prime pilus assembly and are proposed to form the pilus tip. The minor pilins and PilY1 are encoded in an operon that is positively regulated by the FimS-AlgR two-component system. Independent of pilus assembly, PilY1 is proposed to be a mechanosensory component that - in conjunction with minor pilins - triggers up-regulation of acute virulence phenotypes upon surface attachment. Here, we investigated the link between the minor pilins and virulence. pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants had reduced virulence towards Caenorhabditis elegans relative to wild type or a major pilin mutant, implying a role in pathogenicity that is independent of pilus assembly. We hypothesized that loss of specific minor pilins relieves feedback inhibition on FimS-AlgR, increasing transcription of the minor pilin operon and other members of the AlgR regulon. Reporter assays confirmed that FimS-AlgR were required for the increased expression from the minor pilin operon promoter upon loss of select minor pilins. Overexpression of AlgR or its hyperactivation via point mutation reduced virulence, and the virulence defects of pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants were dependent on FimS-AlgR expression and activation. We propose that PilY1 and the minor pilins inhibit their own expression, and that loss of these proteins leads to FimS-mediated activation of AlgR and reduced expression of acute-phase virulence factors. This mechanism could contribute to adaptation of P. aeruginosa in chronic lung infections, as mutations in the minor pilin operon result in the loss of piliation and increased expression of AlgR-dependent virulence factors - such as alginate - that are characteristic of such infections.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPseudomonas aeruginosa causes dangerous infections, including chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. It uses many strategies to infect its hosts, including deployment of grappling hook-like fibres called type IV pili. Among the components involved in assembly and function of the pilus are five proteins called minor pilins that - along with a larger protein called PilY1 - may help the pilus attach to surfaces. In a roundworm infection model, loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins delayed killing, while loss of other pilus proteins did not. We traced this effect to increased activation of the FimS-AlgR regulatory system that inhibits expression of virulence factors used to initiate infections, while positively regulating chronic infection traits such as alginate production, a phenotype called mucoidy. A disruption in the appropriate timing of FimS-AlgR-dependent virulence factor expression when select minor pilins or PilY1 are missing may explain why those pilus-deficient mutants have reduced virulence compared with others whose products are not under FimS-AlgR control. Increased FimS-AlgR activity upon loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of the non-piliated and mucoid phenotypes that are hallmarks of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic (or human-caused) wildfire is an increasingly important driver of ecological change on Pacific islands including southeastern Polynesia, but fire ecology studies are almost completely absent for this region. Where observations do exist, they mostly represent descriptions of fire effects on plant communities before the introduction of invasive species in the modern era. Understanding the effects of wildfire in southeastern Polynesian island vegetation communities can elucidate which species may become problematic invasives with continued wildfire activity. We investigate the effects of wildfire on vegetation in three low-elevation sites (45-379 m) on the island of Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, which are already heavily impacted by past human land use and invasive exotic plants, but retain some native flora. In six study areas (3 burned and 3 unburned comparisons), we placed 30 transects across sites and collected species and abundance information at 390 points. We analyzed each local community of plants in three categories: natives, those introduced by Polynesians before European contact (1767 C.E.), and those introduced since European contact. Burned areas had the same or lower mean species richness than paired comparison sites. Although wildfire did not affect the proportions of native and introduced species, it may increase the abundance of introduced species on some sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicates that (not recently modified) comparison plant communities are more distinct from one another than are those on burned sites. We discuss conservation concerns for particular native plants absent from burned sites, as well as invasive species (including Lantana camara and Paraserianthes falcataria) that may be promoted by fire in the Pacific.",

Females release Z4-11Al at 2.4 ng/h and we readily sense 1 ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine (0.03 nmol/L), while a tenfold concentration is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al. The biological role of Z4-11Al or structurally related aldehydes in humans and the basis for this semiochemical convergence remains yet unclear.",

    "abstract": "The origin of insect wings has long been debated. Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the legs epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments",

    "abstract": "The analysis of the brain from a connectivity perspective is unveiling novel insights into brain structure and function. Discovery is, however, hindered by the lack of prior knowledge used to make hypotheses. On the other hand, exploratory data analysis is made complex by the high dimensionality of data. Indeed, in order to assess the effect of pathological states on brain networks, neuroscientists are often required to evaluate experimental effects in case-control studies, with hundreds of thousand connections.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to identify the multivariate relationships in brain connections that characterise two distinct groups, hence permitting the investigators to immediately discover sub-networks that contain information about the differences between experimental groups. In particular, we are interested in data discovery related to connectomics, where the connections that characterize differences between two groups of subjects are found. Nevertheless, those connections not necessarily maximize accuracy in classification since this does not guarantee reliable interpretation of specific differences between groups. In practice, our method exploits recent machine learning techniques employing sparsity to deal with weighted networks describing the whole-brain macro connectivity. We evaluated our technique on functional and structural connectomes from human and mice brain data. In our experiments, we automatically identified disease-relevant connections in datasets with supervised and unsupervised anatomy-driven parcellation approaches, and by using high-dimensional datasets.",

NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice2-4. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)5. Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the viral capsid protein in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and capsid expression post-transcriptionally downregulated UPF1, a process that we confirmed occurs during de novo ZIKV infection. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures. We therefore propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to dampen antiviral activities of NMD6,7, which subsequently contributes to neuropathology in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are usually deciphered by translation of the coding genome; however, their amino acid residues are seldom determined directly across the proteome. Herein, we describe a systematic workflow for identifying all possible protein residues that differ from the coding genome, termed noncoded amino acids (ncAAs). By measuring the mass differences between the coding amino acids and the actual protein residues in human spermatozoa, over a million nonzero delta masses were detected, fallen into 424 high-quality Gaussian clusters and 571 high-confidence ncAAs spanning 29,053 protein sites. Most ncAAs are novel with unresolved side-chains and discriminative between healthy individuals and patients with oligoasthenospermia. For validation, 40 out of 98 ncAAs that matched with amino acid substitutions were confirmed by exon sequencing.

Here we report a striking behavior of Euglena gracilis, where Euglena cells swim in polygonal trajectories due to exposure to increasing light intensities. While smoothly curved trajectories are common for microswimmers 3, 8, such quantized ones have not been reported previously. This polygonal behavior emerges from periodic switching between the flagellar beating patterns of helical swimming 6, 9 and spinning 10 behaviors. We develop and experimentally validate a biophysical model that describes the phase relationship between the eyespot, cell orientation, light detection, and cellular reorientation, that accounts for all three behavioral states. Coordinated switching between these behaviors allows ballistic, superdiffusive, diffusive, or subdiffusive motion 11,12 (i.e., the tuning of the diffusion constant over 3 orders of magnitude) and enables navigation in structured light fields, e.g., edge avoidance and gradient descent. This feedback-control links multiple system scales (flagellar beats, cellular behaviors, phototaxis strategies) with implications for other natural and synthetic microswimmers 13.",

    "abstract": "We have discovered the expression of CD56 on the intravascular trophoblasts in the maternal spiral artery at implantation sites, and we have also found the similar phenotypic switch of intravascular trophoblasts in the decidual vasculopathy in preeclampsia. Currently we have examined 124 placentas from the patients with preeclampsia and 84 placentas from patients with other pregnancy associated complications without preeclampsia. CD56 expression on the intravascular trophoblasts can be seen in classic decidual vasculopathy such as fibrinoid medial necrosis and acute atherosis. In addition, partial involvement of the decidual vessels with classic vasculopathy can also be identified by CD56 expression. The cellular components of the classic vasculopathy in preeclampsia showed immunoreactivity to cytokeratin and CD68, in addition to CD56 expression, indicating the fetal trophoblastic cell origin. The classic decidual vasculopathy including acute atherosis and fibrinoid medial necrosis can be unified and designated as CD56-related vasculopathy. The CD56 related vasculopathy is associated not only to preeclampsia but also to other pregnancy related complications, such as gestational diabetes, placental infarcts, intervillous thrombosis and other fetal distress syndromes. Our study defined a spectrum of decidual vasculopathy spanning from the classic preeclampsia to other complications important to pregnancy that can be highlighted by CD56 expression, pointing to different direction of pathogenesis of preeclampsia and other pregnancy associated complications.",

During range expansions, strong genetic drift characterized by repeated founder events can result in decreased genetic diversity with increased distance from the center of the historic range, or the point of invasion. The invasion of the Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans, into waters off the U.S. East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea provides a natural system to study rapid range expansion in an invasive marine fish with high dispersal capabilities. We report results from 12,759 loci sequenced by restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing for nine P. volitans populations in the invaded range, including Florida and other Caribbean sites, as well as mitochondrial control region D-loop data. Analyses revealed low to no spatially explicit metapopulation genetic structure in the study area, which is partly consistent with previous finding of little structure within ocean basins, but partly divergent from reports of between-basin structure. Genetic diversity, however, was not homogeneous across all sampled sites. Patterns of genetic diversity correlate with invasion pathway. Observed heterozygosity, averaged across all loci within a population, decreases with distance from Florida while expected heterozygosity is mostly constant throughout sampled populations, indicating population genetic disequilibrium correlated with distance from the point of invasion. Using an FST outlier analysis and a Bayesian environmental correlation analysis, we identified 256 and 616 loci, respectively, that could be experiencing selection or genetic drift. Of these, 24 loci were shared between the two methods.",

Recent systematic efforts to map the mouse mesoscale connectome provide comprehensive projection data on interareal connections, but not at the level of specific cell classes or layers within cortical areas. We present here a significant expansion of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, with [~]1,000 new axonal projection mapping experiments across nearly all isocortical areas in 49 Cre driver lines. Using 13 lines selective for cortical layer-specific projection neuron classes, we identify the differential contribution of each layer/class to the overall intracortical connectivity patterns. We find layer 5 (L5) projection neurons account for essentially all intracortical outputs. L2/3, L4, and L6 neurons contact a subset of the L5 cortical targets. We also describe the most common axon lamination patterns in cortical targets. Most patterns are consistent with previous anatomical rules used to determine hierarchical position between cortical areas (feedforward, feedback), with notable exceptions. While diverse target lamination patterns arise from every source layer/class, L2/3 and L4 neurons are primarily associated with feedforward type projection patterns and L6 with feedback. L5 has both feedforward and feedback projection patterns. Finally, network analyses revealed a modular organization of the intracortical connectome. By labeling interareal and intermodule connections as feedforward or feedback, we present an integrated view of the intracortical connectome as a hierarchical network.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of mesoscopic brain connectivity is important for understanding inter- and intra-region information processing. Models of structural connectivity are typically constructed and analyzed with the assumption that regions are homogeneous. We instead use the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to construct a model of whole brain connectivity at the scale of 100 {micro}m voxels. The dataset used consists of 366 anterograde tracing experiments in wild type C7BL/6 mice, mapping fluorescently-labeled neuronal projections brain-wide. Inferring spatial connectivity with this dataset remains underdetermined, since the approximately 2 x 105 source voxels outnumber the number of experiments. To address this, we assume that connection patterns and strengths vary smoothly across major brain divisions. We model the connectivity at each voxel as a radial basis kernel-weighted average of the projection patterns of nearby injections. The voxel model outperforms a previous regional model in predicting held-out experiments and compared to a human-curated dataset. This voxel-scale model of the mouse connectome permits researchers to extend their previous analyses of structural connectivity to unprecedented levels of resolution, and allows for comparison with functional imaging and other datasets.",

Here, we propose methods for TRN inference in a mammalian setting, using ATAC-seq data to influence gene expression modeling. We rigorously test our methods in the context of T Helper Cell Type 17 (Th17) differentiation, generating new ATAC-seq data to complement existing Th17 genomic resources (plentiful gene expression data, TF knock-outs and ChIP-seq experiments). In this resource-rich mammalian setting, our extensive benchmarking provides quantitative, genome-scale evaluation of TRN inference combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We refine and extend our previous Th17 TRN, using our new TRN inference methods to integrate all Th17 data (gene expression, ATAC-seq, TF KO, ChIP-seq). We highlight new roles for individual TFs and groups of TFs (\\\"TF-TF modules\\\") in Th17 gene regulation. Given the popularity of ATAC-seq, which provides high-resolution with low sample input requirements, we anticipate that application of our methods will improve TRN inference in new mammalian systems, especially in vivo, for cells directly from humans and animal models.",

Although it was reported that depletion of MDM2 or CDK4 decreased proliferation in DDLPS cell lines, it remains unclear whether MDM2 and CDK4 induce WDLPS/DDLPS tumorigenesis. We examined whether MDM2 and/or CDK4 produce WDLPS/DDLPS using transformed human bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), 2H and 5H, with five oncogenic hits (overexpression of hTERT, TP53 degradation, RB inactivation, c-MYC stabilization, and overexpression of HRASv12). In vitro functional experiments revealed that co-overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 plays key roles in tumorigenesis by increasing cell growth and migration and inhibiting adipogenic differentiation potency compared to sole expression of MDM2 or CDK4. Using mouse xenograft models, we found that co-overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 in 5H cells with five additional oncogenic mutations can develop proliferative DDLPS in vivo. Our results suggest that co-overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 induces DDLPS tumour potency in transformed human BMSCs by accelerating cell growth and migration and blocking adipogenetic potential incooperation with multiple genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient availability, growth rate and cell size are closely linked. For example, in budding yeast, the rate of cell growth is proportional to nutrient availability, cell size is proportional to growth rate, and growth rate is proportional to cell size. Thus, cells grow slowly in poor nutrients and are nearly half the size of cells growing in rich nutrients. Moreover, large cells grow faster than small cells. A signaling network that surrounds Tor kinase complex 2 (TORC2) plays an important role in enforcing these proportional relationships. Cells that lack components of the TORC2 network fail to modulate their growth rate or size in response to changes in nutrient availability. Here, we show that budding yeast homologs of the Lkb1 tumor suppressor kinase are required for normal modulation of TORC2 signaling and in response to changes in carbon source. Lkb1 kinases activate Snf1/AMPK to initiate transcription of genes required for utilization of poor carbon sources. However, Lkb1 influences TORC2 signaling via a novel pathway that is independent of Snf1/AMPK. Of the three Lkb1 homologs in budding yeast, Elm1 plays the most important role in modulating TORC2. Elm1 activates a pair of related kinases called Gin4 and Hsl1. Previous work found that loss of Gin4 and Hsl1 causes cells to undergo unrestrained growth during a prolonged mitotic arrest, which suggests that play a role in linking cell cycle progression to cell growth. We found that Gin4 and Hsl1 also control the TORC2 network. In addition, Gin4 and Hsl1 are themselves influenced by signals from the TORC2 network, consistent with previous work showing that the TORC2 network constitutes a feedback loop. Together, the data suggest a model in which the TORC2 network sets growth rate in response to carbon source, while also relaying signals via Gin4 and Hsl1 that set the critical amount of growth required for cell cycle progression. This kind of close linkage between control of cell growth and size would suggest a simple mechanistic explanation for the proportional relationship between cell size and growth rate.",

    "abstract": "Alternatively spliced genes produce multiple spliced isoforms, called transcript variants. In differential alternative splicing, the relative abundance of transcript variants differs across sample types. Differential alternative splicing is common in animal systems and influences cellular development in many processes, but its extent and significance is not as well known in plants. To investigate alternative splicing in plants, we examined rice seedling RNA-Seq data that included approximately 40 million sequence alignments per library, three libraries per sample type, and four sample types: roots and shoots, each treated with exogenous cytokinin delivered hydroponically, plus mock-treated controls. Cytokinin treatment triggered expression changes in thousands of genes, but had minimal effect on alternative splicing. However, there were many splicing differences between roots and shoots. Analysis of a similar (but less deeply sequenced) mRNA-Seq data set from Arabidopsis showed the same pattern. Quantitative fragment analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products made from newly prepared rice samples confirmed nine of ten differential splicing events between rice roots and shoots. In both the Arabidopsis and rice mRNA-Seq data sets, most genes annotated as alternatively spliced had small minor variant frequencies, i.e., the less frequently observed forms were supported by fewer than 20% of informative mRNA-Seq sequences. Of splicing choices where there was more abundant support for minor forms, most alternative splicing events were located within the protein-coding sequence and also maintained the annotated reading frame. A tool for visualizing protein annotations in the context of genomic sequence (ProtAnnot) together with a genome browser (Integrated Genome Browser) were used to visualize and assess effects of differential splicing on gene function. In general, differentially spliced regions coincided with conserved regions in the encoded proteins, indicating that differential alternative splicing is likely to affect protein function between root and shoot tissue in rice.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the use of neonicotinoid insecticides increased significantly in the agricultural landscape and meanwhile considered a risk to honey bees. Besides the exposure to pesticides, colonies are treated frequently with various acaricides that beekeepers are forced to use against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Here we have analyzed the impact of a chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of the common neonicotinoid thiacloprid (T) and the widely used acaricide {tau}-fluvalinate (synthetic pyrethroid, F) - applied alone or in combination - to honey bee colonies under field conditions. The population dynamics of bees and brood were assessed in all colonies according to the Liebefeld method. Four groups (T, F, F+T, control) with 8-9 colonies each were analyzed in two independent replications, each lasting from spring/summer until spring of the consecutive year. In late autumn, all colonies were treated with oxalic acid against Varroosis. We could not find a negative impact of the chronic neonicotinoid exposure on the population dynamics or overwintering success of the colonies, irrespective of whether applied alone or in combination with {tau}-fluvalinate. This is in contrast to some results obtained from individually treated bees under laboratory conditions and confirms again an effective buffering capacity of the honey bee colony as a superorganism. Yet, the underlying mechanisms for this social resilience remain to be fully understood.",
