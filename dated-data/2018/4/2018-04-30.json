    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that voluntary spatial attention can affect neural processing of visual stimuli that do not enter conscious awareness (i.e. invisible stimuli), supporting the notion that attention and awareness are dissociable processes (Watanabe et al., 2011; Wyart, Dehaene, & Tallon-Baudry, 2012). To date, however, no study has demonstrated that these effects reflect enhancement of the neural representation of invisible stimuli per se, as opposed to other neural processes not specifically tied to the stimulus in question. In addition, it remains unclear whether spatial attention can modulate neural representations of invisible stimuli in direct competition with highly salient and visible stimuli. Here we developed a novel electroencephalography (EEG) frequency-tagging paradigm to obtain a continuous readout of human brain activity associated with visible and invisible signals embedded in dynamic noise. Participants (N = 23) detected occasional contrast changes in one of two flickering image streams on either side of fixation. Each image stream contained a visible or invisible signal embedded in every second noise image, the visibility of which was titrated and checked using a two-interval forced-choice detection task. Steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were computed from EEG data at the signal and noise frequencies of interest. Cluster-based permutation analyses revealed significant neural responses to both visible and invisible signals across posterior scalp electrodes. Control analyses revealed that these responses did not reflect a subharmonic response to noise stimuli. In line with previous findings, spatial attention increased the neural representation of visible signals. Crucially, spatial attention also increased the neural representation of invisible signals. As such, the present results replicate and extend previous studies by demonstrating that attention can modulate the neural representation of invisible signals that are in direct competition with highly salient masking stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Higher educational attainment (EA) is negatively associated with schizophrenia (SZ). However, recent studies found a positive genetic correlation between EA and SZ. We investigated possible causes of this counterintuitive finding using genome-wide association study results for EA and SZ (N = 443,581) and a replication cohort (1,169 controls; 1,067 cases) with deeply phenotyped SZ patients. We found strong genetic dependence between EA and SZ that cannot be explained by chance, linkage disequilibrium, or assortative mating. Instead, several genes seem to have pleiotropic effects on EA and SZ, but without a clear pattern of sign concordance. Genetic heterogeneity of SZ contributes to this finding. We demonstrate this by showing that the polygenic prediction of clinical SZ symptoms can be improved by taking the sign concordance of loci for EA and SZ into account. Furthermore, using EA as a proxy phenotype, we isolate FOXO6 and SLITRK1 as novel candidate genes for SZ.",

    "abstract": "In this work we study the limit distribution of an appropriately normalized cophenetic index of the pure-birth tree conditioned on n contemporary tips. We show that this normalized phylogenetic balance index is a submartingale that converges almost surely and in L2. We link our work with studies on trees without branch lengths and show that in this case the limit distribution is a contraction-type distribution, similar to the Quicksort limit distribution. In the continuous branch case we suggest approximations to the limit distribution. We propose heuristic methods of simulating from these distributions and it may be observed that these algorithms result in reasonable tails. Therefore, we propose a way based on the quantiles of the derived distributions for hypothesis testing, whether an observed phylogenetic tree is consistent with the pure-birth process. Simulating a sample by the proposed heuristics is rapid, while exact simulation (simulating the tree and then calculating the index) is a time-consuming procedure. We conduct a power study to investigate how well the cophenetic indices detect deviations from the Yule tree and apply the methodology to empirical phylogenies.",

    "abstract": "Soft rot enterobacteria (Dickeya and Pectobacterium) are major pathogens that cause diseases on plants of agricultural importance such as potato and ornamentals. Long term studies to identify virulence factors of these bacteria focused mostly on plant cell wall degrading enzymes secreted by the type II secretion system and the regulation of their expression. To identify new virulence factors we performed a Tn-seq genome-wide screen of a transposon mutant library during chicory infection followed by high-throughput sequencing. This allowed the detection of mutants with reduced but also increased fitness in the plant. Virulence factors identified differed from those previously known since diffusible ones (secreted enzymes, siderophores or metabolites) were not detected by this screen. In addition to genes encoding proteins of unknown function that could be new virulence factors, others could be assigned to known biological functions. The central role of the FlhDC regulatory cascade in the control of virulence was highlighted with the identification of new members of this pathway. Scarcity of the plant in certain amino acids and nucleic acids required presence of the corresponding biosynthetic genes in the bacteria. Their products could be targets for the development of antibacterial compounds. Among the genes required for full development in chicory we also identified six genes involved in the glycosylation of the flagellin FliC, glycosylation, which in other plant pathogenic bacteria contributes to virulence.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIdentification of virulence factors of plant pathogenic bacteria has relied on the test of individual mutants on plants, a time-consuming method. New methods like transcriptomic or proteomic can now be used but they only allow the identification of genes induced during the infection process and non-induced genes may be missed. Tn-seq is a very powerful method to identify genes required for bacterial growth in their host. We used for the first time this method in a plant pathogenic bacteria to identify genes required for the multiplication of Dickeya dadantii in chicory. We identified about 100 genes with decreased or increased fitness in the plant. Most of them had no previously described role in bacterial virulence. We unveiled important metabolic genes and regulators of motility and virulence. We showed that D. dadantii flagellin is glycosylated and that this modification confers fitness to the bacteria during plant infection. Our work opens the way to the use of Tn-seq with bacterial phytopathogens. Assay by this method of large collections of environmental pathogenic strains now available will allow an easy and rapid identification of new virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding gene regulatory enhancers are essential to transcription in mammalian cells. As a result, a large variety of experimental and computational strategies have been developed to identify cis-regulatory enhancer sequences. In practice, most studies consider enhancers identified by only a single method, and the concordance of enhancers identified by different methods has not been comprehensively evaluated. Here, we assess the similarities of enhancer sets identified by ten representative strategies in four biological contexts and evaluate the robustness of downstream conclusions to the choice of identification strategy. All pairs of enhancer sets we evaluated overlap significantly more than expected by chance; however, we also found significant dissimilarity between enhancer sets in their genomic characteristics, evolutionary conservation, and association with functional loci within each context. We find most regions identified as enhancers are supported by only one method. The disagreement is sufficient to influence interpretation of GWAS SNPs and eQTL, and to lead to disparate conclusions about enhancer biology and disease mechanisms. We also find only limited evidence that regions identified by multiple enhancer identification methods are better candidates than those identified by a single method. Our results highlight the inherent complexity of enhancer biology and argue that current approaches have yet to adequately account for enhancer diversity. As a result, we cannot recommend the use of any single enhancer identification strategy in isolation. To facilitate assessment of enhancer diversity on studies conclusions, we developed creDB, a database of enhancer annotations designed to integrate into bioinformatics workflows. While our findings highlight a major challenge to mapping the genetic architecture of complex disease and interpreting regulatory variants found in patient genomes, a systematic understanding of similarities and differences in enhancer identification methodology will ultimately enable robust inferences about gene regulatory sequences.",

    "abstract": "PurposeIntensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has allowed optimization of three-dimensional spatial radiation dose distributions permitting target coverage while reducing normal tissue toxicity. However, radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity is a major contributor to patients quality of life and often a dose-limiting factor in the definitive treatment of cancer with radiation therapy. We propose the next logical step in the evolution of IMRT using canonical radiobiological principles, optimizing the temporal dimension through which radiation therapy is delivered to further reduce radiation-induced toxicity by increased time for normal tissue recovery. We term this novel treatment planning strategy \\\"temporally feathered radiotherapy\\\" (TFRT).\\n\\nMethodsTFRT plans were generated as a composite of five simulated treatment plans each with altered constraints on particular hypothetical organs at risk (OARs) to be delivered sequentially. For each of these TFRT plans, OARs chosen for feathering receive higher doses while the remaining OARs receive lower doses than the standard fractional dose delivered in a conventional fractionated IMRT plan. Each TFRT plan is delivered a specific weekday, which in effect leads to a higher dose once weekly followed by four lower fractional doses to each temporally feathered OAR. We compared normal tissue toxicity between TFRT and conventional fractionated IMRT plans by using a dynamical mathematical model to describe radiation-induced tissue damage and repair over time.\\n\\nResultsModel-based simulations of TFRT demonstrated potential for reduced normal tissue toxicity compared to conventionally planned IMRT. The sequencing of high and low fractional doses delivered to OARs by TFRT plans suggested increased normal tissue recovery, and hence less overall radiation-induced toxicity, despite higher total doses delivered to OARs compared to conventional fractionated IMRT plans. The magnitude of toxicity reduction by TFRT planning was found to depend on the corresponding standard fractional dose of IMRT and organ-specific recovery rate of sublethal radiation-induced damage.\\n\\nConclusionsTFRT is a novel technique for treatment planning and optimization of therapeutic radiotherapy that considers the non-linear aspects of tissue repair to optimize toxicity profiles. Model-based simulations of TFRT to carefully conceptualized clinical cases have demonstrated potential for normal tissue toxicity reduction in a previously described dynamical model of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variation is the raw material of adaptive Darwinian evolution. The phenotypic variation found in organismal development is biased towards certain phenotypes, but the molecular mechanisms behind such restrictions are still poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks have been proposed as one cause of constrained phenotypic variation. However, most of the evidence for this is theoretical rather than experimental. Here, we study evolutionary biases in two synthetic gene regulatory circuits expressed in E. coli that produce a gene expression stripe - a pivotal pattern in embryonic development. The two parental circuits produce the same phenotype, but create it through different regulatory mechanisms. We show that mutations cause distinct novel phenotypes in the two networks and use a combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modelling and DNA sequencing to understand why mutations bring forth only some but not other novel gene expression phenotypes. Our results reveal that the regulatory mechanisms of networks restrict the possible phenotypic variation upon mutation. Consequently, seemingly equivalent networks can indeed be distinct in how they constrain the outcome of further evolution.",

    "abstract": "DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is a synthetic chemical, identified by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1946 in a screen for repellents to protect soldiers from mosquito-borne diseases1,2. Since its discovery, DEET has become the worlds most widely used arthropod repellent3, and is effective against invertebrates separated by millions of years of evolution, including biting flies4, honeybees5, ticks6, and land leeches4,7. In insects, DEET acts on the olfactory system5,8-14 and requires the olfactory receptor co-receptor orco9,11-13, but its specific mechanism of action remains controversial. Here we show that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is sensitive to DEET, and use this genetically-tractable animal to study its mechanism of action. We found that DEET is not a volatile repellent, but interferes selectively with chemotaxis to a variety of attractant and repellent molecules. DEET increases pause lengths to disrupt chemotaxis to some odours but not others. In a forward genetic screen for DEET-resistant animals, we identified a single G protein-coupled receptor, str-217, which is expressed in a single pair of DEET-responsive chemosensory neurons, ADL. Misexpression of str-217 in another chemosensory neuron conferred strong responses to DEET. Both engineered str-217 mutants and a wild isolate of C. elegans carrying a deletion in str-217 are DEET-resistant. We found that DEET can interfere with behaviour by inducing an increase in average pause length during locomotion, and show that this increase in pausing requires both str-217 and ADL neurons. Finally, we demonstrated that ADL neurons are activated by DEET and that optogenetic activation of ADL increased average pause length. This is consistent with the \\\"confusant\\\" hypothesis, in which DEET is not a simple repellent but modulates multiple olfactory pathways to scramble behavioural responses12,13. Our results suggest a consistent motif for the effectiveness of DEET across widely divergent taxa: an effect on multiple chemosensory neurons to disrupt the pairing between odorant stimulus and behavioural response.",

In particular, the Double Error Dynamic Asymptote (DDA) model introduces: 1) a fully-connected network architecture in which stimuli are represented as temporally clustered elements that associate to each other, so that elements of one cluster engender activity on other clusters, which naturally implements neutral stimuli associations and mediated learning; 2) a predictor error term within the traditional error correction rule (the double error), which reduces the rate of learning for expected predictors; 3) a revaluation associability rate that operates on the assumption that the outcome predictiveness is tracked over time so that prolonged uncertainty is learned, reducing the levels of attention to initially surprising outcomes; and critically 4) a biologically plausible variable asymptote, which encapsulates the principle of Hebbian learning, leading to stronger associations for similar levels of cluster activity. The outputs of a set of simulations of the DDA model are presented along with empirical results from the literature. Finally, the predictive scope of the model is discussed.",

    "abstract": "In bacterial type 3 secretion, substrate proteins are actively transported from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host cell cytoplasm by a large membrane-embedded machinery called the injectisome. Injectisomes transport secretion substrates in response to specific environmental signals, but the molecular details by which the cytosolic secretion substrates are selected and transported through the type 3 secretion pathway remain unclear. Secretion activity and substrate selectivity are thought to be controlled by a sorting platform consisting of the proteins SctK, SctQ, SctL, and SctN, which together localize to the cytoplasmic side of membrane-embedded injectisomes. However, recent work revealed that sorting platform proteins additionally exhibit substantial cytosolic populations and that SctQ reversibly binds to and dissociates from the cytoplasmic side of membrane-embedded injectisomes. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that dynamic molecular turnover at the injectisome and cytosolic assembly among sorting platform proteins is a critical regulatory component of type 3 secretion. To determine whether sorting platform complexes exist in the cytosol, we measured the diffusive properties of the two central sorting platform proteins, SctQ and SctL, using live cell high-throughput 3D single-molecule tracking microscopy. Single-molecule trajectories, measured in wild-type and mutant Yersinia enterocolitica cells, reveal that both SctQ and SctL exist in several distinct diffusive states in the cytosol, indicating that these proteins form stable homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes in their native environment. Our findings provide the first diffusive state-resolved insights into the dynamic regulatory network that interfaces stationary membrane-embedded injectisomes with the soluble cytosolic components of the type 3 secretion system.",

However, species-level resolution is only achieved after a process of \\\"binning\\\" where contigs predicted to originate from the same genome are clustered. Such culture-independent sequencing frequently unearths novel microbes, and so various methods have been devised for reference-free binning. Existing methods, however, suffer from: (1) reliance on human pattern recognition, which is inherently unscalable; (2) requirement for multiple co-assembled metagenomes, which degrades assembly quality due to strain variance; and (3) assumption of prior host genome removal not feasible for non-model hosts. We therefore devised a fully-automated pipeline, termed \\\"Autometa,\\\" to address these issues. Results: Autometa implements a method for taxonomic partitioning of contigs based on predicted protein homology, and this was shown to vastly improve binning in host-associated and complex metagenomes. Autometas method of automated clustering, based on Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-tSNE) and DBSCAN, was shown to be highly scalable, outperforming other binning pipelines in complex simulated datasets.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationAutometa is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/jasonckwan/autometa and as a docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/jasonkwan/autometa under the GNU Affero General Public License 3 (AGPL 3).\\n\\nContactjason.kwan@wisc.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available attached to this article at https://biorxiv.org",

Neurons exhibit spontaneous activity patterns, which are constrained by experience and development, limiting the portion of state space that is effectively visited. Patterns of spontaneous activity may contribute to shaping the synaptic connectivity matrix and contribute to memory consolidation, and synaptic plasticity formation depends crucially on the temporal spiking order among neurons. Hence, the unsupervised detection of spike sequences is a sine qua non for understanding how spontaneous activity contributes to memory formation. Yet, sequence detection presents major methodological challenges like the sparsity and stochasticity of neuronal output, and its high dimensionality. We propose a dissimilarity measure between neuronal patterns based on optimal transport theory, determining their similarity from the pairwise cross-correlation matrix, which can be taken as a proxy of the \\\"trace\\\" that is left on the synaptic matrix. We then perform unsupervised clustering and visualization of patterns using density clustering on the dissimilarity matrix and low-dimensional embedding techniques. This method does not require binning of spike times, is robust to noise, jitter and rate fluctuations, and can detect more patterns than the number of neurons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransposable elements (TE) are an important source of evolutionary novelty in gene regulation. However, the mechanisms by which TEs contribute to gene expression are largely uncharacterized.\\n\\nResultsHere, we leverage Roadmap and GTEx data to investigate the association of TEs with active and repressed chromatin in 24 tissues. We find 112 human TE types enriched in active regions of the genome across tissues. SINEs and DNA transposons are the most frequently enriched classes, while LTRs are often enriched in a tissue-specific manner. We report across-tissue variability in TE enrichment in active regions. Genes with consistent expression across tissues are less likely to be associated with TE insertions. TE presence in repressed regions similarly follows tissue-specific patterns. Moreover, different TE classes correlate with different repressive marks: Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons (LTRs) and Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) are overrepresented in regions marked by H3K9me3, while the other TEs are more likely to overlap regions with H3K27me3. Young TEs are typically enriched in repressed regions and depleted in active regions. We detect multiple instances of TEs that are enriched in tissue-specific active regulatory regions. Such TEs contain binding sites for transcription factors that are master regulators for the given tissue. These TEs are enriched in intronic enhancers, and their tissue-specific enrichment correlates with tissue-specific variations in the expression of the nearest genes.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide an integrated overview of the contribution of TEs to human gene regulation. Expanding previous analyses, we demonstrate that TEs can potentially contribute to the turnover of regulatory sequences in a tissue-specific fashion.",

    "abstract": "The potential impact of structural variants includes not only the duplication or deletion of coding sequences, but also the perturbation of non-coding DNA regulatory elements and structural chromatin features, including topological domains (TADs). Structural variants disrupting TAD boundaries have been implicated both in cancer and developmental disease; this likely occurs via  enhancer hijacking, whereby removal of the TAD boundary exposes enhancers to new target transcription start sites (TSSs). With this functional role, we hypothesized that boundaries would display evidence for negative selection. Here we demonstrate that the chromatin landscape constrains structural variation both within healthy humans and across primate evolution. In contrast, in patients with developmental delay, variants occur remarkably uniformly across genomic features, suggesting a potentially broad role for enhancer hijacking in human disease.",

    "abstract": "Geometric and tendon excursion methods have both been used extensively for estimating plantarflexor muscle moment arm in vivo. Geometric measures often utilize magnetic resonance imaging, which can be costly and impractical for many investigations. Estimating moment arm from tendon excursion measured with ultrasonography may provide a cost-effective alternative to geometric measures of moment arm, but how well such measures represent geometry-based moment arms remains in question. The purpose of this study was to determine whether moment arms from tendon excursion can serve as a surrogate for moment arms measured geometrically. Magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging were performed on 19 young male subjects to quantify plantarflexor moment arm based on geometric and tendon excursion paradigms, respectively. These measurements were only moderately correlated (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.052), and moment arm from tendon excursion under-approximated geometric moment arm by nearly 40% (p < 0.001). This moderate correlation between methods is at odds with a prior report (N = 9) of a very strong correlation (R2 = 0.94) in a similar study. Therefore, we performed 92,378 regression analyses (19 choose 9) to determine if such a strong correlation existed in our study population. We found that certain sub-populations of the current study generated similarly strong coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.92), but 84% of all analyses revealed no correlation (p > 0.05). Our results suggest that the moment arms from musculoskeletal geometry cannot be otherwise obtained by simply scaling moment arms estimated from tendon excursion.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the pupils dilate more in anticipation of larger rewards. This finding raises the possibility of a more general association between reward amount and pupil size. We tested this idea by characterizing macaque pupil responses to offered rewards during evaluation and comparison in a binary choice task. To control attention, we made use of a design in which offers occurred in sequence. By looking at pupil responses after choice but before reward, we confirmed the previously observed positive association between pupil size and anticipated reward values. Surprisingly, however, we find that pupil size is negatively correlated with the value of offered gambles before choice, during both evaluation and comparison stages of the task. These results demonstrate a functional distinction between offered and anticipated rewards, and present evidence against a narrow version of the simulation hypothesis, the idea that we represent offers by reactivating states associated with anticipating them. They also suggest that pupil size is correlated with relative, not absolute, values of offers, suggestive of an accept-reject model of comparison.",

Multiplicity of infection (MOI) by Amp-Seq was 2.32 versus 1.73 for msp2. The higher sensitivity had no effect on estimates of force of infection because missed minority clones were detected in preceding or succeeding bleeds.

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryGlioblastoma (GBM) remains uniformly lethal, and, despite a large accumulation of immune cells in the microenvironment, there is limited anti-tumor immune response, even with newly developed immune checkpoint therapies. To overcome these challenges and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies, a comprehensive understanding of the immune system in GBM and changes during disease progression is required. Here, we integrated multi-parameter flow cytometry and mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) analysis of patient blood to determine changes in the immune system among tumor types and over disease progression. Utilizing multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis in a cohort of over 250 patients with brain tumors ranging from benign to malignant primary and metastatic, we found that GBM patients had a significant elevation in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in blood, but not immunosuppressive T regulatory cells. We validated these findings in GBM patient tissue and found that increased numbers of MDSCs in recurrent GBM portended poor prognosis. CyTOF analysis of peripheral blood from a cohort of newly diagnosed GBM patients revealed that reduction in MDSC frequency over time is accompanied by a concomitant increase in dendritic cells and natural killer cells. This reduced MDSC profile was present in GBM patients with extended survival and was similar to that of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients. Our findings provide a rationale for developing strategies to target MDSCs, which are elevated in GBM patients and predict poor prognosis, either by directly targeting or by shifting the immune profile to induce differentiation toward the immune profile of LGGs.",

To fill this gap, we systematically elucidated the key algorithmic problems in subclonal reconstruction and developed mathematically valid quantitative metrics for evaluating them. We then created approaches to simulate realistic tumour genomes, harbouring all known mutation types and processes both clonally and subclonally. We then simulated 580 tumour genomes for reconstruction, varying tumour read-depth and benchmarking somatic variant detection and subclonal reconstruction strategies.

    "abstract": "Novel insect identification techniques often lead to speculation on whether the method could cope with any intraspecific variation that might occur in a species. Using I3S Classic (Interactive Individual Identification System, Classic) and images of mosquito wings, different mosquito strains were tested with a copy of the strain present or absent from the database which contained images of other strains of the test species. When a wing image of the exact species, strain and sex was present in the database, there was 100% (or near 100%) retrieval of the correct species and strain at rank one. When the exact strain was absent from the database, but other strains of the same species were present, the retrieval rates at rank one were again high (100%) in the majority of cases and when they were not, the correct species was generally retrieved at rank two. Out of 40 different species and strains tested, only three were significantly different at rank one when the exact strain was absent from the database. In general, images of field strains selected for each other and therefore were similar to each other in greater numbers and instances than for the laboratory strains tested. When a copy of a strain was absent from the database, but other strains/sibling species were present, I3S retrieved the correct strains/sibling species at rank one in the majority of cases. In the one case of transgenic mosquitoes tested, I3S could reliably be used to identify transgenic mosquitoes from the parent stock as they were retrieved 100% at rank one when both the transgenic and unmodified parent strains were present in the database. This indicates the potential of using I3S to distinguish transgenic or other selectively bred strains from a parent strain, also selectively bred and wild mosquitoes, at least in the first phase after field release. Similarly, hybrid strains, sibling species and members of species complexes as in the Anopheles gambiae species complex could also be correctly identified when copies of all the relevant species/strains/siblings were in the database. This contradicts the belief that only molecular characterisation could separate A. gambiae s.s. from A. coluzzii, or A. arabiensis; I3S could accurately separate them all. I3S worked as it was set up to do, retrieving closely resembling images of the test insects from the database and ranking them in order of similarity. Dealing with any intraspecific variation was therefore not an issue if the software (I3S) was used systematically. I3S complements molecular and traditional taxonomic methods for species identification and the separation of sibling complexes and strains. In future, it should become the norm to maintain databases of insect wings and other body part images for use in image recognition.",

In contrast with yeast and metazoan DUB modules that are associated with the large SAGA complex, the Arabidopsis DUBm only comprises three proteins (hereafter named SGF11, ENY2 and UBP22) and appears to act independently as a major H2Bub deubiquitinase activity. Our study further unveils that DET1-DDB1-Associated-1 (DDA1) protein interacts with SGF11 in vivo, linking the DET1 complex to light-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation of the DUBm.

Conditional knockout of the homeobox genes En1 and En2 (En1/2) in the rhombic lip-derived eCN and granule cell precursors leads to embryonic loss of a subset of medial eCN and cell non-autonomous and location specific loss of Purkinje cells, with subsequent proportional scaling down of cortex growth. We propose that subsets of eCN dictate the survival of their specific Purkinje cell partners, and in turn sonic hedgehog secreted by Purkinje cells scales the expansion of granule cells and interneurons to produce functional local circuits and the proper folded morphology of the cerebellum.",

Three unrelated human cell lines (SW480, U-2 OS and GM00639) were used to identify common or cell line-specific mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Phased, secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) represent a class of small RNAs in plants generated via distinct biogenesis pathways, predominantly dependent on the activity of 22 nt miRNAs. Most 22 nt miRNAs are processed by DCL1 from miRNA precursors containing an asymmetric bulge, yielding a 22/21 nt miRNA/miRNA* duplex. Here we show that miR1510, a soybean miRNA capable of triggering phasiRNA production from numerous NB-LRRs, previously described as 21 nt in its mature form, primarily accumulates as a 22 nt isoform via monouridylation. We demonstrate that in Arabidopsis, this uridylation is performed by HESO1. Biochemical experiments showed that the 3 terminus of miR1510 is only partially 2-O-methylated, because of the terminal mispairing in the miR1510/miR1510* duplex that inhibits HEN1 activity in soybean. miR1510 emerged in the Phaseoleae ~41 to 42 MYA with a conserved precursor structure yielding a 22 nt monouridylated form, yet a variant in mung bean is processed directly in a 22 nt mature form. This analysis of miR1510 yields two observations: (1) plants can utilize post-processing modification to generate abundant 22 nt miRNA isoforms to more efficiently regulate target mRNA abundances; (2) comparative analysis demonstrates an example of selective optimization of precursor processing of a young plant miRNA.",

    "abstract": "One sentence summaryN-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatment stimulates tomato hypocotyl elongation likely by elevating ethylene emission and lowering indole-3-butyric acid levels in the seedlings.\\n\\nAbstractIn higher plants, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid is characteristically transported from the apex towards the base of the plant, termed as polar auxin transport (PAT). Among the inhibitors blocking PAT, N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) that targets ABCB transporters is most commonly used. NPA-treated light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings show severe inhibition of hypocotyl and root elongation. In light-grown tomato seedlings, NPA inhibited root growth, but contrary to Arabidopsis stimulated hypocotyl elongation. The NPA-stimulation of hypocotyl elongation was milder in blue, red, and far-red light-grown seedlings. The NPA-treatment stimulated emission of ethylene from the seedlings. The scrubbing of ethylene by mercuric perchlorate reduced NPA-stimulated hypocotyl elongation. NPA action on hypocotyl elongation was antagonized by 1-methylcyclopropene, an inhibitor of ethylene action. NPA-treated seedlings had reduced levels of indole-3-butyric acid and higher levels of zeatin in the shoots. NPA did not alter indole-3-acetic levels in shoots. The analysis of metabolic networks indicated that NPA-treatment induced moderate shifts in the networks compared to exogenous ethylene that induced a drastic shift in metabolic networks. Our results indicate that in addition to ethylene, NPA-stimulated hypocotyl elongation in tomato may also involve zeatin and indole-3-butyric acid. Our results indicate that NPA-mediated physiological responses may vary in a species-specific fashion.",

Much of life science research depends on life materials, including human tissue culture cells. In this study we aimed at determining the degree of variability in the molecular makeup and the ensuing phenotypic consequences in commonly used human tissue culture cells. We collected 14 stock HeLa aliquots from 13 different laboratories across the globe, cultured them in uniform conditions and profiled the genome-wide copy numbers, mRNAs, proteins and protein turnover rates via genomic techniques and SWATH mass spectrometry, respectively. We also phenotyped each cell line with respect to the ability of transfected Let7 mimics to modulate Salmonella infection.\\n\\nWe discovered significant heterogeneity between HeLa variants, especially between lines of the CCL2 and Kyoto variety. We also observed progressive divergence within a specific cell line over 50 successive passages. From the aggregate multi-omic datasets we quantified the response of the cells to genomic variability across the transcriptome and proteome. We discovered organelle-specific proteome remodeling and buffering of protein abundance by protein complex stoichiometry, mediated by the adaptation of protein turnover rates. By associating quantitative proteotype and phenotype measurements we identified protein patterns that explained the varying response of the different cell lines to Salmonella infection.\\n\\nAltogether the results indicate a striking degree of genomic variability, the rapid evolution of genomic variability in culture and its complex translation into distinctive expressed molecular and phenotypic patterns. The results have broad implications for the interpretation and reproducibility of research results obtained from HeLa cells and provide important basis for a general discussion of the value and requirements for communicating research results obtained from human tissue culture cells.",

Treatment of triple-negative breast cancer is major challenge and identification of specific drivers is required for targeted therapies. The aim of our present study is to elucidate the therapeutic potential of CSNK2{beta} silencing in triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell.\\n\\nMethodsCSNK2{beta} gene has been knockdown using siRNA and silencing was estimated by both real time and western blot. Cell Titer-Glo (CTG) and colony formation assay and wound healing assay, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry was performed to assess the role of CSNK2{beta} in cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and oncogenesis. Morphological assessment of nuclear condensation, apoptosis by Hoechst staining and measurement of intracellular ROS production was examined using fluorescence microscopy. Real time PCR and western blot was done to study the expression of genes related to cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, apoptosis, and autophagy.\\n\\nResultsSilencing of CSNK2{beta} in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in decreased cell viability, colony formation, and migratory potential. Cell cycle analysis showed that growth inhibitory effect was mediated by arresting the cells in G2/M phase. Furthermore, we demonstrated that silencing of CSNK2{beta} increased the nuclear condensation and intracellular ROS production. CSNK2{beta} regulates the expression of BAX, Bcl-xL, caspase 3, Beclin-1, LC3-I, p-ERK, p38-, c-Myc, MAPK, c-Jun, NF-B, {beta}-catenin, E2F1, PCNA. We have also shown the functional relationship between CSNK2{beta}, PIN1, and PTOV1 by western blotting.

Here, we capitalize on fine-scale population structure and natural dispersal events to compare the reproductive success of local and dispersing individuals captured on the same spawning ground in four consecutive parent-offspring cohorts of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Parentage analysis conducted on adults and juvenile fish showed that local females and males had 9.6 and 2.9 times higher reproductive success than dispersers, respectively.

    "abstract": "Many traits are phenotypically plastic, i.e. the same genotype expresses different phenotypes depending on the environment. Individuals and genotypes can vary in this response to the environment and this individual (IxE) and genetic variation in reaction norm slopes (GxE) can have important ecological or evolutionary consequences. Studies on variation in plasticity often fail to show IxE or GxE; this can indicate a genuine absence or simply a lack of power. There is, however, another factor that could potentially affect the power to detect IxE or GxE: the choice of the environmental variable included in the analysis. Identifying the genuine environmental driver of phenotypic plasticity will mostly be impossible and hence only a proxy is included in the analysis. However, if this proxy is too weakly correlated with the real driver of plasticity, this will bias IxE and GxE downwards, could lead to spurious negative results and invalid conclusions. As the mean phenotype in a given environment captures all environmental effects on the phenotype, using it as  environment in the analysis should increase the power to detect IxE or GxE. Using simulations I here showed that using weakly correlated proxies indeed biased estimates downwards but that when using the environment-specific means this was not the case. Using environment-specific means as a covariate has been commonly used in animal and plant breeding but rarely used outside these fields despite its potential usefulness as  yardstick to test whether IxE or GxE is present or absent in the phenotype of interest.",

    "abstract": "The cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus is composed of peptidoglycan and the anionic polymers lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and wall teichoic acid. LTA is required for growth and normal cell morphology in S. aureus. Strains lacking LTA are usually only viable when grown under osmotically stabilizing conditions or after the acquisition of compensatory mutations. LTA negative suppressor strains with inactivating mutations in gdpP, resulting in an increase in intracellular c-di-AMP levels, have been described previously. Here, we sought to identify factors other than c-di-AMP that allow S. aureus to survive without LTA. LTA-negative strains able to grow in un-supplemented medium were obtained and found to contain mutations in sgtB, mazE, clpX or vraT. The growth improvement through mutations in mazE and sgtB was confirmed by complementation analysis. We also show that an S. aureus sgtB transposon mutant, inactivated for the monofunctional peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase SgtB, displays a 4-fold increase in the MIC towards a number of cell wall-targeting antibiotics, suggesting that alteration in the peptidoglycan structure could help bacteria compensate for the lack of LTA. Muropeptide analysis of peptidoglycan isolated from a WT and sgtB mutant strains did not reveal any sizable alternations in the peptidoglycan structure. In contrast, the peptidoglycan isolated from an LTA-negative ltaS mutant strain showed a significant reduction in the fraction of highly crosslinked peptidoglycan, which was partially rescued in the sgtB/ltaS double mutant suppressor strain. Taken together, these data point towards an important function of LTA in cell wall integrity through its requirement for proper peptidoglycan assembly.\\n\\nImportanceThe bacterial cell wall acts as primary defence against environmental insults such as changes in osmolarity. It is also a vulnerable structure as defects in its synthesis can lead to growth arrest or cell death. The important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus has a typical Gram-positive cell wall, which consists of peptidoglycan and the anionic polymers lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and wall teichoic acid. Several clinically relevant antibiotics inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan; hence it and teichoic acids are considered attractive targets for the development of new antimicrobials. We show that LTA is required for efficient peptidoglycan crosslinking in S. aureus and inactivation of a peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase can partially rescue this defect, altogether revealing an intimate link between peptidoglycan and LTA synthesis.",

An exported Hsp40 (heat shock protein 40)  PFA0660w functions as a co-chaperone of  PfHsp70-x, and these co-localize to specialized intracellular mobile structures termed J-dots. Our studies attempt to understand the function of PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x chaperone pair using recombinant proteins. Biochemical assays reveal that N and C-terminal domains of PFA0660w and PfHsp70-x respectively are critical for their activity. We show the novel direct interaction of PfHsp70-x with the cytoplasmic tail of PfEMP1, and binding of PFA0660w with cholesterol. PFA0660w operates both as a chaperone and lipid binding molecule via its separate substrate and cholesterol binding sites. PfHsp70-x binds cholesterol linked PFA0660w and PfEMP1 simultaneously in vitro to form a complex. Collectively, our results and the past literature support the hypothesis that PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x chaperone pair assists PfEMP1 transport across the host erythrocyte through cholesterol containing  J-dots. Since PFA0660w seems essential for parasite survival, characterization of its interaction with PfHsp70-x and J-dots may form the basis for development of future antimalarials.",

Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cells expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here we illustrate and enhance the use of matrix factorization as a solution to this problem. We show with simulations that a method that we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including the relative contribution of programs in each cell. Applied to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets, cNMF refines the hierarchy of cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and intriguing novel activity programs. We propose that one of the novel programs may reflect a neurosecretory phenotype and a second may underlie the formation of neuronal synapses. We make cNMF available to the community and illustrate how this approach can provide key insights into gene expression variation within and between cell types.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy has become a popular toolbox for non-disruptive studies of molecular interactions and dynamics in living cells. The quantification of e.g. protein oligomerization and absolute concentrations in the native cellular environment is highly relevant for a detailed understanding of complex signaling pathways and biochemical reaction networks. A parameter of particular relevance in this context is the molecular brightness, which serves as a direct measure of oligomerization and can be easily extracted from temporal or spatial fluorescence fluctuations. However, fluorescent proteins (FPs) typically used in such studies suffer from complex photophysical transitions and limited maturation, potentially inducing non-fluorescent states, which strongly affect molecular brightness measurements. Although these processes have been occasionally reported, a comprehensive study addressing this issue is missing.\\n\\nHere, we investigate the suitability of commonly used FPs (i.e. mEGFP, mEYFP and mCherry), as well as novel red FPs (i.e. mCherry2, mRuby3, mCardinal, mScarlet and mScarlet-I) for the quantification of oligomerization based on the molecular brightness, as obtained by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Number&Brightness (N&B) measurements in living cells. For all FPs, we measured a lower than expected brightness of FP homo-dimers, allowing us to estimate, for each fluorescent label, the probability of fluorescence emission in a simple two-state model. By analyzing higher FP homo-oligomers and the Influenza A virus Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, we show that the oligomeric state of protein complexes can only be accurately quantified if this probability is taken into account. Further, we provide strong evidence that mCherry2, an mCherry variant, possesses a superior apparent fluorescence probability, presumably due to its fast maturation. We finally conclude that this property leads to an improved quantification in fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy measurements and propose to use mEGFP and mCherry2 as the novel standard pair for studying biomolecular hetero-interactions.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the direct detection of Leptospira infection can be done in clinical laboratories by a conventional nested polymerase chain reaction method (nested PCR), which is labourious and time-consuming. To overcome these drawbacks, we tested a set of paired samples of serum and urine from 202 patients presenting at a hospital located in an area endemic for leptospirosis using high resolution melting (HRM). The results were compared with those obtained by nested PCR for direct detection of the pathogen in both specimens and with the gold standard test used for indirect detection of anti-Leptospira antibodies in serum (the microscopic agglutination test, MAT). The HRM assay results were positive for 46/202 (22.7%) samples, whereas 47/202 (23.3%) samples were positive by nested PCR. As expected in recently infected febrile patients, MAT results were positive in only 3/46 (6.5%) HRM-positive samples. We did a unique comparative analysis using a robust biobank of paired samples of serum and urine from the same patient to validate the HRM assay for molecular diagnosis of human leptospirosis in a clinical setting. This assay fills a void unmet by serologic assays as it can detect the presence of Leptospira in biological samples even before development of antibody takes place.",

    "abstract": "Expression of heat shock proteins in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) increases during febrile episodes to play key roles in several necessary cellular processes.  PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x, an exported chaperone pair is known to co-localize to specialized intracellular structures termed J-dots, and has been implicated in trafficking of the major virulence factor, PfEMP1 (Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) across the host cell. This article highlights for the first time detailed structural analysis of PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x chaperone pair to better understand their binding mechanism. Here, we have modeled reliable molecular structures for the complete conserved region of PFA0660w and PfHsp70-x. These structures were evaluated by different structure verification tools followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The model of PFA0660w was subjected to docking with PfHsp70-x using Haddock to reveal a number of residues crucial for their bipartite interaction, and also performed MD simulations on the complex. The peptide binding clefts of PFA0660w and its other Plasmodium species homologs were found to be bigger than their counterparts in higher eukaryotes like yeast, humans and C. parvum. Based on our results, we propose a model for PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x interaction and a mechanism of substrate binding, and compare it with its dimeric human counterparts. Owing to these striking structural differences between the host and parasite chaperones, such information on the essential Hsp40 and its partner Hsp70 may form the basis for rational drug design against fatal malaria.",

Moreover, a systems level understanding of how a small number of young hippocampal neurons could dramatically influence brain function is lacking. We examined whether adult neurogenesis sustains hippocampal connections across the life span. Long-term suppression of neurogenesis as occurs during stress and aging resulted in a progressing decline in hippocampal acetylcholine and the slow emergence of profound working memory deficits. These deficits were accompanied by compensatory rewiring of cholinergic dentate gyrus inputs such that ventrally projecting neurons were recruited by the dorsal projection. Our study demonstrates that hippocampal neurogenesis supports memory by maintaining the septohippocampal circuit across the lifespan. It also provides a systems level explanation for the progressive nature of memory deterioration during normal and pathological aging and indicates that the brain connectome is malleable by experience.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule (MT) nucleation in vivo is regulated by the {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}TuRC), an approximately 2-megadalton complex conserved from yeast to humans. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {gamma}TuRC assembly is a key point of regulation over the MT cytoskeleton. Budding yeast {gamma}TuRC is composed of seven {gamma}-tubulin small complex ({gamma}TuSC) subassemblies which associate helically to form a template from which microtubules grow. This assembly process requires higher-order oligomers of the coiled-coil protein Spc110 to bind multiple {gamma}TuSCs, thereby stabilizing the otherwise low-affinity interface between {gamma}TuSCs. While Spc110 oligomerization is critical, its N-terminal domain (NTD) also plays a role that is poorly understood both functionally and structurally. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of Spc110 NTD using a combination of structural and biochemical analyses. Through crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS), we determined that a segment of Spc110 coiled-coil is a major point of contact with {gamma}TuSC. We determined the structure of this coiled-coil segment by X-ray crystallography and used it in combination with our XL-MS dataset to generate an integrative structural model of the {gamma}TuSC-Spc110 complex. This structural model, in combination with biochemical analyses of Spc110 heterodimers lacking one NTD, suggests that the two NTDs within an Spc110 dimer act independently, one stabilizing association between Spc110 and {gamma}TuSC and the other stabilizing the interface between adjacent {gamma}TuSCs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSuper-enhancers and stretch enhancers represent classes of transcriptional enhancers that have been shown to control the expression of cell identity genes and carry disease- and trait-associated variants. Specifically, super-enhancers are clusters of enhancers defined based on the binding occupancy of master transcription factors (TFs), chromatin regulators, or chromatin marks, while stretch enhancers are large chromatin-defined regulatory regions of at least 3,000 base pairs. Several studies have characterized these regulatory regions in numerous cell types and tissues to decipher their functional importance. However, the differences and similarities between these regulatory regions have not been fully assessed.\\n\\nResultsWe integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from ten human cell types to perform a comparative analysis of super and stretch enhancers with respect to their chromatin profiles, cell-type-specificity, and ability to control gene expression. We found that stretch enhancers are more abundant, more distal to transcription start sites, cover twice as much the genome and are significantly less conserved than super-enhancers. In contrast, super-enhancers are significantly more enriched for active chromatin marks and cohesin complex and transcriptionally active than stretch enhancers. Importantly, a vast majority of superenhancers (85%) overlap with only a small subset of stretch enhancers (13%), which are enriched for cell-type-specific biological functions, and control cell identity genes.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell-type-specific than stretch enhancers, and importantly, most of the stretch enhancers that are distinct from superenhancers do not show an association with cell identity genes, are less active, and more likely to be poised enhancers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we report the endophytic microbial diversity of cultivated and wild Oryza sativa plants including their functional traits related to multiple traits that promote plant growth and development. Around 255 bacteria were isolated out of which 70 isolates were selected for further studies based on their morphological differences. The isolates were characterized both at biochemical and at the molecular level by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing the isolates were categorized into three major phyla, viz, Firmicutes (57.1 %), Actinobacteria (20.0 %) and Proteobacteria (22.8 %). Firmicutes was the dominant group of bacteria of which the most abundant genus was Bacillus. The isolates were further screened in vitro for plant growth promoting activities which revealed a hitherto unreported endophytic bacterial isolate, Microbacteriaceae bacterium RS01 11 as the highest secretor of a phytohormone, IAA (28.39 {+/-} 1.39 g/ml) and GA (67.23 {+/-} 1.83 g/ml). Bacillus subtilis RHS 01 displayed highest phosphate solubilizing activity (81.70 {+/-} 1.98 g/ml) while, Microbacterium testaceum MK LS01, and Microbacterium trichothecenolyticum MI03 L05 exhibited highest potassium solubilizing activity (53.42{+/-}0.75g/ml) and zinc solubilizing efficiency (157.50%) respectively. Bacillus barbaricus LP20 05 produced highest siderophore units (64.8 %). Potential plant growth promoting isolated were tested in vivo in pot culture under greenhouse conditions. A consortium consisting of Microbacteriaceae bacterium RS01 11, Bacillus testaceum MK LS01 and Bacillus subtilis RHS promoted plant growth and increased the yield 3.4 fold in rice when compared to control T0 when tested in pot culture and reduce application rates of chemical fertilizer to half the recommended dose. Our study confirms the potentiality of the rice endophytes isolated as good plant growth promoter and effective biofertilizer.",

    "abstract": "Persister cells, which are characterized by inactive metabolism and tolerance to antibiotics or stresses, pose a significant challenge to the treatment of many persistent infections. Although multiple genes have been reported to be involved in persister formation through transposon mutant library screens, how persisters are formed during the natural process of persister formation as the culture transitions from log phase to stationary phase is unclear. Here, using E. coli as a model, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of gene expression profiles of successive cultures of an E. coli culture at different critical time points, starting from persister-free S1-nonexistence phase (3h) to persister appearing S2-emergence phase (4h), and persister abundant stage S3-abundance phase (5h). The differentially expressed genes ([&ge;]2-fold) in persister appearing stage (S1 to S2 transition) and persister abundant stage (S1 to S3) were compared, and 51 and 29 genes were identified to be up-regulated, respectively. Importantly, 13 genes (gnsA, gnsB, ybfA, yjjQ, ymdF, yhdU, csgD, yncN, rpmF, ydcX, yohJ, ssrA, rbsD) overlap in both persister S2-emergence phase and S3-abundance phase, including a member of the trans-translation pathway (ssrA) as well as an orphan toxin (ydcX), which are two well-known persister genes while the remaining 11 novel genes (gnsA, gnsB, ybfA, yjjQ, ymdF, yhdU, csgD, yncN, rpmF, yohJ, rbsD) have not been reported previously. Persister levels of 7 constructed knockout mutants ({Delta}gnsA, {Delta}ybfA, {Delta}yjjQ, {Delta}yhdU, {Delta}csgD, {Delta}yohJ and{Delta} rpmF) and 10 overexpression strains (gnsA, gnsB, ybfA, yjjQ, ymdF, yhdU, csgD, rpmF, yohJ, rbsD) in E. coli uropathogenic strain UTI89 were determined upon treatment with different cidal antibiotics (ampicillin, levofloxacin and gentamicin). Additionally, ranking of these overlapping genes according to their impact on persister levels were also performed. Two genes (rpmF encoding 50S ribosomal subunit protein L32, and yjjQ encoding a putative LuxR-type transcription factor) showed the most obvious phenotype on persister levels in both knockout and overexpression studies, which suggests they are broad and key factors for persister formation. While previous studies cannot distinguish if a given persister gene is involved in persister formation or persister survival, our findings clearly identify novel persister forming genes and pathways involving a ribosome protein and a LuxR type transcription factor during the bona fide persister formation process and may have implications for developing improved treatment of persistent infections.",

    "abstract": "Small regulatory RNA (srRNA) is widely distributed in three kingdoms of life and fulfills functions in many aspects of cellular life, but their role in bacterial persistence remains unknown. In this study, we comprehensively interrogated the expression levels of the known srRNAs on three critical time points, stage 1 (S1) where no persisters are formed, stage 2 (S2) where persisters are beginning to appear, and stage 3 (S3) where persister numbers increase significantly. Three upregulated srRNAs (OmrB, an outer member associated srRNA; RdlB, a swarming motility and curli expression regulator; McaS, a flagellar motility and biofilm formation regulator) overlapping in S2/S1 and S3/S1, together with the other four upregulated srRNAs (MicF, a ribosome binding inhibitor; MicL, an outer membrane associated srRNA; RybB, a cell envelope stress regulator; RydB, regulator of a global regulator RpoS) in S2/S1 are of special interest. By constructing deletion mutants and overexpression strains in uropathogenic E. coli strain UTI89, we tested their persister-formation capabilities in log phase and stationary phase cultures exposed to antibiotics (gentamicin, cefotaxime and levofloxacin) and stresses (heat, hyperosmosis, H2O2, and acid). The results of the deletion mutant studies showed that all the seven identified sRNAs have varying effects on persister formation with different antibiotics or stresses. Moreover, we found all the deletion mutants of these srRNAs have reduced biofilm formation. Additionally, except the McaS and the RydB overexpression strains, all of the srRNAs overexpression strains demonstrated increased persister-formation in antibiotic and stress persister assays, confirming the role of these srRNAs in persistence. Together, we identified seven srRNAs (OmrB, RdlB, McaS, MicF, MicL, RybB, and RydB) that are involved in type II persister formation for the first time. These findings provide convincing evidence for a new level of rapid persistence regulation via srRNA and furnish novel therapeutic targets for intervention.",

    "abstract": "During clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME), membrane scission is achieved by the concerted action of dynamin and its interacting partners. Essential interactions occur between the proline/arginine-rich domain of dynamin (dynPRD) and the Src-homology domain 3 (SH3) of various proteins including amphiphysins. Here we show that multiple SH3 domains must bind simultaneously to dynPRD through three adjacent motifs for dynamins efficient recruitment and function. First, we show in dynamin triple knock-out cells that mutant dynamins modified in a single motif, including the central amphiphysin SH3 (amphSH3) binding motif, are partially capable of rescuing CME. However, mutating two motifs largely prevents that ability. To support this observation, we designed divalent dynPRD-derived peptides. These ligands bind multimers of amphSH3 with >100-fold higher affinity than monovalent ones in vitro. Accordingly, dialyzing living cells with these divalent peptides through a patch-clamp pipette blocks CME 2 to 3 times more effectively than with monovalent ones. Finally, the frequency of endocytic events decreases with competing peptides or hypomorphic rescue mutants but the kinetics of dynamin recruitment is unaffected. This suggests that PRD-SH3 interactions act upstream of dynamin accumulation at the neck of nascent vesicles. We conclude from these data that dynamin drives vesicle scission via multivalent interactions in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) was a deadly disease transferred by antibodies from 5-10% of cows given a novel BVD vaccine. Disease was lethal in 90% of calves receiving colostrum with BNP antibodies. The cause of BNP is not fully understood to date. We revealed a profound difference in immune capacities between BNP dams and non-responders. Significant differences were detectable in response to in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood derived lymphocytes to several mitogens and IL-2. BNP cows regulated their immune proteomes completely different from controls with other immune response master regulators. Since we detected this response pattern also in 22% of cows that were never vaccinated at all, this immune deviant (ID) phenotype is still present in cattle and probably inherited. Immune response pattern of these cows was stable over an observation period of 38 months. Importantly, ID have a significant increased prevalence of mastitis underscoring the clinical importance.",

    "abstract": "Diverse bacterial and archaeal lineages drive biogeochemical cycles in the global ocean, but the evolutionary processes that have shaped their genomic properties and physiological capabilities remain obscure. Here we track the genome evolution of the globally-abundant marine bacterial phylum Marinimicrobia across its diversification into modern marine environments and demonstrate that extant lineages have repeatedly switched between epipelagic and mesopelagic habitats. Moreover, we show that these habitat transitions have been accompanied by repeated and fundamental shifts in genomic organization, cellular bioenergetics, and metabolic modalities. Lineages present in epipelagic niches independently acquired genes necessary for phototrophy and environmental stress mitigation, and their genomes convergently evolved key features associated with genome streamlining. Conversely, lineages residing in mesopelagic waters independently acquired nitrate respiratory machinery and a variety of cytochromes, consistent with the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Further, while surface water clades have retained an ancestral Na+-pumping respiratory complex, deep water lineages have largely replaced this complex with a canonical H+-pumping respiratory complex I, potentially due to the increased efficiency of the latter together with more energy-limiting environments deep in the oceans interior. These parallel evolutionary trends across disparate clades suggest that the evolution of key features of genomic organization and cellular bioenergetics in abundant marine lineages may in some ways be predictable and driven largely by environmental conditions and nutrient dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Despite the identification of many genes and pathways involved in the persistence phenomenon of bacteria, the mechanisms of persistence are not well understood. Here, using Escherichia coli as a model, we identified polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) as a key regulator in persister formation. We successfully constructed pnp knockout mutant strain and its complemented strain, and exposed the pnp knockout mutant and complemented strain to antibiotics and stress conditions. The results showed that, compared with the wild-type W3110, the pnp knockout strain had defect in persistence to antibiotics and stress conditions, and the persistence to antibiotics and stresses was restored upon complementation. RNA-Seq was performed to identify the transcriptome profile in the pnp knockout strain compared with wild-type strain W3110, and the data revealed that 242 (166 up-regulated, and 76 down-regulated) genes were differentially expressed in the pnp knockout mutant strain. KEGG pathway analysis of the up-regulated genes showed that they were mostly mapped to metabolism and virulence pathways, most of which are positively regulated by the global regulator cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). Similarly, the transcription level of the crp gene in the pnp-deletion strain increased 3.22-fold in the early stationary phase. We further explored the indicators of cellular metabolism of the pnp-deletion strain, the persistence phenotype of the pnp and crp double-deletion mutant, and the transcriptional activity of crp gene. Our results indicate that PNPase controls cellular metabolism by negatively regulating the crp operon at the post-transcriptional level by targeting the 5- Untranslated Region (UTR) of the crp transcript. This study offers new insight about the persister mechanisms and provides new targets for development of new drugs against persisters for more effective treatment of persistent bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "While accounting for 2% of the total body mass, the brain is the organ that consumes the most energy. Although it is widely acknowledged that neuronal energy metabolism is tightly regulated, the mechanism how neurons meet their energy demand to sustain synaptic transmission remains poorly studied. Here we provide substantial evidence that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a leading role in this process. Our results show that following synaptic activation, AMPK activation is required to sustain neuronal energy levels particularly through mitochondrial respiration. Further, our studies revealed that this metabolic plasticity regulated by AMPK is required for the expression of immediate early genes, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. These findings are important in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, as AMPK deregulation as it is observed in Alzheimers disease, impairs the metabolic response to synaptic activation. Altogether, our data provides the proof of concept that AMPK is an essential player in the regulation of neuroenergetic metabolism plasticity induced in response to synaptic activation.",

    "abstract": "The standard reference Caenorhabditis elegans strain, N2, has evolved marked behavioral changes since its isolation from the wild 67 years ago. Laboratory-derived variation in two genes, npr-1 and glb-5, suppress aerotaxis behaviors on food, resulting in N2 animals evolving from social to solitary feeding strategies. We show here that the derived alleles of npr-1 and glb-5 can confer large fitness advantages in standard laboratory conditions, suggesting that the changes in feeding strategies were beneficial to the N2 strain. However, by using environmental manipulations that suppress social behaviors, we showed the fitness advantages of the derived alleles remained unchanged, suggesting selection on these alleles acted through biological traits unrelated to solitary behavior. Transcriptomics analysis, developmental timing assays, and feeding assays showed that N2 animals mature faster, produce more sperm, and eat more food than a strain containing ancestral alleles of these genes (CX12311) regardless of the behavioral strategies. The O2-sensing neurons URX, AQR, and PQR and the pheromone biosynthesis and lipid regulating enzyme encoded by daf-22 are necessary for the full fitness advantages. We suggest that changes to social/solitary behavior in N2 were a pleiotropic consequence of npr-1 and glb-5s ability to modify integrated O2 and pheromone neural circuits that regulate feeding rate and reproductive development. Together, our results demonstrate how laboratory evolution can lead to profound changes in a strain used as a model by for understanding a variety of fundamental biological processes.",

We applied StrainSifter to bloodstream isolates and stool metagenome samples from hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with bloodstream infections. StrainSifter is designed to identify single nucleotide variants between isolate and metagenomic short reads using stringent alignment, coverage, and variant frequency criteria for strain comparison. We identified enteric BSI isolates that were highly concordant with those in the gut microbiota, as well as highly concordant strains of typically non-enteric bacteria.

It is important, therefore, to be able to elucidate molecular processes occurring at these interfaces. However, the detailed investigation of each components contribution to the formation and regulation of the contact is hampered by the complexity of cellular composition and architecture. Moreover, the transient nature of these interactions creates additional challenges, especially for using advanced imaging technology. One approach to circumventing these problems is to establish in vitro systems that faithfully mimic immune cell interactions, incorporating complexity that can be  dialled-in as needed. Here, we present an in vitro system making use of synthetic vesicles that mimic important aspects of immune cell surfaces. Using this system, we begin to investigate the spatial distribution of signalling molecules (receptors, kinases and phosphatases) and the intracellular rearrangements that accompany the initiation of signalling in T cells. The model system presented here is expected to be widely applicable.\\n\\nSummary StatementImmune cell-cell interactions are reconstituted in free-standing vesicles wherein spatiotemporal aspects of immune synapse formation can be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity has positive effects on brain health and cognitive function throughout the lifespan. Thus far, few studies have examined the effects of physical activity on white matter (WM) microstructure and psychomotor speed within the same, population-based sample (critical if conclusions are to extend to the wider population). Here, using diffusion tensor imaging and a simple reaction time task within a relatively large population-derived sample (N = 399; 18-87 years) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN), we demonstrate that physical activity mediates the effect of age on white matter integrity, measured with fractional anisotropy. Higher self-reported daily physical activity was associated with greater preservation of WM in several frontal tracts, including the genu of corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, external capsule and anterior limb of the internal capsule. We also show that the age-related slowing is mediated by WM integrity in the genu. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work suggesting that a physically active lifestyle may protect against age-related structural disconnection and slowing.",

    "abstract": "The main outcome of efficient CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage in the chromosome of bacteria is cell death. This can be conveniently used to eliminate specific genotypes from a mixed population of bacteria, which can be achieved both in vitro, e.g. to select mutants, or in vivo as an antimicrobial strategy. The efficiency with which Cas9 kills bacteria has been observed to be quite variable depending on the specific target sequence, but little is known about the sequence determinants and mechanisms involved. Here we performed a genome-wide screen of Cas9 cleavage in the chromosome of E. coli to determine the efficiency with which each guide RNA kills the cell. Surprisingly we observed a large-scale pattern where guides targeting some regions of the chromosome are more rapidly depleted than others. Unexpectedly, this pattern arises from the influence of degrading specific chromosomal regions on the copy number of the plasmid carrying the guide RNA library. After taking this effect into account, it is possible to train a neural network to predict Cas9 efficiency based on the target sequence. We show that our model learns different features than previous models trained on Eukaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 knockout libraries. Our results highlight the need for specific models to design efficient CRISPR-Cas9 tools in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWhole-genome alignment methods show insufficient scalability towards the generation of large-scale whole-genome alignments (WGAs). Profile alignment-based approaches revolutionized the fields of multiple sequence alignment construction methods by significantly reducing computational complexity and runtime. However, WGAs need to consider genomic rearrangements between genomes, which makes the profile-based extension of several whole-genomes challenging. Currently, none of the available methods offer the possibility to align or extend WGA profiles.\n\nResultsHere, we present GPA, an approach that aligns the profiles of WGAs and is capable of producing large-scale WGAs many times faster than conventional methods. Our concept relies on already available whole-genome aligners, which are used to compute several smaller sets of aligned genomes that are combined to a full WGA with a divide and conquer approach. To align or extend WGA profiles, we make use of the SuperGenome data structure, which features a bidirectional mapping between individual sequence and alignment coordinates. This data structure is used to efficiently transfer different coordinate systems into a common one based on the principles of profiles alignments. The approach allows the computation of a WGA where alignments are subsequently merged along a guide tree. The current implementation uses progressiveMauve (Darling et al., 2010) and offers the possibility for parallel computation of independent genome alignments. Our results based on various bacterial data sets up to several hundred genomes show that we can reduce the runtime from months to hours with a quality that is negligibly worse than the WGA computed with the conventional progressiveMauve tool.\n\nAvailabilityGPA is freely available at https://lambda.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/gitlab/ahennig/GPA.

Microtubule network dynamics are controlled by many factors including the efficiency and localization of the nucleation machinery. Microtubule nucleation is dependent on the universally conserved {gamma}-tubulin small complex ({gamma}TuSC), a 300 kDa heterotetramer composed of two copies of {gamma}-tubulin and one each of accessory proteins GCP2 and GCP3. In yeast, nucleation is mediated by a heptameric ring of {gamma}TuSC, which presents 13 {gamma}-tubulins to form a template for microtubule nucleation.\\n\\nWe have obtained single-particle structures of the {gamma}TuSC as a monomer and dimer at resolutions of 3.6-4.6[A], allowing us to build an atomic model for this important complex. By comparison with a crystal structure of isolated {gamma}-tubulin, it is clear that {gamma}-tubulin is activated upon assembly into the {gamma}TuSC, in a manner analogous to the bent to straight transition in {beta}-tubulin upon assembly into the microtubule lattice. Our structures allow us to map phosphorylation sites, revealing several at key interfaces, highly suggestive of their role in regulating spindle pole body attachment and assembly into rings.

Here we present cryo-EM reconstructions of the PhuZ filamentin a pre-hydrolysis (3.5[A]) and three post-hydrolysis states (4.2 [A], 7.3 [A] and 8.1 [A] resolutions), likely representing distinct depolymerization stages. Core polymerization-induced structural changes reveal similarities to {beta}-tubulin, suggesting broad conservation within the tubulin family. By contrast, GTP hydrolysis is sensed quite differently and is communicated by the divergent PhuZ C-terminus to the lateral interface, leading to PhuZ polymer destabilization. This provides a contrasting molecular description of how nucleotide state can be harnessed by the tubulin fold to regulate filament assembly, metastability and disassembly.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between structure and function is of interest in many research fields involving the study of complex biological processes. In neuroscience in particular, the fusion of structural and functional data can help understanding the underlying principles of the operational networks in the brain. To address this issue, this paper proposes a constrained autoregressive model leading to a representation of \"effective\" connectivity that can be used to better understand how the structure modulates the function. Or simply, it can be used to find novel biomarkers characterizing groups of subjects. In practice, an initial structural connectivity representation is re-weighted to explain the functional co-activations. This is obtained by minimizing the reconstruction error of an autoregressive model constrained by the structural connectivity prior. The model has been designed to also include indirect connections, allowing to split direct and indirect components in the functional connectivity, and it can be used with raw and deconvoluted BOLD signal.\n\nThe derived representation of dependencies was compared to the well known dynamic causal model, giving results closer to known ground-truth. Further evaluation of the proposed effective network was performed on two typical tasks. In a first experiment the direct functional dependencies were tested on a community detection problem, where the brain was partitioned using the effective networks across multiple subjects. In a second experiment the model was validated in a case-control task, which aimed at differentiating healthy subjects from individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Results showed that using effective connectivity leads to clusters better describing the functional interactions in the community detection task, while maintaining the original structural organization, and obtaining a better discrimination in the case-control classification task.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA method to combine structural and functional connectivity by using autoregressive model is proposed.\nC_LIO_LIThe autoregressive model is constrained by structural connectivity defining coefficients for Granger causality.\nC_LIO_LIThe usefulness of the generated effective connections is tested on simulations, ground-truth default mode network experiments, a classification and clustering task.\nC_LIO_LIThe method can be used for direct and indirect connections, and with raw and deconvoluted BOLD signal.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Neuronal morphology reconstruction in fluorescence microscopy 3D images is essential for analyzing neuronal cell type and connectivity. Manual tracing of neurons in these images is time consuming and subjective. Automated tracing is highly desired yet is one of the foremost challenges in computational neuroscience. The multispectral labeling technique, Brainbow utilizes high dimensional spectral information to distinguish intermingled neuronal processes. It is particular interesting to develop new algorithms to include the spectral information into the tracing process. Recently, deep learning approaches achieved state-of-the-art in different computer vision and medical imaging applications. To benefit from the power of deep learning, in this paper, we propose an automated neural tracing approach in multispectral 3D Brainbow images based on recurrent neural net-work. We first adopt VBM4D approach to denoise multispectral 3D images. Then we generate cubes as training samples along the ground truth, manually traced paths. These cubes are the input to the recur-rent neural network. The proposed approach is simple and effective. The approach can be implemented with the deep learning toolbox  Keras in 100 lines. Finally, to evaluate our approach, we computed the average and standard deviation of DIADEM metric from the ground truth results to our tracing results, and from our tracing results to the ground truth results. Extensive experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach performs well in Brainbow labeled mouse brain images.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn the past years, several methods have been developed to incorporate information about phenotypes into computational disease gene prioritization methods. These methods commonly compute the similarity between a diseases (or patients) phenotypes and a database of gene-to-phenotype associations to find the phenotypically most similar match. A key limitation of these methods is their reliance on knowledge about phenotypes associated with particular genes which is highly incomplete in humans as well as in many model organisms such as the mouse.\\n\\nResultsWe developed SmuDGE, a method that uses feature learning to generate vector-based representations of phenotypes associated with an entity. SmuDGE can be used as a trainable semantic similarity measure to compare two sets of phenotypes (such as between a disease and gene, or a disease and patient). More importantly, SmuDGE can generate phenotype representations for entities that are only indirectly associated with phenotypes through an interaction network; for this purpose, SmuDGE exploits background knowledge in interaction networks comprising of multiple types of interactions. We demonstrate that SmuDGE can match or outperform semantic similarity in phenotype-based disease gene prioritization, and furthermore significantly extends the coverage of phenotype-based methods to all genes in a connected interaction network.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/SmuDGE\\n\\nContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",

We used serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to determine from multiple specimens the neuromast connectome, or comprehensive set of connections between hair cells and afferent and efferent nerve fibers. This analysis delineated a complex but consistent wiring pattern with three striking characteristics: each nerve terminal is highly specific in receiving innervation from hair cells of a single directional sensitivity; the innervation is redundant; and the terminals manifest a hierarchy of dominance. Mutation of the canonical planar-cell-polarity gene vangl2, which decouples the asymmetric phenotypes of sibling hair-cell pairs, results in randomly positioned, randomly oriented sibling cells that nonetheless retain specific wiring. Because larvae that overexpress Notch exhibit uniformly oriented, uniformly innervating hair-cell siblings, wiring specificity is mediated by the Notch signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Few biodiversity indicators are available that reflect broad-sense biodiversity - rather than particular taxa - at fine spatial and temporal resolution. The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) reports how the average abundance of native terrestrial species in a region compares with their abundances before pronounced human impacts. BII is designed for use with data from a wide range of taxa and functional groups and for estimation at any resolution for which data on land use and related pressures are available. For each year from 2001 to 2012 we combined models of how land use and related pressures in tropical and subtropical forested biomes affect overall abundance and compositional similarity with data on anthropogenic pressures. We used these data to produce annual maps of modelled BII at a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds (roughly 1km at the equator) across tropical and subtropical forested biomes. This is the first time temporal change in BII has been estimated across such a large region. The modelling approach used for compositional similarity is an improvement over that used previously when estimating BII, using data more efficiently. Overall, BII fell by an average of 2.4 percentage points between 2001 and 2012, with 83 countries seeing an average reduction and 45 an average increase, and the extent of primary forest fell by 3.9% over the same period. Changes are not strongly related to countries rates of economic growth over the same period.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSocial vulnerability is strongly associated with tuberculosis (TB) indicators like cure rate. By addressing key social determinants, social protection policies such as Brazils Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP), a governmental conditional cash transfer, may play a role in TB control. Evidence is consolidating around a positive effect of social protection on TB outcomes, however methodological limitations prevent strong conclusions. This paper uses a quasi-experimental approach to more rigorously evaluate the effect of BFP on TB cure rate.\\n\\nMethods & FindingsThe data source was Brazils TB notification system (SINAN), linked to the national registry of those in poverty (CadUnico) and the BFP payroll. Propensity scores (PSs) were estimated from a complete-case logistic regression using covariates from this linked dataset, informed by a directed acyclic graph. Control patients were matched to exposed patients on the PS and the average effect of treatment on the treated (ATT) was estimated as the difference in TB cure rate between matched groups (n = 2167). The ATT was estimated as 10{middle dot}58 (95% CIs: 4{middle dot}39, 16{middle dot}77). This suggests that 10{middle dot}58% of the TB patients receiving BFP who were cured would not have been cured had they not received BFP. The direction of this effect was robust to sensitivity analyses performed and the PS matching broadly improved balance, although missing data limited the sample size.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work is the first quasi-experimental evaluation of social protection in wide-scale practice on TB outcomes. It demonstrates a positive effect of conditional cash transfers on TB cure rate consistent with existing work, suggesting changes to policy and future research on increasing access to social protection for TB patients who remain uncovered by the programme.",

Yet, the convergence of differential gene expression patterns between closely related species-pairs might reflect the role of natural selection during the process of ecological speciation. Here, we test for intercontinental convergence in differential transcriptional signatures between limnetic and benthic sympatric species-pairs of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and its sister-lineage, the European Whitefish (C. lavaretus), using six replicated sympatric species-pairs (two in North America, two in Norway and two in Switzerland). We characterized both sequence variation in transcribed regions and differential gene expression between sympatric limnetic and benthic species across regions and continents. Our first finding was that differentially expressed genes (DEG) between limnetic and benthic whitefish tend to be enriched in shared polymorphism among sister-lineages. We then used both genotypes and co-variation in expression in order to infer polygenic selection at the gene level. We identified parallel outliers and DEG involving genes primarily over-expressed in limnetic species relative to the benthic species. Our analysis finally revealed the existence of shared genomic bases underlying parallel differential expression across replicated species pairs from both continents, such as a cis-eQTL affecting the pyruvate kinase expression level involved in glycolysis. Our results are consistent with a longstanding role of natural selection in maintaining transcontinental diversity at phenotypic traits involved in ecological speciation between limnetic and benthic whitefishes.",

To this end, we conducted a transcriptome-wide survey of tissue-specific gene expression and splicing events in the unprecedented collection of 8527 high-quality RNA-seq samples from the GTEx project, covering 36 human peripheral tissues and 13 brain subregions. We derived a weighted tissue-specificity scoring scheme accounting for the similarity of related tissues and inherent variability across individual samples. We showed that ~50.6% of all annotated human genes show tissue-specific expression, including many low abundance transcripts vastly underestimated by previous array-based expression atlases. As utilities for drug discovery, we demonstrated that tissue-specificity is a highly desirable attribute of validated drug targets and tissue-specificity can be used to prioritize disease-associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using brain striatum-specific gene expression as an example, we provided a template to leverage tissue-specific gene expression to identify novel therapeutic targets. Mining of tissue-specific splicing further reveals new opportunities for tissue-specific targeting. Thus, the high quality transcriptome atlas provided by the GTEx is an invaluable resource for drug discovery and systematic analysis anchored on the human tissue specific gene expression provides a promising avenue to identify novel therapeutic target hypotheses.",

We generated zygotes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using sperm obtained from the proximal (caput) vs. distal (cauda) epididymis, then characterized development of the resulting embryos. Embryos generated using caput sperm significantly overexpress multiple regulatory factors throughout preimplantation development, and subsequently implant inefficiently and fail soon after implantation. Remarkably, microinjection of purified cauda-specific small RNAs into caput-derived embryos not only completely rescued preimplantation molecular defects, but also suppressed the postimplantation embryonic lethality phenotype. These findings reveal an essential role for small RNA remodeling during post-testicular maturation of mammalian sperm, and identify a specific preimplantation gene expression program responsive to sperm-delivered microRNAs.",

In other behavioral contexts, mesolimbic engagement has been shown to enhance episodic memory by supporting consolidation. However, research has yet to investigate how consolidation may support interactions between decision-making and episodic memory. Across two studies, participants encoded items that were occluded by cover screens and could either actively decide which of two items to uncover or were pre-selected by the experimenter. In Study 1, we show that active decision-making reduces forgetting rates across an immediate and 24-hour memory test, a behavioral marker of consolidation. In Study 2, we use functional neuroimaging to characterize putative neural markers of memory consolidation by measuring post-encoding interactions between the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (PRC). We show that choice-related striatal engagement is associated with increased post-encoding hippocampal-PRC interactions. Finally, we show that a previous reported relationship between choice-related striatal engagement and long-term memory is accounted for by post-encoding hippocampal-PRC interactions. Together these findings support a model by which actively deciding to encode information enhances subsequent consolidation mechanisms to preserve episodic memory for outcomes.",

Their signature in the hippocampal extracellular field potential (EFP) can be decomposed into a {approx} 100 ms long sharp wave superimposed by {approx} 200 Hz ripple oscillations. How ripple oscillations are generated is currently not well understood. A promising model for the genesis of ripple oscillations is based on recurrent interneuronal networks (INT-INT). According to this hypothesis, the INT-INT network in CA1 receives a burst of excitation from CA3 that generates the sharp wave, and recurrent inhibition leads to an ultrafast synchronization of the CA1 network causing the ripple oscillations; fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV+BCs) may constitute the ripple-generating interneuronal network. PV+BCs are also coupled by gap junctions (GJs) but the function of GJs for ripple oscillations has not been quantified. Using simulations of CA1 hippocampal networks of PV+BCs, we show that GJs promote synchrony and increase the neuronal firing rate of the interneuronal ensemble, while the ripple frequency is only affected mildly. The promoting effect of GJs on ripple oscillations depends on fast GJ transmission ([lsim] 0.5 ms), which requires proximal gap junction coupling ([lsim] 100 m from soma).",

    "abstract": "When evaluating a newly developed statistical test, the first step is to check its type 1 error (TIE) control using simulations. This is often achieved by the standard simulation design S0 under the so-called  theoretical null of no association. In practice, whole-genome association analyses scan through a large number of genetic markers (Gs) for the ones associated with an outcome of interest (Y), where Y comes from an unknown alternative while the majority of Gs are not associated with Y, that is under the  empirical null. This reality can be better represented by two other simulation designs, where design S1.1 simulates Y from an alternative model based on G then evaluates its association with independently generated Gnew, while design S1.2 evaluates the association between permutated Yperm and G. More than a decade ago, Efron (2004) has noted the important distinction between the  theoretical and  empirical null in false discovery rate control. Using scale tests for variance heterogeneity and location tests of interaction effect as two examples, here we show that not all null simulation designs are equal. In examining the accuracy of a likelihood ratio test, while simulation design S0 shows the method has the correct T1E control, designs S1.1 and S1.2 suggest otherwise with empirical T1E values of 0.07 for the 0.05 nominal level. And the inflation becomes more severe at the tail and does not diminish as sample size increases.

    "abstract": "The distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels Kv1 at the axon initial segment (AIS), along the axon and at presynaptic terminals influences intrinsic excitability and transmitter release. Kv1.1/1.2 subunits are associated with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including Caspr2 and LGI1 that are implicated in autoimmune and genetic neurological diseases with seizures. In particular, mutations in the LGI1 gene cause autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADTLE). In the present study, we used rat hippocampal neurons in culture to assess whether interplay between distinct Kv1-associated CAMs contributes to targeting at the AIS. Strikingly, LGI1 was highly restricted to the AIS surface when transfected alone, whereas the missense mutant LGI1S473L associated with ADLTE was not. Next, we showed that ADAM22 and ADAM23 acted as chaperones to promote axonal vesicular transport of LGI1 reducing its density at the AIS. Moreover, live-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled CAMs indicated that LGI1 was co-transported in axonal vesicles with ADAM22 or ADAM23. Finally, we showed that ADAM22 and ADAM23 also associate with Caspr2 and TAG-1 to be selectively targeted within different axonal sub-regions. The combinatorial expression of Kv1-associated CAMs may be critical to tune intrinsic excitability in a physiological or an epileptogenic context.",

    "abstract": "Unbiased scientific reporting is crucial for data and research synthesis. Previous studies suggest that statistically significant results are more likely to be published and more likely to be submitted to high impact journals. However, the most recent research on statistical significance in relation to journal impact factors in ecological research was published more than two decades ago or addressed a small subset of the literature. Here, we extract p-values from all articles published in 11 journals in 2012 and 2014 across a wide range of impact factors with six journals sampled in both years. Our results indicate that the proportion of statistically significant results increases with rising impact factor. Such a trend can have important consequences for syntheses of ecological data and it highlights the importance of covering a wide range of impact factors when identifying published studies for data syntheses. This trend can also lead to a biased understanding of the probability of true effects in ecology and conservation. We caution against the possible downplaying of non-significant results by either journals or authors.",

    "abstract": "Formins play an important role in the polymerization of unbranched actin filaments, and particular formins slow elongation by 5-95%. We studied the interactions between actin and the FH2 domains of formins Cdc12, Bni1 and mDia1 to understand the factors underlying their different rates of polymerization. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations revealed two factors that influence actin filament elongation and correlate with the rates of elongation. First, FH2 domains can sterically block the addition of new actin subunits. Second, FH2 domains flatten the helical twist of the terminal actin subunits, making the end less favorable for subunit addition. Coarse-grained simulations over longer time scales support these conclusions. The simulations show that filaments spend time in states that either allow or block elongation. The rate of elongation is a time-average of the degree to which the formin compromises subunit addition rather than the formin-actin complex literally being in  open or  closed states.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular protons and calcium ions are two major chemical factors that regulate connexin43 (Cx43) gap junction channels and the synergism or antagonism between pH and Ca2+ has been questioned for decades. In this study, we assessed whether the calcium gating mechanism occurs independently of the pH gating mechanism by utilizing the Cx43-M257 (Cx43K258stop) mutant, a carboxyl-terminal (CT) truncated version of Cx43 lacking the pH gating domain. Dual whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed on Neuroblastoma-2a (N2a) cells or neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes (NMVMs) expressing either full length Cx43 or Cx43-M257 proteins. Addition of 1 M ionomycin to normal calcium saline reduced Cx43 or Cx43-M257 macroscopic gap junction conductance (gj) to zero within 15 min of perfusion, while this response was prevented by omitting 1.8 mM CaCl2 from the external solution or adding 100 nM calmodulin (CaM) inhibitory peptide to the internal pipette solution. The ability of connexin calmodulin binding domain (Cx CaMBD) mimetic peptides and the Gap19 peptide to inhibit the Ca2+/CaM gating response of Cx43 gap junctions was also examined. Internal addition of a Cx50 cytoplasmic loop CaMBD peptide (200 nM) prevented the Ca2+/ionomycin-induced decrease in Cx43 gj, while 100 M Gap19 peptide had no effect. Lastly, the transjunctional voltage (Vj) gating properties of NMVM Cx43-M257 gap junctions were investigated. We confirmed that the fast kinetic inactivation component was absent in Cx43-M257 gap junctions, but also observed that the previously reported facilitated recovery of gj from inactivating potentials was abolished by CT truncation of Cx43. We conclude that CT pH gating domain of Cx43 contributes to the Vj-dependent fast inactivation and facilitated recovery of Cx43 gap junctions, but the Ca2+/CaM-dependent gating mechanism remains intact. Sequence-specific Cx CaMBD mimetic peptides act by binding Ca2+/CaM non-specifically and the Cx43 mimetic Gap19 peptide has no effect on this chemical gating mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death globally. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 95 independent loci that influence CAD risk, most of which reside in non-coding regions of the genome. To interpret these loci, we generated transcriptome and whole-genome datasets using human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) from 52 unrelated donors, as well as epigenomic datasets using ATAC-seq on a subset of 8 donors. Through systematic comparison with publicly available datasets from GTEx and ENCODE projects, we identified transcriptomic, epigenetic, and genetic regulatory mechanisms specific to HCASMC. We assessed the relevance of HCASMC to CAD risk using transcriptomic and epigenomic level analyses. By jointly modeling eQTL and GWAS datasets, we identified five genes (SIPA1, TCF21, SMAD3, FES, and PDGFRA) that modulate CAD risk through HCASMC, all of which have relevant functional roles in vascular remodeling. Comparison with GTEx data suggests that SIPA1 and PDGFRA influence CAD risk predominantly through HCASMC, while other annotated genes may have multiple cell and tissue targets. Together, these results provide new tissue-specific and mechanistic insights into the regulation of a critical vascular cell type associated with CAD in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Following synthesis, RNA can be modified with over 100 chemically distinct modifications, and in recent years it was shown that processing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs can be impacted by an increasing number of these modifications. A modification that recently gained attention is N1-methyladenosine (m1A), which is present across all three domains of life. Recently, two studies - one of them ours - developed conceptually similar approaches to map m1A in a transcriptome-wide manner and at single nucleotide resolution. Surprisingly, the two studies diverged quite substantially in terms of their estimates of the abundance, whereabouts and stoichiometry of this modification within internal sites in cytosolic mRNAs: One study reported it to be a very rare modification, present at very low stoichiometries, and invariably catalyzed by TRMT6/61A. The other found it to be present at >470 sites, in dozens of which at relatively high levels, and in the vast majority of cases these sites were highly unlikely to be substrates of TRMT6/61A, suggesting that additional methyltransferases are active on cytosolic mRNAs. Here we aim to reconcile the contradictions between the two studies, primarily by reanalyzing and re-annotating the set of sites identified in the latter study. We find that the vast majority of sites detected in this study originate from duplications, misannotations, mismapping, SNPs, sequencing errors, and a set of sites originating from the very first transcribed base ( TSS sites). We raise concerns as to whether the TSS sites truly reflect m1A originating from the first transcribed base. We find that only 53 of the sites detected in this study likely reflect bona-fide internal modifications of cytoplasmically encoded mRNA molecules. The vast majority of these are likely to be TRMT6/TRMT61A substrates, and are typically modified at low to undetectable levels. We conclude that within cytosolic mRNAs, m1A is a rare internal modification where it is typically catalyzed at ultra-low stoichiometries via TRMT6/TRMT61A. Our findings offer a clear and consistent view on the abundance and whereabouts of this modification, and lays out key directions for future studies in the field.",

Since training data must be created by hand for each experiment, this task can be very costly and time-consuming.

We have discovered a system that blocks late events of cytokinesis until early ones are successfully accomplished. In budding yeast, cytokinetic actomyosin ring contraction and membrane ingression are coupled with deposition of an extracellular septum that is destroyed immediately after its completion by secreted enzymes. We find this secretion event is linked to septum completion and forestalled when the process is slowed. Delay of septum destruction requires Fir1, an intrinsically disordered protein localized to the cytokinesis site that is degraded upon septum completion but stabilized when septation is aberrant. Fir1 appears to protect cytokinesis in part by inhibiting a separation-specific exocytosis function of the NDR/LATS kinase Cbk1, a key component of a \\\"hippo\\\" signaling pathway that induces mother-daughter separation. We term this system \\\"enforcement of cytokinesis order\\\" (ECO), a checkpoint ensuring proper temporal sequence of mechanistically incompatible processes of cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "Executive summaryO_ST_ABSBackground and objectivesC_ST_ABSSouth Africa has one of the highest HIV incidence rates in the world. Although much research has focused on developing biomedical strategies to reduce HIV incidence, there has been less investment in prevention strategies that address the social drivers of HIV spread. Understanding the social determinants of HIV is closely related to understanding high-risk populations ( key populations), since many of the factors that place these key populations at high HIV risk are social and behavioural rather than biological.\\n\\nMathematical models have an important role to play in evaluating the potential impact of new HIV prevention and treatment strategies. However, most of the mathematical modelling studies that have been published to date have evaluated biomedical HIV prevention strategies, and relatively few models have been developed to understand the role of social determinants or interventions that address these social drivers. In addition, many of the mathematical models that have been developed are relatively simple deterministic models, which are not well suited to simulating the complex causal pathways that link many of the social drivers to HIV incidence. The frequency-dependent assumption implicit in most deterministic models also leads to under-estimation of the contribution of high-risk groups to the incidence of HIV.\\n\\nAgent-based models (ABMs) overcome many of the limitations of deterministic models, although at the expense of greater computational burden. This study presents an ABM of HIV in South Africa, developed to characterize the key social drivers of HIV in South Africa and the groups that are at the highest risk of HIV. The objective of this report is to provide a technical description of the model and to explain how the model has been calibrated to South African data sources; future publications will assess the drivers of HIV transmission in South Africa in more detail.\\n\\nMethodsThe model is an extension of a previously-published ABM of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in South Africa. This model simulates a representative sample of the South African population, starting from 1985, with an initial sample size of 20 000. The population changes in size as a result of births and deaths. Each individual is assigned a date of birth, sex and race (demographic characteristics). This in turn affects the assignment of socio-economic variables. Each individual is assigned a level of educational attainment, which is dynamically updated as youth progress through school and tertiary education, with rates of progression and drop-out depending on the individuals demographic characteristics. Each individual is also assigned to an urban or rural location, with rates of movement between urban and rural areas depending on demographic characteristics and educational attainment.\\n\\nThe model assigns to each individual a number of healthcare access variables that determine their HIV and pregnancy risk. These include their  condom preference (a measure of the extent to which they wish to use condoms and are able to access condoms), use of hormonal contraception and sterilization, use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), male circumcision, HIV testing history and uptake of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Access to these healthcare services changes over time, and is also assumed to depend on demographic and socioeconomic variables, as well as on the individuals health status.\\n\\nSexual behaviour is simulated by assigning to each individual an indicator of their propensity for concurrent partnerships ( high risk individuals are defined as individuals who have a propensity for concurrent partnerships or commercial sex). Each individual is also assigned a sexual preference, which can change over their life course. Three types of relationship are modelled: sex worker-client contacts, short-term (non-marital) relationships and long-term (marital or cohabiting) relationships. Individuals are assumed to enter into short-term relationships at rates that depend on their risk group and demographic characteristics. Each time a new short-term partner is acquired, the individual is linked to another individual in the population, with the probability of linkage depending on the individuals sexual preference and preference for individuals of the relevant age, risk group, race, location and educational attainment. Individuals marry their short-term partners at rates that depend on their demographic characteristics. Frequencies of sex are assumed to depend on demographic characteristics and relationship type, and migrant couples are assumed to have reduced coital frequency. Probabilities of condom use also depend on demographic characteristics and relationship type, and are assumed to be strongly associated with levels of educational attainment.\\n\\nWomens risk of falling pregnant is assumed to depend on their sexual behaviour, natural fertility level, contraceptive usage and breastfeeding status. Adoption and discontinuation of hormonal contraception is assumed to depend on demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and past pregnancy and contraceptive experience. Girls who fall pregnant while in school are assumed to be less likely to complete their schooling than those who do not fall pregnant.\\n\\nProbabilities of HIV transmission per act of sex are assumed to depend on several biological factors, including the viral load of the HIV-positive partner, whether the HIV-positive partner is on ART, the presence of other STIs, the type of contraceptive used, the age and sex of the susceptible partner, male circumcision, the type of relationship, and the use of new HIV prevention methods such as PrEP. If an individual acquires HIV, they are assigned a CD4 count and viral load, both of which change dynamically over the course of HIV infection. The HIV mortality risk is determined by the individuals CD4 count. HIV-positive individuals are diagnosed at rates that depend on their demographic characteristics and CD4 count, and if they disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners after diagnosis, this is assumed to lead to increased rates of condom use. Assumptions about HIV transmission probabilities have been set in such a way that the model matches the observed trends in HIV prevalence, by age and sex, in national South African antenatal and household surveys.\\n\\nThe model also simulates male incarceration. Rates of incarceration are assumed to depend on mens demographic characteristics and educational attainment, and are also assumed to be higher in men who have previously been incarcerated.\\n\\nResults and conclusionsThe model matches reasonably closely the observed levels of HIV prevalence in South Africa by age and sex, as well as the observed changes in HIV prevalence over time. The model also matches observed patterns of HIV prevalence by educational attainment, by urban-rural location and by history of recent migration. Estimates of HIV prevalence in key populations (sex workers, MSM and prisoners) are roughly consistent with surveys. The model has also been calibrated to match total numbers of HIV tests and male circumcision operations performed in South Africa. The model estimates of levels of HIV diagnosis and ART coverage are consistent with the Thembisa model, an HIV model that has been calibrated to South African HIV testing and ART data.\\n\\nAlthough many of the phenomena simulated in the MicroCOSM model have been simulated in previously-published HIV models, MicroCOSM is the first model that systematically describes all of these phenomena in a fully integrated model. This makes it possible to use the model to describe complex interactions between socio-economic and behavioural factors, and their influence on disease and health-seeking behaviour. It also provides a framework for understanding socio-economic and racial inequality in health outcomes in South Africa, and for assessing the potential impact of strategies to reduce these inequalities.",

    "abstract": "The cyclic AMP - Protein Kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic signaling network that is essential for growth and development. In the fungi, cAMP-PKA signaling plays a critical role in regulating cellular physiology and morphological switches in response to nutrient availability. We undertook a comparative investigation of the role that cAMP-PKA signaling plays in the regulation of filamentous growth in two closely related budding yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus. Using chemical and genetic perturbations of this pathway and its downstream targets we discovered divergent roles for cAMP-PKA signaling in the regulation of filamentous growth. While cAMP-PKA signaling is required for the filamentous growth response in both species, increasing or decreasing the activity of this pathway leads to drastically different phenotypic outcomes. In S. cerevisiae, cAMP-PKA inhibition ameliorates the filamentous growth response while hyper-activation of the pathway leads to increased filamentous growth; the same perturbations in S. bayanus result in the obverse. Divergence in the regulation of filamentous growth between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus extends to downstream targets of PKA, including several kinases, transcription factors, and effector proteins. Our findings highlight the potential for significant evolutionary divergence in gene network function, even when the constituent parts of such networks are well conserved.",

    "abstract": "Telomere length (TL) is associated with numerous disease states and is affected by genetic and environmental factors. However, TL has been mostly studied in adult populations of European or Asian ancestry. These studies have identified 34 TL-associated genetic variants recently used as genetic proxies for TL. The generalizability of these associations to pediatric populations and racially diverse populations, specifically of African ancestry, remains unclear. Furthermore, six novel variants associated with TL in a population of European children have been identified but not validated. We measured TL from whole blood samples of 492 healthy African American youth (children and adolescents between 8 and 20 years old) and performed the first genome-wide association study of TL in this population. We were unable to replicate neither the 34 reported genetic associations found in adults nor the six genetic associations found in European children. However, we discovered a novel genome-wide significant association between TL and rs1483898 on chromosome 14. Our results underscore the importance of examining these genetic associations with TL in diverse pediatric populations such as African Americans.",

    "abstract": "Article SummaryIn order to elucidate the genetic architecture of the auditory hair cell synapse and the susceptibility to noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, we are providing the first genome-wide association study with 111 strains (n=695) of the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel based upon the strain variation of the wave 1 P1-N1 amplitude of the auditory brainstem responses both before and after noise exposure. Based on this association analysis and our cochlear gene expression data, we identified several novel loci and prioritized positional candidate genes related to cochlear synaptopathy, especially after exposure to noise.\\n\\nAbstractThis is the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) to define the genetic landscape of the auditory hair cell synapse and the susceptibility to noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy. We tested 5-week old female mice (n=695) from 111 HMDP strains (n= 6-7/strain) at baseline and post noise exposure using ABR wave 1 suprathreshold amplitudes (P1-N1 at 80 dB SPL) at 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32 kHz tone burst stimuli. Mice were exposed for 2 hours to 10 kHz octave band noise (OBN) at 108 dB SPL. A broad range of suprathreshold ABR wave 1 amplitude were detected across the HMDP strains. At the genome-wide significance threshold (-logP = 5.39), associations on Chr. 3 and Chr. 16 were identified at baseline. Also, association peaks on Chr. 2 and Chr. 13 were determined post noise exposure. In order to prioritize candidate genes, we generated gene expression microarray profiles using RNA isolated from cochleae in 64 HMDP strains (n =3 arrays per strain). We then used EMMA to perform an association analysis between all SNPs and array probes mapping within each region. A total of 17 genes (2 within Chr. 3 association, 6 within Chr. 2 association and 9 within Chr. 13 association) of these 3 loci were identified with at least 1 probe whose expression was regulated by a significant cis eQTL in the cochlea. Also, the genetic architecture of noise induced cochlear synaptopathy is distinct from that of baseline auditory nerve/synapse integrity. In summary, from this GWAS and our eQTL data, we identified 4 novel loci and prioritized positional candidate genes related to cochlear synaptopathy at baseline and after exposure to noise.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTreatment with the -glucosidase inhibitor acarbose increases median lifespan by approximately 20% in male mice and 5% in females. This longevity extension differs from dietary restriction based on a number of features, including the relatively small effects on weight and the sex-specificity of the lifespan effect. By inhibiting host digestion, acarbose increases the flux of starch to the lower digestive system, resulting in changes to the gut microbiota and their fermentation products. Given the documented health benefits of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the dominant products of starch fermentation by gut bacteria, this secondary effect of acarbose could contribute to increased longevity in mice. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the fecal microbiome of mice treated with acarbose to control mice at three independent study sites.\\n\\nResultsMicrobial communities and the concentrations of SCFAs in the feces of mice treated with acarbose were notably different from those of control mice. At all three study sites, the bloom of a single bacterial taxon was the most obvious response to acarbose treatment. The blooming populations were classified to the largely uncultured Bacteroidales family Muribaculaceae and were the same taxonomic unit at two of the three sites. Total SCFA concentrations in feces were increased in treated mice, with increased butyrate and propionate in particular. Across all samples, Muribaculaceae abundance was strongly correlated with propionate and community composition was an important predictor of SCFA concentrations. Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the fecal concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and propionate were, together, predictive of mouse longevity even while controlling for sex, site, and acarbose.\\n\\nConclusionWe have demonstrated a correlation between fecal SCFAs and lifespan in mice, suggesting a role of the gut microbiota in the longevity-enhancing properties of acarbose. Treatment modulated the taxonomic composition and fermentation products of the gut microbiome, while the site-dependence of the microbiota illustrates the challenges facing reproducibility and interpretation in microbiome studies. These results motivate future studies exploring manipulation of the gut microbial community and its fermentation products for increased longevity, and to test a causal role of SCFAs in the observed effects of acarbose.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viruses are highly infectious; however, the variation of individuals physiologic responses to viral exposure is poorly understood. Most studies examining molecular predictors of response focus on late stage predictors, typically near the time of peak symptoms. To determine whether pre- or early post-exposure factors could predict response, we conducted a community-based analysis to identify predictors of resilience or susceptibility to several respiratory viruses (H1N1, H3N2, Rhinovirus, and RSV) using peripheral blood gene expression profiles collected from healthy subjects prior to viral exposure, as well as up to 24 hours following exposure. This analysis revealed that it is possible to construct models predictive of symptoms using profiles even prior to viral exposure. Analysis of predictive gene features revealed little overlap among models; however, in aggregate, these genes were enriched for common pathways. Heme Metabolism, the most significantly enriched pathway, was associated with higher risk of developing symptoms following viral exposure.",

    "abstract": "SummarySystems biology analysis often involves building predictive models by selecting informative features from a large number of measurements. The elastic net for generalized linear models is a popular regression and feature selection method, particularly useful when the number of features is greater than the sample size or when there exist many correlated predictor variables. This package provides a quantitative, cross-validation based toolkit to evaluate elastic net models and to uncover correlates contributing to prediction. Feature importance is evaluated by flexible criteria using out-of-bag prediction performance assessed via user-defined quality functions. Statistical significance is assigned to each model by comparison to null models generated by permutations of sample labels; analogous approaches are used to assess significance for the contribution of individual features to prediction. This package fits linear, binomial (logistic) and multinomial models, and provides a set of standard plots, summary statistics and output tables. eNetXplorer enables quantitative, exploratory analysis to generate hypotheses on which features may be associated with biological phenotypes of interest, such as in the identification of biomarkers for therapeutic responsiveness.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationThe eNetXplorer R package is available under GPLv3 license at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eNetXplorer",

We show that in the fruitfly Drosophila, MEF2 is essential for normal development of wing veins, and for mushroom body formation in the brain. In embryos mutant for D-mef2, there was a striking reduction in the number of mushroom body neurons and their axon bundles were not detectable. D-MEF2 expression coincided with the formation of embryonic mushroom bodies and, in larvae, expression onset was confirmed to be in post-mitotic neurons. With a D-mef2 point mutation that disrupts nuclear localization, we find that D-MEF2 is restricted to a subset of Kenyon cells that project to the /{beta}, and {gamma} axonal lobes of the mushroom bodies, but not to those forming the /{beta} lobes. Our findings that ancestral mef2 is specifically important in dopamine-receptive neurons has broad implications for its function in mammalian neurocircuits.",

Although numerous types of cells, including germ cells and extended pluripotency stem cells, have been generated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in-vitro, generating functional BCs only from PSCs has not yet been reported. Here we describe induced self-organizing 3D BC-like structures (iBCs) generated from mouse PSC culture in-vitro. Resembling natural BCs, iBCs have a blastocoel-like cavity and were formed with outer cells that are positive for trophectoderm lineage markers and with inner cells that are positive for pluripotency markers. iBCs transplanted to pseudopregnant mice uteruses implanted, induced decidualization, and exhibited growth and development before resorption, demonstrating that iBCs are implantation-competent. iBC production required the transcription factor Prdm14 and iBC precursor intermediates concomitantly activate the MERVL totipotency related cleavage stage reporter. Thus, our system may contribute to understanding molecular mechanisms underpinning totipotency, embryogenesis, and implantation.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS-Pluripotent cells self-organize blastocyst-like structures in defined conditions.\\n-Structures have several extraembryonic and embryonic characteristics of blastocysts.\\n-Structures can implant in the uterus and grow before resorption.\\n-Totipotency is implicated concomitantly at loci that originate induced blastocysts.",
