    "abstract": "Many proteins are translocated across biomembranes via protein translocons in targeting to their subcellular destinations. Hitherto, the SecYEG/Sec61 translocon, existing in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, represents the most intensively studied one. According to the current perception, both periplasmic and {beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins ({beta}-barrel OMPs) are translocated via the SecYEG translocon in bacterial cells, although direct living cell evidences remain lacking. Here, mainly via in vivo protein photo-crosslinking analysis, we revealed that the never reported membrane-integrated SecAN protein apparently functions as the translocon for {beta}-barrel OMPs. Additionally, SecAN contains a GXXXG motif known for mediating protein interactions in biomembranes, and processing of {beta}-barrel OMP precursors was severely affected in cells producing an assembly-defective SecAN variant resulted from the GXXXG motif mutations. Furthermore, SecAN was demonstrated to directly interact with the Bam complex, thus likely be a part of the supercomplex that we revealed earlier to be responsible for {beta}-barrel OMP biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Woolly mammoths were among the most abundant cold adapted species during the Pleistocene. Their once large populations went extinct in two waves, an end-Pleistocene extinction of continental populations followed by the mid-Holocene extinction of relict populations on St. Paul Island ~5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island ~4,000 years ago. Wrangel Island mammoths experienced an episode of rapid demographic decline coincident with their isolation, leading to a small population, reduced genetic diversity, and the fixation of putatively deleterious alleles, but the functional consequences of these processes are unclear. Here we show that the Wrangel Island mammoth accumulated many putative deleterious mutations that are predicted to cause diverse behavioral and developmental defects. Resurrection and functional characterization of Wrangel Island mammoth genes carrying these substitutions identified both loss and gain of function mutations in genes associated with developmental defects (HYLS1), oligozoospermia and reduced male fertility (NKD1), diabetes (NEUROG3), and the ability to detect floral scents (OR5A1). These results suggest that Wrangel Island mammoths may have suffered adverse consequences from their reduced population sizes and isolation.",

    "abstract": "Semantic cognition refers to the appropriate use of acquired knowledge about the world. This requires representation of knowledge as well as control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of knowledge are retrieved and selected. Although these abilities can be impaired selectively following brain damage, the relationship between them in healthy individuals is unclear. It is also commonly assumed that semantic cognition is preserved in later life, because older people have greater reserves of knowledge. However, this claim overlooks the possibility of decline in semantic control processes. Here, semantic cognition was assessed in 100 young and older adults. Despite having a broader knowledge base, older people showed specific impairments in semantic control, performing more poorly than young people when selecting among competing semantic representations. Conversely, they showed preserved controlled retrieval of less salient information from the semantic store. Breadth of semantic knowledge was positively correlated with controlled retrieval but was unrelated to semantic selection ability, which was instead correlated with non-semantic executive function. These findings indicate that three distinct elements contribute to semantic cognition: semantic representations that accumulate throughout the lifespan, processes for controlled retrieval of less salient semantic information, which appear age-invariant, and mechanisms for selecting task-relevant aspects of semantic knowledge, which decline with age and may relate more closely to domain-general executive control.",

Using data from simple wrist-worn activity monitors, we developed a tailored machine learning model, using balanced random forests with Hidden Markov Models, to reliably detect a number of activity modes. We show that physical activity and sleep behaviours can be classified with 87% accuracy in 159,504 minutes of recorded free-living behaviours from 132 adults. These trained models can be used to infer fine resolution activity patterns at the population scale in 96,220 participants. For example, we find that men spend more time in both low- and high-intensity behaviours, while women spend more time in mixed behaviours. Walking time is highest in spring and sleep time lowest during the summer.

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets and have high potential for drug discovery. The development of a method for measuring the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface, and changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are used as an index of the receptor activity. Here, we show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing ligand effects on GPCR. We monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrates that changes in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflect the ligand-dependent activity. Then, we reveal that the diffusion of receptor molecules is altered by the common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding or accumulation in clathrin-coated pits, by inhibition experiments and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis. We also confirm the generality of agonist-induced diffusion change in class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that the diffusion coefficient is a good index for estimating the ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of the phylogenetic groups, chemical properties of the ligands, and G protein-coupling selectivity.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: Single-molecule imaging for evaluating ligand effects on GPCRs by monitoring the diffusion dynamics on the cell surface.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary dynamics of social traits depend crucially on the social structure of a population, i.e., who interacts with whom. A large body of work studies the effect of social structure on behaviors such as cooperation, but relatively little is known about how social structure itself coevolves with social traits. Here, I use a simple yet realistic model of within-group social structure to study such coevolution. In this model, social connections are either inherited from a parent or made with random individuals. My model shows cooperation can evolve when individuals make few random connections, but the presence of cooperation selects for increased rates of random connections, which leads to the collapse of cooperation. Inherent costs of social connections can prevent this negative feedback, but the more beneficial cooperation is, the higher linking costs have to be maintain it, and linking costs can negate some or all of the aggregate benefits of cooperation. Exogenously maintained social inheritance can mitigate the latter problem and allow cooperation to persist and increase the average fitness of a population. These results illustrate how coevolutionary dynamics can constrain the long-term persistence of cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of cooperation has been one of the most important problems in sociobiology, and many researchers have revealed mechanisms that can facilitate the evolution of cooperation. However, most studies deal only with one cooperative behaviour, even though some organisms perform two or more cooperative behaviours. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum performs two cooperative behaviours in starvation: fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation. Here, we constructed a model that couples these two behaviours, and we found that the two behaviours are maintained due to the emergence of cyclic dominance, although cooperation cannot evolve if only either of the two behaviours is performed. The common chemoattractant cyclic AMP is used in both fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation, providing a biological context for this coupling. Cyclic dominance emerges regardless of the existence of mating types or spatial structure in the model. In addition, cooperation can re-emerge in the population even after it goes extinct. These results indicate that the two cooperative behaviours of the social amoeba are maintained due to the common chemical signal that underlies both fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation. We demonstrate the importance of coupling multiple games when the underlying behaviours are associated with one another.",

    "abstract": "Localizing human brain functions is a long-standing goal in systems neuroscience. Towards this goal, neuroimaging studies have traditionally used volume-based smoothing, registered data to volume-based standard spaces, and reported results relative to volume-based parcellations. A novel 360-area surface-based cortical parcellation was recently generated using multimodal data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and a volume-based version of this parcellation has frequently been requested for use with traditional volume-based analyses. However, given the major methodological differences between traditional volumetric and HCP-style processing, the utility and interpretability of such an altered parcellation must first be established. By starting from automatically generated individual-subject parcellations and processing them with different methodological approaches, we show that traditional processing steps, especially volume-based smoothing and registration, substantially degrade cortical area localization when compared to surface-based approaches. We also show that surface-based registration using features closely tied to cortical areas, rather than to folding patterns alone, improves the alignment of areas, and that the benefits of high resolution acquisitions are largely unexploited by traditional volume-based methods. Quantitatively, we show that the most common version of the traditional approach has spatial localization that is only 35% as good as the best surface-based method as assessed with two objective measures (peak areal probabilities and  captured area fraction for maximum probability maps). Finally, we demonstrate that substantial challenges exist when attempting to accurately represent volume-based group analysis results on the surface, which has important implications for the interpretability of studies, both past and future, that use these volume-based methods.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMost human brain imaging studies have traditionally used low-resolution images, inaccurate methods of cross-subject alignment, and extensive blurring. Recently, a high-resolution approach with more accurate alignment and minimized blurring was used by the Human Connectome Project to generate a multi-modal map of human cortical areas in hundreds of individuals. Starting from this data, we systematically compared these two approaches, showing that the traditional approach is nearly three times worse than the HCPs improved approach in two objective measures of spatial localization of cortical areas. Further, we demonstrate considerable challenges in comparing data across the two approaches, and, as a result, argue that there is an urgent need for the field to adopt more accurate methods of data acquisition and analysis.",

The mechanisms for making piRNAs have been proposed to differ among cell types, tissues, and animals. Our data instead suggest a single model that explains piRNA production in most animals. piRNAs initiate piRNA production by guiding PIWI proteins to slice precursor transcripts. Next, PIWI proteins direct the stepwise fragmentation of the sliced precursor transcripts, yielding tail-to-head strings of phased pre-piRNAs. Our analyses detect evidence for this piRNA biogenesis strategy across an evolutionarily broad range of animals including humans. Thus, PIWI proteins initiate and sustain piRNA biogenesis by the same mechanism in species whose last common ancestor predates the branching of most animal lineages. The unified model places PIWI-clade Argonautes at the center of piRNA biology and suggests that the ancestral animal--the Urmetazoan--used PIWI proteins both to generate piRNA guides and to execute piRNA function.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, multivariate pattern analyses and especially decoding analyses have become a popular alternative to traditional mass-univariate analyses in neuroimaging research. However, a fundamental limitation of decoding analyses is that the source of information driving the decoder is ambiguous, which becomes problematic when the to-be-decoded variable is confounded by variables that are not of primary interest. In this study, we use a comprehensive set of simulations and analyses of empirical data to evaluate two techniques that were previously proposed and used to control for confounding variables in decoding analyses: counterbalancing and confound regression. For our empirical analyses, we attempt to decode gender from structural MRI data when controlling for the confound  brain size. We show that both methods introduce strong biases in decoding performance: counterbalancing leads to better performance than expected (i.e., positive bias), which we show in our simulations is due to the subsampling process that tends to remove samples that are hard to classify; confound regression, on the other hand, leads to worse performance than expected (i.e., negative bias), even resulting in significant below-chance performance in some scenarios. In our simulations, we show that below-chance accuracy can be predicted by the variance of the distribution of correlations between the features and the target. Importantly, we show that this negative bias disappears in both the empirical analyses and simulations when the confound regression procedure performed in every fold of the cross-validation routine, yielding plausible model performance. From these results, we conclude that foldwise confound regression is the only method that appropriately controls for confounds, which thus can be used to gain more insight into the exact source(s) of information driving ones decoding analysis.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe interpretation of decoding models is ambiguous when dealing with confounds;\\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluate two methods, counterbalancing and confound regression, in their ability to control for confounds;\\nC_LIO_LIWe find that counterbalancing leads to positive bias because it removes hard-to-classify samples;\\nC_LIO_LIWe find that confound regression leads to negative bias, because it yields data with less signal than expected by chance;\\nC_LIO_LIOur simulations demonstrate a tight relationship between model performance in decoding analyses and the sample distribution of the correlation coefficient;\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that the negative bias observed in confound regression can be remedied by cross-validating the confound regression procedure;\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays an important role both in health and disease. The use of antibiotics can alter gut microbiota composition, which can cause complications of various kinds. Here we report a whole genome sequencing metagenomic study of the intestinal microbiota changes caused by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. We have found the decrease in taxonomic alpha-diversity due to the therapy. The changes observed were more extensive for patients with duodenal ulcer and female ones. As well across the patients under the therapy we have detected the shifts in the metabolic potential and resistome. Seven KEGG pathways associated with quorum sensing, genetic Information processing and environmental Information processing were increased, while metabolic pathways related with metabolism of cofactors and vitamins and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism decreased. Changes in the resistome profile have also been identified. We observed perturbations in intraspecies structures, which were higher in group of patients under the therapy than in control group of people without treatment. The Eubacterium rectale pangenome extracted from metagenomic data were changed. We also isolated and sequenced Enterococcus faecium strains from two patients before and after eradication therapy. After the therapy this bacterium increased as the antibiotic resistance in vitro, as well the number of ARGs to macrolides and tetracyclines and metagenomic relative abundance in comparison with strains before therapy. In summary, microbial community demonstrated shift to reduce metabolic potential and to increased mechanisms, which mediate more survival condition through intraspecies perturbations.\\n\\nImportanceThe human gut microbiome plays an important role both in health and disease. The use of antibiotics can alter gut microbiota composition, which can cause complications of various kinds. H. pylori eradication therapy causes multiple shifts and alterations (including intraspecies changes) of the intestinal microbiota structure and leads to the accumulation of genes which determine resistance to macrolides. Since these changes are not the same for patients with various diseases, patients with duodenal ulcer may be further paid special attention for reducing side effects, such as antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Also, study of antibiotic treatment in terms of its impact upon the human gut microbiota allows shedding light on of the complex processes that cause accumulation and spread of antibiotic resistance. An identification and understanding of these complicated processes may help to constrain antibiotic resistance spread, which is of great importance for human health care.",

    "abstract": "Background[11C]RO-963, [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-948 (previously referred as [11C]RO6924963, [11C]RO6931643, and [18F]RO6958948, respectively) have been reported as promising PET tracers for tau imaging based on in vitro and preclinical PET data (1,2). Here we describe the first human evaluation of these novel radiotracers.\\n\\nMethodsAmyloid PET positive Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and young healthy subjects (YC) each received two different tau tracers. Dynamic 90 min scans were obtained after bolus injection of [11C]RO-963, [11C]RO-643 or [18F]RO-948. Arterial blood sampling was performed in 11 healthy controls (HC) and 11 AD. Regions were defined on MRI, and PET data were quantified by plasma reference graphical analysis (for VT) and target cerebellum ratio (SUVR60-90). SUVR images were also analyzed voxelwise. Five older healthy subjects (OC) each received two scans with [18F]RO-948 for evaluation of test-retest variability. Four AD subjects received a repeat [18F]RO-948 scan over about 1 year. Six additional HC (3M: 3F; 41-67y) each received one whole body dosimetry scan with [18F]RO-948.\\n\\nResultsIn YC, peak SUV values were observed in the temporal lobe with values of approximately 3.0 for [11C]RO-963, 1.5 for [11C]RO-643 and 3.5 for [18F]RO-948. Over all brain regions and subjects, the trend was that [18F]RO-948 had the highest peak SUV value, followed by [11C]RO-963, and then [11C]RO-643. Regional analysis of SUVR and VT for [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-948 clearly discriminated AD and HC groups. Compartmental modeling confirmed that [11C]RO-643 had lower brain entry than both [18F]RO-963 and [18F]RO-948, and [18F]RO-948 showed a better contrast between (predicted) areas of high vs low tau accumulation. Thus, our subsequent analysis focused on [18F]RO-948. Both voxelwise and region-based analysis of [18F]RO-948 binding in HC vs AD revealed multiple areas where AD and HC significantly differed. Of 22 high-binding regions, 13 showed significant group difference (following ANOVA, F=45, p<10-5). Voxelwise analysis also revealed a set of symmetrical clusters where AD>HC (threshold of p<0.001, cluster size k>50).\\n\\nConclusions[18F]RO-948 demonstrates superior characteristics to [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-963 for characterization of tau pathology in AD. Regional binding data and kinetic properties of RO-948 compare favorably with existing other tau PET tracers.",

    "abstract": "Root pathogens are a major threat in global crop production and protection strategies are required to sustainably enhance the efficiency of root immunity. Our understanding of root immunity is still limited relative to our knowledge of immune responses in leaves. In an effort to reveal the organisation of immunity in roots, we undertook a cell type-specific transcriptome analysis to identify gene networks activated in epidermis, cortex and pericycle cells of Arabidopsis roots upon treatment with two immunity elicitors, the bacterial microbe-associated molecular pattern flagellin, and the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern Pep1. Our analyses revealed that both elicitors induced immunity gene networks in a cell type-specific manner. Interestingly, both elicitors did not alter cell identity-determining gene networks. Using sophisticated paired motif promoter analyses, we identified key transcription factor pairs involved in the regulation of cell type-specific immunity networks. In addition, our data show that cell identity networks integrate with cell immunity networks to activate cell type-specific immune response according to the functional capabilities of each cell type.\\n\\nMaterial Distribution FootnoteThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Patrick Schafer (p.schafer@warwick.ac.uk).",

    "abstract": "Cocaine addiction is a global health problem that causes substantial damage to the health of addicted individuals around the world. Dopamine synthesizing (DA) neurons in the brain play a vital role in the addiction to cocaine. But the underlying molecular mechanisms that help cocaine exert its addictive effect have not been very well understood. Bioinformatics can be a useful tool in the attempt to broaden our understanding in this area. In the present study, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out on the upregulated genes from a dataset of DA neurons of post-mortem human brain of cocaine addicts. As a result of this analysis, 3 miRNAs have been identified as having significant influence on transcription of the upregulated genes. These 3 miRNAs hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of cocaine addiction.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAlthough the characterization of within species genomic diversity continues to increase, this information is usually not incorporated in the sequencing analysis process. Existing reference genomes can easily be converted to graph-based reference genomes by extending them with known sequence variations. However, the practical use of these graph-based reference genomes depends on the ability to align reads to them. Performing substring queries to paths through these graphs lies at the core of this task. The combination of increasing pattern length and encoded variations inevitably leads to a combinatorial explosion of the search space. We present a solution that uses haplotype information to prevent this from happening.\\n\\nResultsWe present CHOP, a method that uses haplotype information to retrieve the constrained sequence search space of a graph-based reference genome. Our approach enables typical sequence aligners to perform read alignments to graphs that store any type of variation. CHOP performs similarly to another graph alignment method that unnecessarily indexes all combinations of sequence, while aligning reads to a population reference graph of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. CHOP can achieve increased sensitivity for variation detection by iteratively integrating variation into a graph. Finally, we show that CHOP can be applied to large and complex datasets, by applying it on a graph-based representation of chromosome 6 of the human genome encoding the variants reported by the 1000 Genomes project.",

    "abstract": "The haploid genome of the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici is contained on \\\"core\\\" and \\\"accessory\\\" chromosomes. While 13 core chromosomes are found in all strains, as many as eight accessory chromosomes show presence/absence variation and rearrangements among field isolates. We investigated chromosome stability using experimental evolution, karyotyping and genome sequencing. We report extremely high and variable rates of accessory chromosome loss during mitotic propagation in vitro and in planta. Spontaneous chromosome loss was observed in 2 to >50 % of cells during four weeks of incubation. Similar rates of chromosome loss in the closely related Z. ardabiliae suggest that this extreme chromosome dynamic is a conserved phenomenon in the genus. Elevating the incubation temperature greatly increases instability of accessory and even core chromosomes, causing severe rearrangements involving telomere fusion and chromosome breakage. Chromosome losses do not impact the fitness of Z. tritici in vitro, but some lead to increased virulence suggesting an adaptive role of this extraordinary chromosome instability.",

We assessed this combined effect using factorial Mendelian randomization (MR).\\n\\nMethodsWe used multivariable adjusted regression and MR to estimate individual and joint associations of BMI and alcohol consumption and liver disease biomarkers (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) y-glutamyltransferase (GGT)) and incident liver disease. We undertook a factorial MR study splitting participants by median of measured BMI or BMI allele score then by median of reported alcohol consumption or ADH1B genotype (AA/AG and GG), giving four groups; low BMI/low alcohol (-BMI/-alc), low BMI/high alcohol (-BMI/+alc), high BMI/low alcohol (+BMI/-alc) and high BMI/high alcohol (+BMI/+alc).\\n\\nResultsIndividual positive associations of BMI and alcohol with ALT, GGT and incident liver disease were found. In the factorial MR analyses, considering the +BMI/+alc group as the reference, mean circulating ALT and GGT levels were lowest in the -BMI/-alc group (2.32% (95% CI: -4.29, -0.35) and -3.56% (95% CI: -5.88; -1.24) for ALT and GGT respectively). Individuals with -BMI/+alc and +BMI/-alc had lower mean circulating ALT and GGT compared to the reference group (+BMI/+alc). For incident liver disease multivariable factorial analyses followed a similar pattern to those seen for the biomarkers, but little evidence of differences between MR factorial categories for odds of liver disease.\\n\\nConclusionsConsistent results from multivariable regression and MR analysis, provides compelling evidence for the individual adverse effects of BMI and alcohol consumption on liver disease. Intervening on both BMI and alcohol may improve the profiles of circulating liver biomarkers. However, this may not reduce clinical liver disease risk.",

    "abstract": "In spite of much effort, many aspects of chromosome organisation and segregation in bacteria remain unclear. Even for Escherichia coli, the most widely studied bacterial model organism, we still do not know the underlying mechanisms. Like many other bacteria, the chromosomal origin of replication in E. coli is dynamically positioned throughout the cell cycle. Initially maintained at mid-cell, where replication occurs, origins are subsequently partitioned to opposite quarter positions. The Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complex, MukBEF, which is required for correct chromosome compaction and organisation, has been implicated in this behaviour but the mode of action is unknown. Here, we build on a recent self-organising model for the positioning of E. coli MukBEF, to propose an explanation for the positioning and partitioning of origins. We propose that a specific association of MukBEF with the origin region, results in a non-trivial feedback between the self-organising MukBEF gradient and the origins, leading to accurate positioning and partitioning as an emergent property. We compare the model to quantitative experimental data of origin dynamics and their colocalisation with MukBEF clusters and find excellent agreement. Overall, the model suggests that MukBEF and origins act together as a self-organising system for chromosome segregation and introduces protein self-organisation as an important consideration for future studies of chromosome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Clinical genomic tests increasingly utilize a next generation sequencing (NGS) platform due in part to the high fidelity of variant calls, yet rare errors are still possible. In hereditary cancer screening, failure to correct such errors could have serious consequences for patients, who may follow an unwarranted screening or surgical-management path. It has been suggested that routine orthogonal confirmation via Sanger sequencing is required to verify NGS results, especially low-confidence positives with depressed allele fraction (<30% of alternate allele). We evaluated whether an alternative method of confirmation--software-assisted manual call review--performed comparably to Sanger confirmation in >15,000 samples. Licensed reviewers manually inspected both raw and processed data at the batch-, sample-, and variant-level, including raw NGS read pileups. Of ambiguous variant calls with <30% allele fraction (1,707 total calls at 38 unique sites), manual call review classified >99% (1,701) as true positives (enriched for long insertions or deletions (\\\"indels\\\") and homopolymers) or true negatives (often conspicuous NGS artifacts), with the remaining <1% (6) being mosaic. Critically, results from software-assisted manual review and retrospective Sanger sequencing were concordant for samples selected from all ambiguous sites. We conclude that the confirmation required for high confidence in NGS-based germline testing can manifest in different ways: a trained NGS expert operating platform-tailored review software achieves quality comparable to routine Sanger confirmation.",

    "abstract": "Automated data acquisition is now used widely for the single-particle averaging approach to reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) volumes of biological complexes preserved in vitreous ice and imaged in a transmission electron microscope (cryo-EM). Automation has become integral to this method because of the very large number of particle images required to be averaged in order to overcome the typically low signal-to-noise ratio of these images.\\n\\nFor optimal efficiency, all automated data acquisition software packages employ some degree of beam-image shift because this method is fast and accurate (+/- 0.1 m). Relocation to a targeted area under low-dose conditions can only be achieved using stage movements in combination with multiple iterations or long relaxation times, both reducing efficiency. It is, however, well known that applying beam-image shift induces beam-tilt and hence structure phase error. A {pi}/4 phase error is considered as the worst that can be accepted, and is used as an argument against the use of any beam-image shift for high resolution data collection.\\n\\nIn this study, we performed cryo-EM single-particle reconstructions on a T20S proteasome sample using applied beam-image shifts corresponding to beam tilts from 0 to 10 mrad. To evaluate the results we compared the FSC values, and examined the water density peaks in the 3D map. We conclude that the {pi}/4 phase error does not limit the validity of the 3D reconstruction from single-particle averaging beyond the {pi}/4 resolution limit.",

Here, we show that the phenotype of increased extracellular citrate accumulation can have fundamentally different underlying mechanisms, depending on how this response is triggered, and that combining gene expression analyses of the different conditions can lead to the compilation of a shortlist of the most promising citrate exporter candidates. Specifically, we found that varying the amount and type of supplement of an arginine auxotrophic A. niger strain shows down-regulation of citrate metabolising enzymes in the condition in which more citrate is accumulated extracellularly. This contrasts with the transcriptional adaptations triggered by iron limitation, which also induces increased A. niger citrate production. By combining data obtained from these two manners of inducing comparatively high extracellular citrate accumulation, we were able to compile a shortlist of the most likely citrate transporter candidates. Two of the most promising candidates were tested in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of which showed the ability to secrete citrate. Deletion of the endogenous A. niger gene encoding the corresponding transporter abolished the ability of this fungus to secrete citrate. Instead, under conditions that usually favour A. niger citrate production, we found increased accumulation of extracellular oxalate. Our findings provide steps in untangling the complex interplay of different mechanisms underlying A. niger citrate accumulation, and we identify, for the first time, a fungal citrate exporter, offering a valuable tool for improvement of A. niger as biotechnological cell-factory for organic acid production.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCitrate is widely applied as acidifier, flavouring and chelating agent. Industrial citrate production currently relies on the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. Although the industrial production process using A. niger has vastly improved since initiated almost 100 years ago, citrate export remains a bottleneck. Here, we studied the gene expression pattern of A. niger under various citrate producing conditions. Using these expression patterns and different computational approaches, we compiled a shortlist of putative citrate exporter candidates. In this way, we were able to identify a gene encoding a transporter protein capable of citrate export. We show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, normally a citrate non-producer, secretes detectable amounts of citrate when harbouring this gene. In addition, we verify the biological function of this gene in A. niger itself, as removing this gene resulted in a citrate non-producing phenotype, which is atypical for this fungus. This finding is particularly exciting, as it is the first identification of a eukaryotic citrate exporter. With this, we not only provide a tool for improvement of industrial citrate production, but knowledge of this gene should help develop new methods for improvement of A. niger as biotechnological cell-factory for the production of other organic acids.",

    "abstract": "RationaleMammals lose the ability to regenerate their hearts within one week after birth. During this regenerative window, cardiac energy metabolism shifts from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, and recent evidence suggests that metabolism may participate in controlling cardiomyocyte cell cycle. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating the loss of postnatal cardiac regeneration are not fully understood.\\n\\nObjectiveThis study aims at providing an integrated resource of mRNA, protein and metabolite changes in the neonatal heart to identify metabolism-related mechanisms associated with the postnatal loss of regenerative capacity.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsMouse ventricular tissue samples taken on postnatal days 1, 4, 9 and 23 (P01, P04, P09 and P23, respectively) were analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and global proteomics and metabolomics. Differential expression was observed for 8547 mRNAs and for 1199 of the 2285 quantified proteins. Furthermore, 151 metabolites with significant changes were identified. Gene ontology analysis, KEGG pathway analysis and fuzzy c-means clustering were used to identify biological processes and metabolic pathways either up- or downregulated on all three levels. Among these were branched chain amino acid degradation (upregulated at P23) and production of free saturated and monounsaturated medium- to long-chain fatty acids (upregulated at P04 and P09; downregulated at P23). Moreover, the HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS)-mediated mevalonate pathway and ketogenesis were transiently activated. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGCS in primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes reduced the percentage of BrdU+ cardiomyocytes, providing evidence that the mevalonate and ketogenesis routes may participate in regulating cardiomyocyte cell cycle.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first systems-level resource combining data from genome-wide transcriptomics with global quantitative proteomics and untargeted metabolomics analyses of the mouse heart throughout the early postnatal period. This integrated multi-level data of molecular changes associated with the loss of cardiac regeneration may open up new possibilities for the development of regenerative therapies.",

    "abstract": "Central-western Asia has often been underrepresented in population genetic studies, but it is important for the clarification of the peopling of Eurasia and the relationship between its western and eastern extremities. We genotyped individuals from over 40 population groups, mostly central Eurasian, for mitochondrial HVR1, CCR5del32 and five functional MC1R variants (p.Val60Leu, p.Val92Met, p.Arg151Cys, p.Arg160Trp, p.Arg163Gln), and collected published genotype data for comparison. Mitochondrial profiles confirm both the higher heterozygosity in Central Asia than in surrounding areas, and the broadly northern European distribution of CCR5del32. The MC1R variants profile alone is a good determinant of the longitudinal position of a population group, and combined FST values divide Eurasia into seven broad geographic divisions. We can conclude that Central Asia shares genetic features with both eastern and western Eurasia, compatible with both a scenario where the former acted as a source for the latter twos genetic diversity, or one where Central Asia is a  hybrid zone where eastern and western peoples met. Furthermore, the overall high FST values for functional MC1R variants combined with presumed selection pressures on skin pigmentation in low-UV areas lead us to conclude that different variants were selected for in east and west Eurasia, an example of convergent evolution.",

The preferred stimulus orientation of these columns span the full range of orientations, as observed in recordings of spikes, which represent the outputs of cortical neurons. However, when we imaged also the thalamic input to these cells that occur on a larger spatial scale, we found that the orientation domain map of the primary visual cortex did not show the diversity of orientations exhibited by signals representing outputs of the cells. This map was dominated by just the one orientation that is most commonly represented in subcortical responses. This supports cortical feature selectivity and columnar architecture being built upon feed-forward signals transmitted from the thalamus in a very limited number of broadly-tuned input channels.",

    "abstract": "Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in the heart has, until recently, been solely accredited to cardiomyocytes. The inherent complexities of the heart make it difficult to examine nonmuscle contributions to contraction in vivo, and conventional in vitro models fail to capture multiple features and cellular heterogeneity of the myocardium. Here, we report on the development of a 3D cardiac Tissue towards recapitulating the architecture and composition of native myocardium in vitro. Cells are encapsulated within micropatterned gelatin-based hydrogels formed via visible light photocrosslinking. This system enables spatial control of cardiac microarchitecture, perturbation of the cellular composition, and functional measures of EC coupling via video microscopy and a custom algorithm to quantify beat frequency and degree of coordination. To demonstrate the robustness of these tools and evaluate the impact of altered cell population densities on cardiac Tissues, contractility and cell morphology were assessed with the inclusion of exogenous non-myelinating Schwann cells (SCs). Results demonstrate that the addition of exogenous SCs alter cardiomyocyte EC, profoundly inhibiting the response to electrical pacing. Computational modeling of connexin-mediated coupling suggests that SCs impact cardiomyocyte resting potential and rectification following depolarization. Cardiac Tissues hold potential for examining the role of cellular heterogeneity in heart health, pathologies, and cellular therapies.",

Apparently, computational biology is playing a more important role in protein structure prediction than ever. Here, we present a system of de novo predictor, termed NiDelta, building on a deep convolutional neural network and statistical potential enabling molecular dynamics simulation for modeling protein tertiary structure. Combining with evolutionary-based residue-contacts, the presented predictor can predict the tertiary structures of a number of target proteins with remarkable accuracy. The proposed approach is demonstrated by calculations on a set of eighteen large proteins from different fold classes. The results show that the ultra-fast molecular dynamics simulation could dramatically reduce the gap between the sequence and its structure at atom level, and it could also present high efficiency in protein structure determination if sparse experimental data is available.",

One of these is a functional of beliefs about states and policies, but a function of observations, while the second is a functional of beliefs about all three. In the former (expected free energy), prior beliefs about outcomes are not part of the generative model (because they are absorbed into the prior over policies). Conversely, in the second (generalised free energy); priors over outcomes become an explicit component of the generative model. When using the free energy function, which is blind to counterfactual (i.e., future) observations, we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that ensure preferred (i.e., priors over) outcomes are realised. In other words, selected policies minimise uncertainty about future outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future. When using the free energy functional - that effectively treats counterfactual observations as hidden states - we show that policies are inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by minimising the free energy of future expectations. Interestingly, the form of posterior beliefs about policies (and associated belief updating) turns out to be identical under both formulations, but the quantities used to compute them are not.",

Here, using samples of neurosurgically-excised cortex, we confirm the presence of myelinated inhibitory axons in all layers of human neocortex. As in mouse, these axons have distinctive features, including high neurofilament content, short nodes of Ranvier, and high content of myelin basic protein in their myelin sheath. We further show that, consistent with the known high-energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, the inhibitory myelinated axons have more mitochondria, as well more 2,3-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels thought to provide access for trophic support from oligodendrocytes). The distinctive features of myelinated inhibitory axons in human cortical grey matter may have important implications for neurological disorders that involve pathologies of myelinated axons.",

Previous studies have shown different thermotolerance levels according to depth in this species which could correspond to genetic or environmental differences. We designed a sampling scheme with six pairs of  shallow vs deep populations distributed in three geographical regions as replicates. Our results showed significant differentiation among locations and among sites separated by around 20 m depth. The tests of association between genetics and environment allowed the identification of candidate loci under selection but with a potentially high rate of false positive. We discuss the methodological obstacles and biases encountered for the detection of selected loci in such a strongly genetically structured species. On this basis, we also discuss the significance of the candidate loci for local adaptation detected in each geographical region and the evolution of red coral populations along environmental gradients.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/306456_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (110K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d6129org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d604c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d2bef2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f64160_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG A colony of red coral, Corallium rubrum, near Marseille.

    "abstract": "Roads fragment landscapes and can cause the loss of metapopulation dynamics in threatened species, but as relatively new landscape features, few studies have had the statistical power to genetically examine road effects. We used DNA sequence data from thousands of nuclear loci to characterize the population structure of New York-endangered Eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) on Long Island and quantify the impacts of roads on population fragmentation. We uncovered highly genetically structured populations over an extremely small spatial scale (approximately 40 km2) in an increasingly human-modified landscape. Geographic distance and the presence of roads between ponds are both strong predictors of genetic divergence, suggesting that both natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the observed patterns of genetic variation. Our study demonstrates the value of genomic approaches in molecular ecology, as these patterns did not emerge in an earlier study of the same system using microsatellite loci. Ponds supported small effective population sizes, and pond surface area showed a strong positive correlation with salamander population size. When combined with the high degree of structuring in this heavily modified landscape, our study indicates that these endangered amphibians require management at the individual pond, or pond cluster, level. Particular efforts should be made to preserve large vernal pools, which harbor the greatest genetic diversity, and their surrounding upland habitat. Contiguous upland landscapes between ponds that facilitate natural metapopulation connectivity and demographic rescue from future local extirpations should also be protected.",

Here we report high coverage sequencing of the Bengal tiger genome and its mapping to the Amur tiger genome in order to discover single nucleotide to large structural variants. A total of 345 Gb, roughly equivalent to 144X coverage of the genome, was generated from 1,149,381,669 raw read pairs. Further, 990,060,729 clean read pairs, again equivalent to 115X coverage, were retained from the raw read data and considered for comparative analysis with the Amur tiger genome. This alignment showed that 97.35% of the bases mapped at 5X depth, 97.26% at 10X and 90.44% at 50X depth. We identified a total of 3,601,882 single nucleotide variants, 948 structural variants, 56,649 copy number variants and 1,760,347 simple sequence repeats. We report the first high coverage genome sequence of Bengal tiger with an overview of its genomic variants when compared to the Amur tiger genome. Of the several variants identified, we further have to assess and validate variants potentially associated with the ability of the animal to adapt to environmental changes, disease susceptibility and other important biological phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The importance of specific neurons to a networks function is best studied by precisely timed, reversible silencing of these neurons. Previously, we showed that alternating magnetic field mediated heating of magnetic nanoparticles bound to neurons expressing temperature-sensitive cation channels TRPV1, stimulates these neurons to fire and affects animal behavior in vivo (Munshi et al., 2017). Here, we demonstrate how to apply magnetic nanoparticle mediated heating to silence target neurons. Rat hippocampal neuron cultures are transfected to express the temperature gated chloride Anoctamin1 (TMEM16A) channels. Within seconds the heating of the membrane opens the Anoctamin1 (TMEM16A) channels, suppressing action potential firing. Five seconds of magnetic field application leads to about 12 seconds of silencing, with a latency of about 2 seconds and an average suppression ratio of more than 80%. The method provides a promising avenue for tether free, remote, transient neuronal silencing in vivo for both scientific and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhysiological regulators of life history trade-offs need to be responsive to sudden changes of resource availability. When homeostasis is challenged by unpredictable stressors, vertebrates respond through a set of physiological reactions, which can promote organismal survival. Glucocorticoids have been traditionally recognized as one of the main regulators of the physiological stress response, but the role of an evolutionarily more conserved pathway, the hypothalamic-pituitary-somatotropic (HPS) axis producing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has received much less attention. Although IGF-1 is known to affect several life history traits, little is known about its role in the physiological stress response and it has never been studied directly in adult wild animals.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we combined field observations with a controlled experiment to investigate how circulating levels of IGF-1 change in response to stress and whether this change is due to concomitant change in glucocorticoids in a free-living songbird, the bearded reedling Panurus biarmicus. We used a standard capture-restraint protocol in field observation, in which we took first and second (stress induced: 15 minutes later) samples. In a follow-up experiment, we used a minimally invasive oral corticosterone manipulation.\\n\\nResultsWe showed that corticosterone levels significantly increased while IGF-1 levels significantly decreased during capture and handling stress. However, change in corticosterone levels were not related to change in IGF-1 levels. We found that experimentally elevated corticosterone levels did not affect IGF-1 levels.\\n\\nDiscussionOur results are the first to highlight that circulating IGF-1 levels are responsive to stress independently from glucocorticoids and suggest that the HPS axis is an autonomous physiological pathway that may play an important role as regulator of life-history decisions.",

    "abstract": "1Cytoplasmic Dynein, a motor with an unusual architecture made up of a motor domain belonging to the AAA+ family, walks on microtubule towards the minus end. Prompted by the availability of structures in different nucleotide states, we performed simulations based on a new coarse-grained model to illustrate the molecular details of the dynamics of allosteric transitions in the motor. The simulations show that binding of ATP results in the closure of the cleft between the AAA1 and AAA2, which in turn triggers conformational changes in the rest of the motor domain, thus poising dynein in the pre-power stroke state. Interactions with the microtubule, which are modeled implicitly, substantially enhances the rate of ADP release, and formation of the post-power stroke state. The dynamics associated with the key mechanical element, the linker (LN) domain, which changes from a straight to a bent state and vice versa, are highly heterogeneous suggestive of multiple routes in the pre power stroke to post power stroke transition. We show that persistent interactions between the LN and the insert loops in the AAA2 domain prevent the formation of pre-power stroke state when ATP is bound to AAA3, thus locking dynein in a non-functional repressed state. Motility in such a state may be rescued by applying mechanical force to the LN domain. Taken together, these results show how the intricate signaling dynamics within the motor domain facilitate the stepping of dynein.",

Extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) can modulate the CRAC current Icrac via oxidation of ORAI1. We formulate a reaction-diffusion model to quantify the STIM1-ORAI1 interaction during CRAC channel formation and analyze different ORAI1 channel stoichiometries and different ratios of STIM1 and ORAI1 in comparison with experimental data. We incorporate the inhibition of ORAI1 channels by ROS into our model and calculate its contribution to the CRAC channel amplitude. We find that the possibility of reactions between CRAC channel subunits and established CRAC channels tunes the total amount of Ca2+ influx and determines which CRAC channel configuration is mostly preferred. High numbers of ROS-inhibited ORAI1 dimers (in comparison to non-inhibited ORAI1 dimers) are needed to induce a strong decrease of Ca2+ influx compared to the wildetype (WT) case.",

    "abstract": "Previously described methods of analysis allow variants in a gene to be weighted more highly according to rarity and/or predicted function and then for the variant contributions to be summed into a gene-wise risk score which can be compared between cases and controls using a t test. However this does not allow incorporating covariates into the analysis. Schizophrenia is an example of an illness where there is evidence that different kinds of genetic variation can contribute to risk, including common variants contributing to a polygenic risk score (PRS), very rare copy number variants (CNVs) and sequence variants. A logistic regression approach has been implemented to compare the gene-wise risk scores between cases and controls while incorporating as covariates population principal components, the PRS and the presence of pathogenic CNVs and sequence variants. A likelihood ratio test is performed comparing the likelihoods of logistic regression models with and without this score. The method was applied to an ethnically heterogeneous exome-sequenced sample of 6000 controls and 5000 schizophrenia cases. In the raw analysis the test statistic is inflated but inclusion of principal components satisfactorily controls for this. In this dataset the inclusion of the PRS and effect from CNVs and sequence variants had only small effects. The set of genes which are FMRP targets showed some evidence for enrichment of rare, functional variants among cases (p=0.0005). This approach can be applied to any disease in which different kinds of genetic and non-genetic risk factors make contributions to risk.",

In mice, these immunogens elicited monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing up to 31% of a cross-clade panel of 208 HIV-1 strains. Crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures of these antibodies revealed fusion peptide-conformational diversity as a molecular explanation for the cross-clade neutralization. Immunization of guinea pigs and rhesus macaques induced similarly broad fusion peptide-directed neutralizing responses suggesting translatability. The N terminus of the HIV-1-fusion peptide is thus a promising target of vaccine efforts aimed at eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae O1 can cause life threatening diarrheal disease if left untreated. A long lasting immune response, producing 3-5 years of protection from subsequent, symptomatic disease following natural infection, is mediated by B cell mediated humoral immunity. T cells can play critical roles in inducing such immunity. However, the mechanism of T cell dependent B cell maturation and whether a key sub-population of T cells are involved is not well established in cholera. We hypothesized that a specific population of T cells, follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, are involved in B cell maturation following cholera; we used flow cytometry, culture and colorimetric assays to address this question. We found that V. cholerae infection induces significant increase in circulating Tfh cells expressing B cell maturation associated protein CD40L early in disease. The increased Tfh cells expressing CD40L recognize cholera toxin most prominently, with lessened responses to two antigens tested, V. cholerae membrane preparation (MP) and Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC). We further showed that early induction of Tfh cells and CD40L was associated with later memory B cell responses to same antigens. Lastly, we demonstrated in vitro that Tfh cells isolated after cholera can stimulate class switching of cocultured, isolated B cells from patients with cholera, leading to production of the more durable IgG antibody isotype. These studies were conducted on circulating Tfh cells; future studies will be directed at examining role of Tfh cells during cholera directly in the gut mucosa of biopsied samples, at the single cell level if feasible.",

Our model facilitates analysis of several aspects of the rules that govern the multi-level evolutionary biology of antibiotic resistance. We examine a number of selected landscapes where we predict the effects of different rates of patient flow from hospital to the community and viceversa, cross-transmission rates between patients with bacterial propagules of different sizes, the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics, antibiotics and dosing in opening spaces in the microbiota where resistant phenotypes multiply. We can also evaluate the selective strength of some drugs and the influence of the time-0 resistance composition of the species and bacterial clones in the evolution of resistance phenotypes. In summary, we provide case studies analyzing the hierarchical dynamics of antibiotic resistance using a novel computing model with reciprocity within and between levels of biological organization, a type of approach that may be expanded in the multi-level analysis of complex microbial landscapes.",

Metabolomics is a powerful tool that can be used to screen for potential biomarkers, exogenous toxicants, and metabolic network changes associated with disease states. Here, we used high-resolution metabolomics to compare over 10,000 plasma metabolic features from older adults with and without PD in an untargeted approach. We performed a network analysis that demonstrates that the presence of the PD drug levodopa influences variation observed between PD and control patients. Metabolome wide association studies and discrimination analysis identified significant differentiation in the metabolomics profile of older adults with and without PD. Notably, 15 metabolic features (ten of which we putatively identified) differed between PD and control adults with p < 0.05 and a corrected false discovery rate less than 20%. Furthermore, 13 metabolic networks were identified to be functionally different between PD and non-PD patients. Lastly, the dopaminergic toxic intermediate DOPAL differed between PD and non-PD populations, which supports the dopaminergic sequestration model of PD. These individual metabolites and metabolic networks have been implicated in past PD pathogenesis models, including the beta-carboline harmalol and the glycosphingolipid metabolism pathway including the ganglioside GM2. We recommend that future studies take into account the confounding effects of levodopa in metabolomic analyses of disease versus control patients, and encourage validation of several promising metabolic markers of PD.",

    "abstract": "In daily life, working memory plays an important role in action planning and decision-making. However, both the informational content of memory and how that information is used in decisions is poorly understood. To investigate this, we conducted a memory experiment where people not only reported an estimate of a remembered stimulus, but also made a rewarded decision designed to reflect memory uncertainty. Reported memory uncertainty is correlated with estimation error, showing people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory quality into rewarded decisions. Moreover, memory uncertainty can be combined with other sources of information; after we induced prior beliefs about stimuli probabilities, we found that estimates shifted towards more frequent colors, with the shift increasing with reported uncertainty. The data is best predicted by models where people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory uncertainty with potential rewards and prior beliefs, highlighting the importance of studying working memory as a process integrated with decision-making.",

It address the binary segmentation problem, where every pixel in an image is labeled as an angiodysplasia lesions or background. Then, we analyze connected component of each predicted mask. Based on the analysis we developed a classifier that predict angiodysplasia lesions (binary variable) and a detector for their localization (center of a component). In this setting, our approach outperforms other methods in every task subcategory for angiodysplasia detection and localization thereby providing state-of-the-art results for these problems.

Null transduction. Hyperoxia was associated with diffuse apoptosis that was inhibited only in patchy areas of endothelial proliferation under VEGF transduction. Hyperoxia-induced alveolar inflammation was similar with Ad.Null and Ad.VEGF. Under normoxia, the high dose of VEGF transduction induced diffuse alveolar inflammation whereas the low dose did not suggesting a pro-inflammatory effect of VEGF that may have participated to increased survival under hyperoxia.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that lung VEGF-A transduction despite inhibition of the loss of capillary bed has a marginal effect of on animal survival during hyperoxia-induced injury.",

Fetal exposure to currently utilized agents is poorly described. We directly assessed fetal exposure by screening meconium from 23 newborns whose mothers had undergone treatment for cancer during pregnancy.\\n\\nStudy DesignMeconium was collected from newborns whose mothers were diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy and underwent chemotherapy in the second or third trimester as part of the Cancer and Pregnancy Registry. We conducted screening of 23 meconium samples for chemotherapeutics and known metabolites of chemotherapeutics by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Putative identification of paclitaxel and/or its metabolites was made in 8 screened samples. In positively screened samples, we quantified paclitaxel, 3-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 6-hydroxypaclitaxel by stable isotope dilution-LC-HRMS.\\n\\nResultsMean levels of paclitaxel were 399.9 pg/mg in meconium samples from newborn born to mothers that underwent chemotherapy during pregnancy. 3-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6-hydroxypaclitaxel mean levels were 105.2 and 113.4 pg/mg meconium, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionIntact paclitaxel, and at least two of its major metabolites were detected in meconium, providing unambiguous confirmation of human fetal exposure. Variability in meconium levels between individuals may indicate a potential for reducing fetal exposure based on timing, dosing, and individual characteristics. This preliminary study may provide an efficient approach for examining the effects of cancer diagnosis during pregnancy on other outcomes by providing a measure of direct fetal exposure.",

    "abstract": "Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) is the master transcriptional regulator of molecular chaperones and binds to the same cis-acting element - Heat Shock Element (HSE) - across the eukaryotic lineage. In budding yeast, Hsf1 drives transcription of ~20 genes essential to maintain proteostasis under basal conditions, yet its specific targets and extent of inducible binding during heat shock remain unclear. Here we combine Hsf1 ChIP-seq, nascent RNA-seq and Hsf1 nuclear depletion to quantify Hsf1 binding and transcription across the yeast genome. Hsf1 binds 74 loci during acute heat shock, 46 of which are linked to genes with strong Hsf1-dependent transcription. Most of these targets show detectable Hsf1 binding under basal conditions, but basal occupancy and heat shock-inducible binding both vary over two orders of magnitude. Notably, Hsf1s induced DNA binding leads to a disproportionate (up to 50-fold) increase in nascent transcription. While variation in basal Hsf1 occupancy poorly correlates with the strength of the HSE, promoters with high basal Hsf1 occupancy have nucleosome-depleted regions due to the presence of  pioneer factors. Such accessible chromatin may be critical for Hsf1 occupancy of its genomic sites as the activator is incapable of binding HSEs embedded within a stable nucleosome in vitro. In response to heat shock, however, Hsf1 is able to gain access to nucleosomal sites and promotes chromatin remodeling with the RSC complex playing a key role. We propose that the interplay between nucleosome occupancy, HSE strength and active Hsf1 levels allows cells to precisely tune expression of the proteostasis network.",

Using computational modeling and MRBLE-pep, we systematically probe binding of calcineurin (CN), a conserved protein phosphatase essential for the immune response and target of immunosuppressants, to the PxIxIT SLiM. We establish that flanking residues and post- translational modifications critically contribute to PxIxIT-CN affinity, and discover CN-inhibitory peptides with unprecedented affinity and therapeutic potential.

    "abstract": "The adherens junctions between epithelial cells involve a protein complex formed by E-cadherin, {beta}-catenin, -catenin and F-actin. The stability of this complex was a puzzle for many years, since in vitro studies could reconstitute various stable subsets of the individual proteins, but never the entirety. The missing ingredient turned out to be mechanical tension: a recent experiment that applied physiological forces to the complex with an optical tweezer dramatically increased its lifetime, a phenomenon known as catch bonding. However, in the absence of a crystal structure for the full complex, the microscopic details of the catch bond mechanism remain mysterious. Building on structural clues that point to -catenin as the force transducer, we present a quantitative theoretical model for how the catch bond arises, fully accounting for the experimental lifetime distributions. The model allows us to predict the energetic changes induced by tension at the interface between -catenin and F-actin. It also identifies a significant energy barrier due to a network of salt bridges between two conformational states of {beta}-catenin. By stabilizing one of these states, this barrier could play a role in how the complex responds to additional in vivo binding partners like vinculin. Since significant conformational energy barriers are a common feature of other adhesion systems that exhibit catch bonds, our model can be adapted into a general theoretical framework for integrating structure and function in a variety of force-regulated protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins is a key step in many signaling cascades. However, a complete mechanism for this process, which requires allosteric communication between binding sites that are ~30 [A] apart, remains elusive. We construct an atomically-detailed model of G protein activation by combining three powerful computational methods; metadynamics, Markov state models (MSMs), and CARDS analysis of correlated motions. We uncover a mechanism that is consistent with a wide variety of structural and biochemical data. Surprisingly, the rate-limiting step for GDP release correlates with tilting rather than translation of the GPCR-binding helix 5. {beta}-Strands 1-3 and helix 1 emerge as hubs in the allosteric network that links conformational changes in the GPCR-binding site to disordering of the distal nucleotide-binding site and consequent GDP release. Our approach and insights provide foundations for understanding disease-implicated G protein mutants, illuminating slow events in allosteric networks, and examining unbinding processes with slow off-rates.",

    "abstract": "Activating BRAF mutations drive melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis by constitutively activating MEK and ERK, and small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of BRAF or MEK have shown promise as melanoma therapeutics. However, the development of resistance to these inhibitors in both the short- and longterm is common; warranting investigation into how these SMIs influence ERK signaling dynamics. By quantitative single cell imaging of an ERK activity reporter in living cells, we describe both intra- and inter-cell heterogeneity in ERK activity in isogenic melanoma populations harboring a BRAFV600E mutation. This heterogeneity is largely due to a cell-cycle dependent bifurcation in ERK activation. Moreover, we show there are cell-cycle dependent responses in ERK activity following BRAF or MEK inhibition. Prior to, but not following, CDK4/6-mediated passage through the Restriction Point (RP) ERK activity is sensitive to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In contrast, in cells that have passed the RP, ERK activity will remain elevated even in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibition until mitosis. We propose that ERK activity in the presence of activating BRAF mutations is regulated by both positive and negative feedback loops that are engaged in cell-cycle dependent fashions. CDK4/6 inhibition sensitizes ERK activity to BRAF or MEK inhibition by preventing passage the transition from a BRAF/MEK dependent to independent state. Our results have implications for the use of MEK and BRAF inhibitors as melanoma therapeutics, and offer a rational basis for the use of these inhibitors in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition during cancer therapy.",

The relative physical contribution of cells and ECM to morphogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we dissected the mechanics of the envelope of the Drosophila developing leg, an epithelium submitted to a number of mechanical stresses: first stretched, it is then torn apart and withdrawn to free the leg. During stretching, we found that mechanical tension is entirely borne by the ECM at first, then by the cellular monolayer as soon as they detach themselves from one another. Then, each envelope layer is removed by an independent mechanism: while ECM withdraws following local proteolysis, cellular monolayer withdrawal is independent of ECM degradation and driven by an autonomous myosin-II-dependent contraction. These results reveal a physical and functional cell-matrix uncoupling that could timely control tissue dynamics during development.",

The absence of luminal A cell lines means the extensive amount of in vitro work studying the response to hormones in ER+ breast cancers is biased for the luminal B subtype. We have developed a luminal A like cell model by increasing the ER expression in the MCF-7 cell line. Our results show that increased ER expression promotes an anti-proliferative response to estrogen through regulation of genes involved in the G1/S-phase transition of the cell cycle. Furthermore, increased ER expression increases ER-DNA binding in the absence of estrogen and regulates basal gene transcription by promoting DNA looping. These results provide novel evidence that the characteristic increased ER expression of luminal A tumors may promote a novel chromatin configuration that enables growth of these tumors in the absence of estrogen and enables gene repression in the presence of hormones.",

    "abstract": "During transcription, RNA polymerase (RNAP) supercoils DNA as it forsward-translocates. Accumulation of this torsional stress in DNA can become a roadblock for an elongating RNAP and thus should be subject to regulation during transcription. Here, we investigate whether, and how, a transcription factor may regulate the torque generation capacity of RNAP and torque-induced RNAP stalling. Using a real-time assay based on an angular optical trap, we found that under a resisting torque, RNAP was highly prone to extensive backtracking. However, the presence of GreB, a transcription factor that facilitates the cleavage of the 3 end of the extruded RNA transcript, greatly suppressed backtracking and remarkably increased the torque that RNAP was able to generate by 65%, from 11.2 to 18.5 pN{middle dot}nm. Analysis of the real-time trajectories of RNAP position at a stall revealed the kinetic parameters of backtracking and GreB rescue. These results demonstrate that backtracking is the primary mechanism that limits transcription against DNA supercoiling and the transcription factor GreB effectively enhances the torsional capacity of RNAP. These findings broaden the potential impact of transcription factors on RNAP functionality.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and recurrence, and may also represent a subset of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In our prior study, CTCs in advanced prostate cancer patients were found to express CD117/c-kit in a liquid biopsy. Whether CD117 expression played an active or passive role in the aggressiveness and migration of these CTCs remained an open question. In this study, we show that CD117 expression in prostate cancer patients is associated with decreased overall and progression-free survival and that activation and phosphorylation of CD117 increases in prostate cancer patients with higher Gleason grades. To determine how CD117 expression and activation by its ligand stem cell factor (SCF, kit ligand, steel factor) alter prostate cancer aggressiveness, we used LNCaP-C4-2 and PC3-mm human prostate cancer cells, which contain a CD117+ subpopulation. We demonstrate that CD117+ cells display increased proliferation and migration. In prostaspheres, CD117 expression enhances sphere formation. In both 2D and 3D cultures, stemness marker gene expression is higher in CD117+ cells. Using xenograft limiting dilution assays and serial tumor initiation assays, we show that CD117+ cells represent a CSC population. Combined, these data indicate that CD117 expression potentially promotes tumor initiation and metastasis. Further, in cell lines, CD117 activation by SCF promotes faster proliferation and invasiveness, while blocking CD117 activation with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) decreased progression in a context-dependent manner. We demonstrate that CD117 expression and activation drives prostate cancer aggressiveness through the CSC phenotype and TKI resistance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfections with helminths cause an enormous disease burden in billions of animals and plants worldwide. Large scale use of anthelmintics has driven the evolution of resistance in a number of species that infect livestock and companion animals, and there are growing concerns regarding the reduced efficacy in some human-infective helminths. Understanding the mechanisms by which resistance evolves is the focus of increasing interest; robust genetic analysis of helminths is challenging, and although many candidate genes have been proposed, the genetic basis of resistance remains poorly resolved.\n\nResultsHere, we present a genome-wide analysis of two genetic crosses between ivermectin resistant and sensitive isolates of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, an economically important gastrointestinal parasite of small ruminants and a model for anthelmintic research. Whole genome sequencing of parental populations, and key stages throughout the crosses, identified extensive genomic diversity that differentiates populations, but after backcrossing and selection, a single genomic quantitative trait locus (QTL) localised on chromosome V was revealed to be associated with ivermectin resistance. This QTL was common between the two geographically and genetically divergent resistant populations and did not include any leading candidate genes, suggestive of a previously uncharacterised mechanism and/or driver of resistance. Despite limited resolution due to low recombination in this region, population genetic analyses and novel evolutionary models supported strong selection at this Q.TL, driven by at least partial dominance of the resistant allele, and that large resistance-associated haplotype blocks were enriched in response to selection.\n\nConclusionsWe have described the genetic architecture and mode of ivermectin selection, revealing a major genomic locus associated with ivermectin resistance, the most conclusive evidence to date in any parasitic nematode. This study highlights a novel genome-wide approach to the analysis of a genetic cross in non-model organisms with extreme genetic diversity, and the importance of a high quality reference genome in interpreting the signals of selection so identified.",

    "abstract": "Mutualisms may be \\\"key innovations\\\" that spur diversification in one partner lineage, but no study has evaluated whether mutualism accelerates diversification in both interacting lineages. Recent research suggests that plants that attract ant mutualists for defense or seed dispersal have higher diversification rates than non-ant associated plant lineages. We ask whether the reciprocal is true: does the ecological interaction between ants and plants also accelerate diversification in ants? In other words, do ants and plants cooperate-and-radiate? We used a novel text-mining approach to determine which ant species associate with plants in defensive or seed dispersal mutualisms. We investigated patterns of trait evolution and lineage diversification using phylogenetic comparative methods on a large, recent species-level ant phylogeny. We found that ants that associate mutualistically with plants have elevated diversification rates compared to non-mutualistic ants, suggesting that ants and plants cooperate-and-radiate.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic development yields many different cell types in response to just a few families of inductive signals. The property of a signal-receiving cell that determines how it responds to such signals, including the activation of cell type-specific genes, is known as its competence. Here, we show how maternal factors modify chromatin to specify initial competence in the frog Xenopus tropicalis. We identified the earliest engaged regulatory DNA sequences, and inferred from them critical activators of the zygotic genome. Of these, we showed that the pioneering activity of the maternal pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and Sox3 predefines competence for germ layer formation by extensively remodeling compacted chromatin before the onset of signaling. The remodeling includes the opening and marking of thousands of regulatory elements, extensive chromatin looping, and the co-recruitment of signal-mediating transcription factors. Our work identifies significant developmental principles that inform our understanding of how pluripotent stem cells interpret inductive signals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReinforcement learning models provide excellent descriptions of learning in multiple species across a variety of tasks. Many researchers are interested in relating parameters of reinforcement learning models to neural measures, psychological variables or experimental manipulations. We demonstrate that parameter identification is difficult because a range of parameter values provide approximately equal quality fits to data. This identification problem has a large impact on power: we show that a researcher who wants to detect a medium sized correlation (r = .3) with 80% power between a variable and learning rate must collect 60% more subjects than specified by a typical power analysis in order to account for the noise introduced by model fitting.\\n\\nNew MethodWe derive a Bayesian optimal model fitting technique that takes advantage of information contained in choices and reaction times to constrain parameter estimates.\\n\\nResultsWe show using simulation and empirical data that this method substantially improves the ability to recover learning rates.\\n\\nComparison with Existing MethodsWe compare this method against the use of Bayesian priors. We show in simulations that the combined use of Bayesian priors and reaction times confers the highest parameter identifiability. However, in real data where the priors may have been misspecified, the use of Bayesian priors interferes with the ability of reaction time data to improve parameter identifiability.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a simple technique that takes advantage of readily available data to substantially improve the quality of inferences that can be drawn from parameters of reinforcement learning models.\\n\\nHighlights- Parameters of reinforcement learning models are particularly difficult to estimate\\n- Incorporating reaction times into model fitting improves parameter identifiability\\n- Bayesian weighting of choice and reaction times improves the power of analyses assessing learning rate",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar learning is canonically thought to rely on synaptic plasticity, particularly at synaptic inputs to Purkinje cells. Recently, however, other complementary mechanisms have been identified. Intrinsic plasticity is one such mechanism, and depends in part on the down-regulation of calcium-dependent SK-type K channels, which is associated with an increase in neuronal excitability. In the hippocampus, SK-mediated intrinsic plasticity has been shown to play a role in trace eyeblink conditioning; however, it is not yet known how intrinsic plasticity contributes to a cerebellar learning task such as delay eyeblink conditioning. Whole cell recordings were obtained from acute cerebellar slices from mice ~48 hours after learning a delay eyeblink conditioning task. Over a period of repeated training sessions mice received either distinctly paired trials of a tone co-terminating with a periorbital shock (conditioned mice) or trials in which these stimuli were presented in an unpaired manner (pseudoconditioned mice). Conditioned mice show a significantly reduced afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following trains of parallel fiber stimuli. Moreover, we find that SK-dependent intrinsic plasticity is occluded in conditioned, but not pseudoconditioned mice. These findings show that excitability is enhanced in Purkinje cells after delay eyeblink conditioning and point toward a downregulation of SK channels as a potential underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of fundamental biological processes play an important role in consolidating theory and experiments, especially if they are systematically developed, thoroughly characterized, and well tested by experimental data. In this work, we report a detailed bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock network developed by Relogio et al. [16], noteworthy for its consistency with available data. Using one- and two-parameter bifurcation diagrams, we explore how oscillations in the model depend on the expression levels of its constituent genes and the activities of their encoded proteins. These bifurcation diagrams allow us to decipher the dynamics of interlocked feedback loops, by parametric variation of genes and proteins in the model. Among other results, we find that REV-ERB, a member of a subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors, plays a critical role in the intertwined dynamics of Relogios model. The bifurcation diagrams reported here can be used for predicting how the core-clock network responds--in terms of period, amplitude and phases of oscillations--to different perturbations.",

    "abstract": "This technical report presents the Automatic Temporal Registration Algorithm (ATRA) for symmetric rigid-body affine registration of longitudinal T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the human brain. This is a fundamental processing step in computational neuroimaging. The notion of leave-one-out consistent (LOOC) landmarks with respect to a supervised landmark detection algorithm is introduced. An automatic algorithm is presented for identification of LOOC landmarks on MRI scans. Using this technique, multiple sets of LOOC landmarks (around 150) are identified on each of the volumes being registered. Then, a Generalized Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis of the identified landmarks is used to find a rigid-body transformation of each volume into a common space where the transformed volumes are precisely aligned. In addition, a new approach is introduced for quantitative assessment of registration accuracy in the absence of a gold standard. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of ATRA registration accuracy are performed using 2012 volumes from 503 subjects (4 longitudinal volumes/subject) from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, and on a further 120 volumes acquired from 3 normal subjects (40 longitudinal volumes/subject). The algorithm is symmetric, in the sense that any permutation of the input volumes does not change the resulting transformation matrices, and unbiased, in the sense that all volumes undergo one and only one interpolation operation, which precisely aligns them in a common space. There is no interpolation bias and no reference volume. All volumes are treated exactly the same. The algorithm is fast and highly accurate. The software is publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-stratified variance of a quantitative trait could differ in the presence of gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Genetic markers associated with phenotypic variance are thus considered promising candidates for follow-up interaction or joint location-scale analyses. However, as in studies of main effects, the X-chromosome is routinely excluded from  whole-genome scans due to analytical challenges. Specifically, as males carry only one copy of the X-chromosome, the inherent sex-genotype dependency could bias the trait-genotype association, through sexual dimorphism in quantitative traits with sex-specific means or variances. Here we investigate phenotypic variance heterogeneity associated with X-chromosome SNPs and propose valid and powerful strategies. Among those, a generalized Levenes test has adequate power and remains robust to sexual dimorphism. An alternative approach is sex-stratified analysis but at the cost of slightly reduced power and modeling flexibility. We applied both methods to an Estonian study of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL; n=841), and two complex trait studies of height, hip and waist circumferences, and body mass index from multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA; n=2,073) and UK Biobank (UKB; n=327,393). Consistent with previous eQTL findings on mean, we found some but no conclusive evidence for cis regulators being enriched for variance association. SNP rs2681646 is associated with variance of waist circumference (p=9.5E-07) at X-chromosome-wide significance in UKB, with a suggestive female-specific effect in MESA (p=0.048). Collectively, an enrichment analysis using permutated UKB (p<1/10) and MESA (p<1/100) datasets, suggests a possible polygenic structure for the variance of human height.",

    "abstract": "Cell-to-cell variability is central for microbial populations and contributes to cell function, stress adaptation and drug resistance. Gene-expression heterogeneity underpins this variability, but has been challenging to study genome-wide. Here, we report an integrated approach for imaging of individual fission yeast cells followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and novel Bayesian normalisation. We analyse >2000 single cells and >700 matching RNA controls in various environmental conditions and identify sets of highly variable genes. Combining scRNA-seq with cell-size measurements provides unique insights into genes regulated during cell growth and division in single cells, including genes whose expression does not scale with cell size. We further analyse the heterogeneity and dynamics of gene expression during adaptive and acute responses to changing environments. Entry into stationary phase is preceded by a gradual, synchronised adaptation in gene regulation, followed by highly variable gene expression when growth decreases. Conversely, a sudden and acute heat-shock leads to a stronger and coordinated response and adaptation across cells. This analysis reveals that the extent and dynamics of global gene-expression heterogeneity is regulated in response to different physiological conditions within populations of a unicellular eukaryote. In summary, this works illustrates the potential of combined transcriptomics and imaging analysis in single cells to provide comprehensive and unbiased mechanistic understanding of cell-to-cell variability in microbial communities.",

Aloe vera GMMT expression is also induced by exogenous application of the plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in non-water-stressed plants.\\n\\nSummaryIn Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera), a xerophytic crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant, the main polysaccharide of the gel present in the leaves is an acetylated glucomannan named acemannan. This polysaccharide is responsible for the plant succulence, helping it to retain water. In this study we determined using polysaccharide analysis by carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE) that the acemannan is a glucomannan without galactose side branches. We also investigated the expression of the gene responsible for acemannan backbone synthesis, encoding a glucomannan mannosyltransferase (GMMT). It was found by in silico analyses that the GMMT gene belongs to the cellulose synthase like A type-9 (CSLA9) subfamily. Using RT-qPCR it was found that the expression of GMMT increased in Aloe vera plants subjected to water stress. This expression correlates with an increase of endogenous ABA levels, suggesting that the gene expression could be regulated by ABA. To corroborate this hypothesis, exogenous ABA was applied to non-water-stressed plants, increasing the expression of GMMT significantly 48 h after ABA treatment.",
