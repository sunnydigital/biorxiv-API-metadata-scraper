    "abstract": "From foraging for food to learning complex games, many aspects of human behaviour can be framed as a search problem with a vast space of possible actions. Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using a variety of bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, where the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across a variety of diifferent probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian Process function learning--combined with an optimistic Upper Confidence Bound sampling strategy--provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable, and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent staining is a common tool for both quantitative and qualitative assessment of pro- and eukaryotic cells sub-population fractions by using microscopy and flow cytometry. However, direct cell counting by flow cytometry is often limited, for example when working with cells rigidly adhered either to each other or to external surfaces like bacterial biofilms or adherent cell lines and tissue samples. An alternative approach is provided by using fluorescent microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which enables the evaluation of fractions of cells subpopulations in a given sample. For the quantitative assessment of cell fractions in microphotographs, we suggest a simple two-step algorithm that combines single cells selection and the statistical analysis. To facilitate the first step, we suggest a simple procedure that supports finding the balance between the detection threshold and the typical size of single cells based on objective cell size distribution analysis. Based on a series of experimental measurements performed on bacterial and eukaryotic cells under various conditions, we show explicitly that the suggested approach effectively accounts for the fractions of different cell sub-populations (like the live/dead staining in our samples) in all studied cases that are in good agreement with manual cell counting on microphotographs and flow cytometry data. This algorithm is implemented as a simple software tool that includes an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for the initial adjustment of algorithm parameters to the microphotographs analysis as well as for the sequential analysis of homogeneous series of similar microscopic images without further user intervention.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndividuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) suffer from a constellation of rapidly shifting emotional, interpersonal, and behavioral symptoms. The menstrual cycle may contribute to symptom instability among females with this disorder.\\n\\nMethodsFifteen healthy, unmedicated females with BPD and without dysmenorrhea reported daily symptoms across 35 days. Urine luteinizing hormone (LH) and salivary progesterone (P4) were used to confirm ovulation and cycle phase. Cyclical worsening of symptoms was evaluated using (1) phase contrasts in multilevel models and (2) the Carolina Premenstrual Assessment Scoring System (C-PASS; Eisenlohr-Moul et al., 2017b), a protocol for evaluating clinically significant cycle effects on symptoms.\\n\\nResultsMost symptoms demonstrated midluteal worsening, a perimenstrual peak, and resolution of symptoms in the follicular or ovulatory phase. Post-hoc correlations with person-centered progesterone revealed negative correlations with most symptoms. Depressive symptoms showed an unexpected delayed pattern in which baseline levels of symptoms were observed in the ovulatory and midluteal phases, and exacerbations were observed during both the perimenstrual and follicular phases. The majority of participants met C-PASS criteria for clinically significant (>=30%) symptom exacerbation. All participants met the emotional instability criterion of BPD, and no participant met DSM-5 criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\\n\\nConclusionsFemales with BPD may be at elevated risk for perimenstrual worsening of emotional symptoms. Longitudinal studies with fine-grained hormonal measurement as well as hormonal experiments are needed to determine the pathophysiology of perimenstrual exacerbation in BPD.",

    "abstract": "Cell deformation is regulated by complex underlying biological mechanisms associated with spatial and temporal morphological changes in the nucleus that are related to cell differentiation, development, proliferation, and disease. Thus, quantitative analysis of changes in size and shape of nuclear structures in 3D microscopic images is important not only for investigating nuclear organization, but also for detecting and treating pathological conditions such as cancer. While many efforts have been made to develop cell and nuclear shape characteristics in 2D or pseudo-3D, several studies have suggested that 3D morphometric measures provide better results for nuclear shape description and discrimination. A few methods have been proposed to classify cell and nuclear morphological phenotypes in 3D, however, there is a lack of publicly available 3D data for the evaluation and comparison of such algorithms. This limitation becomes of great importance when the ability to evaluate different approaches on benchmark data is needed for better dissemination of the current state of the art methods for bioimage analysis. To address this problem, we present a dataset containing two different cell collections, including original 3D microscopic images of cell nuclei and nucleoli. In addition, we perform a baseline evaluation of a number of popular classification algorithms using 2D and 3D voxel-based morphometric measures. To account for batch effects, while enabling calculations of AUROC and AUPR performance metrics, we propose a specific cross-validation scheme that we compare with commonly used k-fold cross-validation.

    "abstract": "Chromatin organization is highly dynamic and regulates transcription. Upon transcriptional activation, chromatin is remodeled and referred to as \\\"open\\\", but quantitative and dynamic data of this decompaction process are lacking. Here, we have developed a quantitative high-resolution microscopy assay in living yeast cells to visualize and quantify chromatin dynamics using the GAL7-10-1 locus as a model system. Upon transcriptional activation of these three clustered genes, we detect an increase of the mean distance across this locus by >100 nm. This decompaction is linked to active transcription but is not sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A or to deletion of the histone acetyl transferase Gcn5. By contrast, the deletion of SNF2 (encoding the ATPase of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) or the deactivation of the histone chaperone complex FACT lead to a strongly reduced decompaction without significant effects on transcriptional induction. Our findings are consistent with nucleosome remodeling and eviction activities being major contributors to chromatin reorganization during transcription but also suggest that transcription can occur in the absence of detectable decompaction.",

    "abstract": "Time series data provide a crucial window into infectious disease dynamics, yet their utility is often limited by the spatially aggregated form in which they are presented. When working with time series data, violating the implicit assumption of homogeneous dynamics below the scale of spatial aggregation could bias inferences about underlying processes. We tested this assumption in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia, where time series of weekly case reports were available at national, departmental, and municipal scales. First, we performed a descriptive analysis, which showed that the timing of departmental-level epidemic peaks varied by three months and that departmental-level estimates of the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), showed patterns that were distinct from a national-level estimate. Second, we applied a classification algorithm to six features of proportional cumulative incidence curves, which showed that variability in epidemic duration, the length of the epidemic tail, and consistency with a cumulative normal density curve made the greatest contributions to distinguishing groups. Third, we applied this classification algorithm to data simulated with a stochastic transmission model, which showed that group assignments were consistent with simulated differences in the basic reproduction number, R0. This result, along with associations between spatial drivers of transmission and group assignments based on observed data, suggests that the classification algorithm is capable of detecting differences in temporal patterns that are associated with differences in underlying drivers of incidence patterns. Overall, this diversity of temporal patterns at local scales underscores the value of spatially disaggregated time series data.",

We integrated abundance data with information on geographic range, habitat preference, taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, and IUCN Red List Categories and threats. We found that 15% of populations declined, 18% increased, and 67% showed no net changes over time. Against a backdrop of no biogeographic and phylogenetic patterning in population change, we uncovered a distinct taxonomic signal. Amphibians were the only taxa that experienced net declines in the analysed data, while birds, mammals and reptiles experienced net increases. Population trends were poorly captured by species rarity and global-scale threats. Incorporation of the full spectrum of population change will improve conservation efforts to protect global biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Dyslexia is associated with abnormal performance on many auditory psychophysics tasks, particularly those involving the categorization of speech sounds. However, it is debated whether those apparent auditory deficits arise from (a) reduced sensitivity to particular acoustic cues, (b) the difficulty of experimental tasks, or (c) unmodeled lapses of attention. Here we investigate the relationship between phoneme categorization and reading ability, with special attention to the nature of the cue encoding the phoneme contrast (static versus dynamic), differences in task paradigm difficulty, and methodological details of psychometric model fitting. We find a robust relationship between reading ability and categorization performance, show that task difficulty cannot fully explain that relationship, and provide evidence that the deficit is not restricted to dynamic cue contrasts, contrary to prior reports. Finally, we demonstrate that improved modeling of behavioral responses suggests that the gap between dyslexics and typical readers may be smaller than previously reported.",

    "abstract": "Cancer metastasis accounts for the majority of deaths by cancer. Detection of cancer metastasis at its early stage is important for the management and prediction of cancer progression. Urine, which is not regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, reflects systemic changes in the whole body and can potentially be used for the early detection of cancer metastasis. In this study, a lung metastasis of a Walker-256 rat model was established by tail-vein injection of Walker-256 cells. Urine samples were collected at days 2, 4, 6 and 9 after injection, and the urinary proteomes were profiled using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The urinary protein patterns changed significantly with the development of Walker-256 lung metastasis. On the fourth day, lung metastasis nodules appeared. On the sixth day, clinical symptoms started. On days 2, 4, 6 and 9, 11, 25, 34 and 44 differential proteins were identified in 7 lung metastatic rats by LC-MS/MS. Seventeen of these 62 differential proteins were identified on the second day, and 18 of them were identified on the fourth day. The differential urinary proteins changed significantly two days before lung metastasis nodules appeared. Differential urinary proteins differed in Walker-256 lung metastasis rat models and Walker-256 subcutaneous rat models. A total of 9 differential proteins (NHRF1, CLIC1, EZRI, AMPN, ACY1A, HSP7C, BTD, NID2, and CFAD) were identified in 7 lung metastatic rats at one or more common time points, and these 9 differential proteins were not identified in the subcutaneous rat model. Seven of these 9 differential proteins were associated with both breast cancer and lung cancer, eight of the nine were identified on the second day, and 8 of the nine can be identified on the fourth day; these early changes in urine were also identified with differential abundances at late stages of lung metastasis. Our results indicate that (1) the urine proteome changed significantly, even on the second day after tail-vein injection of Walker-256 cells and that (2) the urinary differential proteins were different in Walker-256 lung metastatic tumors and Walker-256 subcutaneous tumors. Our results provide the potential to detect early breast cancer lung metastasis, monitor its progression and differentiate it from the same cancer cells grown at other locations.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that alterations in the gut phagobiota may contribute to pathophysiological processes in mammals; however, the association of bacteriophage community structure with Parkinsons disease (PD) has not been yet characterized. Towards this end, we used a published dataset to analyse bacteriophage composition and determine the phage/bacteria ratio in faecal samples from drug-naive PD patients and healthy participants. Our analyses revealed significant alterations in the representation of certain bacteriophages in the phagobiota of PD patients. We identified shifts of the phage/bacteria ratio in lactic acid bacteria known to produce dopamine and regulate intestinal permeability, which are major factors implicated in PD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we observed the depletion of Lactococcus spp. in the PD group, which was most likely due to the increase of lytic c2-like and 936-like lactococcal phages frequently present in dairy products. Our findings add bacteriophages to the list of possible factors associated with the development of PD, suggesting that gut phagobiota composition may serve as a diagnostic tool as well as a target for therapeutic intervention, which should be confirmed in further studies. Our results open a discussion on the role of environmental phages and phagobiota composition in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Unlike other primates, human foragers have an egalitarian society. Therefore, the evolution of egalitarian behaviour has been the subject of long-standing debate in a wide variety of disciplines. A recent hypothesis states that a social control against potentially dominant individuals played an important role in the emergence of an egalitarian society, although this has not been modelled directly. In the present study, we modelled this hypothesis based on the n-player game framework, in which the owner, who may attempt to monopolise resources, could be punished by a coalition of other group members. Our results suggest that a potentially despotic payoff structure can promote the evolution of egalitarian behaviour. Besides, large group size, small cost of competition, and variation in the strengths of individuals can promote the evolution of egalitarian behaviour. Our results suggest the importance of both social control against dominant individuals and benefits of a coalition for the evolution of egalitarian behaviour.",

Here, I developed a modelling framework for discrete traits (with any number of phenotypes) to explore different models connecting the non-random mating causes (intra sexual competition and/or mate choice) and their consequences (sexual selection and/or assortative mating).\n\nI derived the formulas for the maximum likelihood estimates of each model and used information criteria for performing multimodel inference. Simulation results showed a good performance of both model selection and parameter estimation. The methodology was applied to data from Galician Littorina saxatilis ecotypes, to show that the mating pattern is better described by models with two parameters that involve both mate choice and intrasexual competition, generating positive assortative mating plus female sexual selection.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the first standardized methodology for model selection and multimodel inference of mating parameters for discrete traits. The advantages of this framework include the ability of setting up models from which the parameters connect causes, as intrasexual competition and mate choice, with their outcome in the form of data patterns of sexual selection and assortative mating. For some models, the parameters may have a double effect i.e. they cause both kind of patterns, while for others models there are separated parameters for one kind of pattern or another.\n\nThe full methodology was implemented in a software called InfoMating (available at http://acraaj.webs6.uvigo.es/InfoMating/Infomating.htm).",

This study is the first to explore the relationship between discrimination and DNA methylation of stress regulatory genes in Latinas. Our sample was Latina women (n = 147) with a mean age of 27.6 years who were assessed at 24-32 weeks gestation (T1) and 4-6 weeks postpartum (T2) and reside in the U.S. Blood was collected at T1, and the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) was administered at T1 and T2. DNA Methylation at candidate gene regions was determined by bisulphite pyrosequencing. Associations between EDS and DNA methylation were assessed via zero-inflated Poisson models, adjusting for covariates and multiple-test comparisons. Discrimination was negatively associated with methylation at CpG sites within the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes that were consistent over time. In addition, discrimination was negatively associated with methylation of a CpG in the glucocorticoid binding protein (FKBP5) at T1 but not at T2. This study underscores the complex biological pathways between discrimination and epigenetic modification in Latina women that warrant further investigation to better understand the genetic and psychopathological impact of discrimination on Latino mothers and their families.",

    "abstract": "Research efforts to discover potential new antibiotics for Gram-negative bacteria suffer from high attrition rates due to the synergistic action of efflux systems and the limited permeability of the outer membrane (OM). One potential strategy to overcome the OM permeability barrier is to identify small molecules that are natural substrates for abundant OM channels, and to use such compounds as scaffolds for the design of efficiently-permeating antibacterials. Here we present a multidisciplinary approach to identify such potential small-molecule scaffolds. Focusing on the pathogenic bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii, we use OM proteomics to identify DcaP as the most abundant channel under various conditions that are relevant for infection. High-resolution X-ray structure determination of DcaP surprisingly reveals a trimeric, porin-like structure and suggests that dicarboxylic acids are potential transport substrates. Electrophysiological experiments and allatom molecular dynamics simulations confirm this notion and provide atomistic information on likely permeation pathways and energy barriers for several small molecules, including a clinically-relevant {beta}-lactamase inhibitor. Our study provides a general blueprint for the identification of molecular scaffolds that will inform the rational design of future antibacterials.",

    "abstract": "Here we present FusoPortal, an interactive repository of Fusobacterium genomes that were sequenced using a hybrid MinION long-read sequencing pipeline, followed by assembly and annotation using a diverse portfolio of predominantly open-source software. Significant efforts were made to provide genomic and bioinformatic data as downloadable files, including raw sequencing reads, genome maps, gene annotations, protein functional analysis and classifications, and a custom BLAST server for FusoPortal genomes. FusoPortal has been initiated with eight complete genomes, of which seven were previously only drafts that varied from 24-67 contigs. We showcase that genomes in FusoPortal provide accurate open reading frame annotations, and have corrected a number of large genes (>3 kb) that were previously misannotated due to contig boundaries. In summary, FusoPortal (http://fusoportal.org) is the first database of MinION sequenced and completely assembled Fusobacterium genomes, and this central Fusobacterium genomic and bioinformatic resource will aid the scientific community in developing a deeper understanding of how this human pathogen contributes to an array of diseases including periodontitis and colorectal cancer.\\n\\nImportanceIn this study, we report a hybrid MinION whole genome sequencing pipeline, and describe the genomic characteristics of the first eight strains deposited in the FusoPortal database. This collection of highly accurate and complete genomes drastically improves upon previous multi-contig assemblies by correcting and newly identifying a significant number of open reading frames. We believe this resource will result in the discovery of proteins and molecular mechanisms used by an oral pathogen, with the potential to further our understanding of how F. nucleatum contributes to a repertoire of diseases including periodontitis, pre-term birth, and colorectal cancer",

    "abstract": "Cortical responses to sensory stimuli are highly variable, and sensory cortex exhibits intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Here, by recording over 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we show that spontaneous activity reliably encodes a high-dimensional latent state, which is partially related to the mouses ongoing behavior and is represented not just in visual cortex but across the forebrain. Sensory inputs do not interrupt this ongoing signal, but add onto it a representation of visual stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVolatile interpersonal relationships are a core feature of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and lead to devastating disruption of patients personal and professional lives. Quantitative models of social decision making and learning hold promise for defining the underlying mechanisms of this problem. In this study, we tested BPD and control subject weighting of social versus non-social information, and their learning about choices under stable and volatile conditions. We compared behavior using quantitative models.\\n\\nMethodsSubjects (n=20 BPD, n=23 control) played an extended reward learning task with a partner (confederate) that requires learning about non-social and social cue reward probability (The Social Valuation Task). Task experience was measured using language metrics: explicit emotions/beliefs, talk about the confederate, and implicit distress (using the previously established marker self-referentiality). Subjects weighting of social and non-social cues was tested in mixed-effects regression models. Subjects learning rates under stable and volatile conditions were modelled (Rescorla-Wagner approach) and group x condition interactions tested.\\n\\nResultsCompared to controls, BPD subject debriefings included more mentions of the confederate and less distress language. BPD subjects also weighted social cues more heavily, but had blunted learning responses to (non-social and social) volatility.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first report of patient behavior in the Social Valuation Task. The results suggest that BPD subjects expect higher volatility than do controls. These findings lay the groundwork for a neuro-computational dissection of social and non-social belief updating in BPD, which holds promise for the development of novel clinical interventions that more directly target pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Recently it has been proposed that information in short-term memory may not always be stored in persistent neuronal activity, but can be maintained in \\\"activity-silent\\\" hidden states such as synaptic efficacies endowed with short-term plasticity (STP). However, working memory involves manipulation as well as maintenance of information in the absence of external stimuli. In this work, we investigated working memory representation using recurrent neural network (RNN) models trained to perform several working memory dependent tasks. We found that STP can support the short-term maintenance of information provided that the memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in tasks that require actively manipulating information, persistent neuronal activity naturally emerges from learning, and the amount of persistent neuronal activity scales with the degree of manipulation required. These results shed insight into the current debate on working memory encoding, and suggest that persistent neural activity can vary markedly between tasks used in different experiments.",

Two areas where users and developers frequently need to extend the built-in capabilities of most software packages are implementing custom interactions, for instance biases derived from experimental data, and running ensembles of simulations. We present a Python high-level interface for the popular simulation package GROMACS that 1) allows custom potential functions without modifying the simulation package code, 2) maintains the optimized performance of GROMACS, and 3) presents an abstract interface to building and executing computational graphs that allows transparent low-level optimization of data flow and task placement. Minimal dependencies make this integrated API for the GROMACS simulation engine simple, portable, and maintainable. We demonstrate this API for experimentally-driven refinement of protein conformational ensembles.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource and installation instructions are available at https://github.com/kassonlab/gmxapi.",

    "abstract": "Clinical genomic tests increasingly utilize a next generation sequencing (NGS) platform due in part to the high fidelity of variant calls, yet rare errors are still possible. In hereditary cancer screening, failure to correct such errors could have serious consequences for patients, who may follow an unwarranted screening or surgical-management path. It has been suggested that routine orthogonal confirmation via Sanger sequencing is required to verify NGS results, especially low-confidence positives with depressed allele fraction (<30% of alternate allele). We evaluated whether an alternative method of confirmation--software-assisted manual call review--performed comparably to Sanger confirmation in >15,000 samples. Licensed reviewers manually inspected both raw and processed data at the batch-, sample-, and variant-level, including raw NGS read pileups. Of ambiguous variant calls with <30% allele fraction (1,707 total calls at 38 unique sites), manual call review classified >99% (1,701) as true positives (enriched for long insertions or deletions (\\\"indels\\\") and homopolymers) or true negatives (often conspicuous NGS artifacts), with the remaining <1% (6) being mosaic. Critically, results from software-assisted manual review and retrospective Sanger sequencing were concordant for samples selected from all ambiguous sites. We conclude that the confirmation required for high confidence in NGS-based germline testing can manifest in different ways: a trained NGS expert operating platform-tailored review software achieves quality comparable to routine Sanger confirmation.",

    "abstract": "The thalamus appears to be involved in the flexible routing of information among cortical areas, yet the computational implications of such routing are only beginning to be explored. Here we create a connectionist model of how selectively gated cortico-thalamo-cortical relays could underpin both symbolic and sub-symbolic computations. We first show how gateable relays can be used to create a Dynamically Partitionable Auto-Associative Network (DPAAN) (Hayworth, 2012) consisting of a set of cross-connected cortical memory buffers. All buffers and relays in a DPAAN are trained simultaneously to have a common set of stable attractor states that become the symbol vocabulary of the DPAAN. We show via simulations that such a DPAAN can support operations necessary for syntactic rule-based computation, namely buffer-to-buffer copying and equality detection. We then provide each DPAAN module with a multilayer input network trained to map sensory inputs to the DPAANs symbol vocabulary, and demonstrate how gateable thalamic relays can provide recall and clamping operations to train this input network by Contrastive Hebbian Learning (CHL) (Xie and Seung, 2003). We suggest that many such DPAAN modules may exist at the highest levels of the brains sensory hierarchies and show how a joint snapshot of the contents of multiple DPAAN modules can be stored as a declarative memory in a simple model of the hippocampus. We speculate that such an architecture might first have been  discovered by evolution as a means to bootstrap learning of more meaningful cortical representations feeding the striatum, eventually leading to a system that could support symbolic computation. Our model serves as a bridging hypothesis for linking controllable thalamo-cortical information routing with computations that could underlie aspects of both learning and symbolic reasoning in the brain.",

This study directly compares the decoding performance between a 3T and a 7T dataset that were acquired using the same stimulation paradigm by applying an identical analysis procedure. The results indicate that decoding models built on 3T data are comparatively impaired. Moreover, we found no evidence for a strong coupling of BOLD signal change magnitude or temporal signal to noise ratio (tSNR) with decoding performance. Direct enhancement of tSNR via multiband fMRI acquisition at the same resolution did not translate into improved decoding performance. Additional voxel selection can boost 3T decoding performance to the 7T level only at a 3mm acquisition resolution. In both datasets the BOLD signal available for orientation decoding is spatially broadband, but, consistent with the size of the BOLD point-spread-function, decoding models at 3T utilize spatially coarser image components.",

About 20% of children are steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) which progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). More than 53 genes are associated with SRNS which represent the genetic heterogeneity of SRNS. This study was aimed to screen disease causing mutations within NPHS1 and NPHS2 and evaluate new potential variants in other genes.\\n\\nMethod: In first phase of study, 25 patients with SRNS were analyzed for NPHS1 (exon 2, 26) and all exons of NPHS2 genes by Sanger sequencing. In the second phase, whole exome sequencing was performed on 10 patients with no mutations in NPHS1 and NPHS2.\\n\\nResult: WES analysis revealed a novel mutation in FAT1 (c.10570C>A; Q3524K).

How does this specialization emerge? Here, we investigated the role of sensorimotor experience in shaping the organization of the action observation network as a window on this question. Observed body movements are frequently coupled with corresponding motor codes, e.g. during monitoring ones own movements and imitation, resulting in bidirectionally connected circuits between areas involved in body movements observation (e.g., of the hand) and the motor codes involved in their execution. If the organization of the action observation network is shaped by this sensorimotor coupling, then, it should not form for body movements that do not belong to individuals motor repertoire. To test this prediction, we used fMRI to investigate the spatial arrangement and functional properties of the hand and foot action observation circuits in individuals born without upper limbs. Multivoxel pattern decoding, pattern similarity, and univariate analyses revealed an intact hand action observation network in the individuals born without upper limbs. This suggests that the organization of the action observation network does not require effector-specific visuomotor coupling.",

    "abstract": "Background: Taking into account that injury is one of the main causes of child fatalities in developed countries, and that boys are more likely to suffer it than girls, we have explored a database of pediatric patients with severe injuries to determine whether sex and age influence the pattern of these fatalities, and the magnitude of this.\\n\\nMethod: Observational study of the demographic and clinical characteristics of 227 patients from a Spanish pediatric reference hospital, all of them admitted with a diagnosis of trauma.\\n\\nResult: Falls are the most frequent type of trauma (60.7%), followed by pedestrian traffic collisions (15%). Boys are over-represented in falls (72% vs 28% in girls) and pedestrian traffic injuries (61% vs 39 %). In boys, falls are mainly observed in public roads and during leisure activities (53.8%) whereas in girls at home (55.2%). In a logistic regression, sex and age are statistically significant predictors of severe trauma, boys (OR = 1.59) and the adolescent age group (OR = 3.7) showed the highest odds.\\n\\nConclusion: We have observed a clear gender-biased pattern of injury-related events: falls are the leading cause of injuries, with 2.5 boys for every girl. Falls mostly happened during outdoor leisure activities in boys and at home in girls. Pedestrian traffic injuries also show significant differences between sexes, emphasizing the role of cognitive and cultural factors in childrens behavior.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic DNA polymerase {beta} plays an important role in cellular DNA repair as it fills gaps in single nucleotide gapped DNA that result from removal of damaged bases. Since defects in DNA repair may lead to cancer and genetic instabilities, Pol {beta} has been extensively studied, especially substrate binding and a fidelity-related conformational change called \\\"fingers closing\\\". Here, we applied single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer to study the conformational dynamics of Pol {beta}. Using an acceptor labelled polymerase and a donor labelled DNA substrate, we measured distance changes associated with DNA binding and fingers movement. Our findings suggest that Pol {beta} does not bend its gapped DNA substrate to the extent related crystal structures indicate: instead, bending seems to be significantly less profound. Furthermore, we visualized dynamic fingers closing in single Pol {beta}-DNA complexes upon addition of complementary nucleotides and derived rates of conformational changes. Additionally, we provide evidence that the fingers close only partially when an incorrect nucleotide is bound. This \\\"ajar\\\" conformation found in Pol {beta}, a polymerase of the X-family, suggests the existence of an additional fidelity checkpoint similar to what has been previously proposed for a member of the A-family, the bacterial DNA polymerase I.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ThyroSeq v2 next-generation sequencing assay (ThyroSeq) estimates the probability of malignancy in indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITN). Its diagnostic accuracy in different practice settings and patient populations is not well understood.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed 273 Bethesda III/IV ITN evaluated with ThyroSeq at 4 institutions: 2 comprehensive cancer centers (n=98 and 102), a multicenter healthcare system (n=60), and an academic medical center (n=13). The positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of ThyroSeq, and distribution of final pathology were analyzed and compared to values predicted by Bayes Theorem.\\n\\nResultsAcross 4 institutions, the PPV was 35% (22-43%), and NPV was 93% (88-100%). Predictive values correlated closely with Bayes Theorem estimates (r2=.84), although PPVs were lower than expected. RAS mutations were the most frequent molecular alteration. Among 84 RAS-mutated nodules, malignancy risk was variable (25%, range 10-37%), and distribution of benign diagnoses differed across institutions (adenoma/hyperplasia 12-85%, NIFTP 5-46%).\\n\\nConclusionsIn a multi-institutional analysis, ThyroSeq PPVs were variable and lower than expected. This is attributable to differences in the prevalence of malignancy, and variability in pathologist interpretations of non-invasive tumors. It is important that clinicians understand ThyroSeq performance in their practice setting when evaluating these results.",

    "abstract": "Pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is a transcription factor involved in cancer and growth. We discovered a de novo DNA motif containing a PLAG1 binding site in the promoters of genes activated during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in human embryos. This motif was located within an Alu element in a region that was conserved in the murine B1 element. We show that maternally provided Plag1 is essential for timely mouse preimplantation embryo development. Heterozygous mouse embryos lacking maternal Plag1 showed disrupted regulation of 1,089 genes, spent significantly longer time in the 2-cell stage, and started expressing Plag1 ectopically from the paternal allele. The de novo PLAG1 motif was enriched in the promoters of the genes whose activation was delayed in the absence of Plag1. Further, these mouse genes showed a significant overlap with genes upregulated during human ZGA that also contain the motif. By gene ontology, the mouse and human ZGA genes with de novo PLAG1 motifs were involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Collectively, our data suggest that PLAG1 affects embryo development in mice and humans through a conserved DNA motif within Alu/B1 elements located in the promoters of a subset of ZGA genes.",

    "abstract": "Assembly of reference-quality genomes from next-generation sequencing data is a key challenge in genomics. Recently, we and others have shown that Hi-C data can be used to address several outstanding challenges in the field of genome assembly. This principle has since been developed in academia and industry, and has been used in the assembly of several major genomes. In this paper, we explore the central principles underlying Hi-C-based assembly approaches, by quantitatively defining and characterizing three invariant Hi-C interaction patterns on which these approaches can build: Intrachromosomal interaction enrichment, distance-dependent interaction decay and local interaction smoothness. Specifically, we evaluate to what degree each invariant pattern holds on a single locus level in different species, cell types and Hi-C map resolutions. We find that these patterns are generally consistent across species and cell types but are affected by sequencing depth, and that matrix balancing improves consistency of loci with all three invariant patterns. Finally, we overview current Hi-C-based assembly approaches in light of these invariant patterns and demonstrate how local interaction smoothness can be used to easily detect scaffolding errors in extremely sparse Hi-C maps. We suggest that simultaneously considering all three invariant patterns may lead to better Hi-C-based genome assembly methods.",

    "abstract": "Substance addiction is regarded as an important public health problem, perpetuated by fronto-striatal circuit pathology. A usual finding in neuroimaging human and murine studies is cortical thinning and lower volume when compared to healthy controls. In this study we wished to replicate cortical thinning findings and find if striatum morphology may explain the cortical pathology. For this we analyzed T1w neuroimaging data from an ongoing addiction Mexican dataset. This dataset includes cocaine addicts diagnosed by expert psychiatrists and healthy controls. For the analysis we used voxel-based morphometry, cortical thickness and volumetric analysis of the basal ganglia, and we correlated striatum volume with cortical thickness to find pathological patterns. Our group contrast showed cortical thinning and striatum volume differences in cocaine addicts correlated to their years of substance use, craving and age. Our correlation between striatum-cortex morphology showed higher significant correlations in healthy controls, not observed in cocaine addicts. The correlation between striatum volume and cortical thickness in healthy controls involved similar areas as those shown with less cortical thickness in cocaine addicts. We suggest that striatum morphological changes in addiction may explain the pattern of cortical thinning observed across several substances addiction studies.\\n\\nResearch Data Related to this SubmissionData set https://zenodo.org/record/1409808#.W5E3oCOZPIF Patterns of reduced cortical thickness and striatum pathological morphology in cocaine addiction\\n\\nThis dataset includes all the data and scripts needed to reproduce the analysis and results on the manuscript \\\"Patterns of reduced cortical thickness and striatum pathological morphology in cocaine addiction\\\" (link).
