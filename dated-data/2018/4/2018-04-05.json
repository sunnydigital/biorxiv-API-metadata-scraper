    "abstract": "During the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode zygote, the polarity cues distribution and daughter cell fates depend on the correct positioning of the mitotic spindle, which results from both centering and cortical pulling forces. Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn consequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of these forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule availability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull. Importantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99 cortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior crescent. After delaying anaphase onset, we detected this positional pulling force regulation in C. elegans as a precocious spindle rocking with respect to anaphase onset. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex. Indeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it modulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control, predicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent controlled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic progression. We found in particular that the oscillation onset position resists changes in cellular geometry and moderate variations of active force generator count. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to a posterior crescent sets the spindles final position, reflecting polarity through the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior crescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity. This novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force generator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold needed for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.",

    "abstract": "Putative associations between sex hormones and attractive physical characteristics in women are central to many theories of human physical attractiveness and mate choice. Although such theories have become very influential, evidence that physically attractive and unattractive women have different hormonal profiles is equivocal. Consequently, we investigated hypothesized relationships between salivary estradiol and progesterone and two aspects of womens physical attractiveness that are commonly assumed to be correlated with levels of these hormones: facial attractiveness (N=249) and waist-to-hip ratio (N=247). Our analyses revealed no evidence that women with more attractive faces or lower (i.e., more attractive) waist-to-hip ratios had higher levels of estradiol or progesterone. These results do not support the influential hypothesis that between-woman differences in physical attractiveness are related to estradiol and/or progesterone.",

    "abstract": "Visual neglect is a frequent and disabling consequence of right hemisphere damage. Previous work demonstrated a probable role of posterior callosal dysfunction in the chronic persistence of neglect signs. Prism adaptation is a non-invasive and convenient technique to rehabilitate chronic visual neglect, but it is not effective in all patients. Here we aimed to assess the hypothesis that prism adaptation improves left neglect by facilitating compensation through the contribution of the left, undamaged hemisphere. We assessed the relationship between prism adaptation effects, cortical thickness and white matter integrity in a group of 14 patients with unilateral right-hemisphere strokes and chronic visual neglect. Results showed that patients who benefitted from prism adaptation had thicker cortex in temporo-parietal, prefrontal and cingulate areas of the left, undamaged hemisphere. Additionally, these patients had a higher fractional anisotropy value in the body and genu of the corpus callosum. Results from normal controls show that these callosal regions connect temporo-parietal, sensorimotor and prefrontal areas. Finally, shorter time intervals from the stroke tended to improve patients response to prism adaptation. We concluded that prism adaptation may improve left visual neglect by promoting the contribution of the left hemisphere to neglect compensation. These results support current hypotheses on the role of the healthy hemisphere in the compensation for stroke-induced, chronic neuropsychological deficits, and suggest that prism adaptation can foster this role by exploiting sensorimotor/prefrontal circuits, especially when applied at early stages post-stroke.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1-infected people who take drugs that suppress viremia to undetectable levels are protected from developing AIDS. Nonetheless, these individuals have chronic inflammation associated with heightened risk of cardiovascular pathology. HIV-1 establishes proviruses in long-lived CD4+ memory T cells, and perhaps other cell types, that preclude elimination of the virus even after years of continuous antiviral therapy. Though the majority of proviruses that persist during antiviral therapy are defective for production of infectious virions, many are expressed, raising the possibility that the HIV-1provirus or its transcripts contribute to ongoing inflammation. Here we found that the HIV-1 provirus activated innate immune signaling in isolated dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4+ T cells. Immune activation required transcription from the HIV-1 provirus and expression of CRM1-dependent, Rev-dependent, RRE-containing, unspliced HIV-1 RNA. If rev was provided in trans, all HIV-1 coding sequences were dispensable for activation except those cis-acting sequences required for replication or splicing. These results indicate that the complex, post-transcriptional regulation intrinsic to HIV-1 RNA is detected by the innate immune system as a danger signal, and that drugs which disrupt HIV-1 transcription or HIV-1 RNA metabolism would add qualitative benefit to current antiviral drug regimens.",

    "abstract": "Procedural memories, such as for riding a bicycle, can be maintained without practice for long periods of time and are thought to be supported by the persistent reorganization of sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1). Whereas enhanced synaptic strength and structural changes accompany the learning of motor tasks, the persistent molecular modifications that store long-term procedural memories within specific layers of sensorimotor cortex have not been identified. The persistent increase in the autonomously active, atypical PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is a putative molecular mechanism for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength during long-term potentiation (LTP) and several forms of long-term memory. Here we examine whether persistent increases in PKM{zeta} store long-term memory for a reaching task in rat sensorimotor cortex that could reveal the sites of procedural memory storage. Perturbing PKM{zeta} synthesis with PKM{zeta} -antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or blocking atypical PKC activity with zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) in S1/M1 disrupts and erases the maintenance of long-term motor memories. Only memories that are maintained without daily reinforcement are affected, indicating atypical PKCs (via ZIP) and PKM{zeta} specifically (via antisense) stores consolidated long-term procedural memories. Analysis of changes in the amount of PKM{zeta} in S1/M1 reveals PKM{zeta} increases in layers II/III and V of both S1 and M1 cortices as performance improves to an asymptote during training. After storage for 1 month without reinforcement, the increase in M1 layer V but not other layers persists without decrement. Thus, the sustained increases in PKM{zeta} reveal that the persistent molecular changes storing long-term procedural memory are localized to the descending output layer of primary motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "The ER is a complex network of sheets and tubules that is continuously being remodeled. The relevance of this membrane dynamics is underscored by the fact that mutations in Atlastins (ATL), the ER fusion proteins in mammals, cause neurodegeneration. How defects in this process disrupt neuronal homeostasis is largely unknown. Here we show by EM volume reconstruction of transfected cells, neurons and patient fibroblasts that the HSAN-causing ATL3 mutants promote aberrant ER tethering hallmarked by bundles of laterally attached ER tubules. In vitro, these mutants cause excessive liposome tethering, recapitulating the results in cells. Moreover, ATL3 variants retain their dimerization-dependent GTPase activity, but are unable to promote membrane fusion, suggesting a defect on an intermediate step of the ATL3 functional cycle. Our data therefore show that the effects of ATL3 mutations on ER network organization stretch beyond a loss of fusion, shedding a new light on neuropathies caused by atlastin defects.",

Despite intense study of the segmentation clock governing the timing of somite generation, how it relates to somite size is poorly understood. Here we examine somite scaling and find that somite size at specification scales with the length of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) despite considerable variation in PSM length across developmental stages and in surgically size-reduced embryos. Measurement of clock period, axis elongation speed, and clock gene expression patterns demonstrate that existing models fail to explain scaling. We posit a \\\"clock and scaled gradient\\\" model, in which somite boundaries are set by a dynamically scaling signaling gradient across the PSM. Our model not only explains existing data, but also makes a unique prediction that we experimentally confirm--the formation of periodic \\\"echoes\\\" in somite size following perturbation of the size of one somite. Our findings demonstrate that gradient scaling plays a central role both in progression and size control of somitogenesis.\\n\\nSummary statementBy comparing patterning in zebrafish embryos of different size we show that a dynamically scaling gradient in the presomitic mesoderm regulates somite size control.",

    "abstract": "Given the highly dynamic and complex nature of the human gut microbial community, the ability to identify and predict time-dependent compositional patterns of microbes is crucial to our understanding of the structure and function of this ecosystem. One factor that could affect such time-dependent patterns is microbial interactions, wherein community composition at a given time point affects the microbial composition at a later time point. However, the field has not yet settled on the degree of this effect. Specifically, it has been recently suggested that only a minority of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) depend on the microbial composition in earlier times. To address the issue of identifying and predicting temporal microbial patterns we developed a new model, MTV-LMM (Microbial Temporal Variability Linear Mixed Model), a linear mixed model for the prediction of the microbial community temporal dynamics based on the community composition at previous time stamps. MTV-LMM can identify time-dependent microbes in time series datasets, which can then be used to analyze the trajectory of the microbiome over time. We evaluated the performance of MTV-LMM on three human microbiome time series datasets, and found that MTV-LMM significantly outperforms all existing methods for microbiome time series modeling. Particularly, we demonstrate that the effect of the microbial composition in previous time points on the abundance levels of an OTU at a later time point is underestimated by a factor of at least 10 when applying previous approaches. Using MTV-LMM, we demonstrate that a considerable proportion of the human gut microbiome, both in infants and adults, has a significant time-dependent component that can be predicted based on microbiome composition in earlier time points. This suggests that microbiome composition at a given time point is a major factor in defining future microbiome composition and that this phenomenon is considerably more common than previously reported for the human gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Self-fertilization is often associated with ecological traits corresponding to the ruderal strategy in Grimes Competitive-Stress-tolerant-Ruderal (CSR) classification of ecological strategies. Consequently, selfers are expected to be less competitive than outcrossers, either because of a colonization/competition trade-off or because of the deleterious genetic effects of selfing. Range expansion could reduce further competitive ability while polyploidy could mitigate the effects of selfing. Although suggested by meta-analyses, these predictions have not been directly tested yet. We compared the competitive ability of four Capsella species differing by their mating system and ploidy level. We found that the two diploid selfing species (C. rubella and C. orientalis) were more sensitive to competition than the diploid outcrosser (C. grandiflora), and that the tetraploid selfer (C. bursa-pastoris) was intermediate. Within C. bursa-pastoris, we also found that sensitivity to competition increased in parallel to range expansion. These results highlight the possible roles of ecological context and ploidy in the evolutionary trajectories of selfing species.",

Massive, genome-wide transcriptomic rewiring in response to genomic merger and doubling has been demonstrated in many allopolyploid systems, encompassing a diversity of phenomena, including homoeolog expression bias, genome dominance, expression-level dominance, and revamping of co-expression networks. Here we present an analytical framework to reconcile these patterns of regulatory novelty as governed by distinct sets of intra- and inter-subgenome cis-trans relationships. This approach is a novel extension of classic allele-specific expression analysis to incorporate and distinguish the separate effects of parental regulatory interactions as well as further complications at the allopolyploid level. We demonstrated that the cis-trans framework devised not only offers new perspective on disentangling genetic from epigenetic and higher-order effects that impact gene expression, but also provides the conceptual basis and tools to unify recently presented models for both genome-wide expression dominance and biased fractionation in allopolyploids.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMammalian phenotypes are shaped by numerous genome variants, many of which may regulate gene transcription or RNA splicing. To identify variants with regulatory functions in cattle, an important economic and model species, we used sequence variants to map a type of expression quantitative trait loci (expression QTLs) that are associated with variations in the RNA splicing, i.e., sQTLs. To further the understanding of regulatory variants, sQTLs were compare with other two types of expression QTLs, 1) variants associated with variations in gene expression, i.e., geQTLs and 2) variants associated with variations in exon expression, i.e., eeQTLs, in different tissues.\\n\\nResultsUsing whole genome and RNA sequence data from four tissues of over 200 cattle, sQTLs identified using exon inclusion ratios were verified by matching their effects on adjacent intron excision ratios. sQTLs contained the highest percentage of variants that are within the intronic region of genes and contained the lowest percentage of variants that are within intergenic regions, compared to eeQTLs and geQTLs. Many geQTLs and sQTLs are also detected as eeQTLs. Many expression QTLs, including sQTLs, were significant in all four tissues and had a similar effect in each tissue. To verify such expression QTL sharing between tissues, variants surrounding ({+/-}1Mb) the exon or gene were used to build local genomic relationship matrices (LGRM) and estimated genetic correlations between tissues. For many exons, the splicing and expression level was determined by the same cis additive genetic variance in different tissues. Thus, an effective but simple-to-implement meta-analysis combining information from three tissues is introduced to increase power to detect and validate sQTLs. sQTLs and eeQTLs together were more enriched for variants associated with cattle complex traits, compared to geQTLs. Several putative causal mutations were identified, including an sQTL at Chr6:87392580 within the 5th exon of kappa casein (CSN3) associated with milk production traits.\\n\\nConclusionsUsing novel analytical approaches, we report the first identification of numerous bovine sQTLs which are extensively shared between multiple tissue types. The significant overlaps between bovine sQTLs and complex traits QTL highlight the contribution of regulatory mutations to phenotypic variations.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of antimicrobial resistance has been well documented in Gram-negative bacteria and healthcare-associated epidemic pathogens, often emerging from regions with heavy antimicrobial use. However, the degree to which similar processes occur with Gram-positive bacteria in the community setting is less well understood. Here we demonstrate the recent origin and global spread from the Indian subcontinent of a multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage, sequence type 772 (Bengal Bay clone). Short-term outbreaks occurred following intercontinental transmission, typically associated with travel and family contacts, but ongoing endemic transmission was uncommon. Instrumental in the emergence of a single dominant clade in the early 1990s was the acquisition of a multidrug resistance integrated plasmid that did not appear to incur a significant fitness cost. The Bengal Bay clone therefore combines the multidrug resistance of traditional healthcare-associated clones with the epidemiological and virulence potential of community-associated clones.",

    "abstract": "We present a technique applicable in any dynamical framework to identify control-robust subsets of an interacting system. These robust subsystems, which we call stable modules, are characterized by constraints on the variables that make up the subsystem. They are robust in the sense that if the defining constraints are satisfied at a given time, they remain satisfied for all later times, regardless of what happens in the rest of the system, and can only be broken if the constrained variables are externally manipulated. We identify stable modules as graph structures in an expanded network, which represents causal links between variable constraints. A stable module represents a system \\\"decision point\\\", or trap subspace. Using the expanded network, small stable modules can be composed sequentially to form larger stable modules that describe dynamics on the system level. Collections of large, mutually exclusive stable modules describe the systems repertoire of long-term behaviors. We implement this technique in a broad class of dynamical systems and illustrate its practical utility via examples and algorithmic analysis of two published biological network models. In the segment polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster, we obtain a state-space visualization that reproduces by novel means the four possible cell fates and predicts the outcome of cell transplant experiments. In the T-cell signaling network, we identify six signaling elements that determine the high-signal response and show that control of an element connected to them cannot disrupt this response.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe show how to uncover the causal relationships between qualitative statements about the values of variables in ODE systems. We then show how these relationships can be used to identify subsystem behaviors that are robust to outside interventions. This informs potential system control strategies (e.g., in identifying drug targets). Typical analytical properties of biomolecular systems render them particularly amenable to our techniques. Furthermore, due to their often high dimension and large uncertainties, our results are particularly useful in biomolecular systems. We apply our methods to two quantitative biological models: the segment polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and the T-cell signal transduction network.",

    "abstract": "The canonical approach to exploring brain-behaviour relationships is to group individuals according to a phenotype of interest, and then explore the neural correlates of this grouping. A limitation of this approach is that multiple aetiological pathways could result in a similar phenotype, so the role of any one brain mechanism may be substantially underestimated. Building on advances in network analysis, we used a data-driven community-clustering algorithm to identify robust subgroups based on white-matter microstructure in childhood and adolescence (total N=313, mean age: 11.24 years). The algorithm indicated the presence of two equal-size groups that show a critical difference in FA of the left and right cingulum. These different  brain types had profoundly different cognitive abilities with higher performance in the higher FA group. Further, a connectomics analysis indicated reduced structural connectivity in the low FA subgroup that was strongly related to reduced functional activation of the default mode network.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/237859_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (34K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135e807org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145673org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137cd67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e2cff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Concepts in molecular tension sensing in biology are growing and have their origins in studies of muscle contraction. In the heart muscle, a key parameter of contractility is the detachment rate from actin of myosin, which determines the time that myosin is bound to actin in a force-producing state and, importantly, depends on the load (force) against which myosin works. Here, we measure the detachment rate of single molecules of human {beta}-cardiac myosin and its load dependence. We find that both can be modulated by both small molecule compounds and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. Furthermore, effects of mutations can be reversed by introducing appropriate compounds. Our results suggest that activating vs. inhibitory perturbations of cardiac myosin are discriminated by the aggregate result on duty ratio, average force, and ultimately average power output and that cardiac contractility can be controlled by tuning the load-dependent kinetics of single myosin molecules.",

    "abstract": "In early Alzheimers disease (AD) spatial navigation is impaired; however, the precise cause of this impairment is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that getting lost in new surroundings is one of the first impairments to emerge in AD. It is possible that getting lost in new surroundings represents a failure to use distal cues to get oriented in space. Therefore, we set out to look for impaired use of distal cues for spatial orientation in a mouse model of amyloidosis (3xTg-AD). To do this, we trained mice to shuttle to the end of a track and back to an enclosed start box to receive a water reward. Then, mice were trained to stop in an unmarked reward zone to receive a brain stimulation reward. The time required to remain in the zone for a reward was increased across training, and the track was positioned in a random start location for each trial. We found that 6-month female, but not male, 3xTg-AD mice were impaired. Male and female mice had only intracellular pathology and male mice had less pathology, particularly in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, AD may cause spatial disorientation as a result of impaired use of landmarks.",

    "abstract": "The MYC oncogene promotes tumorigenesis in part by facilitating cell cycle entry thus driving cellular proliferation. Tumors that overexpress MYC frequently demonstrate aneuploidy, numerical chromosome alterations associated with highly aggressive cancers, rapid tumor evolution, and poor patient outcome. While the role of MYC in overcoming the G1/S checkpoint is well established, it remains poorly understood whether MYC induces chromosomal instability (CIN). Here, we identify a direct influence of MYC on mitotic progression. MYC overexpression induces defects in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly promoting chromosome segregation defects, micronuclei and CIN. We examined which mitotic regulators are required for the survival of MYC-overexpressing cells and found a reliance on high TPX2 expression. TPX2, a master microtubule regulator, is overexpressed together with MYC in multiple cell lines, in mouse tumor models and in aggressive human breast cancers. High TPX2 expression is permissive for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation in cells with deregulated MYC, whereas TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death and prevents tumor growth. Importantly, attenuation of MYC expression reverses the mitotic defects observed, even in established tumor cell lines, implicating an ongoing role for high MYC in the persistence of a CIN phenotype in tumors. Here, we implicate the MYC oncogene as a regulator of spindle assembly and dynamics and identify a new MYC-TPX2 synthetic-lethal interaction that could represent a future therapeutic strategy in MYC-overexpressing cancers. Our studies suggest that blocking MYC activity can attenuate the emergence of CIN and tumor evolution.",

AD affects brain dynamics at the local level, such as changes in the balance of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations, as well as long-range changes to the global network.

Here, we use a multi-scale neurophysiological model, \\\"The Virtual Brain (TVB)\\\", based on empirical multi-modal neuroimaging data, to study how local and global dynamics correlate with individual differences in cognition. In particular, we modeled individual resting-state functional activity of 124 individuals across the behavioral spectrum from healthy aging, to amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), to AD. The model parameters required to accurately simulate empirical functional brain imaging data correlated significantly with cognition, and exceeded the predictive capacity of empirical connectomes.",

Here we report a striking behavior of Euglena gracilis, where Euglena cells swim in polygonal trajectories due to exposure to increasing light intensities. While smoothly curved trajectories are common for microswimmers 3, 8, such quantized ones have not been reported previously. This polygonal behavior emerges from periodic switching between the flagellar beating patterns of helical swimming 6, 9 and spinning 10 behaviors. We develop and experimentally validate a biophysical model that describes the phase relationship between the eyespot, cell orientation, light detection, and cellular reorientation, that accounts for all three behavioral states. Coordinated switching between these behaviors allows ballistic, superdiffusive, diffusive, or subdiffusive motion 11,12 (i.e., the tuning of the diffusion constant over 3 orders of magnitude) and enables navigation in structured light fields, e.g., edge avoidance and gradient descent. This feedback-control links multiple system scales (flagellar beats, cellular behaviors, phototaxis strategies) with implications for other natural and synthetic microswimmers 13.",

Here, we propose methods for TRN inference in a mammalian setting, using ATAC-seq data to influence gene expression modeling. We rigorously test our methods in the context of T Helper Cell Type 17 (Th17) differentiation, generating new ATAC-seq data to complement existing Th17 genomic resources (plentiful gene expression data, TF knock-outs and ChIP-seq experiments). In this resource-rich mammalian setting, our extensive benchmarking provides quantitative, genome-scale evaluation of TRN inference combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We refine and extend our previous Th17 TRN, using our new TRN inference methods to integrate all Th17 data (gene expression, ATAC-seq, TF KO, ChIP-seq). We highlight new roles for individual TFs and groups of TFs (\\\"TF-TF modules\\\") in Th17 gene regulation. Given the popularity of ATAC-seq, which provides high-resolution with low sample input requirements, we anticipate that application of our methods will improve TRN inference in new mammalian systems, especially in vivo, for cells directly from humans and animal models.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) depends on sequential detection and localization of individual molecular blinking events. Due to the stochasticity of single-molecule blinking and the desire to improve SMLMs temporal resolution, algorithms capable of analyzing frames with a high density (HD) of active molecules, or molecules whose images overlap, are a prerequisite for accurate location measurements. Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the structure of errors caused by the structure of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscopes point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

We quantified individuality in bands of clonal Escherichia coli cells that migrate collectively along a channel by following a self-generated gradient of attractant. We discovered that despite substantial differences in individual chemotactic abilities, the cells are able to migrate as a coherent group by spontaneously sorting themselves within the moving band. This sorting mechanism ensures that differences between individual chemotactic abilities are compensated by differences in the local steepness of the traveling gradient each individual must navigate, and determines the minimum performance required to travel with the band. By resolving conflicts between individuality and collective migration, this mechanism enables populations to maintain advantageous diversity while on the move.",

    "abstract": "Signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses involves the activity of ionotropic glutamate receptors, including the AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptor. Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy have brought a slew of full-length structures of AMPA receptors, on their own and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures illustrate a wide range of conformations, indicating that individual domains might undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, resulting in an open, \\\"relaxed\\\" extracellular layer. Here, we used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations found in functional AMPA receptors both in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. Our data indicate that AMPA receptors have considerable conformational freedom and can get trapped in stable, relaxed conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Thus, under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of Stargazin dominate, AMPA receptors are unlikely to adopt very relaxed conformations during gating.",

At DSBs, the severed strands of the DNA helix are repaired by a variety of mechanisms. The two major DSB repair pathways are Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homologous Recombination (HR). NHEJ repairs DNA by ligating both ends of the DSB together, often resulting in small insertions and deletions at the break site. HR repair involves more extensive processing of the DSB site, in which 5 to 3 end-resection of the DSB ends results in a single-stranded DNA sequence that invades and perfectly copies homologous sequences to repair the DS ...",

Local translation for some dendritic proteins occurs, but local translation in mammalian presynaptic nerve terminals is difficult to demonstrate. Here, we present evidence for local presynaptic protein synthesis in the mammalian brain at a glutamatergic nerve terminal. We show an essential ribosomal component, 5.8s rRNA, in terminals. We also show active translation in nerve terminals, in situ, in brain slices demonstrating ongoing presynaptic protein synthesis. After inhibiting translation for ~1 hour, the presynaptic terminal exhibits increased spontaneous release, and increased evoked release with an increase in vesicle recycling during stimulation trains. Postsynaptic response, shape and amplitude were not affected. We conclude that ongoing protein synthesis limits vesicle release at the nerve terminal which reduces the need for presynaptic vesicle replenishment, thus conserving energy required for maintaining synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "Studies of amnesic patients and animal models support a systems consolidation model, which posits that explicit memories formed in hippocampus are transferred to cortex over time1-6. Prelimbic cortex (PL), a subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex, is required for the expression of learned fear memories from hours after learning until weeks later7-12. While some studies suggested that prefrontal cortical neurons active during learning are required for memory retrieval13-15, others provided evidence for ongoing cortical circuit reorganization during memory consolidation10,16,17. It has been difficult to causally relate the activity of cortical neurons during learning or recent memory retrieval to their function in remote memory, in part due to a lack of tools18. Here we show that a new version of  targeted recombination in active populations, TRAP2, has enhanced efficiency over the past version, providing brain-wide access to neurons activated by a particular experience. Using TRAP2, we accessed PL neurons activated during fear conditioning or 1-, 7-, or 14-day memory retrieval, and assessed their contributions to 28-day remote memory. We found that PL neurons TRAPed at later retrieval times were more likely to be reactivated during remote memory retrieval, and more effectively promoted remote memory retrieval. Furthermore, reducing PL activity during learning blunted the ability of TRAPed PL neurons to promote remote memory retrieval. Finally, a series of whole-brain analyses identified a set of cortical regions that were densely innervated by memory-TRAPed PL neurons and preferentially activated by PL neurons TRAPed during 14-day retrieval, and whose activity co-varied with PL and correlated with memory specificity. These findings support a model in which PL ensembles underlying remote memory undergo dynamic changes during the first two weeks after learning, which manifest as increased functional recruitment of cortical targets.",

Challenge participants used machine learning and clustering techniques to predict ALS progression and survival. By developing new approaches, the best performing teams were able to predict disease outcomes better than currently available methods. At the same time, the integration of clustering components across methods led to the emergence of distinct consensus clusters, separating patients into four consistent groups, each with its unique predictors for classification.

    "abstract": "In many applications, inter-sample heterogeneity is crucial to understanding the complex biological processes under study. For example, in genomic analysis of cancers, each patient in a cohort may have a different driver mutation, making it difficult or impossible to identify causal mutations from an averaged view of the entire cohort. Unfortunately, many traditional methods for genomic analysis seek to estimate a single model which is shared by all samples in a population, ignoring this inter-sample heterogeneity entirely. In order to better understand patient heterogeneity, it is necessary to develop practical, personalized statistical models. To uncover this inter-sample heterogeneity, we propose a novel regularizer for achieving patient-specific personalized estimation. This regularizer operates by learning two latent distance metrics - one between personalized parameters and one between clinical covariates - and attempting to match the induced distances as closely as possible. Crucially, we do not assume these distance metrics are already known. Instead, we allow the data to dictate the structure of these latent distance metrics. Finally, we apply our method to learn patient-specific, interpretable models for a pan-cancer gene expression dataset containing samples from more than 30 distinct cancer types and find strong evidence of personalization effects between cancer types as well as between individuals. Our analysis uncovers sample-specific aberrations that are overlooked by population level methods, suggesting a promising new path for precision analysis of complex diseases such as cancer.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes receive and degrade cargo from endocytosis, phagocytosis and autophagy. They also play an important role in sensing and instructing cells on their metabolic state. The lipid kinase PIKfyve generates phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate to modulate lysosome function. PIKfyve inhibition leads to impaired degradative capacity, ion dysregulation, abated autophagic flux, and a massive enlargement of lysosomes. Collectively, this leads to various physiological defects including embryonic lethality, neurodegeneration and overt inflammation. While being the most dramatic phenotype, the reasons for lysosome enlargement remain unclear. Here, we examined whether biosynthesis and/or fusion-fission dynamics contribute to swelling. First, we show that PIKfyve inhibition activates TFEB, TFE3 and MITF enhancing lysosome gene expression. However, this did not augment lysosomal protein levels during acute PIKfyve inhibition and deletion of TFEB and/or related proteins did not impair lysosome swelling. Instead, PIKfyve inhibition led to fewer but enlarged lysosomes, suggesting that an imbalance favouring lysosome fusion over fission causes lysosome enlargement. Indeed, conditions that abated fusion curtailed lysosome swelling in PIKfyve-inhibited cells.\\n\\nSummary statementPIKfyve inhibition causes lysosomes to coalesce, resulting in fewer, enlarged lysosomes.

Yet, whether the ducts are capable of regenerating after genotoxic injury, or if damage to ductal cells induces lineage plasticity, as has been reported in other organ systems, remains unknown. Here, we show that two ductal progenitor populations marked by KRT14 and KIT exclusively maintain non-overlapping ductal compartments after radiation exposure but do so through distinct cellular mechanisms. KRT14+ progenitor cells are fast cycling cells that proliferate in response to radiation-induced damage in a sustained manner and divide asymmetrically to produce differentiated cells of the larger granulated ducts. Conversely, KIT+ cells are long lived progenitors for the intercalated ducts that undergo few cell divisions either during homeostasis or after gamma radiation, thus maintaining ductal architecture in the near absence of cell turnover. Together, these data illustrate the regenerative capacity of the salivary ducts and highlight the heterogeneity in the damage responses used by salivary progenitor cells to maintain tissue architecture.\\n\\nSummary StatementThe salivary gland ductal network is maintained during homeostasis and after genotoxic injury by diverse progenitors that respond differentially to radiation induced damage.",

While all professional phagocytes use chemotaxis to locate bacteria, little is known about whether they can discriminate among them, responding preferentially to some bacteria over others. Here we examine the chemotaxis of the soil amoeba and professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum in assays where amoebae were presented with a paired choice of different bacteria. We observed variation in the extent to which they pursue different types of bacteria and preferential migration towards Gram-negative over Gram-positive bacteria. Response profiles were similar for amoebae isolated from different geographic locations, suggesting that chemotaxis preferences are not strongly influenced by any local variation in the bacterial community. Because cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a known chemoattractant for D. discoideum, we tested whether it mediated the preference for Gram-negative bacteria. Chemotaxis was diminished in response to a cAMP-deficient strain of Escherichia coli and enhanced in response to an E. coli strain that overproduces cAMP. We conclude that D. discoideum discriminates at a distance among bacteria and that discrimination is mediated in part by sensing of cAMP. Preferential sensing and response to different bacteria may help to explain why some amoeba-bacterial associations are more prevalent in nature than others.",

    "abstract": "Several plant lineages have evolved adaptations that allow survival in extreme and harsh environments including many within the plant clade Portulacineae (Caryophyllales) such as the Cactaceae, Didiereaceae of Madagascar, and high altitude Montiaceae. Here, using newly generated transcriptomic data, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Portulacineae and examine potential correlates between molecular evolution within this clade and adaptation to harsh environments. Our phylogenetic results were largely congruent with previous analyses, but we identified several early diverging nodes characterized by extensive gene tree conflict. For particularly contentious nodes, we presented detailed information about the phylogenetic signal for alternative relationships. We also analyzed the frequency of gene duplications, confirmed previously identified whole genome duplications (WGD), and identified a previously unidentified WGD event within the Didiereaceae. We found that the WGD events were typically associated with shifts in climatic niche and did not find a direct association with WGDs and diversification rate shifts. Diversification shifts occurred within the Portulacaceae, Cactaceae, and Anacampserotaceae, and while these did not experience WGDs, the Cactaceae experienced extensive gene duplications. We examined gene family expansion and molecular evolutionary patterns with a focus on genes associated with environmental stress responses and found evidence for significant gene family expansion in genes with stress adaptation and clades found in extreme environments. These results provide important directions for further and deeper examination of the potential links between molecular evolutionary patterns and adaptation to harsh environments.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how environmental variation drives phenotypic diversification within species is a major objective in evolutionary biology. The seaweed fly Coelopa frigida provides an excellent model for the study of genetically driven phenotypes because it carries an /{beta} inversion polymorphism that affects body size. Coelopa frigida inhabits highly variable beds of decomposing seaweed on the coast in Scandinavia thus providing a suitable test ground to investigate the genetic effects of substrate on both the frequency of the inversion (directional selection) and on the phenotype (genotype x environment effects). Here we use a reciprocal transplant experiment to test the effect of the /{beta} inversion on body size traits and development time across four suitable natural breeding substrates from the clinal distribution. We show that while development time is unaffected by GxE effects, both the frequency of the inversion and the relative phenotypic effects of the inversion on body size differ between population x substrate combinations. This indicates that the environment modulates the fitness as well as the phenotypic effects of the inversion karyotypes. It further suggests that the inversion may have accumulated qualitatively different mutations in different populations that interact with the environment. Together our results are consistent with the idea that the inversion in C. frigida likely evolves via a combination of local mutation, GxE effects, and differential fitness of inversion karyotypes in heterogeneous environments.",

We sought to clarify associations of genetic inhibition of CETP on detailed lipoproteins.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe used variants associated with CETP (rs247617) and HMGCR (rs12916) expression in 62,400 Europeans with detailed lipoprotein profiling from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Genetic associations were scaled to 10% lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Associations of lipoprotein measures with risk of incident CHD in three population-based cohorts (770 cases) were examined.\\n\\nCETP and HMGCR had near-identical associations with LDL-cholesterol concentration estimated by Friedewald-equation. HMGCR had a relatively consistent effect on cholesterol concentrations across all apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. CETP had stronger effects on remnant and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but no effect on cholesterol concentrations in LDL defined by particle size (diameter 18-26 nm) (-0.02SD 95%CI: -0.10, 0.05 for CETP versus -0.24SD, 95%CI -0.30, -0.18 for HMGCR). CETP had profound effects on lipid compositions of lipoproteins, with strong reductions in the triglyceride content of all highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) particles. These alterations in triglyceride composition within HDL subclasses were observationally associated with risk of CHD, independently of total cholesterol and triglycerides (strongest HR per 1-SD higher triglyceride composition in very-large HDL 1.35; 95%CI: 1.18, 1.54).\\n\\nConclusionCETP inhibition does not affect size-specific LDL cholesterol but may lower CHD risk by lowering cholesterol in other apolipoprotein-B containing lipoproteins and lowering triglyceride content of HDL particles. Conventional composite lipid assays may mask heterogeneous effects of lipid-altering therapies.",

We describe a novel approach to data integration to generate an mRNA expression atlas for the chicken spanning major tissue types and developmental stages, using a diverse range of publicly-archived RNA-seq datasets and new data derived from immune cells and tissues.\\n\\nResultsRandomly down-sampling RNA-seq datasets to a common depth and quantifying expression against a reference transcriptome using the mRNA quantitation tool Kallisto ensured that disparate datasets explored comparable transcriptomic space. The network analysis tool Miru was used to extract clusters of co-expressed genes from the resulting expression atlas, many of which were tissue or cell-type restricted, contained transcription factors that have previously been implicated in their regulation, or were otherwise associated with biological processes, such as the cell cycle. The atlas provides a resource for the functional annotation of genes that currently have only a locus ID. We cross-referenced the RNA-seq atlas to a publicly available embryonic Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) dataset to infer the developmental time course of organ systems, and to identify a signature of the expansion of tissue macrophage populations during development.\\n\\nConclusionExpression profiles obtained from public RNA-seq datasets - despite being generated by different laboratories using different methodologies - can be made comparable to each other. This meta-analytic approach to RNA-seq can be extended with new datasets from novel tissues, and is applicable to any species.",

    "abstract": "Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) fundamentally limit the utility of genetic information in a clinical setting. The challenge of VUS is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene integral to DNA repair and genomic stability. Germline BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) variants predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Data sharing attenuates this problem but it is unlikely to solve it, as most newly observed variants are exceedingly rare. In lieu of genetic evidence, experimental approaches can be used to functionally characterize VUS. However, to date, functional studies of BRCA1 VUS have been conducted in a post hoc, piecemeal fashion. Here we employ saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Our assay measures cellular fitness in a haploid human cell line whose survival is dependent on intact BRCA1 function. The resulting function scores for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Sequence-function maps enhanced by parallel measurements of variant effects on mRNA levels reveal mechanisms by which loss-of-function SNVs arise. Hundreds of missense SNVs critical for protein function are identified, as well as dozens of exonic and intronic SNVs that compromise BRCA1 function by disrupting splicing or transcript stability. We predict that these function scores will be directly useful for the clinical interpretation of cancer risk based on BRCA1 sequencing. Furthermore, we propose that this paradigm can be extended to overcome the challenge of VUS in other genes in which genetic variation is clinically actionable.",

MAC strains show a wide genetic variability, and there is growing evidence suggesting that genetic differences may contribute to a varied immune response that may impact on the infection outcome. The current study aimed to characterize the genomic changes within Mav isolates collected from single patients over time and test the host immune responses to these clinical isolates. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing was performed on 40 MAC isolates isolated from 15 patients at the Department of Medical Microbiology at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim, Norway. Patients (4, 9 and 13) who contributed more than two isolates were selected for further analysis. These isolates exhibited extensive sequence variation in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), suggesting that Mav accumulates mutations at high rates during persistent infections. Infection of murine macrophages and mice with sequential isolates from patients showed a tendency towards increased persistence and down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines by host-adapted Mav strains. The study revealed rapid genetic evolution of Mav in chronically infected patients accompanied with change in virulence properties of the sequential mycobacterial isolates.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMAC are a group of opportunistic pathogens, consisting of Mav and M. intracellulare species. Mav is found ubiquitously in the environment. In Mav infected individuals, Mav has been known to persist for long periods of time, and anti-mycobacterial drugs are unable to effectively clear the infection. The continued presence of the bacteria, could be attributed to either a single persistent strain or reinfection with the same or different strain. We examined sequential isolates collected over time from Mav infected individuals and observed that most patients carried the same strain overtime and were not re infected. We observed high rates of mutation within the serial isolates, accompanied with changes in virulence properties. In the light of increase in incidence of MAC related infections, this study highlights the possibility that host adapted Mav undergo genetic modifications to cope with the host environment and thereby persisting longer.",

    "abstract": "Using personalized peptide vaccines (PPVs) to target tumor-specific non-self antigens (neoantigens) is a promising approach to cancer treatment. However, the development of PPVs is hindered by the challenge of identifying tumor-specific neoantigens, in part because current in silico methods for identifying such neoantigens have limited effectiveness. Here we report the results of molecular dynamics simulations of 12 oligopeptides bound with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA), revealing a previously unrecognized association between the inability of an oligopeptide to elicit a T-cell response and the contraction of the peptide-binding groove upon binding of the oligopeptide to the HLA. Our conformational analysis showed that this association was due to incompatibility at the interface between the contracted groove and its {beta}-T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). This structural demonstration that having the capability to bind HLA does not guarantee immunogenicity prompted us to develop an atom-based method [Formula] to predict immunogenicity through using the structure and energy of a peptide*HLA complex to assess the propensity of the complex for forming a ternary complex with its TCR. In predicting the immunogenicities of the 12 oligopeptides, [Formula] achieved a 100% success rate compared with success rates of 25-50% for 11 publicly available residue-based methods including NetMHC-4.0. While further validation and refinements of [Formula] are required, our results suggest a need to develop in silico methods that assess peptide characteristics beyond their capability to form stable binary complexes with HLAs to help remove hurdles in using the patient tumor DNA information to develop PPVs for personalized cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The stability of the Escherichia coli populations in the human gastrointestinal tract are not fully appreciated, and represent a significant knowledge gap regarding gastrointestinal community structure, as well as resistance to incoming pathogenic bacterial species and antibiotic treatment. The current study examines the genomic content of 240 Escherichia coli isolates from children 2 to 35 months old in Tanzania. The E. coli strains were isolated from three time points spanning a six month time period, with or without antibiotic treatment. The resulting isolates were sequenced, and the genomes compared. The findings in this study highlight the transient nature of E. coli strains in the gastrointestinal tract of children, as during a six-month interval, no one individual contained phylogenomically related isolates at all three time points. While the majority of the isolates at any one time point were phylogenomically similar, most individuals did not contain phylogenomically similar isolates at more than two time points. Examination of global genome content, canonical E. coli virulence factors, multilocus sequence type, serotype, and antimicrobial resistance genes identified diversity even among phylogenomically similar strains. There was no apparent increase in the antimicrobial resistance gene content after antibiotic treatment. The examination of the E. coli from longitudinal samples from multiple children in Tanzania provides insight into the genomic diversity and population variability of resident E. coli within the rapidly changing environment of the gastrointestinal tract.\\n\\nImportanceThis study increases the number of resident Escherichia coli genome sequences, and explores E. coli diversity through longitudinal sampling. We investigate the genomes of E. coli isolated from human gastrointestinal tracts as part of an antibiotic treatment program among rural Tanzanian children. Phylogenomics demonstrates that resident E. coli are diverse, even within a single host. Though the E. coli isolates of the gastrointestinal community tend to be phylogenomically similar at a given time, they differed across the interrogated time points, demonstrating the variability of the members of the E. coli community. Exposure to antibiotic treatment did not have an apparent impact on the E. coli community or the presence of resistance and virulence genes within E. coli genomes.

    "abstract": "That periodicity in the biting activity of mosquito vectors explains why malaria parasites have evolved rhythms in cycles of asexual replication in the hosts blood was proposed almost 50 years ago. Yet, tests of this hypothesis have proved inconclusive. Using the rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi, we examine rhythms in the density and infectivity of transmission forms (gametocytes) in the hosts blood, parasite development inside mosquitoes, and onwards transmission.Moreover, we control for the confounding effects of rhythms in mosquito susceptibility. We reveal that at night, gametocytes are twice as infective to mosquitoes, despite being less numerous in the blood. This enhanced infectiousness at night interacts with mosquito rhythms to increase sporozoite burdens by almost four-fold when mosquitoes feed during their day. Thus, daytime blood-feeding (e.g. driven by the use of bed nets) may render gametocytes less infective, but this is compensated for by the greater susceptibility of mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "The earliest step in DNA replication is origin licensing which is the DNA loading of MCM helicase complexes. The Cdt1 protein is essential for MCM loading during G1 phase of the cell cycle, yet the mechanism of Cdt1 function is still incompletely understood. We examined a collection of rare Cdt1 variants that cause a form of primordial dwarfism (Meier-Gorlin syndrome) plus one hypomorphic Drosophila allele to shed light on Cdt1 function. Three hypomorphic variants load MCM less efficiently than WT Cdt1, and their lower activity correlates with impaired MCM binding. A structural homology model of the human Cdt1-MCM complex position the altered Cdt1 residues at two distinct interfaces rather than the previously described single MCM interaction domain. Surprisingly, one dwarfism allele (Cdt1-A66T) is more active than WT Cdt1. This hypermorphic variant binds both Cyclin A and SCFSkp2 poorly relative to WT Cdt1. Detailed quantitative live cell imaging analysis demonstrated no change in stability of this variant however. Instead, we propose that Cyclin A/CDK inhibits Cdt1 licensing function independently of the creation of the SCFSkp2 phosphodegron. Together, these findings identify key Cdt1 interactions required for both efficient origin licensing and tight Cdt1 regulation to ensure normal cell proliferation and genome stability.",

Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse, and were grouped by developmental anatomical units, and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission and membrane conductance. We discovered several distinct, regionally restricted, astrocytes types, which obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity, followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system, and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic pesticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid are the most important insecticides used for plant protection worldwide. In recent decades concerns have been raised about side effects on non-target insect species, including altered foraging behaviour and navigation. Although pollinators rely on visual cues to forage and navigate their environment, the effect of neonicotinoids on visual processing have been largely overlooked. Here we describe a modified electrophysiological setup that allowed recordings of visually evoked responses while perfusing the brain in vivo. Long-lasting recordings from wide-field motion sensitive neurons of the hoverfly pollinator, Eristalis tenax, revealed that sub-lethal exposure to imidacloprid alters their physiological response to motion stimuli. We observed substantially increased spontaneous firing rate, reduced contrast sensitivity and weaker directional tuning to wide-field moving stimuli. This approach reveals sub-lethal effects of imidacloprid in the visual motion detecting system of an important pollinator with likely implications for flight control, hovering and routing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundZika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne disease discovered in 1947, which did not cause public concern for the next 68 years. However, when ZIKV emerged in Brazil 2015 the attention increased rapidly. The announcement by Brazilian authorities, that ZIKV infection was associated with severe congenital disease e.g. microcephaly, surged public interest. Because of the accumulation of evidence that showed the magnitude of the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern February 1, 2016.\\n\\nResultsDuring 2015-2017, we witnessed one of the most active and cooperated research responses against an emerging disease. To investigate the impact of ZIKV research during those years we decided to perform a bibliometric analysis of ZIKV research. The search for research articles on ZIKV was performed by bibliometric analysis from the scientific databases PubMed and Scopus. We found that the number of ZIKV related publications increased 38-41 times in 2016-2017 compared to 2015. During the three years there was a temporal shift in ZIKV research trends, from reports of ZIKV case studies and diagnostic methods, to development of ZIKV prevention and treatment. In addition, the number of countries involved in ZIKV research increased from 25 in 2015 to 111 in 2016 and 139 in the following year, showing that ZIKV research became global during three years.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results from our study highlighted the importance of gathering public interest to global health issues, and how it can act as a powerful catalyzer to trigger the research field. However, despite the progress in ZIKV research, many questions remain to be addressed to accelerate the development of effective ZIKV countermeasures. Nevertheless, as long as we remember the importance of support and collaboration that we have experienced during the multidisciplinary effort against the current ZIKV outbreak, we will have an idea on how to handle the next inevitable and yet unknown infectious disease threat.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMechanistic kinetic models usually contain unknown parameters, which need to be estimated by optimizing the fit of the model to experimental data. This task can be computationally challenging due to the presence of local optima and ill-conditioning. While a variety of optimization methods have been suggested to surmount these issues, it is not obvious how to choose the best one for a given problem a priori, since many factors can influence their performance. A systematic comparison of methods that are suited to parameter estimation problems of sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of optimization variables is currently missing, and smaller studies indeed provided contradictory findings.\\n\\nResultsHere, we use a collection of benchmark problems to evaluate the performance of two families of optimization methods: (i) a multi-start of deterministic local searches; and (ii) a hybrid metaheuristic combining stochastic global search with deterministic local searches. A fair comparison is ensured through a collaborative evaluation, involving researchers applying each method on a daily basis, and a consideration of multiple performance metrics capturing the trade-off between computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that, thanks to recent advances in the calculation of parametric sensitivities, a multi-start of gradient-based local methods is often a successful strategy, but a better performance can be obtained with a hybrid metaheuristic. The best performer is a combination of a global scatter search metaheuristic with an interior point local method, provided with gradients estimated with adjoint-based sensitivities. We provide an implementation of this novel method in an open-source software toolbox to render it available to the scientific community.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe code to reproduce the results is available at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1160343\\n\\nContactjan.hasenauer@helmholtz-muenchen.de, julio@iim.csic.es",

    "abstract": "Metabolic networks comprise thousands of enzymatic reactions functioning in a controlled manner and have been shaped by natural selection. Thanks to the genome data, the footprints of adaptive (positive) selection are detectable, and the strength of purifying selection can be measured. This has made possible to know where, in the metabolic network, adaptive selection has acted and where purifying selection is more or less strong and efficient. We have carried out a comprehensive molecular evolutionary study of all the genes involved in the human metabolism. We investigated the type and strength of the selective pressures that acted on the enzyme-coding genes belonging to metabolic pathways during the divergence of primates and rodents. Then, we related those selective pressures to the functional and topological characteristics of the pathways. We have used DNA sequences of all enzymes (956) of the metabolic pathways comprised in the HumanCyc database, using genome data for humans and five other mammalian species.\\n\\nWe have found that the evolution of metabolic genes is primarily constrained by the layer of the metabolism in which the genes participate: while genes encoding enzymes of the inner core of metabolism are much conserved, those encoding enzymes participating in the outer layer, mediating the interaction with the environment, are evolutionarily less constrained and more plastic, having experienced faster functional evolution. Genes that have been targeted by adaptive selection are endowed by higher out-degree centralities than non-adaptive genes, while genes with high in-degree centralities are under stronger purifying selection. When the position along the pathway is considered, a funnel-like distribution of the strength of the purifying selection is found. Genes at bottom positions are highly preserved by purifying selection, whereas genes at top positions, catalyzing the first steps, are open to evolutionary changes.\\n\\nThese results show how functional and topological characteristics of metabolic pathways contribute to shape the patterns of evolutionary pressures driven by natural selection and how pathway network structure matters in the evolutionary process that shapes the evolution of the system.",

Such essential property is being studied in a wide diversity of traits in many organisms but it is difficult to compare the results obtained on the robustness of different traits with each other given the differences that exist between traits in the way they are measured, in their genetic architecture and development. In this study, we assessed robustness of bristle number to incoming genetic and environmental variation for eight bristle types in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, allowing for a straightforward comparison of the robustness observed between bristle types. We measured the response of bristle number mean and variance to changes in temperature and in the number of copies of two genes (scute and miR-9a) known to be involved in bristle development. Many combinations between the three factors were tested, thus allowing to test for the effect of each factor in different contexts for the two other factors - to which we refer herein as different backgrounds. We have found different responses between bristle types, suggesting that they present different levels of robustness to the factors tested. In addition, we have found that temperature and miR-9a affect more generally the variance of the traits rather than their means, thus fulfilling a criteria usually admitted to identify robustness factors.",

In addition to their sensitivity and high-throughput capacity, absolute molecule counting based on unique molecular identifier (UMI) has high potential to increase biomarker detection accuracy even further through the reduction of systematic technical biases. Here, we present TAC-seq, a simple and cost-effective targeted allele counting by sequencing method that uses UMIs to estimate the original molecule counts of different biomarker types like mRNAs, microRNAs and cell-free DNA. We applied TAC-seq in three different applications and compared the results with standard sequencing technologies. RNA samples extracted from human endometrial biopsies were analyzed using previously described 57 mRNA-based receptivity biomarkers and 49 selected microRNAs at different expression levels. Cell-free DNA aneuploidy testing was based on cell line (47,XX,+21) genomic DNA. TAC-seq mRNA biomarker profiling showed identical clustering results to full transcriptome RNA sequencing, and microRNA detection demonstrated significant reduction in amplification bias, allowing to determine minor expression changes between different samples that remained undetermined by standard sequencing. The mimicking experiment for cell-free DNA fetal aneuploidy analysis showed that TAC-seq can be applied to count highly fragmented DNA, detecting significant (p=4.8x10-11) excess of molecules in case of trisomy 21. Based on three proof-of-principle applications we show that TAC-seq is a highly accurate and universal method for targeted nucleic acid biomarker profiling.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the worlds most common sexually transmitted infection, and is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. Previous studies of global gene expression changes induced by HPV infection have focused on the cancerous stages of infection, and therefore, not much is known about global gene expression changes at early pre-neoplastic stages of infection. We show for the first time, global gene expression changes of early stage HPV16 infection in cervical tissue using 3-dimensional organotypic raft cultures that produce high levels of progeny virions.\\n\\ncDNA microarray analysis showed that a total of 594 genes were upregulated and 651 genes were downregulated at least 1.5-fold with HPV16 infection. Gene ontology analysis showed that biological processes including cell cycle progression and DNA metabolism were upregulated, while skin development, immune response, and cell death were downregulated with HPV16 infection in cervical keratinocytes. Individual genes were selected for validation at the transcriptional and translational levels including UBC, which was central to the protein association network of immune response genes, and top downregulated genes RPTN, SERPINB4, KRT23, and KLK8. In particular, KLK8 and SERPINB4 have shown to be upregulated in cancer, which contrasts our results.\\n\\nOrganotypic raft cultures that allow full progression of the HPV life-cycle have allowed us to identify novel gene modulations and potential therapeutic targets of early stage HPV infection in cervical tissue. Additionally, our results suggest that early stage productive infection and cancerous stages of infection are distinct disease states expressing different transcriptomes.\\n\\nImportancePersistent HPV infection is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. Transition from precancerous to cancerous stages of HPV infection is marked by a significant reduction in virus production. Most global gene expression studies of HPV infection have focused on the cancerous stages. Therefore, little is known about global gene expression changes at precancerous stages. For the first time, we measured global gene expression changes at precancerous stages of HPV16 infection in human cervical tissue producing high levels of virus. We identified a group of genes that are typically overexpressed in cancerous stages to be significantly downregulated at the precancerous stage. Moreover, we identified significantly modulated genes that have not yet been studied in the context of HPV infection. Studying the role of these genes in HPV infection will help us understand what drives the transition from precancerous to cancerous stages, and may lead to development of new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Inference methods are widely used to recover effective models from observed data. However, few studies attempted to investigate the dynamics of inferred models in neuroscience, and none, to our knowledge, at the network level. We introduce a principled modification of a widely used generalized linear model (GLM), and learn its structural and dynamic parameters from in-vitro spike data. The spontaneous activity of the new model captures prominent features of the non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network, where the reference GLM largely fails, and also reflects fine-grained spatio-temporal dynamical features. Two ingredients were key for success. The first is a saturating transfer function: beyond its biological plausibility, it limits the neurons information transfer, improving robustness against endogenous and external noise. The second is a super-Poisson spikes generative mechanism; it accounts for the undersampling of the network, and allows the model neuron to flexibly incorporate the observed activity fluctuations.",

Genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 gene frequently reveals a missense variant for which the impact on the molecular function of the BRCA1 protein is unknown. Functional BRCA1 is required for homology directed repair (HDR) of double-strand DNA breaks, a key activity for maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression. Here we describe a multiplex HDR reporter assay to simultaneously measure the effect of hundreds of variants of BRCA1 on its role in DNA repair. Using this assay, we measured the effects of ~1,700 amino acid substitutions in the first 302 residues of BRCA1. Benchmarking these results against variants with known effects, we demonstrate accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign variants. We anticipate that this assay can be used to functionally characterize BRCA1 missense variants at scale, even before the variants are observed in results from genetic testing.",

Between species, the number of intact receptors can vary by orders of magnitude. However, the evolutionary processes behind variation in receptor number, and also its link to fitness-related behaviors are not well understood. From vomeronasal transcriptomes, we discovered the first evidence of intact vomeronasal type-1 receptor (V1r) genes in bats, and we tested whether putatively functional bat receptors were orthologous to those of related taxa, or whether bats have evolved novel receptors. We found that V1rs in bats and show high levels of orthology to those of their relatives, as opposed to lineage-specific duplications, and receptors are under purifying selection. Despite widespread vomeronasal organ loss in bats, V1r copies have been retained for >65 million years. The highly conserved nature of bat V1rs challenges our current understanding of mammalian V1r function and suggest roles other than conspecific recognition or mating initiation in social behavior.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-sensitive membrane proteins are united by the ability to transform changes in the membrane potential into mechanical work. They are responsible for a spectrum of key physiological processes in living organisms, including electric signaling and progression along the cell cycle. While the voltage-sensing mechanism has been well characterized for some membrane proteins such as voltage-gated ion channels, for others even the location of the voltage-sensing elements remains unknown. The detection of these elements using experimental techniques is complicated due to the large diversity of membrane proteins. Here, we suggest a computational approach to predict voltage-sensing elements in any membrane protein independent of structure or function. It relies on the estimation of the capacity of a protein to respond to changes in the membrane potential. We first show how this property correlates well with voltage sensitivity by applying our approach to a set of membrane proteins including voltage-sensitive and voltage-insensitive ones. We further show that it correctly identifies true voltage-sensitive residues in the voltage sensor domain of voltage-gated ion channels. Finally, we investigate six membrane proteins for which the voltage-sensing elements have not yet been characterized and identify residues and ions potentially involved in the response to voltage. The suggested approach is fast and simple and allows for characterization of voltage sensitivity that goes beyond mere identification of charges. We anticipate that its application prior to mutagenesis experiments will allow for significant reduction of the number of potential voltage-sensitive elements to be tested.",

    "abstract": "AimThe latitudinal diversity gradient is the dominant pattern of life on Earth, but a consensus understanding of its origins has remained elusive. The analysis of recently diverged, hyper-rich invertebrate groups provides an opportunity to investigate latitudinal patterns with the statistical power of large trees while minimizing potentially confounding variation in ecology and history. Here, we synthesize global phylogenetic and macroecological data on a hyperdiverse (>1100 species) ant radiation, Pheidole, and evaluate the roles of three general explanations for the latitudinal gradient: variation in diversification rate, tropical conservatism, and ecological regulation.\\n\\nLocationGlobal.\\n\\nTime PeriodThe past 35 million years.\\n\\nMajor taxa studiedThe hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole Westwood.\\n\\nMethodsWe assembled geographic data for 1499 species and morphospecies, and inferred a dated phylogeny of Pheidole of 449 species, including 150 species newly sequenced for this study. We tested correlations between diversification rate and latitude with BAMM, HiSSE, GeoSSE, and FiSSE, and examined patterns of diversification as Pheidole spread around the globe.\\n\\nResultsWe found that Pheidole diversification occurred in series of bursts when new continents were colonized, followed by a slowdown in each region. There was no evidence of systematic variation of net diversification rates with latitude across any of the methods. Additionally, we found latitudinal affinity is moderately conserved with a Neotropical ancestor and phylogenetic inertia alone is sufficient to produce the gradient pattern.\\n\\nMain ConclusionsOverall our results are consistent with tropical conservatism explaining the diversity gradient, while providing no evidence that diversification rate varies systematically with latitude. There is evidence of ecological regulation on continental scales through the pattern of diversification after colonization. These results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the diversity gradient, while contributing toward a much-needed invertebrate perspective on global biodiversity dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Preservation of the soil resources stability is of paramount importance for the ecosystem, particularly in the current era of environmental change, which presents a severe pollution burden (e.g. by heavy metals) to soil ecosystems and its fauna. Gut microbiomes are becoming recognized as important players in organism health, with comprehension of their perturbations in the polluted environment offering new insights into the nature and extent of heavy metal effects on the health of soil biota. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the effect of environmentally relevant heavy metal concentrations of cadmium (Cd) on the earthworm gut microbiota. Cd exposure led to perturbations of several heavy metal resistant taxa as well as taxa able to bind heavy metals, revealing the potential of the earthworm-microbiota system in overcoming humancaused heavy metal pollution. An  indicator species analysis linked bacterial genera Paenibacillus and Flavobacterium, and members of the order Actinomycetales with Cd treatment, suggesting the possible use of these bacterial taxa as biomarkers of exposure for Cd stressed soils. The results of this study will be essential to understanding of the soil fauna health, under anthropogenic disturbance, and will have implications for environmental monitoring and protection of soil resources.\\n\\nImportanceSoil heavy metal pollution presents a severe burden for soil invertebrates and can have impact on their health, which in turn reflects on the health of the entire ecosystem. Gut microbiome is recognized as a central driver of the host health and its shifts can have severe consequences for the host. In this study we investigated the impact of cadmium (Cd) on earthworm gut microbiota, in a controlled experiment using cutting edge next generation sequencing and state of the art bioinformatics tools. The significance of this study is in identifying the gut bacterial taxa which are indicators for Cd treatment and are potential biomarkers of exposure to Cd. Therefore, this study contributes to develop efficient measures to qualify environmental pollution and to protect fragile soil resources and ultimately human health.",

We assessed the ability of two benchtop high-throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms, to identify a large taxonomic array of food items from domestic cats Felis silvestris catus, including prey and human-related food taxa (pet food and leftovers leaving undetectable solid remains in faeces). Scats from a captive feeding trial (n=41) and from free-ranging individuals (n=326) were collected and analysed using a cytb mini-barcode in independent PCR duplicates on the Ion PGM and the MiSeq platforms. Outputs from MiSeq were more sensitive and reproducible than those from Ion PGM due to a higher sequencing depth and sequence quality on MiSeq. DNA from intact prey taxa was detected more often (82% of the expected occurrences) than DNA from pet food (54%) and raw fish and meat (31%). We assumed that this variability was linked to different degree of DNA degradation: The Ion PGM detected significantly less human-linked food, birds, field voles, murids and shrews in the field-collected samples than the MiSeq platform. Pooling the replicates from both platforms and filtering the data allowed identification of at least one food item in 87.4% of the field-collected samples. Our DNA metabarcoding approach identified 29 prey taxa, of which 25 to species level (90% of items) including 9 rodents, 3 insectivores, 12 birds and 1 reptile and 33 human-related food taxa of which 23 were identified to genus level (75% of items). Our results demonstrate that using HTS platforms such as MiSeq, which provide reads of sufficiently high quantity and quality, with sufficient numbers of technical replicates, is a robust and non-invasive approach for further dietary studies on animals foraging on a wide range of food items in anthropogenic landscapes.",

However, recent genetic advances suggest that Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) could allow MDD patients to be stratified for antidepressant response. We used PRS for MDD and PRS for neuroticism as putative predictors of antidepressant response within three treatment cohorts: The Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) cohort, and 2 sub-cohorts from the Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomics Study PRGN-AMPS (total patient number = 783). Results across cohorts were combined via meta-analysis within a random effects model. Overall, PRS for MDD and neuroticism did not significantly predict antidepressant response but there was a consistent direction of effect, whereby greater genetic loading for both MDD (best MDD result, p < 5*10-5 MDD-PRS at 4 weeks, {beta} = -0.019, S.E = 0.008, p = 0.01) and neuroticism (best neuroticism result, p < 0.1 neuroticism-PRS at 8 weeks, {beta} = -0.017, S.E = 0.008, p = 0.03) were associated with less favourable response. We conclude that the PRS approach may offer some promise for treatment stratification in MDD and should now be assessed within larger clinical cohorts.",

Model modifications enable the definition of various perturbations, as well as model reduction, easing the analysis of large models. Another modification enables the study of multi-valued models with tools limited to the Boolean case. Finally, bioLQM provides a framework for the development of novel analysis tools. The current version implements the usual updating modes for model simulation (notably synchronous, asynchronous, and random asynchronous), as well as some static analysis features for the identification of attractors.

Assessments for variant classification now require orthogonal data searches, requiring aggregation of multiple lines of evidence from diverse resources. The burden of evidence for each variant to meet thresholds for pathogenicity or actionability now poses a growing challenge for those seeking to counsel patients and families following germline genetic testing. A computational algorithm that automates, provides uniformity and significantly accelerates this interpretive process is needed. The tool described here, Pathogenicity of Mutation Analyzer (PathoMAN) automates germline genomic variant curation from clinical sequencing based on ACMG guidelines. PathoMAN aggregates multiple tracks of genomic, protein and disease specific information from public sources. We compared expert manually curated variant data from studies on (i) prostate cancer (ii) breast cancer and (iii) ClinVar to assess performance. PathoMAN achieves high concordance (83.1% pathogenic, 75.5% benign) and negligible discordance (0.04% pathogenic, 0.9% benign) when contrasted against expert curation. Some loss of resolution (8.6% pathogenic, 23.64% benign) and gain of resolution (6.6% pathogenic, 1.6% benign) was also observed. We highlight the advantages and weaknesses related to the programmable automation of variant classification. We also propose a new nosology for the five ACMG classes to facilitate more accurate reporting to ClinVar. The proposed refinements will enhance utility of ClinVar to allow further automation in cancer genetics. PathoMAN will reduce the manual workload of domain level experts.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a hybrid method to threshold FMRI group statistical maps derived from voxelwise second-level statistical analyses. The proposed \\\"Equitable Thresholding and Clustering\\\" (ETAC) approach seeks to reduce the dependence of clustering results on arbitrary parameter values by using multiple sub-tests, each equivalent to a standard FMRI clustering analysis, to make decisions about which groups of voxels are potentially significant. The union of these sub-test results decides which voxels are accepted. The approach adjusts the cluster-thresholding parameter of each sub-test in an equitable way, so that the individual false positive rates (FPRs) are balanced across sub-tests to achieve a desired final FPR (e.g., 5%). ETAC utilizes resampling methods to estimate the FPR, and thus does not rely on parametric assumptions about the spatial correlation of FMRI noise. The approach was validated with pseudo-task timings in resting state brain data. Additionally, a task FMRI data collection was used to compare ETACs true positive detection power vs. a standard cluster detection method, demonstrating that ETAC is able to detect true results and control false positives while reducing reliance on arbitrary analysis parameters.",

However, a mathematical model shows that the signaling off-state is robust to increasing amounts of Erk, and Erk activity may even decline with increasing amounts of Erk. This counter-intuitive, bell-shaped response of Erk activity to increasing amounts of Erk arises from the competition of the unmodified and single phosphorylated form of Erk for access to its kinase Mek. This shows that phosphorylation cycles can contain an intrinsic robustness mechanism that protects signaling from aberrant activation e.g. by gene expression noise or kinase overexpression following gene duplication events in diseases like cancer.",

    "abstract": "The loss of imprinting of MEST has been linked to certain types of cancer by promoter switching. However, MEST-mediated regulation of tumorigenicity and metastasis are yet to be understood. Herein, we reported that MEST is a key regulator of IL-6/JAK/STAT3/Twist-1 signal pathway-mediated tumor metastasis. Enhanced MEST expression is significantly associated with pathogenesis of breast cancer patients. Also, MEST induces metastatic potential of breast cancer through induction of the EMT-TFs-mediated EMT program. Moreover, MEST leads to Twist-1 induction by STAT3 activation and subsequently enables the induction of activation of the EMT program via the induction of STAT3 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the c-terminal region of MEST was essential for STAT3 activation via the induction of JAK2/STAT3 complex formation. Finally, MEST significantly increases the breast cancers ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. These observations suggest that MEST is a promising target for intervention to prevent tumor metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder with complex and unclarified etiological factors. Sex differences have been observed in humans but animal models have only focused on male subjects. In this study, we report the establishment of the neurodevelopmental MAM model of schizophrenia in mice and compare the schizotypic-like characteristics and cognitive function in both sexes. Pregnant mice were injected with 26mg/kg(i.p.) of Methylazoxy-methanol acetate (MAM) or saline (5ml/kg) on gestational day (GD) 16 (MAM-16) or 17 (MAM-17). Behavioral, histological and electrophysiological and mass spectrometry-based comparative proteomic techniques were employed to assess the schizotypic-like characteristics and cognitive function of adult male and female offspring (MAM- or saline-treated). Female MAM-16, but not MAM-17 treated mice exhibited enhanced hyperlocomotion after acute administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, compared to saline treated mice. Male MAM-16, but not MAM-17 treated mice showed decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex. Both male and female MAM-16 and MAM-17 treated mice exhibited reduced hippocampal (HPC) size and thinning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but only male MAM-16 treated mice showed decreased parvalbumin expression in HPC and PFC. Similarly, both male and female MAM-16 treated mice displayed impaired contextual fear memory, while only male MAM-16 treated mice exhibited deficits in the delayed alternation task. The neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie these cognitive functions were further investigated. Both male and female MAM-16 treated mice had significantly reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the HPC CA1 synapses, while only male MAM-16 treated mice exhibited decreased LTP in the PFC. Proteomic analyses of PFC lysates further showed significant MAM- and sex-dependent differences in regulation of protein expression. Our results demonstrate that while both male and female mice, prenatally exposed to MAM on GD16, display several core schizophrenia-like deficits and impairments in the hippocampus, only male MAM-treated mice have PFC-dependent cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "The ability to use temporal relationships between cross-modal cues facilitates perception and behavior. Previously we observed that temporally correlated changes in the size of a visual stimulus and the intensity in an auditory stimulus influenced the ability of listeners to perform an auditory selective attention task (Maddox et al., 2015). In this task participants detected timbral changes in a target sound while ignoring those in a simultaneously presented masker. When the visual stimulus was temporally coherent with the target sound, performance was significantly better than when it was temporally coherent with the masker sound, despite the visual stimulus conveying no task-relevant information. Here, we trained observers to detect audiovisual temporal coherence and asked whether this improved their ability to benefit from visual cues during the auditory selective attention task. We observed these listeners improved performance in the auditory selective attention task and changed the way in which they benefited from a visual stimulus: after training performance was better when the visual stimulus was temporally coherent with either the target or the masker stream, relative to the condition in which the visual stimulus was coherent with neither auditory stream. A second group which trained to discriminate modulation rate differences between temporally coherent audiovisual streams improved task performance, but did not change the way in which they used visual information. A control group did not change their performance between pretest and post-test. These results provide insights into how crossmodal experience may optimize multisensory integration.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of learning difficulties largely comes from children with specific diagnoses or individuals selected from community/clinical samples according to strict inclusion criteria. Applying strict exclusionary criteria overemphasizes within-group homogeneity and between-group differences, and fails to capture comorbidity. Here we identify cognitive profiles in a large heterogeneous sample of struggling learners, using unsupervised machine learning in the form of an artificial neural network. Children were referred to the Centre for Attention Learning and Memory (CALM) by health and education professionals, irrespective of diagnosis or comorbidity, for problems in attention, memory, language, or poor school progress (n=530). Children completed a battery of cognitive and learning assessments, underwent a structural MRI scan, and their parents completed behaviour questionnaires. Within the network, we could identify four groups of children: i) children with broad cognitive difficulties, and severe reading, spelling and maths problems; ii) children with age-typical cognitive abilities and learning profiles; iii) children with working memory problems; and iv) children with phonological difficulties. Despite their contrasting cognitive profiles, the learning profiles for the latter two groups did not differ: both were around 1 SD below age-expected levels on all learning measures. Importantly a childs cognitive profile was not predicted by diagnosis or referral reason. We also constructed whole-brain structural connectomes for children from these four groupings (n=184), alongside an additional group of typically developing children (n=36), and identified distinct patterns of brain organisation for each group. This study represents a novel move towards identifying data-driven neurocognitive dimensions underlying learning-related difficulties in a representative sample of poor learners.\\n\\nAuthor NoteThe Centre for Attention Learning and Memory (CALM) research clinic is based at and supported by funding from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge.

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecium though commensals in human gut, few strains provide beneficial effect to humans as probiotics, few are responsible for nosocomial infection and few as non-pathogens. Comparative genomics of E. faecium will help to reveal the genomic differences responsible for the said properties. In this study, we compared E. faecium strain 17OM39 with a marketed probiotic, non-pathogenic non-probiotic (NPNP) and pathogenic strains. The core genome analysis revealed, 17OM39 was closely related with marketed probiotic strain T110. Strain 17OM39 was found to be devoid of known vancomycin, tetracycline resistance genes and functional virulence genes. Moreover, 17OM39 is \\\"less open\\\" due to absence of frequently found transposable elements. Genes imparting beneficial functional properties were observed to be present in marketed probiotic T110 and 17OM39 strains. Additional, genes associated with colonization within gastrointestinal tract were detected across all the strains. Beyond shared genetic features; this study particularly identified genes that are responsible to impart probiotic, non-pathogenic and pathogenic features to the strains of E. faecium. The study also provides insights into the acquired and intrinsic drug resistance genes, which will be helpful for better understanding of the physiology of antibiotic resistance in E. faecium strains. In addition, we could identify genes contributing to the intrinsic ability of 17OM39 E. faecium isolate to be a potential probiotic.\\n\\nThe study has comprehensively characterized genome sequence of each strain to find the genetic variation and understand effects of these on functionality, phenotypic complexity.

    "abstract": "Development of Parkinsons disease is associated with spontaneous self-assembly of -synuclein (-syn). Efforts aimed at understanding this process have produced little clarity and the mechanism remains elusive. We report a novel effect of phospholipid bilayers on the catalysis of -syn aggregation from monomers. We directly visualized -syn aggregation on supported lipid bilayers using time-lapse atomic force microscopy. We discovered that -syn assemble in aggregates on bilayer surfaces even at the nanomolar concentration of monomers in solution. The efficiency of the aggregation process depends on the membrane composition, being highest for a negatively charged bilayer. Furthermore, assembled aggregates can dissociate from the surface, suggesting that on-surface aggregation can be a mechanism by which pathological aggregates are produced. Computational modeling revealed that interaction of -syn with bilayer surface changes the protein conformation and its affinity to assemble into dimers, and these properties depend on the bilayer composition. A model of the membrane-mediated aggregation triggering the assembly of neurotoxic aggregates is proposed.",

Here we tested the flexibility of familiar face recognition with a morphing paradigm where the appearance of a personally familiar face was mixed with the appearance of a stranger. The aim was to assess how categorical boundaries for recognition of identity are affected by familiarity. We found a narrower categorical boundary for the identity of personally familiar faces when they were mixed with unfamiliar identities as compared to the control condition, in which the appearance of two unfamiliar faces were mixed. Our results suggest that familiarity warps the representational geometry of face space, amplifying perceptual distances for small changes in the appearance of familiar faces that are inconsistent with the structural features that define their identities.",

    "abstract": "Vaccinating children with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines disrupts transmission, reducing disease rates in unvaccinated adults. When considering changes in vaccination strategies (e.g., removing doses), it is critical to understand which groups of children contribute most to transmission. We used data from Israel to evaluate how the build-up of vaccine-associated immunity in children was associated with declines in IPD due to vaccine-targeted serotypes in unimmunized adults. Data on vaccine uptake and prevalence of colonization with PCV-targeted serotypes were obtained from a unique study conducted among children visiting an emergency department in southern Israel and from surveys of colonization from central Israel. Data on invasive pneumococcal disease in adults were obtained from a nationwide surveillance study. We compared the trajectory of decline of IPD due to PCV-targeted serotypes in adults with the trajectory of decline of colonization prevalence and trajectory of increase in vaccine-derived protection against pneumococcal carriage among different age groupings of children. The declines in IPD in adults were most closely associated with the declines in colonization and increased vaccination coverage in children in the range of 36-59 months of age. This suggests that preschool-aged children, rather than infants, are responsible for maintaining the indirect benefits of PCVs.",
