    "abstract": "Single-molecule binding assays enable the study of how molecular machines assemble and function. Current algorithms can identify and locate individual molecules, but require tedious manual validation of each spot. Moreover, no solution for high-throughput analysis of single-molecule binding data exists. Here, we describe an automated pipeline to analyze single-molecule data over a wide range of experimental conditions. We benchmarked the pipeline by measuring the binding properties of the well-studied, DNA-guided DNA endonuclease, TtAgo, an Argonaute protein from the Eubacterium Thermus thermophilus. We also used the pipeline to extend our understanding of TtAgo by measuring the proteins binding kinetics at physiological temperatures and for target DNAs containing multiple, adjacent binding sites.",

    "abstract": "Calretinin (CR)-expressing periglomerular (PG) cells are the most abundant interneurons in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. They are predominately generated postnatally from the septal and dorsal sub-ventricular zones that continue producing them well into adulthood. Yet, little is known about their properties and functions. Using transgenic approaches and patch-clamp recording we show that CR(+) PG cells of both septal and dorsal origin have homogenous morphological and electrophysiological properties. They express a surprisingly poor repertoire of voltage-activated channels and fire, at most, one action potential. They also receive little synaptic inputs and NMDA receptors predominate at excitatory synapses. These properties, that resemble those of immature neurons, persist over time and limit the contribution of CR(+) PG cells in network activity. Thus, postnatally-generated CR(+) PG cells continuously supply a pool of latent neurons that unlikely participate in olfactory bulb computation but may provide a so far unsuspected reservoir of plasticity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe positron emission tomography radioligand (R)-[11C]PK11195 can be used to quantify the expression of translocator protein (TSPO), which is considered a marker for activation of glial cells. TSPO is expressed throughout the brain, and for this reason no true reference region exists. When a radioligand does not have a reference region, an arterial input function (AIF) is usually required in order to quantify binding. However, obtaining an AIF can be difficult as well as uncomfortable for participants. Alternative methods have therefore been proposed with the aim of estimating (R)-[11C]PK11195 binding without arterial measurements, such as standardized uptake values (SUVs), supervised-cluster analysis (SVCA), or the use of a pseudo-reference region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability and convergent validity of these techniques.\\n\\nMethodsData from a previously published (R)-[11C]PK11195 test-retest study in six healthy male subjects were reanalysed. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated for a set of cortical and subcortical brain regions using the simplified reference tissue model, with either cerebellum as reference region or a reference input derived using SVCA. SUVs were estimated for the time interval of 40-60 minutes. For comparison, total distribution volume (VT), specific distribution volume (VS) and BPND were estimated from the two-tissue-compartment model (2TCM) using AIF. Test-retest reliability was then assessed for all outcome measures. Convergent validity was examined by correlating all measures derived without an AIF to those derived using 2TCM.\\n\\nResultsTest-retest reliability for BPND estimates were poor (80% of all regional ICCs<0.5). SUVs showed, on average, moderate reliability. BPND estimates derived without an AIF were not correlated with VT, VS or BPND from the 2TCM (all R2<12%). SUVs were not correlated with any other outcome (all R2<9%).\\n\\nDiscussionBPND estimated using cerebellum or SVCA as reference input showed poor reliability and little to no convergent validity with outcomes derived using an AIF. SUVs showed moderate reliability but no convergent validity with any other outcome. Caution is warranted for interpreting patient-control comparisons employing (R)-[11C]PK11195 outcome measures obtained without an AIF.",

    "abstract": "We investigated age-related differences in syntactic comprehension in young and older adults. Most previous research found no evidence of age-related decline in syntactic processing. We investigated elementary syntactic comprehension of minimal sentences (e.g. I cook), minimizing the influence of working memory. We also investigated the contribution of semantic processing by comparing sentences containing real verbs (e.g. I cook) versus pseudoverbs (e.g. I spuff). We measured the speed and accuracy of detecting syntactic agreement errors (e.g. I cooks, I spuffs). We found that older adults were slower and less accurate than younger adults in detecting syntactic agreement errors for both real and pseudoverb sentences, suggesting there is age-related decline in syntactic comprehension. The age-related decline in accuracy was smaller for the pseudoverb sentences, and the decline in speed was larger for the pseudoverb sentences, compared to real verb sentences. We suggest that syntactic comprehension decline is stronger in the absence of semantic information, which causes older adults to produce slower responses in order to make more accurate decisions. In line with these findings, performance for older adults was positively related to a measure of processing speed capacity. Taken together, we found evidence that elementary syntactic processing abilities decline in healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "The value of an anticipated rewarding event is crucial information in the decision to engage in its pursuit. The networks responsible for encoding and retrieving this value are largely unknown. Using glutamate biosensors and pharmacological manipulations, we found that basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic activity tracks and mediates both the encoding and retrieval of the state-dependent incentive value of a palatable food. Projection-specific and bidirectional chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations revealed the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) supports the BLA in these processes. Critically, the function of ventrolateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) OFC[-&gt;]BLA projections was found to be doubly dissociable. Whereas activity in lOFC[-&gt;]BLA projections is necessary for and sufficient to drive encoding of a positive change in the value of a reward, mOFC[-&gt;]BLA projections are necessary and sufficient for retrieving this value from memory to guide its pursuit. These data reveal a new circuit for adaptive reward valuation and pursuit, indicate dissociability in the encoding and retrieval of reward memories, and provide insight into the dysfunction in these processes that characterizes myriad psychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith aging, the incidence of neuropathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases increases in the brains of cognitively healthy individuals. It is currently unclear to what extent these hallmarks associate with symptoms of disease at extreme ages. Forty centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort agreed to post-mortem brain donation. Centenarians self-reported to be cognitive healthy at baseline, which was confirmed by a proxy. Objective ante-mortem measurements of cognitive performance were associated with the prevalence, distribution and quantity of age- and AD-related neuropathological hallmarks. Despite self-reported cognitive health, objective neuropsychological testing suggested varying levels of ante-mortem cognitive functioning. Post-mortem, we found that most neuropathological hallmarks related to age and neurodegenerative diseases such as A{beta} and Tau pathology, as well as atherosclerosis, were abundantly present in most or all centenarians, whereas Lewy body and pTDP-43 pathology were scarce. We observed that increased pathology loads correlated across pathology subtypes, and an overall trend of higher pathology loads to associate with a lower cognitive test performance. This trend was carried especially by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and to a lesser extent by A{beta}-associated pathologies. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) specifically associated with lower executive functioning in the centenarians. In conclusion, we find that while the centenarians in this cohort escaped or delayed cognitive impairment until extreme ages, their brains reveal varying levels of disease-associated neuropathological hallmarks, some of which associate with cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising non-invasive method for brain computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs translate brain activity into signals that allow communication with the outside world. Visual and motor imagery are often used as information-encoding strategies, but can be challenging if not grounded in recent experience in these modalities, e.g. in patients with locked-in-syndrome (LIS). In contrast, somatosensory imagery might constitute a more suitable information-encoding strategy as somatosensory function is often very robust. Somatosensory imagery has been shown to activate somatotopic cortex, but it has been unclear so far whether it can be reliably detected on a single-trial level and successfully classified according to specific somatosensory imagery content.\\n\\nUsing ultra-high field 7-T fMRI, we show reliable and high-accuracy single-trial decoding of left-foot vs. right-hand somatosensory imagery. Correspondingly, higher decoding accuracies were associated with greater spatial separation of hand and foot decoding-weight patterns in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Exploiting these novel neuroscientific insights, we developed - and provide a proof of concept for - basic BCI communication by showing that binary (yes/no) answers encoded by somatosensory imagery can be decoded with high accuracy not only offline but also in real-time.\\n\\nThis study demonstrates that body part-specific somatosensory imagery differentially activates somatosensory cortex in a topographically specific manner; evidence which was surprisingly still lacking in the literature. It is also offers a promising novel somatosensory imagery based fMRI-BCI control strategy, with particularly high potential for visually and motor-impaired patients. The strategy could also be transferred to lower MRI field strengths and to mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Finally, given that communication BCIs provide the BCI user with a form of feedback based on their brain signals and can thus be considered as a specific form of neurofeedback, and that repeated use of a BCI has been shown to enhance underlying representations, we expect that the current BCI could also offer an interesting new approach for somatosensory rehabilitation training in the context of stroke and phantom limb pain.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological signals across species and recording scales exhibit both periodic and aperiodic features. Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic \\\"background\\\" 1/f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitation/inhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters--along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth--are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.",

Here we use model based approach to assess the population density of a threatened bird, the Multicolored Tanager (Chlorochrysa nitidissima). We conducted 144 fixed point counts samplings to record all the individuals of the Multicolored Tanager detected by visual and aural observations from different habitats (forest edge, mature, secondary, and riparian forest), during four months in an Important Bird Area of Central Andes of Colombia. We used spatially replicated counts, distance sampling, and multinomial- Poisson mixture models to estimate the population density of the Multicolored Tanager. Accumulated sampling effort was of 576 repetitions in 144 point counts with 96 h of observation. The Multinomial-Poisson mixture model showed the best fit due low variance of density estimations in comparison to the conventional distance sampling and the spatially replicated counts. Results of this model evidenced a remarkable higher density estimates (1.3 - 2.05 individuals/ha) of the Multicolored Tanager, particularly in mature and secondary forest, as a result of detection correction, instead of sampling effort, by our model based analysis in contrast to index density used in previous studies. We discuss the advantages of model based methods over density indexes in designs monitoring programs of endangered species as the Multicolored Tanager, in order to obtain better and comparable assessment of density estimations along multiple localities.\\n\\nResumenLa combinacion de modelos multi-nominales y Poisson revelan estimaciones de densidad altas inesperadas en un ave amenazada Andina.

Using a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model, validated via a comprehensive simulation study, we quantified household differences in malaria exposure and examined its spatial distribution. We found that housing quality explained large variation among households in mosquito counts. In each site, there was evidence for hot and cold spots, spatial patterns associated with urbanicity, elevation, or other environmental covariates.

Thus, MHAs have a second (vertical) paralogy dimension, which re-categorizes most indel mutations as replication slippage and attenuates the indel problem. Furthermore, internally-cinched, inferred microparalogy in a self-MHA can later be relaxed to restore uniformity to 2-dimensional widths in a multiple sequence alignment. This de-cinching operation is used as a first resort before artificial null characters are used. We implement MHA in a program called maximal, which is composed of a series of modules for cinching and cyclelizing divergent tandem repeats. In conclusion, we find that the MHA approach is of higher utility than GA in non-protein-coding regulatory sequences, which are unconstrained by codon-based reading frames and are enriched in dense microparalogical content.",

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the major pathogen responsible for community and hospital bacterial infections. Sublancin, a glocosylated antimicrobial peptide isolated from Bacillus subtilis 168, possesses anti-bacterial infective effects. In this study, we investigated the role and anti-infection mechanism of sublancin in a mouse model of MRSA-induced sublethal infection. Sublancin could modulate innate immunity by inducing the production of IL-1{beta}, IL-6, TNF- and nitric oxide, enhancing phagocytosis and MRSA-killing activity in both RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. The enhanced macrophage function by the peptide in vitro correlated with stronger protective activity in vivo in the MRSA-invasive sublethal infection model. Macrophages activation by sublancin was found to be mediated through the TLR4 and the NF-{kappa}B and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, oral administration of sublancin increased the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. The protective activity of sublancin was associated with in vivo augmenting phagocytotic activity of peritoneal macrophages and partly improving T cell-mediated immunity. Macrophages thus represent a potentially pivotal and novel target for future development of innate defense regulator therapeutics againt S. aureus infection.",

Little work has been carried out to assess the efficacy of this approach in stroke patients, and the lack of studies with active control conditions and rigorous evaluations of cognitive functioning pre and post training means understanding is limited as to whether and how such interventions may be effective. Here we compare the effects of 20 days of active cognitive training using either novel Selective Attention Training (SAT) or commercial Working Memory Training (WMT) programme, versus a waitlist control group, on a wide range of attentional and working memory tasks, as well as on self-reported everyday functioning. We demonstrate separable effects of each of the active training conditions, with SAT leading to improvements in both spatial and non-spatial aspects of attention and WMT leading to improvements only on very closely related working memory tasks. Both training groups reported improvements in everyday functioning, which were associated with improvements in attentional functions, suggesting that improving attention may be of particular importance in maximising functional recovery in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLocal mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in two counties of the continental United State (US), prompting the issuance of travel, prevention, and testing guidance across the continental US. Large uncertainty, however, surrounds the quantification of the actual risk of ZIKV introduction and autochthonous transmission across different areas of the US.\\n\\nMethodWe present a framework for the projection of ZIKV autochthonous transmission in the continental US during the 2015-2016 epidemic, using a data-driven stochastic and spatial epidemic model accounting for seasonal, environmental and detailed population data. The model generates an ensemble of travel-related case counts and simulate their potential to trigger local transmission at individual level.\\n\\nResultsWe estimate the risk of ZIKV introduction and local transmission at the county level and at the 0.025{degrees} x 0.025{degrees} cell level across the continental US. We provide a risk measure based on the probability of observing local transmission in a specific location during a ZIKV epidemic modeled after the one observed during the years 2015-2016. The high spatial and temporal resolutions of the model allow us to generate statistical estimates of the number of ZIKV introductions leading to local transmission in each location. We find that the risk is spatially heterogeneously distributed and concentrated in a few specific areas that account for less than 1% of the continental US population. Locations in Texas and Florida that have actually experienced local ZIKV transmission are among the places at highest risk according to our results. We also provide an analysis of the key determinants for local transmission, and identify the key introduction routes and their contributions to ZIKV spread in the continental US.\\n\\nConclusionsThis framework provides quantitative risk estimates, fully captures the stochas-ticity of ZIKV introduction events, and is not biased by the under-ascertainment of cases due to asymptomatic infections. It provides general information on key risk determinants and data with potential uses in defining public health recommendations and guidance about ZIKV risk in the US.",

    "abstract": "Breeding varieties for increased disease resistance is a major means to control epidemics. However, the deployment of resistance genes through space and time drives the genetic composition of the pathogen population, with predictable changes in pathotype frequencies. In France, Leptosphaeria maculans causes disease on Brassica napus oilseed rape crops but not on B. juncea condiment mustard. Prior to the deployment of winter B. napus varieties with Rlm6 resistance gene introduced from B. juncea, the aim of our study was to investigate if this deployment could impact disease control in condiment mustard. We assessed the presence of resistance genes against phoma stem canker in a set of current French B. juncea varieties and breeding lines. Rlm6 was detected in all the 12 condiment mustard varieties. Rlm5 was also detected in 8 varieties. No additional resistance genes were detected with the set of isolates used. Because frequency of isolates virulent on Rlm6 is very low, these results indicate that Rlm6 gene is a major component of disease control in the French B. juncea mustards tested. Using Rlm6 in oilseed rape varieties will very likely induce an increase in frequency of Rlm6 virulent isolates. This raises the acute concern of a wise deployment of oilseed rape around the condiment mustard growing area. Scientific knowledge on adaptation dynamics, spatial segregation of crops and cooperation between actors is currently available in order to mitigate the risk and advert negative consequences of the introduction of Rlm6 resistance gene in oilseed rape varieties.",

Recent data suggest that high-resolution data on malaria exposure can be obtained from a small number of samples by measuring a handful of properly chosen antibody responses.

    "abstract": "The formation of the potent neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) is a microbially mediated process that has raised much concern because MeHg poses threats to wildlife and human health. Since boreal forest soils can be a source of MeHg in aquatic networks, it is crucial to understand the biogeochemical processes involved in the formation of this pollutant. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and the mercury methyltransferase, hgcA, combined with geochemical characterisation of soils, were used to determine the microbial populations contributing to MeHg formation in forest soils across Sweden. The hgcA sequences obtained were distributed among diverse clades, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Methanomicrobia, with Deltaproteobacteria, particularly Geobacteraceae, dominating the libraries across all soils examined. Our results also suggest that MeHg formation is linked to the composition of also non-mercury methylating bacterial communities, likely providing growth substrate (e.g. acetate) for the hgcA-carrying microorganisms responsible for the actual methylation process. While previous research focused on mercury methylating microbial communities of wetlands, this study provides some first insights into the diversity of mercury methylating microorganisms in boreal forest soils.\\n\\nImportanceDespite a global state of awareness that mercury, and methylmercury in particular, is a neurotoxin that millions of people continue to be exposed to, there are sizable gaps in our fundamental understanding of the processes and organisms involved in methylmercury formation. In the present study we shed light on the diversity of the microorganisms responsible for methylmercury formation in boreal forest soils. All the microorganisms identified have a relevant role on the processing of organic matter in soils. Moreover, our results show that the formation of methylation formation is not only linked to mercury methylating microorganisms but also to the presence of non-mercury methylating bacterial communities that contribute to methylmercury formation by the appropriate substrate to the microorganisms responsible for the actual methylation process. This study improves current knowledge on the diversity of organisms involved in methylmercury formation in soils.",

    "abstract": "Non-synonymous mutations linked to the complex diseases often have a global impact on a biological system, affecting large biomolecular networks and pathways. However, the magnitude of the mutation-driven effects on the macromolecular network is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we present an systematic multi-level characterization of human mutations associated with genetic disorders by determining their individual and combined interaction-rewiring, \\\"edgetic\\\", effects on the human interactome. Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar. Case studies reveal the central role of interaction-disrupting mutations in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and suggest the importance of studying mutations that abnormally strengthen the protein interactions in cancer. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology that drives precision medicine, there is an increasing demand in understanding the changes in molecular mechanisms caused by the patient-specific genetic variation. The current and future in-silico edgotyping tools present a cheap and fast solution to deal with the rapidly growing datasets of discovered mutations.",

    "abstract": "Standard methods for seeding monolayer cell cultures in a multiwell plate or dish do not uniformly distribute cells on the surface. With traditional methods, users find aggregation around the circumference, in the centre, or a combination of the two. This variation is introduced due to the macro scale flow of the cell seeding suspension, and movement of the dish before cells can settle and attach to the surface. Reproducibility between labs, users, and experiments is hampered by this variability in cell seeding. We present a simple method for uniform and user-independent cell seeding using an easily produced uniform cell seeder (UCS) device. This allows precise control of cell density in a reproducible manner. By containing the cell seeding suspension in a defined volume above the culture surface with the UCS, fluctuations in cell density are minimised. Seeding accuracy, as defined by the actual cell density versus the target seeding density is improved dramatically across users with various levels of expertise. We go on to demonstrate the impact of local variation in cell density on the lineage commitment of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards pancreatic endoderm (PE). Variations in the differentiation profile of cells across a culture well closely mirror variations in cell density introduced by seeding method - with the UCS correcting variations in differentiation efficiency. The UCS device provides a simple and reproducible method for uniform seeding across multiple culture systems.",

    "abstract": "The Hsp90 protein family are ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that maintain protein homeostasis and regulate many essential cellular processes. Higher eukaryotic cells have organelle-specific Hsp90 paralogs that are adapted to each unique sub-cellular environment. The mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, supports the folding and activity of electron transport components and is increasingly being appreciated as a critical player in mitochondrial signaling. It is well known that calcium plays an important regulatory role in mitochondria and can even accumulate to much higher concentrations than in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, we find that calcium can replace the requirement for magnesium to support TRAP1 ATPase activity. Using anomalous x-ray diffraction, we reveal a novel calcium-binding site within the TRAP1 nucleotide-binding pocket located near the ATP -phosphate and completely distinct from the magnesium site adjacent to the {beta} and {gamma}-phosphates. In the presence of magnesium, ATP hydrolysis by TRAP1, as with other Hsp90s, is non-cooperative, whereas calcium binding results in cooperative ATP hydrolysis by the two protomers within the Hsp90 dimer. The structural data suggest a mechanism for the cooperative behavior. Owing to the cooperativity, at high ATP concentrations, ATPase activity is higher with calcium, whereas the converse is true at low ATP concentrations. Integrating these observations, we propose a model where the divalent cations choice can control switching between non-cooperative and cooperative TRAP1 ATPase mechanisms in response ATP concentrations. This may facilitate coordination between cellular energetics, mitochondrial signaling, and protein homeostasis via alterations in the TRAP1 ATP-driven cycle.",
