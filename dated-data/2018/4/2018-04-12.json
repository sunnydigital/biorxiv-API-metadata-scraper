    "abstract": "SummaryExome sequencing approach is extensively used in research and diagnostic laboratories to discover pathological variants and study genetic architecture of human diseases. However, a significant proportion of identified genetic variants are actually false positive calls, and this pose serious challenges for variants interpretation. Here, we propose a new tool named GARFIELD-NGS (Genomic vARiants FIltering by dEep Learning moDels in NGS), which rely on deep learning models to dissect false and true variants in exome sequencing experiments performed with Illumina or ION platforms. GARFIELD-NGS showed strong performances for both SNP and INDEL variants (AUC 0.71 - 0.98) and outperformed established hard filters. The method is robust also at low coverage down to 30X and can be applied on data generated with the recent Illumina two-colour chemistry. GARFIELD-NGS processes standard VCF file and produces a regular VCF output. Thus, it can be easily integrated in existing analysis pipeline, allowing application of different thresholds based on desired level of sensitivity and specificity.\\n\\nAvailabilityGARFIELD-NGS available at https://github.com/gedoardo83/GARFIELD-NGS\\n\\nContactedoardo.giacopuzzi@unibs.it",

    "abstract": "Previously, we classified colorectal cancers (CRCs) into five CRCA subtypes with different prognoses and potential treatment responses, using a 786-gene signature. We merged our subtypes and those described by five other groups into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) that are similar to CRCA subtypes. Here we demonstrate the analytical development and application of a custom NanoString platform-based biomarker assay to stratify CRC into subtypes. To reduce costs, we switched from the standard protocol to a custom modified protocol (NanoCRCA) with a high Pearson correlation coefficient (>0.88) between protocols. Technical replicates were highly correlated (>0.96). The assay included a reduced robust 38-gene panel from the 786-gene signature that was selected using an in-laboratory developed computational pipeline of class prediction methods. We applied our NanoCRCA assay to untreated CRCs including fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (n=81) with matched microarray or RNA-Seq profiles. We further compared the assay results with CMS classification, different platforms (microarrays/RNA-Seq) and gene-set classifiers (38 and 786 genes). NanoCRCA classified fresh-frozen samples (n=39; not including those showing a mixture of subtypes) into all five CRCA subtypes with overall high concordance across platforms (89.7%) and with CMS subtypes (84.6%), independent of tumour cellularity. This analytical validation of the assay shows the association of subtypes with their known molecular, mutational and clinical characteristics. Overall, our modified NanoCRCA assay with further clinical assessment may facilitate prospective validation of CRC subtypes in clinical trials and beyond.\\n\\nNovelty and ImpactWe previously identified five gene expression-based CRC subtypes with prognostic and potential predictive differences using a 786-gene signature and microarray platform. Subtype-driven clinical trials require a validated assay suitable for routine clinical use. This study demonstrates, for the first time, how molecular CRCA subtype can be detected using NanoString Technology-based biomarker assay (NanoCRCA) suitable for clinical validation. NanoCRCA is suitable for analysing FFPE samples, and this assay may facilitate patient stratification within clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., J. Mol. Biol., 406:228-256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody-antigen complexes, using two design strategies - optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody-antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAntibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to attack infections and cancer and are also used as drugs to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. The mechanism that has evolved to produce them is able to make 10s of millions of different antibodies, each with a different surface used to bind the foreign or mutated molecule. We have developed a method to design antibodies computationally, based on the 1000s of experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of antibodies available. The method works by treating pieces of these structures as a collection of parts that can be combined in new ways to make better antibodies. Our method has been implemented in the protein modeling program Rosetta, and is called RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD). We tested RAbD both computationally and experimentally. The experimental test shows that we can improve existing antibodies by 10 to 50 fold, paving the way for design of entirely new antibodies in the future.",

    "abstract": "We describe a patient-specific simulation based investigation on the role of Circle of Willis anatomy in cardioembolic stroke. Our simulation framework consists of medical image-driven modeling of patient anatomy including the Circle, 3D blood flow simulation through patient vasculature, embolus transport modeling using a discrete particle dynamics technique, and a sampling based approach to incorporate parametric variations. A total of 24 (four patients and six Circle anatomies including the complete Circle) models were considered, with cardiogenic emboli of varying sizes and compositions released virtually and tracked to compute distribution to the brain. The results establish that Circle anatomical variations significantly influence embolus distribution to the six major cerebral arteries. Embolus distribution to MCA territory is found to be least sensitive to the influence of anatomical variations. For varying Circle topologies, differences in flow through cervical vasculature are observed. This incoming flow is recruited differently across the communicating arteries of the Circle for varying anastomoses. Emboli interact with the routed flow, and can undergo significant traversal across the Circle arterial segments, depending upon their inertia and density ratio with respect to blood. This interaction drives the underlying biomechanics of embolus transport across the Circle, explaining how Circle anatomy influences embolism risk.",

Aerobic fitness has been shown to ameliorate decline in some cognitive domains, but the potential benefits for language have not been examined. In a cross-sectional sample, we investigated the relationship between aerobic fitness and tip-of-the-tongue states. These are among the most frequent cognitive failures in healthy older adults and occur when a speaker knows a word but is unable to produce it. We found that healthy older adults indeed experience more tip-of-the-tongue states than young adults. Importantly, higher aerobic fitness levels decrease the probability of experiencing tip-of-the-tongue states in healthy older adults. Fitness-related differences in word finding abilities are observed over and above effects of age. This is the first demonstration of a link between aerobic fitness and language functioning in healthy older adults.",

Acute exercise promotes the release of endocannabinoids (especially anandamide, AEA), which enhance BDNF release and improve hippocampal plasticity in rodents. How acute exercise affects BDNF and AEA levels and influences memory performance in humans remains to date unknown. Here we combined blood biomarkers, behavioral and fMRI measurements to assess the impact of acute physical exercise on associative memory and underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. For each participant, memory was tested after three conditions: rest, moderate or high exercise intensity. A long-term memory retest took place 3 months later. At both test and retest, memory performance increased after moderate but not high intensity exercise or rest. We also show that memory benefited from exercise-related increases in both AEA and BNDF levels: AEA boosted hippocampal activity during memory recall, while BDNF enhanced hippocampal memory representations and long-term performance.",

    "abstract": "Antigenic targets of influenza vaccination are currently seen to be polarised between (i) highly immunogenic (and protective) epitopes of high variability, and (ii) conserved epitopes of low immunogenicity. This requires vaccines directed against the variable sites to be continuously updated, with the only other alternative being seen as the artificial boosting of immunity to invariant epitopes of low natural efficacy. However, theoretical models suggest that the antigenic evolution of influenza is best explained by postulating the existence of highly immunogenic epitopes of limited variability. Here we report the identification of such an epitope of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 haemagglutinin protein. We show that the epitope mediates immunity to historical influenza strains not previously seen by a cohort of young children. Furthermore, vaccinating mice with these epitope conformations can induce immunity to all the human H1N1 influenza strains that have circulated since 1918. The identification of epitopes of limited variability offers a mechanism by which a universal influenza vaccine can be created; these vaccines would also have the potential to protect against newly emerging influenza strains.",

This is the case in Norway, where more than 80 per cent of TB cases are found among immigrants from high-incidence countries.

We applied modeled transmission based on whole-genome sequence data to estimate infection times for individual patients. By contrasting these estimates with time of arrival in Norway, we estimate on a case-by-case basis whether patients were likely to have been infected before or after arrival.\\n\\nResultsIndependent import was responsible for the majority of cases, but we estimate that about a quarter of the patients had contracted TB in Norway.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study illuminates the transmission dynamics within an immigrant community.

Transformed representations were found to veer towards the original non-blurred image and away from the blurred stimulus image.

    "abstract": "Human observers automatically extract temporal contingencies from the environment and predict the onset of future events. Temporal predictions are modelled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability was either solely driven by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function), or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area (SMA), underlining this areas link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing, and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilised to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementExtracting temporal predictions from sensory input allows to process future input more efficiently and to prepare responses in time. In mathematical terms, temporal predictions can be described by the hazard function, modelling the probability of an event to occur over time. Here, we show that the human EEG tracks temporal hazard in an implicit foreperiod paradigm. Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal-hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions that differed in their build-up of hazard over time. These neural signatures of tracking temporal hazard converge with the extant literature on temporal processing and provide new evidence that the supplementary motor area tracks hazard under strictly implicit timing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Reticulated evolution -i.e. secondary introgression / admixture between sister taxa-is increasingly recognized as a key evolutionary process that may play a role in structuring infra-specific genetic variation, and possibly promoting adaptation. Mytilus spp. is an ideal system to assess its importance, because these marine mussels form semi-isolated species that remain reproductively compatible over large time-scales. It includes three taxa that hybridize in the Northern Hemisphere (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus) and two taxa of uncertain ancestry in the Southern Hemisphere (M. platensis: South America and the Kerguelen Islands; and M. planulatus: Australasia). The Kerguelen mussels are of particular interest to investigate the potential role of admixture in enhancing micro-geographic structure, as they inhabit a small and isolated island in the Southern Ocean characterized by a highly heterogeneous environment, and genomic reticulation between Northern and Southern lineages has been suspected. Here, we extended a previous analysis by using targeted-sequencing data (51,878 SNPs) across the three Northern species and the Kerguelen population, coupled with a panel of 33 SNPs genotyped on 695 mussels across 35 sites in the Kerguelen Islands. The panel was enriched with ancestry-informative SNPs, i.e. SNPs that were more differentiated than the genomic average between Northern lineages, to evaluate whether reticulated evolution contributed to micro-geographic structure. We first showed that the Kerguelen population belongs to a divergent Southern lineage, most related to M. edulis mussels, that experienced secondary admixture with non-indigenous Northern species. We then demonstrated that the Kerguelen mussels were significantly differentiated over small spatial distance, and that this local genetic structure was associated with environmental variation and mostly revealed by ancestry-informative markers. Although local adaptation can explain the association with the environment we believe it more likely that environment variables better describe population connectivity than geographic distance. Our study highlights genetic connectivity of populations is more easily revealed by non-equilibrium secondary introgression clines at a subset of loci, while association with the environment should not be hastily advocated to support adaptation from admixture variation.",

High sequencing depth can also be used to identify phylogenetically informative allelic variation within sequenced individuals, but allele sequences are infrequently assembled in phylogenetic studies.\\n\\nInstead, many scientists perform their phylogenetic analyses using contig sequences which result from the de novo assembly of sequencing reads into contigs containing only canonical nucleobases, and this may reduce both statistical power and phylogenetic accuracy. Here, we develop an easy-to-use pipeline to recover allele sequences from sequence capture data, and we use simulated and empirical data to demonstrate the utility of integrating these allele sequences to analyses performed under the Multispecies Coalescent (MSC) model. Our empirical analyses of Ultraconserved Element (UCE) locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last three million years. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species, and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large databases (e.g. > 10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full-text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about one day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times.\\n\\nResultsTo solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor directories via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.\\n\\nContacttemesgen.dadi@fu-berlin.de\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://gitlab.com/pirovc/dream_yara/",

Whereas scientific misconduct, like data fabrication, is clearly irresponsible and unethical, other behaviors--often referred to as questionable research practices (QRPs)--exploit the ethical shades of gray that color acceptable practice. This study aimed to measure the frequency of self-reported QRPs in a diverse, international sample of health professions education (HPE) researchers.\\n\\nMethodIn 2017, the authors conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional survey study. The web-based survey contained 43 QRP items that asked respondents to rate how often they had engaged in various forms of scientific misconduct. The items were adapted from two previously published surveys.\\n\\nResultsIn total, 590 HPE researchers took the survey. The mean age was 46 years (SD=11.6), and the majority of participants were from the United States (26.4%), Europe (23.2%), and Canada (15.3%). The three most frequently reported QRPs were adding authors to a paper who did not qualify for authorship (60.6%), citing articles that were not read (49.5%), and selectively citing papers to please editors or reviewers (49.4%). Additionally, respondents reported misrepresenting a participants words (6.7%), plagiarizing (5.5%), inappropriately modifying results (5.3%), deleting data without disclosure (3.4%), and fabricating data (2.4%). Overall, 533 (90.3%) respondents reported at least one QRP.\\n\\nConclusionsNotwithstanding the methodological limitations of survey research, these findings indicate that a substantial proportion of HPE researchers report a range of QRPs. In light of these results, reforms are needed to improve the credibility and integrity of the HPE research enterprise.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"Researchers should practice research responsibly.

We deployed an autonomous rover in a mission-relevant Martian drilling scenario with manual sample validation. Subsurface communities were delineated by depth related to sediment moisture. Geochemical analysis indicated soluble salts and minerology that influenced water bio-availability, particularly in deeper sediments.

Because of the lengthy duration of treatment that can precede resistance in patients, in order to study changes underlying the evolution of bevacizumab resistance, we created a novel multigenerational xenograft model of acquired bevacizumab resistance. Glioblastoma xenografts were treated with bevacizumab or IgG, and the fastest growing tumor re-implanted into new mice, generating paired isogeneic responsive or resistant multigenerational xenografts. Microarray analysis revealed significant overexpression across generations of the mesenchymal subtype gene signature, paralleling results from patient bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas (BRGs) that exhibited increasing mesenchymal gene expression correlating with increased bevacizumab treatment duration. Key mesenchymal markers, including YKL-40, CD44, SERPINE1, and TIMP1 were upregulated across generations, with altered morphology, increased invasiveness, and increased neurosphere formation confirmed in later xenograft generations. Interestingly, YKL-40 levels were elevated in serum of patients with bevacizumab-resistant vs. bevacizumab-naive glioblastomas. Finally, despite upregulation of VEGF-independent pro-angiogenic genes across xenograft generations, immunostaining revealed increased hypoxia and decreased vessel density with increasing generation of treatment, mirroring our findings in patient BRGs and suggesting tumor growth despite effective devascularization caused by VEGF blockade. Besides identifying novel targets for preventing the evolution of resistance and offering a xenograft model for testing resistance inhibitors, our work suggests YKL-40 as a blood biomarker of bevacizumab resistance worthy of further evaluation.",

However, this model is grounded largely in studies of behaviors that utilize hardwired neural pathways to link sensory input to motor output. To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes that require arbitrary sensorimotor associations, we have developed a cerebellar-dependent motor learning paradigm compatible with both mesoscale and single dendrite resolution calcium imaging in mice. Here, we find that CFs are preferentially driven by and more time-locked to correctly executed movements and other task parameters that predict reward outcome, exhibiting widespread correlated activity within parasagittal processing zones that is governed by these predictions. Together, such CF activity patterns are well-suited to drive learning by providing predictive instructional input consistent with an unsigned reinforcement learning signal that does not rely exclusively on motor errors.",

The physiology, ecology, and evolution of these obligate parasites are still poorly understood. A high-quality reference genome (size 266.74 Mb and contig N50 of 3.63 Mb) of Cuscuta australis was assembled. Our analyses reveal that Cuscuta experienced accelerated evolution, and Cuscuta and the convolvulaceous morning glory (Ipomoea) shared a common whole-genome triplication event before their divergence. Importantly, C. australis genome harbors only 19805 protein-coding genes, and 11.7% of the conserved orthologs in autotrophic plants are lost in C. australis. Many of these gene loss events likely result from the plants parasitic lifestyle and large changes in its body plan. Moreover, comparison of the gene expression patterns in Cuscuta prehaustoria/haustoria and various tissues of closely related autotrophic plants suggests that Cuscuta haustorium genes largely evolved from roots. The C. australis genome provides important resources for studying the evolution of parasitism, regressive evolution, and evo-devo in plant parasites.",

Here we show highly dynamic changes in protein synthesis along differentiation of stem cells to neurons in vivo. Examination of individual transcripts using RiboTag mouse models reveals that neural stem cells efficiently translate abundant transcripts, whereas translation becomes increasingly controlled with the onset of differentiation. Stem cell generation of early neuroblasts involves translational repression of a subset of mRNAs including the stem cell-identity factors Sox2 and Pax6 as well as translation machinery components. In silico motif analysis identifies a pyrimidine-rich motif (PRM) in this repressed subset. A drop in mTORC1 activity at the onset of differentiation selectively blocks translation of PRM-containing transcripts. Our data uncovers how a drop in mTORC1 allows robust simultaneous posttranscriptional repression of key stem cell identity-factors and translation-components and thereby stemness exit and migration.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCurrent genotyping approaches for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) rely on short, relatively accurate reads from second generation sequencing devices. Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread. These platforms come with the significant drawback of higher sequencing error rates, which makes them ill-suited to current genotyping algorithms. However, the longer reads make more of the genome unambiguously mappable and typically provide linkage information between neighboring variants.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper we introduce a novel approach for haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads. We do this by considering bipartitions of the sequencing reads, corresponding to the two haplotypes. We formalize the computational problem in terms of a Hidden Markov Model and compute posterior genotype probabilities using the forward-backward algorithm. Genotype predictions can then be made by picking the most likely genotype at each site. Our experiments indicate that longer reads allow significantly more of the genome to potentially be accurately genotyped. Further, we are able to use both Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences sequencing data to independently validate millions of variants previously identified by short-read technologies in the reference NA12878 sample, including hundreds of thousands of variants that were not previously included in the high-confidence reference set.",

Here, we describe for the first time an ancient and diverging lineage of the Italian wall lizard Podarcis siculus from the western Pontine Islands. We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences of 156 individuals with the aim of unraveling their phylogenetic position, while microsatellite loci were used to compare several a priori insular biogeographic models of migration with empirical data. Our results suggest that the western Pontine populations colonized the islands early during their Pliocene volcanic formation, while populations from the eastern Pontine Islands seem to have been introduced recently. The inter-island genetic makeup indicates an important role of historical migration, probably due to glacial land bridges connecting islands followed by a recent vicariant mechanism of isolation. Moreover, the most supported migration model predicted higher gene flow among islands sharing a longitudinal arrangement. Considering the threatened status of small insular endemic populations, we suggest this new evolutionarily independent unit be given priority in conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "A central paradigm in conservation biology is that population bottlenecks reduce genetic diversity and negatively impact population viability and adaptive potential. In an era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and climate change, understanding both the determinants and consequences of bottlenecks in wild populations is therefore an increasingly important challenge. However, as most studies have focused on single species, the multitude of potential drivers and the consequences of bottlenecks remain elusive. Here, we used a comparative approach by integrating genetic data from over 11,000 individuals of 30 pinniped species with demographic, ecological and life history data to elucidate the consequences of large-scale commercial exploitation by 18th and 19th century sealers. We show that around one third of these species exhibit strong genetic signatures of recent population declines, with estimated bottleneck effective population sizes reflecting just a few tens of surviving individuals in the most extreme cases. Bottleneck strength was strongly associated with both breeding habitat and mating system variation, and together with global abundance explained a large proportion of the variation in genetic diversity across species. Overall, there was no relationship between bottleneck intensity and IUCN status, although three of the four most heavily bottlenecked species are currently endangered. Our study reveals an unforeseen interplay between anthropogenic exploitation, ecology, life history and demographic declines, sheds new light on the determinants of genetic diversity, and is consistent with the notion that both genetic and demographic factors influence population viability.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is an emergent fungal pathogen of rising public health concern due to increasing reports of outbreaks in healthcare settings and resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs. While distantly related to the more common pathogens C. albicans and C. glabrata, C. auris is closely related to three rarely observed and often multidrug-resistant species, C. haemulonii, C. duobushaemulonii and C. pseudohaemulonii. Here, we generated and analyzed near complete genome assemblies and RNA-Seq-guided gene predictions for isolates from each of the four major C. auris clades and for C. haemulonii, C. duobushaemulonii and C. pseudohaemulonii. Our analyses mapped seven chromosomes and revealed chromosomal rearrangements between C. auris clades and related species. We found conservation of genes involved in mating and meiosis and identified both MTLa and MTL C. auris isolates, suggesting the potential for mating between clades. Gene conservation analysis highlighted that many genes linked to drug resistance and virulence in other pathogenic Candida species are conserved in C. auris and related species including expanded families of transporters and lipases, as well as mutations and copy number variants in ERG11 that confer drug resistance. In addition, we found genetic features of the emerging species that likely underlie differences in virulence and drug response between these and other Candida species, including genes involved in cell wall structure. To begin to characterize the species-specific genes important for antifungal response, we profiled the gene expression of C. auris in response to voriconazole and amphotericin B and found induction of several transporters and metabolic regulators that may play a role in drug resistance. This study provides a comprehensive view of the genomic basis of drug resistance, potential for mating, and virulence in this emerging fungal clade.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal immune system has the challenging task of tolerating foreign nutrients and the commensal microbiome, while excluding or eliminating ingested pathogens. Failure in such balance leads to a range of severe intestinal and systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, food allergies or invasive gastrointestinal infections1,2. Multiple innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are therefore in place to maintain tissue integrity, including efficient peripheral generation of effector T (TH) cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T (pTreg) cells, which mediate resistance to pathogens and regulate excessive immune activation, respectively2-5. The gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) are critical sites for orchestrating adaptive immunity to luminal perturbations6-8. However, how they manage to simultaneously support tolerogenic and inflammatory reactions is incompletely understood. Here we report that individual mLNs are anatomically and immunologically distinct according to the functional gut segment they drain. Dendritic cell gene signatures and adaptive T cell polarization against the same luminal antigen differed between mLNs along the intestine, the proximal small intestine-draining mLNs preferentially giving rise to tolerogenic and the distal mLNs to pro-inflammatory T cell responses. This compartmentalized dichotomy could be perturbed by duodenal infection, surgical removal of select distal mLNs, dysbiosis, or ectopic antigen delivery, impacting both lymphoid organ and tissue immune responses. Our findings reveal that the conflict between tolerogenic and inflammatory adaptive responses is in part resolved by discrete mLN drainage, and encourage gut segment-specific antigen targeting for therapeutic immune modulation.",

Global networks can be analyzed at the transcriptome wide scale or after querying them with a set of guide genes to capture the transcriptional landscape of a given pathway in a process named Pathway Level Correlation (PLC).

In the present work, we compared how Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Spearman Correlation Coefficient (SCC), their respective ranked values (Highest Reciprocal Rank (HRR)), Mutual Information (MI) and Partial Correlations (PC) performed on global networks and PLCs. This evaluation was conducted on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using microarray and differently pre-processed RNA-seq datasets. We particularly evaluated how dataset x distance measurement combinations performed in 5 PLCs corresponding to 4 well described plant metabolic pathways (phenylpropanoid, carbohydrate, fatty acid and terpene metabolisms) and the cytokinin signaling pathway.

    "abstract": "Non-synonymous mutations linked to the complex diseases often have a global impact on a biological system, affecting large biomolecular networks and pathways. However, the magnitude of the mutation-driven effects on the macromolecular network is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we present an systematic multi-level characterization of human mutations associated with genetic disorders by determining their individual and combined interaction-rewiring, \\\"edgetic\\\", effects on the human interactome. Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar. Case studies reveal the central role of interaction-disrupting mutations in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and suggest the importance of studying mutations that abnormally strengthen the protein interactions in cancer. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology that drives precision medicine, there is an increasing demand in understanding the changes in molecular mechanisms caused by the patient-specific genetic variation. The current and future in-silico edgotyping tools present a cheap and fast solution to deal with the rapidly growing datasets of discovered mutations.",

    "abstract": "Standard methods for seeding monolayer cell cultures in a multiwell plate or dish do not uniformly distribute cells on the surface. With traditional methods, users find aggregation around the circumference, in the centre, or a combination of the two. This variation is introduced due to the macro scale flow of the cell seeding suspension, and movement of the dish before cells can settle and attach to the surface. Reproducibility between labs, users, and experiments is hampered by this variability in cell seeding. We present a simple method for uniform and user-independent cell seeding using an easily produced uniform cell seeder (UCS) device. This allows precise control of cell density in a reproducible manner. By containing the cell seeding suspension in a defined volume above the culture surface with the UCS, fluctuations in cell density are minimised. Seeding accuracy, as defined by the actual cell density versus the target seeding density is improved dramatically across users with various levels of expertise. We go on to demonstrate the impact of local variation in cell density on the lineage commitment of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards pancreatic endoderm (PE). Variations in the differentiation profile of cells across a culture well closely mirror variations in cell density introduced by seeding method - with the UCS correcting variations in differentiation efficiency. The UCS device provides a simple and reproducible method for uniform seeding across multiple culture systems.",

To unveil the molecular underpinnings of DFTD, we designed an approach that combines sensitivity to drugs with an integrated systems-biology characterization. Sensitivity to inhibitors of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases correlated with their overexpression, suggesting a causative link. Proteomic and DNA methylation analyses revealed tumor-specific signatures linked to oncogenic signaling hubs including evolutionary conserved STAT3. Indeed, ERBB inhibition blocked phosphorylation of STAT3 and arrested cancer cells. Pharmacological blockade of ERBB signaling prevented tumor growth in a xenograft model and resulted in recovery of MHC class I gene expression. This link between the hyperactive ERBB-STAT3 axis and MHC class I mediated tumor immunosurveillance provides mechanistic insights into horizontal transmissibility and led us to the proposition of a dual chemo-immunotherapeutic strategy to save Tasmanian devils from DFTD.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae two-component regulatory systems (TCS) enable adaptation and ensure its maintenance in host environments. This study deciphers the impact of the TCS08 on pneumococcal gene expression and its role in metabolic and pathophysiological processes. Transcriptome analysis and real-time PCR demonstrated a regulatory effect of the TCS08 on genes involved mainly in environmental information processing, intermediary metabolism, and colonization by S. pneumoniae D39 and TIGR4. Striking examples are genes of the fatty acid biosynthesis, arginine-deiminase system, and psa operon encoding the manganese ABC transport system. In silico analysis confirmed that TCS08 is homologous to Staphylococcus aureus SaeRS and a SaeR-like binding motif is displayed in the promotor region of pavB, the upstream gene of the tcs08 operon encoding a surface-exposed adhesin. Indeed, PavB is regulated by the TCS08 as confirmed by immunoblotting and surface abundance assays. Similarly, Pilus-1 of TIGR4 is regulated by TCS08. Finally, in vivo infections using the acute pneumonia and sepsis models showed a strain dependent effect. Loss of function of HK08 or TCS08 attenuated D39 virulence in lung infections. The RR08 deficiency attenuated TIGR4 in pneumonia, while there was no effect on sepsis. In contrast, lack of HK08 procured a highly virulent TIGR4 phenotype in both pneumonia and sepsis infections. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of TCS08 in pneumococcal fitness to adapt to the milieu of the respiratory tract during colonization.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEStreptococcus pneumoniae interplays with its environment by using 13 two-component regulatory systems and one orphan response regulator. These systems are involved in the sensing of environmental signals thereby modulating pneumococcal pathophysiology. This study aimed to understand the functional role of genes subject to control by the TCS08. The identified genes play a role in transport of compounds such as sugars or amino acids. In addition, the intermediary metabolism and colonization factors are modulated by TCS08. Thus, TCS08 regulates genes involved in maintaining pneumococcal physiology, transport capacity and adhesive factors to enable optimal colonization, which represents a prerequisite for invasive pneumococcal disease.",

    "abstract": "One of the characteristics of RNA interference (RNAi) is systemic spread of the silencing signal among cells and tissues throughout the organism. Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We show that ingested dsRNA spreads through the bees hemolymph associated with a protein complex. The systemic dsRNA is secreted with the jelly and delivered to larvae via ingestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Finally, RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Some of these RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNA and exogenous viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Thus, our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and epigenetic dynamics among honey bees and potentially other closely interacting organisms.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEHoney bees are eusocial insects, living in a colony that is often described as a superorganism. RNA mobility among cells of an organism has been documented in plants and animals. Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiated RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA. Our findings demonstrate a transmissible RNA pathway with potential roles in social immunity and epigenetic signaling among members of the hive.",

Visualizing features learned across all network layers reveals that APARENT recognizes sequence motifs known to recruit APA regulators, discovers previously unknown sequence determinants of cleavage site selection, and integrates these features into a comprehensive, interpretable cis-regulatory code.

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) induces latent life-long infections in all human populations. Depending on geographic area and socio-economic conditions between 30 to nearly 100% of individuals are affected. The biology of this virus is difficult to explore due to its extreme sophistication and the lack of pertinent animal model. Here we present the first application of the ANCHOR DNA labeling system to a herpes virus, allowing real time imaging and direct monitoring of HCMV infection and replication in human living cells. The ANCHOR system is composed of a protein (OR) which specifically binds to a short, non-repetitive DNA target sequence (ANCH) and spreads onto neighboring sequences due to protein oligomerization. If OR protein is fused to GFP, this accumulation results in a site specific fluorescent focus. We have created a recombinant ANCHOR-HCMV harboring an ANCH target sequence and the gene encoding the cognate OR-GFP fusion protein. Infection of permissive cells with ANCHOR-HCMV enables visualization of the nearly complete viral cycle until cell fragmentation and death. Quantitative analysis of infection kinetics and of viral DNA replication revealed cell-type specific behavior of HCMV and sensitivity to inhibitors. Our results show that the ANCHOR technology is a very efficient tool for the study of complex DNA viruses and new highly promising biotechnology applications.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe ANCHOR technology is to date the most powerful tool to follow and quantify the replication of HCMV in living cells and to gain new insights into its biology. This technology is applicable to virtually any DNA virus or virus presenting a dsDNA phase, paving the way to infection imaging in various cell lines or even in animal models and opening fascinating fundamental and applied prospects. Associated to high content automated microscopy, this technology permitted rapid, robust and precise determination of Ganciclovir IC50 and IC90 on HCMV replication, with minimal hands-on investment. To search for new antiviral activities, the experiment is easy to up-grade towards efficient and cost-effective screening of large chemical libraries. The simple infection of permissive cells with ANCHOR-viruses in the presence of a compound of interest may even provide a first estimation about the stage of the viral cycle this molecule is acting upon.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear speckles are interchromatin structures enriched in RNA splicing factors. Determining their relative positions with respect to the folded nuclear genome could provide critical information on co-and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, it remains challenging to identify which parts of the nuclear genome are in proximity to nuclear speckles, due to physical separation between nuclear speckle cores and chromatin. We hypothesized that noncoding RNAs including small nuclear RNAs, 7SK and Malat1, which accumulate at the periphery of nuclear speckles (nsaRNA, nuclear speckle associated RNA), may extend to sufficient proximity to the nuclear genome. Leveraging a transcriptome-genome interaction assay (MARGI), we identified nsaRNA-interacting genomic sequences, which exhibited clustering patterns (nsaPeaks) in the genome, suggesting existence of relatively stable interaction sites for nsaRNAs in nuclear genome. Posttranscriptional pre-mRNAs, which are known to be clustered to nuclear speckles, exhibited proximity to nsaPeaks but rarely to other genomic regions. Furthermore, CDK9 proteins that localize to the vicinity of nuclear speckles produced ChIP-seq peaks that overlapped with nsaPeaks. Our combined DNA FISH and immunofluorescence analysis in 182 single cells revealed a 3-fold increase in odds for nuclear speckles to localize near an nsaPeak than its neighboring genomic sequence. These data suggest a model that nsaRNAs locate in sufficient proximity to nuclear genome and leave identifiable genomic footprints, thus revealing the parts of genome proximal to nuclear speckles.",

Hoxb1 is the member of its chromosomal cluster expressed in the most rostral domain during vertebrate development, but never by the multipotent neural crest cell population anterior to the cerebellum. We have developed a novel floxed transgenic mouse line, CAG-Hoxb1,-EGFP (CAG-Hoxb1), which upon recombination by Cre recombinase conditionally induces robust Hoxb1 and eGFP over-expression. When induced within the neural crest lineage, pups die at birth. A variable phenotype develops from E11.5 on, associating frontonasal hypoplasia/aplasia, micrognathia/agnathia, major ocular and forebrain anomalies, and cardiovascular malformations. Neural crest derivatives in the body appear unaffected. Transcription of effectors of developmental signaling pathways (Bmp, Shh, Vegfa) and transcription factors (Pax3, Sox9) is altered in mutants. These outcomes emphasize that repression of Hoxb1, along with other paralog group 1 and 2 Hox genes, is strictly necessary in anterior cephalic NC for craniofacial, visual, auditory and cardiovascular development.",

    "abstract": "We identified seven families associating NEUROD2 pathogenic mutations with ASD and intellectual disability. To get insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms, we analyzed cortical development in Neurod2 KO mice. Cortical projection neurons (CPNs) over-migrated during embryogenesis, inducing abnormal thickness and laminar positioning of cortical layers. At juvenile ages, dendritic spine turnover and intrinsic excitability were increased in L5 CPNs. Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice. Our findings demonstrate crucial roles for Neurod2 in cortical development and function, whose alterations likely account for ASD and related symptoms in the newly defined NEUROD2 mutation syndrome.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to terminate the chaotic state of the literature on Nrf1/TCF11 with various confused molecular masses, we herein establish a generally acceptable criterion required for identification of its endogenous full-length proteins and derivative isoforms expressed differentially in distinct experimental cell lines. Further work has been focused on the molecular mechanisms that dictate the successive multistate post-translational modifications (i.e. glycosylation by OST, deglycosylation by NGLY, and ubiquitination by Hrd1) of this CNC-bZIP protein and its proteolytic processing to yield multiple isoforms. Several lines of experimental evidence have demonstrated that the nascent Nrf1/TCF11 polypeptide (non-glycosylated) is transiently translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in which it becomes an inactive glycoprotein-A, and also folded in a proper topology within and around membranes. Thereafter, dynamic repositioning of the ER-resident domains in Nrf1 glycoprotein is driven by p97-fueled retrotranslocation into extra-ER compartments. Therein, glycoprotein of Nrf1 is allowed for digestion into a deglycoprotein-B and then its progressive proteolytic processing by cytosolic DDI-1/2 and proteasomes to yield distinct proteoforms (i.e. protein-C/D). The processing is accompanied by removal of a major N-terminal ~12.5-kDa polypeptide from Nrf1. Interestingly, our present study has further unraveled that coupled positive and negative feedback circuits exist between Nrf1 and its cognate target genes, including those encoding its regulators p97, Hrd1, DDI-1 and proteasomes. These key players are differentially or even oppositely involved in diverse cellular signalling responses to distinct extents of ER-derived proteotoxic and oxidative stresses induced by different concentrations of proteasomal inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "1 AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSMetastasis through the bloodstream contributes to poor prognosis in many types of cancer. A unique approach to target and kill colon, prostate, and other epithelial-type cancer cells in the blood has been recently developed that causes circulating leukocytes to present the cancer-specific, liposome-bound Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) on their surface along with E - selectin adhesion receptors. This approach, demonstrated both in vitro with human blood and in mice, mimics the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells. The resulting liposomal TRAIL-coated leukocytes hold promise as an effective means to neutralize circulating tumor cells that enter the bloodstream with the potential to form new metastases.\\n\\nResultsThe computational biology study reported here examines the mechanism of this effective signal delivery, by considering the kinetics of the coupled reaction cascade, from TRAIL binding death receptor to eventual apoptosis. In this study, a collision of bound TRAIL with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is considered and compared to a prolonged exposure of CTCs to soluble TRAIL. An existing computational model of soluble TRAIL treatment was modified to represent the kinetics from a diffusion-limited 3D reference frame into a 2D collision frame with advection and adhesion to mimic the E - selectin and membrane bound TRAIL treatment. Thus, the current model recreates the new approach of targeting cancer cells within the blood. The model was found to faithfully reproduce representative observations from experiments of liposomal TRAIL treatment under shear. The model predicts apoptosis of CTCs within 2 hr when treated with membrane bound TRAIL, while apoptosis in CTCs treated with soluble TRAIL proceeds much more slowly over the course of 10 hrs, consistent with previous experiments. Given the clearance rate of soluble TRAIL in vivo, this model predicts that the soluble TRAIL method would be rendered ineffective, as found in previous experiments.\\n\\nConclusionThis study therefore indicates that the kinetics of the coupled reaction cascade of liposomal E - selectin and membrane bound TRAIL colliding with CTCs can explain why this new approach to target and kill cancer cells in blood is much more effective than its soluble counterpart.",

We examine the basin boundaries of attraction associated with the chemo-sensitive population and the chemo-resistant population for increasing values of chemo-concentrations and show their spiral intertwined structure.

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic cell division cycle is the process by which cells duplicate their genomes and proliferate. Transitions between sequential cell cycle phases are tightly orchestrated to ensure precise and efficient cell cycle progression. Interrogating molecular events at these transitions is important for understanding normal and pathological cell proliferation and mechanisms that ensure genome stability. A popular fluorescent reporter system known as \\\"FUCCI\\\" has been widely adopted for identifying cell cycle phases. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed the dynamics of the FUCCI reporters relative to the transitions into and out of S phase. Although the original reporters reflect the E3 ubiquitin ligase activities for which they were designed, SCFSkp2 and APCCdh1, their dynamics are significantly and variably offset from actual S phase boundaries. To precisely mark these transitions, we generated and thoroughly validated a new reporter containing a PCNA-interacting protein degron whose oscillations are directly coupled to the process of DNA replication itself. We combined this reporter with the geminin-based APCCdh1 reporter to create \\\"PIP-FUCCI.\\\" PIP degron reporter dynamics closely correlate with S phase transitions irrespective of reporter expression levels. Using PIP-FUCCI, we made the unexpected observation that the apparent timing of APCCdh1 inactivation frequently varies relative to the onset of S phase. We demonstrate that APCCdh1 inactivation is not a strict pre-requisite for S phase entry, though delayed APCCdh1 inactivation correlates with longer S phase. Our results illustrate the benefits of precise delineation of cell cycle phase boundaries for uncovering the sequences of molecular events at critical cell cycle transitions.",

While the structure of the cilium is being defined at increasing resolution, centriolar structure remains poorly understood. Here, we used electron cryo-tomography to determine the structure of mammalian (triplet) and Drosophila (doublet) centrioles at 25 [A] resolution. Mammalian centrioles have two distinct domains: a 200 nm proximal core region connected by A-C linkers, and a distal domain where the C-tubule is incomplete and a pair of novel linkages stabilize the assembly producing a geometry more closely resembling the ciliary axoneme. Drosophila centrioles more closely resemble the mammalian core, but with their doublets linked through A tubules. The commonality of core region length, and the abrupt transition in mammalian centrioles, suggests a conserved length-setting mechanism. The unexpected linker diversity suggests how unique centriolar architectures arise in different tissues and organisms.",

While the parasitoid lifestyle has evolved numerous times in different insect groups, research has focused almost exclusively on Hymenoptera from the parasitica clade. The genomes of several members of this group have been sequenced, but no genomic resources are available from any of the other, independent evolutionary origins of the parasitoid lifestyle. Our aim here was to develop genomic resources for three parasitoid insects outside the parasitica. We present draft genome assemblies for Goniozus legneri, a parasitoid Hymenopteran more closely related to the non-parasitoid wasps and bees than to the parasitica wasps, the Coleopteran parasitoid Aleochara bilineata and the Dipteran parasitoid Paykullia maculata. The genome assemblies are fragmented, but complete in terms of gene content. We also provide preliminary structural annotations. We anticipate that these genomic resources will be valuable for testing the generality of findings obtained from parasitica wasps in future comparative studies.\\n\\nData availabilityThe Whole Genome Shotgun projects have been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accessions NCVS00000000 (G. legneri), NBZA00000000 (A. bilineata) and NDXZ00000000 (P. maculata).

Despite known variation in opsin repertoires and associated visual phenotypes, the genetic basis of such patterns has not been examined at each step of the central dogma. By comparing sequences, gene expression, and protein localization across a hyperdiverse group of mammals, noctilionoid bats, we find evidence that independent losses of S-opsin arose through disruptions at different stages of protein synthesis, while maintenance relates to frugivory. Discordance between DNA, RNA, and protein reveals that the loss of short-wave sensitivity in some lineages resulted from transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in addition to degradation of open reading frames. These mismatches imply that visual phenotypes cannot reliably be predicted from genotypes alone, and connect ecology to multiple mechanisms behind the loss of color in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBrain size is expected to evolve by a balance between cognitive benefits and energetic costs. Several influential hypotheses have suggested that large brains may be especially beneficial in social contexts. Group living and competition may pose unique cognitive challenges to individuals and favor the evolution of increased cognitive ability. Evidence comes from comparative studies on the link between social complexity and brain morphology, but the strength of empirical support has recently been challenged. In addition, the behavioral mechanisms that would link cognitive ability to sociality are rarely studied. Here we take an alternative approach and investigate experimentally how brain size can relate to the social competence of individuals within species, a problem that so far has remained unresolved. We use the unique guppy brain size selection line model system to evaluate whether large brains are advantageous by allowing individuals to better assess their performance in a social contest situation. Based on theoretical literature, we predict that contest duration should depend on the brain size of the loser, as it is the capitulation of the losing individual that ends the fight.\\n\\nResultsFirst, we show that studying the movement of competitors during contests allows for precise estimation of the dominance timeline in guppies, even when overt aggression is typically one-sided and delayed. Second, we staged contests between pairs of male that had been artificially selected for large and small relative brain size, with demonstrated differences in cognitive ability. We show that dominance was established much earlier in contests with large-brained losers, whereas the brain size of the winner had no effect. Following our prediction, large-brained individuals gave up more quickly when they were going to lose.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that large-brained individuals assess their performance in contests better and that social competence indeed can depend on brain size. Conflict resolution may therefore be an important behavioral mechanism behind macro-evolutionary patterns between sociality and brain size. Since conflict is ubiquitous among group-living animals, the possible effects of the social environment on the evolution of cognition may be more broadly applicable than previously thought.",

Previously, RNA was sequenced by the chemical degradation of radiolabelled RNA, a difficult method that produced only short sequences. Instead, RNA has usually been sequenced indirectly by copying it into cDNA, which is often amplified to dsDNA by PCR and subsequently analyzed using a variety of DNA sequencing methods. We designed an adapter to short highly conserved termini of the influenza virus genome to target the (-) sense RNA into a protein nanopore on the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Utilizing this method and total RNA extracted from the allantoic fluid of infected chicken eggs, we demonstrate successful sequencing of the complete influenza virus genome with 100% nucleotide coverage, 99% consensus identity, and 99% of reads mapped to influenza. By utilizing the same methodology we can redesign the adapter in order to expand the targets to include viral mRNA and (+) sense cRNA, which are essential to the viral life cycle. This has the potential to identify and quantify splice variants and base modifications, which are not practically measurable with current methods.",

    "abstract": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes severe infectious disease in poultry, and selectively kills tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. In this report, we revealed the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced apoptosis via investigation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related unfolded protein response (UPR) in HeLa cells. We found that NDV infection induced the expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP via PKR-eIF2 pathway. Knock down and exogenous expression studies showed that CHOP promoted cell apoptosis by down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and MCL-1, promotion of pro-apoptotic JNK and p38 signaling, and suppression of pro-survival AKT signaling. Meanwhile, CHOP facilitated NDV proliferation. Furthermore, virus infection activated IRE1, another ER stress sensor, thereby promoting the mRNA splicing of XBP1 and resulting in the translation of transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1s entered into cell nucleus, promoted the expression of ER chaperones and components of ER associated degradation (ERAD). Exogenous expression of XBP1s helped IBV proliferation, and silence of XBP1s reduced virus proliferation. Meanwhile, exogenous expression and knock down studies demonstrated that IRE1 activated pro-apoptotic JNK signaling, promoted apoptosis and inflammation. In conclusion, our current study demonstrates that the induction of CHOP and activation of IRE1-XBP1/JNK signaling cascades promote apoptosis and benefit NDV proliferation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEIt is well known that NDV kills host animal and tumor cells by inducing cell apoptosis. Although several studies investigate the apoptotic phenomena in NDV-infected tumor cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying this oncolytic virus induced apoptosis is not well understood yet. In this study, we focus on characterization of the ER stress responses in NDV-infected tumor cells, and find that virus induces apoptosis by up-regulation or activation of several unfolded protein responses (UPR) related transcription factors and signaling: such as ATF4, CHOP and XBP1s, and pro-apoptotic kinases (IRE1, JNK, p38). Moreover, activation of these transcription factors and signaling cascades helps virus proliferation. Our study dissects the UPR induced apoptosis in NDV-infected tumor cells, and provides the evidence that UPR favors NDV proliferation.",

While previous work has focused on classification algorithms to identify the most likely stimulus label in a predefined set of categories, fewer studies have approached a full stimulus reconstruction task. Outstanding questions revolve around the type of algorithm that is most suited to decoding (i.e. full reconstruction, in the context of this study), especially in the presence of strong encoding non-linearities, and the possible role of pairwise correlations. We present, here, the first pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of a complex natural stimulus from 2-photon calcium imaging responses of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We decoded the activity of approximately 100 neurons from layer 2/3 using an optimal linear estimator and an artificial neural network. We also investigated how much accuracy is lost in this decoding operation when ignoring pairwise neural correlations. We found that a simple linear estimator is sufficient to extract relevant stimulus features from the neural responses, and that it was not significantly outperformed by a non-linear decoding algorithm. The importance of pairwise correlations for reconstruction accuracy was also limited. The results of this study suggest that, conditional on the spatial and temporal limits of the recording technique, V1 neurons display linear readout properties, with low information content in the joint distribution of their activity.",

    "abstract": "Generating a complete, de novo genome assembly for prokaryotes is often considered a solved problem. However, we here show that Pseudomonas koreensis P19E3 harbors multiple, near identical repeat pairs up to 70 kilobase pairs in length. Beyond long repeats, the P19E3 assembly was further complicated by a shufflon region. Its complex genome could not be de novo assembled with long reads produced by Pacific Biosciences technology, but required very long reads from the Oxford Nanopore Technology. Another important factor for a full genomic resolution was the choice of assembly algorithm.\\n\\nImportantly, a repeat analysis indicated that very complex bacterial genomes represent a general phenomenon beyond Pseudomonas. Roughly 10% of 9331 complete bacterial and a handful of 293 complete archaeal genomes represented this dark matter for de novo genome assembly of prokaryotes. Several of these dark matter genome assemblies contained repeats far beyond the resolution of the sequencing technology employed and likely contain errors, other genomes were closed employing labor-intense steps like cosmid libraries, primer walking or optical mapping. Using very long sequencing reads in combination with assemblers capable of resolving long, near identical repeats will bring most prokaryotic genomes within reach of fast and complete de novo genome assembly.",

    "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation plays a critical role in regulating transcript levels in eukaryotic cells. Previous work by us and others has shown that codon identity exerts a powerful influence on mRNA stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, studies using a handful of reporter mRNAs show that optimal codons increase translation elongation rate, which in turn increase mRNA stability. However, a direct link between elongation rate and mRNA stability has not been established across the entire yeast transcriptome. In addition, there is evidence from work in higher eukaryotes that amino acid identity influences mRNA stability, raising the question as to whether the impact of translation elongation on mRNA decay is at the level of tRNA decoding, amino acid incorporation, or some combination of each. To address these questions, we performed ribosome profiling of wildtype yeast. In good agreement with other studies, our data showed faster codon-specific elongation over optimal codons and faster transcript-level elongation correlating with transcript optimality. At both the codon-level and transcript-level, faster elongation correlated with increased mRNA stability. These findings were reinforced by showing increased translation efficiency and kinetics for a panel of 11 HIS3 reporter mRNAs of increasing codon optimality. While we did observe that elongation measured by ribosome profiling is composed of both amino acid identity and synonymous codon effects, further analyses of these data establish that A-site tRNA decoding rather than other steps of translation elongation is driving mRNA decay in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive neurodevelopmental conditions that often involve mutations affecting synaptic mechanisms. Recently, the involvement of cerebellum in ASD has been suggested but the underlying functional alterations remained obscure. We investigated single-neuron and microcircuit properties in IB2 KO mice, which present a cerebellar phenotype associated with ASD. Granule cells showed a larger NMDA receptor-mediated current and enhanced intrinsic excitability raising the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Furthermore, the spatial organization of granular layer responses to mossy fibers shifted from a Mexican hat to stovepipe hat profile, with stronger excitation in the core and weaker inhibition in the surround. Finally, the size and extension of long-term synaptic plasticity was remarkably increased. These results show for the first time that hyper-excitability and hyper-plasticity disrupt signal transfer in the granular layer of IB2 KO mice supporting cerebellar involvement in the pathogenesis of ASD.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a crucial step in tumor progression, as this process allows tumors to recruit new blood vessels and obtain oxygen and nutrients to sustain growth. Therefore, inhibiting angiogenesis remains a viable strategy for cancer therapy. However, anti-angiogenic therapy has not proved to be effective in reducing tumor growth across a wide range of tumors, and no reliable predictive biomarkers have been found to determine the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatment. Using our previously established computational model of tumor-bearing mice, we sought to determine whether tumor growth kinetic parameters could be used to predict the outcome of anti-angiogenic treatment. A model trained with datasets from six in vivo mice studies was used to generate a randomized in silico tumor-bearing mouse population. We analyzed tumor growth in untreated mice (control) and mice treated with an anti-angiogenic agent and determined the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates based on simulated tumor volume data. We found that the ratio between two kinetic parameters, k0 and k1, which characterize the tumors exponential and linear growth rates, as well as k1 alone, can be used as prognostic biomarkers of population survival outcome. Our work demonstrates a robust, quantitative approach for identifying tumor growth kinetic parameters as prognostic biomarkers and serves as a template that can be used to identify other biomarkers for anti-angiogenic treatment.",

Surprisingly, wild-type H{gamma}D catalyzes aggregation of its cataract related W42Q variant while itself remaining soluble - the inverse of the classical prion-like scenario whereby misfolded polypeptides catalyze aggregation of natively folded ones. The search for a biochemical mechanism of catalysis of W42Q aggregation by WT has revealed that WT H{gamma}D can transfer a disulfide bond to the W42Q variant. The transferred disulfide kinetically traps an aggregation-prone intermediate made accessible by the W42Q mutation, facilitating light-scattering aggregation of the W42Q variant. The aggregating variant thus becomes a disulfide sink, removing the disulfides from solution. Such redox \\\"hot potato\\\" competitions among wild-type and mutant or modified polypeptides may be relevant for many long-lived proteins that function in oxidizing environments. In these cases aggregation may be forestalled by inhibiting disulfide flow toward damaged polypeptides.",

We created a comprehensive database of transcripts from 29 public RNA sequencing datasets, officially predicted genes from Ensembl plants, and common contaminants in which to search for protein-level evidence. We re-analysed nine publicly accessible rice proteomics datasets. In total, we identified 420K peptide spectrum matches from 47K peptides and 8,187 protein groups. 4168 peptides were initially classed as putative novel peptides (not matching official genes). Following a strict filtration scheme to rule out other possible explanations, we discovered 1,584 high confidence novel peptides. The novel peptides were clustered into 692 genomic loci where our results suggest annotation improvements. 80% of the novel peptides had an ortholog match in the curated protein sequence set from at least one other plant species. For the peptides clustering in intergenic regions (and thus potentially new genes), 101 loci were identified, for which 43 had a high-confidence hit for a protein domain. Our results can be displayed as tracks on the Ensembl genome or other browsers supporting Track Hubs, to support re-annotation of the rice genome.",

    "abstract": "The revolution in fluorescence microscopy enables sub-diffraction-limit (\\\"superresolution\\\") localization of hundreds or thousands of copies of two differently labeled proteins in the same live cell. In typical experiments, fluorescence from the entire three-dimensional (3D) cell body is projected along the z-axis of the microscope to form a 2D image at the camera plane. For imaging of two different species, here denoted \\\"red\\\" and \\\"green\\\", a significant biological question is the extent to which the red and green spatial distributions are positively correlated, anti-correlated, or uncorrelated. A commonly used statistic for assessing the degree of linear correlation between two image matrices R and G is the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). PCC should vary from -1 (perfect anti-correlation) to 0 (no linear correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation). However, in the special case of spherocylindrical bacterial cells such as E. coli or B. subtilis, we show that the PCC fails both qualitatively and quantitatively. PCC returns the same +1 value for 2D projections of distributions that are either perfectly correlated in 3D or completely uncorrelated in 3D. The PCC also systematically underestimates the degree of anti-correlation between the projections of two perfectly anti-correlated 3D distributions. The problem is that the projection of a random spatial distribution within the 3D spherocylinder is non-random in 2D, whereas PCC compares every matrix element of R or G with the constant mean value[Formula] or[Formula] . We propose a modified Pearson Correlation Coefficient (MPCC) that corrects this problem for spherocylindrical cell geometry by using the proper reference matrix for comparison with R and G. Correct behavior of MPCC is confirmed for a variety of numerical simulations and on experimental distributions of HU and RNA polymerase in live E. coli cells. The MPCC concept should be generalizable to other cell shapes.",

Here we have used paired recordings of each type of interneuron with a postsynaptic pyramidal neuron in layer II-IV of the adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) to characterize the interneuron action potentials (AP), evoked IPSC characteristics and response to the GAT-1 inhibitor NNC 711 and the N-type Ca-channel inhibitor {omega}-conotoxin GVIA. GABA released from FS BCs were insensitive to {omega}-conotoxin GVIA (0.5 M), the postsynaptic response did not desensitize and the IPSC was unchanged in NNC 711 (2 M). Conversely, IPSCs generated by APs from NGF INs were 80 % inhibited by {omega}-conotoxin GVIA, displayed a strong degree of desensitization and the decay-time of the IPSCs doubled in NNC 711. We used these pharmacological differences to identify the source of GABA in paradigms of synaptic overspill induced by extracellular stimulation. The decaytime of the electrically evoked event doubled in NNC 711 and this increase was reversed by subsequent application of {omega}-conotoxin GVIA, suggesting that the source of GABA responding to NNC 711 originate from axons that terminate on pyramidal neuron dendrites and employ N-type Ca-channels for release.",

    "abstract": "The size of a cell sets the scale for all biochemical processes within it, thereby affecting cellular fitness and survival. Hence, cell size needs to be kept within certain limits and relatively constant over multiple generations. However, how cells measure their size and use this information to regulate growth and division remains controversial. Here, we present two mechanistic mathematical models of the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) cell cycle to investigate competing hypotheses on size control: inhibitor dilution and titration of nuclear sites. Our results suggest that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism, in which cell growth dilutes the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 against the constant activator Cln3, can facilitate size homeostasis. This is achieved by utilising a positive feedback loop to establish a fixed size threshold for the SO_SCPCAPTARTC_SCPCAP transition, which efficiently couples cell growth to cell cycle progression. Yet, we show that inhibitor dilution cannot reproduce the size of mutants that alter the cells overall ploidy and WHI5 gene copy number. By contrast, size control through titration of Cln3 against a constant number of genomic binding sites for the transcription factor SBF recapitulates both size homeostasis and the size of these mutant strains. Moreover, this model produces an imperfect  sizer behaviour in G1 and a  timer in S/G2/M, which combine to yield an  adder over the whole cell cycle; an observation recently made in experiments. Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.",

The ERM protein ezrin is abundant and associated with cellular membranes that are flat or with positive or negative curvatures. Using in vitro and cell biology approaches, we assess mechanisms of ezrins enrichment on curved membranes. We evidence that ezrin (ezrinWT) and its phosphomimetic mutant T567D (ezrinTD) do not deform membranes but self-assemble anti-parallelly, zipping adjacent membranes. EzrinTDs specific conformation reduces intermolecular ezrin interactions, allows binding to actin filaments, and promotes ezrin binding to positively curved membranes. While neither ezrinTD nor ezrinWT senses negative membrane curvature alone, we demonstrate that interacting with curvature sensors I-BAR-domain proteins facilitates ezrin enrichment in negatively curved membrane protrusions. Overall, our work reveals new mechanisms, specific conformation or binding to a curvature sensor partner, for targeting curvature insensitive proteins to curved membranes.",

Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of circRNA expression in human hematopoietic progenitors, and in differentiated lymphoid and myeloid cells. We here show that the expression of circRNA is cell-type specific, and increases upon maturation. circRNA splicing variants can also be cell-type specific. Furthermore, nucleated hematopoietic cells contain circRNA that have higher expression levels than the corresponding linear RNA. Enucleated blood cells, i.e. platelets and erythrocytes, were suggested to use RNA to maintain their function, respond to environmental factors or to transmit signals to other cells via microvesicles. Here we show that platelets and erythrocytes contain the highest number of circRNA of all hematopoietic cells, and that the type and numbers of circRNA changes during maturation. This cell-type specific expression pattern of circRNA in hematopoietic cells suggests a hithero unappreciated role in differentiation and cellular function.",
