    "abstract": "Gastrotrichs - hairy bellies - are microscopic free-living animals inhabiting marine and freshwater habitats. Based on morphological and early molecular analyses, gastrotrichs were placed close to nematodes, but recent phylogenomic analyses have suggested their close relationship to flatworms (Platyhelminthes) within Spiralia. Small non-coding RNA data on e.g. microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNA) may help to resolve this long-standing question. MiRNAs are short post-transcriptional gene regulators that together with piRNAs play key roles in development. In a  multi-omics approach we here used small-RNA sequencing, available transcriptome and genomic data to unravel the miRNA-and piRNA complements along with the RNAi protein machinery of Lepidodermella squamata (Gastrotricha, Chaetonotida). We identified 52 miRNA genes representing 35 highly conserved miRNA families specific to Eumetazoa, Bilateria, Protostomia, and Spiralia, respectively, with overall high similarities to platyhelminth miRNA complements. In addition, we found four large piRNA clusters that also resemble flatworm piRNAs but not those earlier described for nematodes. Congruently, transcriptomic annotation revealed that the Lepidodermella protein machinery is highly similar to flatworms, too. Taken together, miRNA, piRNA and protein data support a close relationship of gastrotrichs and flatworms.",

    "abstract": "Mating success is the main source of fitness variation in males, meaning that males should capitalise on all opportunities for mating. Strong selection on male mating success should also reduce genetic variation in male mating traits relative to other traits. We quantified mating latency, mating duration and productivity in males of the tropical fruitfly, Drosophila birchii, from 30 isofemale lines collected from across two elevational gradients, when they were given opportunities to mate with up to four females consecutively. Male remating rates were low compared to other Drosophila (only 14 - 27% of males achieved a fourth mating), with mean mating durations approximately doubling across successive copulations. However, although successive remating produced progressively fewer offspring, it consistently increased overall male reproductive success, with males that mated four times more than doubling offspring number compared to males mating only once. We also found no reduction in the productivity of sons emerging from later matings, indicating a sustained cumulative fitness benefit to remating. Heritable variation was observed for most traits (H2 = 0.035 - 0.292) except mating latency, but there was no divergence in trait means with elevation. The observed restricted remating ability of male D. birchii, despite the clear benefits of remating, may be due to a low encounter rate with females in the field, leading to high investment per gamete (or ejaculate). However, it remains unclear why genetic variation in these traits is high, given we observe no variation in these traits across elevational gradients known to affect local population density.",

    "abstract": "The biogenic amine octopamine (OA) and its precursor tyramine (TA) are involved in controlling a plethora of different physiological and behavioral processes. The tyramine-{beta}-hydroxylase (t{beta}h) gene encodes the enzyme catalyzing the last synthesis step from TA to OA. Here, we report differential dominance (from recessive to overdominant) of the putative null t{beta}hnM18 allele in two behavioral measures in Buridans paradigm (walking speed and stripe deviation) and a proboscis extension assay in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The behavioral analysis of transgenic t{beta}h expression experiments in mutant and wild type flies as well as of OA- and TA-receptor mutants revealed a complex interaction of both aminergic systems. Our analysis suggests that the different neuronal networks responsible for the three phenotypes show differential sensitivity to t{beta}h gene expression levels. The evidence suggests that this sensitivity is brought about by a TA/OA opponent system modulating the involved neuronal circuits. This conclusion entails important implications for standard transgenic techniques, commonly used in functional genetics.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells display an altered metabolism with an increased glycolysis and glucose uptake. Anti-cancer strategies targeting glycolysis through metabolic inhibitors have been considered. Particularly, the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) is imported into cells and phosphorylated into 2DG-6-phosphate, a toxic by-product that inhibits glycolysis. Recent data suggest that 2DG has additional effects in the cell, and resistance to 2DG has also been observed. Using yeast as a model, we engaged an unbiased, mass-spectrometry-based approach to probe the cellular effects of 2DG on the proteome and study resistance mechanisms. This revealed that two 2DG-6-phosphate phosphatases, Dog1 and Dog2, are induced upon exposure to 2DG and participate in 2DG detoxication. 2DG induces Dog2 by upregulating several signaling pathways, such as the MAPK (Hog1/p38)-based stress-responsive pathway, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) triggered by 2DG-induced ER stress, and the MAPK (Slt2)-based Cell Wall Integrity pathway. Thus, 2DG-induced interference with cellular signaling rewires the expression of these endogenous phosphatases to promote 2DG resistance. Consequently, loss of the UPR or CWI pathways leads to hypersensitivity to 2DG. In contrast, DOG2 is transcriptionally repressed by glucose availability in a Snf1/AMPK-dependent manner, and mutants impaired in this pathway are 2DG-resistant. The characterization and genome resequencing of spontaneous 2DG-resistant mutants revealed that DOG2 overexpression is a common strategy to achieve 2DG resistance. The human Dog2 orthologue, HDHD1, also displays 2DG-6-phosphate phosphatase activity in vitro, and its overexpression confers 2DG resistance in HeLa cells, which has important implications for potential future chemotherapies involving 2DG.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency (PID) is characterised by recurrent and often life-threatening infections, autoimmunity and cancer, and it presents major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Although the most severe forms present in early childhood, the majority of patients present in adulthood, typically with no apparent family history and a variable clinical phenotype of widespread immune dysregulation: about 25% of patients have autoimmune disease, allergy is prevalent, and up to 10% develop lymphoid malignancies1-3. Consequently, in sporadic PID genetic diagnosis is difficult and the role of genetics is not well defined. We addressed these challenges by performing whole genome sequencing (WGS) of a large PID cohort of 1,318 participants. Analysis of coding regions of 886 index cases found disease-causing mutations in known monogenic PID genes in 10.3%, while a Bayesian approach (BeviMed4) identified multiple potential new candidate genes, including IVNS1ABP. Exploration of the non-coding genome revealed deletions in regulatory regions which contribute to disease causation. Finally, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified PID-associated loci and uncovered evidence for co-localisation of, and interplay between, novel high penetrance monogenic variants and common variants (at the PTPN2 and SOCS1 loci). This begins to explain the contribution of common variants to variable penetrance and phenotypic complexity in PID. Thus, a cohort-based WGS approach to PID diagnosis can increase diagnostic yield while deepening our understanding of the key pathways influencing human immune responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "A core event in the integrated stress response, an adaptive pathway common to all eukaryotic cells in response to various stress stimuli, is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Normally, unphosphorylated eIF2 transfers methionylated initiator tRNA to the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. In contrast, phosphorylated eIF2 inhibits its specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, which leads to a deficiency of active eIF2 and resultant global translation repression. To unveil the mechanism by which the eIF2 phosphorylation status regulates the eIF2B nucleotide exchange activity, we determined cryo-electron microscopic and crystallographic structures of eIF2B in complex with unphosphorylated or phosphorylated eIF2. Intriguingly, the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of eIF2 bind to eIF2B in completely different manners: the nucleotide exchange-active \\\"productive\\\" and nucleotide exchange-inactive \\\"nonproductive\\\" modes, respectively. The nonproductive-mode phosphorylated eIF2, extending from one of the two eIF2B \\\"central cavities\\\", not only prevents nucleotide exchange on itself, but also sterically prevents unphosphorylated eIF2 from productively binding on the other central cavity of eIF2B, which explains how phosphorylated eIF2 inhibits eIF2B.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA drastic change in the binding mode of eIF2 to eIF2B induces translational control in stress.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila circadian pacemaker consists of transcriptional feedback loops subjected to both post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. While post-translational regulatory mechanisms have been studied in detail, much less is known about circadian post-transcriptional control. To have a better understanding of the role and mechanisms of circadian post-transcriptional regulation, we targeted 364 RNA binding and RNA associated proteins with RNA interference. Among the 43 genes we identified was the alternative splicing regulator P-element somatic inhibitor (PSI). PSI downregulation shortens the period of circadian rhythms both in the brain and in peripheral tissues. Interestingly, we found that PSI regulates the thermosensitive alternative splicing of timeless (tim), promoting splicing events favored at warm temperature over those increased at cold temperature. Moreover, the period of circadian behavior was insensitive to PSI downregulation when flies could produce functional TIM proteins only from a transgene that cannot form the thermosensitive splicing isoforms. Therefore, we conclude that PSI regulates the period of Drosophila circadian rhythms through its modulation of the tim splicing pattern.",

This study compared the root, shoot and physiological traits under drought stress (DS) and well-watered (WW) conditions of various sugarcane varieties grown in rhizoboxes in a greenhouse at the Field Crops Research Station of Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. Data were recorded for the root, shoot and physiological traits (relative water content, stomatal conductance, SPAD chlorophyll meter reading and chlorophyll fluorescence) at 90 days after transplanting. Root samples were recovered from 11 soil layers at 10 cm intervals from the top to the bottom of the rhizobox, for root length and root dry weight measurements. Drought was imposed on sugarcane at early growth stages altered the root distribution patterns, and differences were evident among the sugarcane genotypes. The sugarcane genotypes adapted to water stress by increasing root length into deeper soil layers. Drought led to increased total root length in KK3, MPT06-166, K88-92, CP38-22, Kps01-12 and KPK98-40. Root lengths and stomatal conductance were positively correlated under WW and DS conditions. Root distribution in the lower soil layers and the percentage of root distribution were higher than those under well-watered conditions. The knowledge gained from this study will aid parental selection in sugarcane breeding programs for drought resistance as the findings strongly suggest that the physiological modification in the root system is a useful drought-resistant mechanism.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDHemorrhagic myocarditis is a potentially fatal complication of excessive levels of systemic inflammation. It has been reported in viral infection, but is also possible in systemic autoimmunity. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the current gold standard for non-invasive detection of suspected inflammatory damage to the heart and changes in T1 and T2 relaxation times are commonly used to detect edema associated with immune cell infiltration and fibrosis. These measurements also form the basis of the Lake Louise Criteria, which define a framework for the CMR-based diagnosis of myocarditis. However, they do not take into account the possibility of hemorrhage leading to tissue iron deposition which strongly influences T1 and T2 measurements and may complicate interpretation based on these two parameters only.\\n\\nMETHODSSystemic inflammation was induced in CFN mice by application of the TLR-7 agonist Resiquimod. Histopathology was performed on heart sections to assess immune cell infiltration (Hematoxylin & Eosin), fibrosis (PicoSirius Red) and tissue iron deposition (Perls Prussian Blue). A multi-parametric cardiac MRI tissue mapping approach measuring T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times was established to non-invasively identify these parameters in this small rodent model.\\n\\nRESULTSResiquimod-treated mice developed severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic myocarditis. We identified patches of cardiac hemorrhage based on the presence of two major MRI phenotypes. Increased T2 with normal T1 and T2* values correlated with infiltration/edema only, while decreased T1, T2, and T2* values identify areas with infiltration/edema in the presence of iron indicating hemorrhagic myocarditis.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONWe show that over-activation of the TLR-7 pathway by Resiquimod treatment of CFN mice induces an early immune response reminiscent of excessive systemic inflammation due to viral infection. This causes internal bleeding which manifests most prominently as severe hemorrhagic myocarditis. We optimized a comprehensive noninvasive in vivo MRI approach based on quantitative measurement of T1, T2 and T2* to demonstrate the presence of diffuse myocardial edema, infiltration and iron deposition without the need of contrast agent administration. We propose that adding quantitative T2* mapping to CMR protocols for detection of myocarditis will improve diagnostic sensitivity and interpretation of disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesEnergy balance disruption due to excess of calorie-rich food is considered to be one of the major players in the current worldwide obesity pandemic. In rodents, a high fat diet (HFD) induces not only obesity, but also inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. To identify factors underlying diet-induced obesity (DIO) resistance we compared the wild-derived mouse strain WSB/EiJ, characterized by a striking resistance to DIO, with the more DIO-sensitive C57BL/6J strain.\\n\\nMethodsWe analysed circulating levels of lipids, cytokines and adipokines as well as hypothalamic markers of inflammatory status and mitochondrial activity in both strains exposed to HFD for three days (3d) or eight weeks (8wk). To identify hypothalamic genes potentially involved in these differential regulations, we selected 86 genes related to inflammation and mitochondrial pathways. We analysed their expression levels by high throughput microfluidic qPCR on RNA extracted from laser micro-dissected arcuate (ARC) and paraventricular (PVN) hypothalamic nuclei of the two strains of mice, under the different HFD treatments.\\n\\nResultsAfter 3d and 8wk HFD, C57BL/6J mice, in contrast to WSB/EiJ, displayed significantly increased body weight gain, and also increased circulating levels of leptin, cholesterol, HDL and LDL. WSB/EiJ mice displayed a lower inflammatory status, both peripherally (lower levels of circulating cytokines) and centrally (less activated microglia in the hypothalamus) as well as more reactive mitochondria in the hypothalamus. Principal Component Analysis and gene ontology analysis of gene expression data showed, first, that datasets segregated as a function of strain and second, allowed to identify the metabolic pathways involved. These results were reinforced by the identification of strain-specific differential expression of several individual hypothalamic genes as well as differential effects of HFD between strains.\\n\\nConclusionsAdaptation to metabolic stress in the DIO-resistant WSB/EiJ strain implicates enhanced lipid metabolism, lower peripheral and hypothalamic inflammatory status and higher mitochondrial activity than in the C57BL/6J strain. These results point to the implication of the hypothalamic inflammatory and mitochondrial pathways as key factors in the control of energy homeostasis and the resistance to DIO.\\n\\nDeclarations of interest: none\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDiet-induced-obesity resistance of WSB/EiJ implicates enhanced lipid metabolism\\nC_LIO_LIWSB/EiJ mice are protected from HFD-induced peripheral and central inflammation\\nC_LIO_LIEnhanced hypothalamic transport and signalling of endocrine molecules in WSB/EiJ\\nC_LIO_LIWSB/EiJ hypothalamic mitochondria dynamics differ from C57BL/6J\\nC_LIO_LIDifferential regulation of hypothalamic inflammatory/mitochondria genes in WSB/EiJ\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Network-biology view of biological systems is a ubiquitous abstraction that emerged in the last two decades to allow a high-level understanding of principles governing them. However, the principles according to which biological systems are organized are still unclear. Here, we investigate if biological networks could be approximated as overlapping, feed-forward networks where the nodes have non-linear activation functions. Such networks have been shown to be universal approximators and their stability has been explored in the context of artificial neural networks. Mathematical formalization of this model followed by numerical simulations based on genomic data allowed us to accurately predict the statistics of gene essentiality in yeast and hence indicate that biological networks might be better understood as a distributed system, comprising potentially unreliable components.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin are molecular motors that move along the microtubules. They function to transport cargoes, vesicles and organelles to designated locations in the cells. KIF3A belongs to the Kinesin-2 family and forms a heterotrimeric complex with KIF3B and KAP3. We have earlier shown that the cargo trafficking activity of KIF3 motor can be regulated by CaMKII kinase and POPX2 phosphatase. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism of KIF3A regulation. We find that KIF3A adopts an auto-inhibited state through the interaction between the motor and tail domains. The motor-tail interaction also hinders the ATPase activity of the motor domain. We show that the phosphorylation status of serine-689/690 (mouse/human) at the C-terminal region of KIF3A is crucial for the motor-tail interaction. The motor domain does not interact well with the tail domain when serine-689 is phosphorylated by CaMKII or mutated to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the non-phosphorylated tail domain folds into the hydrophobic pocket formed by the motor dimers. Phosphorylation of serine-689 results in conformational changes that leads to the relieve of auto-inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Identification of functional non-coding variants (polymorphisms) and their mechanistic interpretation is a major challenge of modern genomics, especially for precision medicine. Transcription factor (TF) binding profiles and epigenomic landscapes in reference samples can help us functionally annotate the genome, but do not provide ready answers regarding the effects of non-coding variants. A promising computational approach is to build models that predict TF-DNA binding from sequence, and use such models to score a variants impact on TF binding strength. Here, we asked if this mechanistic approach to variant interpretation can be combined with information on genotype-phenotype associations to discover important transcription factors regulating phenotypic variation among individuals. We developed a statistical approach that integrates phenotype, genotype, gene expression, TF ChIP-seq and Hi-C chromatin interaction data to answer this question. Using drug sensitivity measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines as the phenotype of interest, we tested if the non-coding variants statistically linked to the phenotype are enriched for strong predicted impact on DNA-binding strength of a TF, and used this test to identify TFs regulating individual differences in the phenotype. Our method relies on a new method for predicting variant impact on TF-DNA binding, that uses a combination of biophysical modelling and machine learning. We report statistical and literature-based support for many of the TFs discovered here as regulators of drug response variation. We show that the use of mechanistically driven variant impact predictors can identify TF-drug associations that would otherwise be missed. We examined in depth the evidence underlying one reported association - that of the transcription factor ELF1 with the drug doxorubicin - and identified several genes that may mediate this regulatory relationship.",

    "abstract": "Although Channelrhodopsin (ChR) is a widely applied light-activated ion channel, important properties such as light-adaptation, photocurrent inactivation, and alteration of the ion selectivity during continuous illumination are not well-understood from a molecular perspective. Herein, we address these open questions using single turn-over electrophysiology, time-resolved step-scan FTIR and Raman spectroscopy of fully dark adapted ChR2. This yields a unifying parallel photocycle model explaining all data: in dark-adapted ChR2, the protonated Schiff base retinal chromophore (RSBH+) adopts an all-trans,C=N-anti conformation only. Upon light activation, a branching reaction into either a 13-cis,C=N-anti or a 13-cis,C=N-syn retinal conformation occurs. The anti-cycle features sequential H+ and Na+ conductance in a late M-like state and an N-like open-channel state. In contrast, the 13-cis,C=N-syn isomer represents a second closed-channel state identical to the long lived P480-state, which has been previously assigned to a late intermediate in a single photocycle model. Light excitation of P480 induces a parallel syn-photocycle with an open channel state of small conductance and high proton selectivity. E90 becomes deprotonated in P480 and stays deprotonated in the C=N-syn-cycle and we show that deprotonation of E90 and successive pore hydration are crucial for late proton conductance following light-adaptation. Parallel anti- and syn-photocycles explain inactivation and ion selectivity changes of ChR2 during continuous illumination, fostering the future rational design of optogenetic tools.\\n\\nSignificance statementUnderstanding the mechanisms of photoactivated biological processes facilitates the development of new molecular tools, engineered for specific optogenetic applications, allowing the control of neuronal activity with light. Here, we use a variety of experimental and theoretical techniques to examine the precise nature of the light-activated ion channel in one of the most important molecular species used in optogenetics, channelrhodopsin-2. Existing models for the photochemical and photophysical pathway after light absorption by the molecule fail to explain many aspects of its observed behavior including the inactivation of the photocurrent under continuous illumination. We resolve this by proposing a new branched photocycle explaining electrical and photochemical channel properties and establishing the structure of intermediates during channel turnover.",

Cancer progression and metastatic spread is reliant on new blood vasculature, or angiogenesis. Tumour-related angiogenesis is regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors secreted from malignant tissue in a stepwise process. Previously we structurally modified the small anti-angiogenic molecule quininib and discovered a more potent anti-angiogenic compound 1, 4 dihydroxy quininib (Q8), an antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-1 with VEGF-independent bioactivity. Here, Q8, quininib (Q1) and five structural analogues were assayed for anti-tumorigenic effects in pre-clinical cancer models. Q8 reduced clone formation of the human colorectal cancer cell line HT29-Luc2. Gene silencing of CysLT1 in HT29-Luc2 cells significantly reduced expression of calpain-2. In human ex vivo colorectal cancer tumour explants, Q8 significantly decreased the secretion of both TIE-2 and VCAM-1 expression. In vivo Q8 was well tolerated up to 50 mg/kg by Balb/C mice and significantly more effective at reducing tumour volume in colorectal tumour xenografts compared to the parent drug quininib. In tumour xenografts, Q8 significantly reduced expression of the angiogenic marker calpain-2 in. In summary, we propose Q8 may act on the TIE-2-Angiopoietin signalling pathway to significantly inhibit the process of tumour angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary adaptations to life on land include changes to the physiology, morphology and behaviour of an animal in response to physical differences between water and air. The visual systems of amphibious species show pronounced morphological adaptations; yet, whether molecular changes also occur remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular evolution of visual pigment genes (opsins) in amphibious and terrestrial fishes belonging to the Salariini division of blennies (Blenniidae). We hypothesized that when conquering land, blenny opsins adapt - in terms of sequence variation and/or gene expression - to match both higher light intensities as well as the broader light spectrum. Using retinal transcriptomes in six species ranging from fully aquatic to fully terrestrial, we found very little variation in opsin gene sequences or gene expression between species. All blennies expressed a single rod opsin gene as well as two cone opsin genes sensitive to longer-wavelengths of light: RH2A-1 (green-sensitive) and LWS (red-sensitive). They also expressed one or two short-wavelength-sensitive cone opsin genes (SWS2A, SWS2A{beta}; blue-sensitive) in a phylogenetically inert manner. However, based on amino acid predictions, both SWS2A proteins confer similar peak spectral sensitivities and differential expression is therefore unlikely to be ecologically significant. Red-sensitivity is likely beneficial for feeding on algae and detritus, the main food source of Salariini blennies, and could be co-adapted to perceive visual displays in terrestrial species, which often use red dorsal fins to signal during aggressive disputes and courtship. Our data suggests that on the molecular level, the visual systems that evolved in aquatic blennies have been retained in species that have transitioned onto land.",

    "abstract": "The underlying genetic changes that regulate the appearance and disappearance of repeated traits, or serial homologs, remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that variation in genomic regions flanking master regulatory genes, also known as input-output genes, controls variation in trait number, making the locus of evolution almost predictable. Other hypotheses implicate genetic variation in up-stream or downstream loci of master control genes. Here, we use the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, a species which exhibits natural variation in eyespot number on the dorsal hindwing, to test these two hypotheses. We first estimated the heritability of dorsal hindwing eyespot number by breeding multiple butterfly families differing in eyespot number, and regressing eyespot number of offspring on mid-parent values. We then estimated the number and identity of independent genetic loci contributing to eyespot number variation by performing a genome-wide association study with restriction site-associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) from multiple individuals varying in number of eyespots sampled across a freely breeding lab population. We found that dorsal hindwing eyespot number has a moderately high heritability of approximately 0.50. In addition, multiple loci near previously identified genes involved in eyespot development display high association with dorsal hindwing eyespot number, suggesting that homolog number variation is likely determined by regulatory changes at multiple loci that build the trait and not by variation at single master regulators or input-output genes.",

Using this method, we map visually-evoked neuronal ensembles in 3D, finding a lack of columnar structure in orientation responses and revealing functional correlations between cortical layers which differ from trial to trial and are missed in sequential imaging. We also reveal functional interactions between presynaptic L1 axons and postsynaptic L2/3 neurons.

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common source of intellectual disability and autism. Extensive studies have been performed on the network and behavioral correlates of the syndrome but our knowledge about intrinsic conductance changes is still limited. In this study we show a differential effect of FMRP Knock Out (KO) in different sub-sections of hippocampus using whole cell patch clamp in mouse hippocampal slices. We observed no significant change in spike numbers in the CA1 region of hippocampus but a significant increase in CA3, in juvenile mice. However, in adult mice we see a reduction in spike number in the CA1 with no significant difference in CA3. In addition, we see increased variability in spike number in CA1 cells following a variety of steady and modulated current step protocols. This effect emerges in adult (8 weeks) but not juvenile (4 weeks) mice. This increased spiking variability was correlated with reduced spike number and with elevated AHP. The increased AHP arose from elevated SK currents (small conductance calcium activated potassium channels) but other currents involved in mAHP, such as Ih and M, were not significantly different. We obtained a partial rescue of the cellular variability phenotype when we blocked SK current using the specific blocker apamin. Our observations provide a single cell correlate of the network observations of response variability and loss of synchronization, and suggest that elevation of SK currents in FXS may provide a partial mechanistic explanation for this difference.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFragile-X syndrome leads to a range of intellectual disability effects and autism. We have found differential effect of FMRP KO in different sub sections of hippocampus where it caused an increased spiking in CA3 in juveniles and reduced spiking in CA1, in adults. We have also found that even individual neurons with this mutation exhibit increased variability in their activity patterns. Importantly, this effect emerges after six weeks of age in mice. We showed that a specific ion channel protein, SK channel, was partially responsible, and blockage of these channels led to a partial restoration of cellular activity. This is interesting as it provides a possible molecular link between activity variability in single cells, and reported irregularity in network activity.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus plays important roles in memory formation and retrieval through sharp-wave-ripples. Recent studies have shown that certain neuron populations in the prefrontal cortex exhibit coordinated reactivations during awake ripple events. Also, the reactivation seems stronger during initial awake learning. These experimental findings suggest that the awake ripple is an important biomarker, through which the hippocampus interacts with the neocortex to assist the memory formation and retrieval. However, the computational mechanisms of this ripple based hippocampal-cortical coordination are still not clear. In this work, we build a biophysical model that includes both CA1 and layer V networks of the prefrontal cortex to investigate the possible mechanisms, by which the memory traces in the hippocampus can be transferred to prefrontal cortex. We first show that the local field potentials generated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex exhibit ripple range activities that are consistent with the recent experimental studies. Then, we find that the sequence information stored in the hippocampus can be successfully transferred to the prefrontal cortex recurrent networks through spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and sequence replays. Further, we investigate the mechanisms of memory retrieval in the PFC network. Our findings suggest that the stored memory traces in the prefrontal cortex network can be retrieved through two different mechanisms, namely the cell-specific input and non-specific spontaneous background noise. Finally, we show that more SWRs and an optimal background noise level will both contribute to better sequence reactivations in the PFC network during memory retrieval. Our study presents a possible explanation for the memory trace transfer from the hippocampus to the neocortex through ripple coupling in awake states and reports two different mechanisms by which the stored memory traces can be successfully retrieved.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe hippocampal-cortical interactions have been found to be important for learning and memory. Recent experimental work reports interesting coordinations between the hippocampus and neocortex during ripple events in quiet awake states. Investigating this phenomena is critical for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which hippocampus contributes to the long-term memory formation in the neocortex. To this end, we build a biophysical computational model for both the hippocampal CA1 and prefrontal cortex networks. We demonstrate that under STDP rule and sequential inputs, the memory traces initially stored in the hippocampus can be transferred to the neocortex through the ripple events. The stored memory traces in the PFC network can be reactivated by two different mechanisms, namely the cell-specific inputs and non-specific background noises. Our study suggests that both the ripple event numbers and the level of background noises jointly determine the quality of memory retrieval during reactivation.",

    "abstract": "By applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in muscles of the contralateral hand during reaction time (RT) tasks, many studies have reported a strong suppression of MEPs during action preparation, a phenomenon called preparatory inhibition. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding the role of this inhibition, with the predominant view suggesting that it would help action selection. However, this assumption is still a matter of debate. Here, we aimed at directly addressing this idea by comparing MEPs in a task that required subjects to select a finger response within a set of predefined options (choice RT task: left or right index finger abduction) or when subjects simply had to provide the same finger response on every trial, in the absence of choice (simple RT task). Moreover, we minimized any effect that could be associated with other forms of inhibition. In both versions of the task, TMS was applied on both M1 (double-coil protocol) at several time points between the go signal and the left or right index finger response, eliciting MEPs bilaterally in the prime mover (index finger agonist) and in an irrelevant muscle (pinky agonist). Overall, MEP suppression was moderate in this study; it was only found for the irrelevant muscle. As such, MEPs in the index agonist were facilitated when elicited in a responding hand (e.g. left MEPs preceding left responses) and remained mostly unchanged in a non-responding hand (e.g. left MEPs preceding right responses). In contrast, MEPs were almost always suppressed in the pinky muscle when elicited in the non-responding hand and sometimes also in the responding hand. Importantly, this effect was more consistent in the choice than in the simple RT task, supporting the view that preparatory inhibition may assist action selection. Moreover, the fact that it sometimes concerned the responding hand is coherent with the idea of a global process, suppressing broadly the motor system.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAddressed the debated idea that preparatory inhibition assists action selection\\nC_LIO_LICompared MEPs in simple and choice RT tasks (no catch, no delay)\\nC_LIO_LIDetected preparatory suppression of MEPs, although weaker than usual\\nC_LIO_LIObserved a more consistent suppression of MEPs in the choice than simple setting\\nC_LIO_LIProvided support for action selection hypothesis, with traces of broad inhibition\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for any animal (or sampling technique) is to avoid wasting time by searching for resources (information) in places already found to be unprofitable. In biology, this challenge is particularly strong when the organism is a central place forager - returning to a nest between foraging bouts - because it is destined repeatedly to cover much the same ground. This problem will be particularly acute if many individuals forage from the same central place, as in social insects such as the ants. Foraging (sampling) performance may be greatly enhanced by coordinating movement trajectories such that each ant ( walker) visits separate parts of the surrounding (unknown) space. We find experimental evidence for an externalised spatial memory in Temnothorax albipennis ants: chemical markers (either pheromones or cues such as cuticular hydrocarbon footprints) that are used by nestmates to mark explored space. We show these markers could be used by the ants to scout the space surrounding their nest more efficiently through indirect coordination. We also develop a simple model of this marking behaviour that can be applied in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Baddeley et al. 2019). This substantially enhances the performance of standard methods like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in sampling from sparse probability distributions (such as those confronted by the ants) with little additional computational cost. Our Bayesian framework for superorganismal behaviour motivates the evolution of exploratory mechanisms such as trail marking in terms of enhanced collective information processing.",

First, ZnO NPs were synthesized using hydrothermal method and their size and morphology were determined by SEM and TEM methods and then to study its toxicity on the HSA structure were used UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Also, in order to investigate interaction mechanism of ZnO NP with HSA at the atomistic level was used molecular dynamics (md) simulation. The obtained images from SEM and TEM showed that ZnO NPs were nanosheet with size of less than 40 nm. The results of spectroscopic studies showed ZnO NPs lead to significant conformational changes in the proteins absorption and emission spectra. Moreover, md results showed the minor structure changes in HSA due to interaction with ZnO NP during the 100 ns simulation and the formation of nanoparticle-protein corona complex that is mainly because of electrostatic interactions between charge groups of HSA and ZnO NP.",

    "abstract": "Centrioles are essential microtubule-based organelles organizing cilia and centrosomes. Their mode of biogenesis is semi-conservative: each pre-existing centriole scaffolds the formation of a new one, a process coordinated with the cell cycle. By contrast, multiciliated progenitors with two centrosomal centrioles massively amplify centrioles to support the nucleation of hundred of motile cilia and transport vital fluids. This occurs through cell type-specific organelles called deuterosomes, composed of centrosome-related elements, and is regulated by the cell cycle machinery. Deuterosome-dependent centriole amplification was proposed for decades to occur de novo, i.e. independently from pre-existing centrioles. Challenging this hypothesis, we recently reported an accumulation of procentriole and deuterosome precursors at the centrosomal daughter centriole during centriole amplification in brain multiciliated cells. Here we further investigate the relationship between the centrosome and the dynamic of centriole amplification by (i) characterizing the centrosome behavior during the centriole amplification dynamics and (ii) assessing the dynamics of amplification in centrosome-depleted cells. Surprisingly, although our data strengthen the centrosomal origin of amplified centrioles, we show limited consequences in deuterosome/centriole number when we deplete centrosomal centrioles. Interestingly, in absence of centrosomal centrioles, procentrioles are still amplified sequentially from a single focal region, characterized by microtubule convergence and pericentriolar material (PCM) self-assembly. The relevance of deuterosome association with the daughter centriole as well as the role of the PCM in the focal and sequential genesis of centrioles in absence of centrosomal centrioles are discussed.",

This concept was challenged by the discovery of neuro-mesodermal progenitors, a bi-potent cell population that gives rise to both spinal neural tube and somites. In line with their proposed potency, these cells are considered to co-express the neural marker Sox2 and the mesodermal marker T/Brachyury. We performed genetic lineage tracing in mouse embryos and confirmed that T-expressing cells give rise to both neural tube and mesoderm. Surprisingly, however, Sox2-expressing cell derivatives colonise only the neural tube after embryonic day 8.5. Deletion of Sox2 in T-expressing cells was compatible with an otherwise normal neural tube and paraxial mesoderm. Moreover, Sox2 expression is absent from the chordoneural hinge, where neuro-mesodermal progenitors are located. Our findings demonstrate that neuro-mesodermal progenitors express T but not Sox2, suggesting the need for re-evaluation of the neuro-mesodermal progenitor hypothesis.",

This is a cause of bias in the estimation of parameters relevant to the study and can lead to inaccurate conclusions when evaluating associations among pollutants, disease risk and biomarkers. Although the presence of measurement error in such studies has been recognized as a potential problem, it is rarely considered in applications and practical solutions are still lacking.\\n\\nIn this work, we formulate Bayesian measurement error models and apply them to study the link between air pollution and omic signals. The data we use stem from the \\\"Oxford Street II Study\\\", a randomized crossover trial in which 60 volunteers walked for two hours in a traffic-free area (Hyde Park) and in a busy shopping street (Oxford Street) of London. Metabolomic measurements were made in each individual as well as air pollution measurements, in order to investigate the association between short-term exposure to traffic related air pollution and perturbation of metabolic pathways. We implemented error-corrected models in a classical framework and used the flexibility of Bayesian hierarchical models to account for dependencies among omic signals, as well as among different pollutants. Models were implemented using traditional MCMC simulative methods as well as integrated Laplace approximation.\\n\\nThe inclusion of a classical measurement error term resulted in variable estimates of the association between omic signals and traffic related air pollution (TRAP) measurements, where the direction of the bias was not predictable a priori. The models were successful in including and accounting for different correlation structures, both among omic signals and among different pollutant exposures. In general, more associations were identified when the correlation among omics and among pollutants were modeled, and their number increased when a measurement error term additionally included in the multivariate models (particularly for the associations between metabolomics and NO2).",

By collaborating with online communities of amateur naturalists, investigators can greatly increase the amount and diversity of phenotypic data in their analyses while simultaneously engaging with a public audience.

We then show that our protocol for measuring wing phenotypes from photographs yields accurate measurements in two species of Calopterygid damselflies. Next, we show that, while most observations of our target species were made by members of the large and established community of amateur naturalists at iNaturalist.org, our efforts to increase recruitment through various outreach initiatives were successful. Finally, we present results from two case studies: (1) an analysis of wing pigmentation in male smoky rubyspots (Hetaerina titia) showing previously undocumented geographical variation in a seasonal polyphenism, and (2) an analysis of variation in the relative size of the wing spots of male banded demoiselles (Calopteryx splendens) in Great Britain questioning previously documented evidence for character displacement. Our results demonstrate that our protocol can be used to create high quality phenotypic datasets using citizen scientists photographs, and, when combined with metadata (e.g., date and location), can greatly broaden the scope of studies of geographical and temporal variation in phenotypes. Our analyses of the recruitment and engagement process also demonstrate that collaborating with an online community of amateur naturalists can be a powerful way to conduct hypothesis-driven research aiming to elucidate the processes that impact trait evolution at landscape scales.",

In contrast to classical approach to event-related oscillations which relies on either stimulus- or response-locked time reference, an approach assigned as \"oscillatory process-related oscillations\" has been introduced. The method enables us to overcome the variability of latency period of the SCR. The hypothesis about the existence of the SCR-related brain oscillations and their delta nature has been confirmed through the grand averaging method. An unexpected finding was the complex nature of the SCR-related oscillations: in addition to the two second EEG segment which was correlated with the SCR system signals they also comprised an initial 200 ms segment uncorrelated with the SCR. The hypothesis about the connectivity between the SCR system and the respective delta brain oscillatory response has been operationalized through a multiple time series regression model. The predictor set consists of the SCR, its first three derivatives, and their mutual interactions. The Monte Carlo test of the causal link between the SCR system signals and the related delta EEG signal demonstrated significance in more than half of the participants. The findings have been considered from the standpoints of the segmental structure of the EEG, monoaminergic signaling and recently emerged the \"brain-body dynamic syncytium\" hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Nucleocytoplasmic transport is dysregulated in sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) are purportedly involved in ALS. The Ran-binding protein 2 (Ranbp2) controls rate-limiting steps of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Mice with Ranbp2 loss in Thy1+-motoneurons develop cardinal ALS-like traits, but the impairments in RGNs and the degree of dysfunctional consonance between RGNs and motoneurons caused by Ranbp2 loss are unknown. This understanding will facilitate to discern the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport in the differential vulnerability of neurons to ALS and to develop therapeutic approaches and biomarkers in ALS. Here, we ascertain Ranbp2s function and endophenotypes in RGNs of an ALS-like mouse model lacking Ranbp2 in motoneurons and RGNs. Thy1+-RGNs lacking Ranbp2 shared with motoneurons the dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport. RGN abnormalities were comprised morphologically by soma hypertrophy and optic nerve axonopathy and physiologically by a delay of the visual pathways evoked potentials. Whole-transcriptome analysis showed restricted transcriptional changes in optic nerves that were distinct from those found in sciatic nerves. Specifically, the level and nucleocytoplasmic partition of the anti-apoptotic and novel substrate of Ranbp2, Pttg1/securin, were dysregulated. Further, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, which modulates de novo synthesis of fatty acids and T-cell immunity, showed the highest up-regulation (35-fold). This effect was reflected by the activation of ramified Cd11b+ and CD45+-microglia, increase of F4\\\\80+-microglia and a shift from pseudopodial/lamellipodial to amoeboidal F4\\\\80+-microglia intermingled between RGNs of naive mice. This immunogenic phenotype was accompanied by the intracellular sequestration in RGNs of metalloproteinase-28, which regulates macrophage recruitment and polarization in inflammation. Ranbp2 genetic insults in RGNs and motoneurons trigger distinct paracrine signaling likely by the dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of neural-type selective substrates. Metabolic and immune-modulators underpinning RGN-to-microglial signaling are regulated by Ranbp2, and this neuroglial system manifests endophenotypes that are likely useful in the prognosis and diagnosis of ALS.",

    "abstract": "Rule-based modeling allows representation and simulation of biological systems where molecular features (such as protein domains) and feature-specific details of molecular interactions are accounted for. The rule-based description is precise and can define very fine molecular details (e.g. how phosphorylation status of a single residue in a multi-protein complex can affect affinity of another binding site of another protein within the same complex), but makes it difficult to effectively combine the assumptions scribed within the multiple rules of a model into a diagrammatic view. Various visualization schemas have been suggested, but they are all highly rule-based centric (e.g. a visual list of unconnected rules, extended contact maps, or atom-rule graphs). None of them match the clarity of traditional reaction/pathway diagrams, where a researcher can easily visually track the transitions and modifications of chemical species occurring in the biological systems being modeled. Here we present a novel approach and software for precise, scalable and compact representation of rule-based models that we call Molecular Process Diagram. It is based on the three basic elements: interacting molecular complexes, molecular sites directly modified by a rule, and molecular sites that are not modified but contribute to a rule mechanism (e.g. a site that in a phosphorylated state changes binding affinity of another site). Multiple levels of resolution are available: pathway-like diagram of interactions among molecules, optional site-specific interactions, and additional contingencies for interactions. Inclusion of molecular sites enables unambiguous reconstruction of the rule descriptions from the visual diagram without additional supporting documentation, while still keeping a pathway-like visual appearance. The proposed approach for visualization has been implemented in the Virtual Cell (VCell) modeling and simulation framework. Our Molecular Process Diagrams extend the notion of Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) process diagrams and use SBGN-compliant conventions.\\n\\nSummaryKinetic models have provided significant insights into biological regulatory mechanisms even though they typically did not take into consideration the details of protein subcomponents such as binding domains and phosphorylation sites. However, these details are often required for an accurate understanding of the events that occur during cell signaling. Without such detailed understanding, intervention strategies to act on signaling pathways in pathological conditions are bound to have limited success. This need to include site-specific details into models led to the advance of rule-based modeling. While rules describe the details of interactions with unmatched precision, they often obscure the \\\"big picture\\\", i.e. a pathway-like description of the information flow through the biological system. An intuitive visual diagram is crucial for understanding the assumptions embodied into a model. Here we present a novel approach and software for precise, scalable and compact representation of rule-based models that we call Molecular Process Diagram. It allows visualizing in a pathway-like diagram of the interacting molecules, the molecular sites modified, and the molecular sites that affect the interactions. The approach is implemented in the Virtual Cell (VCell) modeling and simulation framework and suggested as an extension for the Systems Biology Graphical Notations (SBGN) standard.",

    "abstract": "Hyocholic acid (HCA) and its derivatives are found in only trace amounts in human blood, but constitute approximately 76 % of the bile acid (BA) pool in the pig, a species known for its exceptional resistance to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here we show that HCA species play a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing T2DM. We found that in two cohort studies (n=1,213), both obesity and diabetes were associated with lower serum concentrations of HCA species. Serum HCA levels in apparently healthy individuals (n=132) were found to be strong predictors for metabolic health 10 years later. Oral administration of HCA increased serum fasting GLP-1, to a greater extent than metformin, in healthy and diabetic mouse models. HCA upregulated GLP-1 secretion in intestinal enteroendocrine cells via simultaneously activating G-protein-coupled BA receptor, TGR5, and inhibiting farnesoid X receptor, a unique mechanism that is not found in other BA species.",

    "abstract": "Rap1 GTPases bind effectors, such as RIAM, to enable talin1 to induce integrin activation. In addition, Rap1 binds directly to the talin1 F0 domain (F0); however, this interaction makes a negligible contribution to integrin activation in CHO cells or platelets. Here, we show that talin1 F1 domain contains a previously undetected Rap1 binding site of similar affinity to that in F0. A structure-guided point mutant (R118E) in F1, which blocks Rap1 binding, abolishes the capacity of Rap1 to potentiate talin1-induced integrin activation. The capacity of F1 to mediate Rap1-dependent integrin activation depends on a unique loop in F1 that transforms into an amphipathic helix upon binding to membrane lipids. Basic membrane-facing residues of this helix are critical as charge reversal mutations led to dramatic suppression of talin1-dependent activation. Thus, a novel Rap1 binding site and a lipid-dependent amphipathic helix in talin1 F1 cooperate to enable a direct Rap1-talin1 interaction to cause integrin activation.\\n\\nSummaryThis work reveals that Rap1 GTPases bind directly to talin1 F1 domain and by cooperating with a unique lipid-dependent amphipathic helix in the F1 domain effects talin1-mediated integrin activation.",

    "abstract": "Neural insult during development results in recovery outcomes that vary dependent upon the system under investigation. Nerve regeneration does not occur if the rat gustatory chorda tympani nerve is sectioned (CTX) during neonatal ([&le;] P10) development. It is unclear how chorda tympani soma and terminal fields are affected after neonatal CTX. The current study determined the impact of neonatal CTX on chorda tympani neurons and brainstem gustatory terminal fields. To assess terminal field volume in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), rats received CTX at P5 or P10 followed by chorda tympani label, or glossopharyngeal (GL) and greater superficial petrosal (GSP) label as adults. In another group of animals, terminal field volumes and numbers of chorda tympani neurons in the geniculate ganglion (GG) were determined by labeling the chorda tympani with DiI at the time of CTX in neonatal (P5) and adult (P50) rats. There was a greater loss of chorda tympani neurons following P5 CTX compared to adult denervation. Chorda tympani terminal field volume was dramatically reduced 50 days after P5 or P10 CTX. Lack of nerve regeneration after neonatal CTX is not caused by ganglion cell death alone, as approximately 30% of chorda tympani neurons survived into adulthood. Although the total field volume of intact gustatory nerves was not altered, the GSP volume and GSP-GL overlap increased in the dorsal NTS after CTX at P5, but not P10, demonstrating age-dependent plasticity. Our findings indicate that the developing gustatory system is highly plastic and simultaneously vulnerable to injury.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe volume of chorda tympani central processes is severely diminished after the nerve is sectioned in 5- or 10-day-old rats.\\nC_LIO_LICompared to adult injury, neonatal denervation produced greater loss of terminal field and ganglion cell bodies.\\nC_LIO_LIAbout 30% of chorda tympani neurons survive early section, suggesting lack of regeneration is not caused by cell loss alone.\\nC_LIO_LIThe organization of intact gustatory terminal fields is altered by early chorda tympani nerve section.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are generated by the cyclic transcription, translation and degradation of clock genes, including timeless (tim). Currently, little is known about the mechanisms by which the circadian clock senses and adapts to temperature changes. Here we show that temperature dramatically changes the splicing pattern of tim. We found that at 18{degrees}C TIM protein levels are diminished due to the induction of two cold-specific splicing isoforms (tim-cold and tim-short&cold). At 29{degrees}C, another isoform, tim-Medium is strongly upregulated. We found that this isoform switching mechanism allows flies to regulate the levels and activity of TIM by setting miRNA-dependent thresholds for expression as well as by expressing isoforms with specific functions. Flies in which the production of tim-short&cold is abrogated display altered patterns of locomotor activity and altered tim expression. Interestingly, the introns of tim carry the information for the temperature sensitivity, suggesting that tim splicing per se is the temperature sensor.",

    "abstract": "Exploring complex biological systems requires adequate knowledge of the systems underlying wiring diagram but not its specific functional forms. Thus, exploration actually requires the concepts and approaches delivered by structure-based network control, which investigates the controllability of complex networks through a minimum set of input nodes. Traditional structure-based control methods focus on the structure of complex systems with linear dynamics and may not match the meaning of control well in some biological systems. Here we took into consideration the nonlinear dynamics of some biological networks and formalized the nonlinear control problem of undirected dynamical networks (NCU). Then, we designed and implemented a novel and general graphic-theoretic algorithm (NCUA) from the perspective of the feedback vertex set to discover the possible minimum sets of the input nodes in controlling the network state. We applied our NCUA to both synthetic networks and real-world networks to investigate how the network parameters, such as the scaling exponent and the degree heterogeneity, affect the control characteristics of networks with nonlinear dynamics. The NCUA was applied to analyze the patient-specific molecular networks corresponding to patients across multiple datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which demonstrates the advantages of the nonlinear control method to characterize and quantify the patient-state change over the other state-of-the-art linear control methods. Thus, our model opens a new way to control the undesired transition of cancer states and provides a powerful tool for theoretical research on network control, especially in biological fields.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComplex biological systems usually have nonlinear dynamics, such as the biological gene (protein) interaction network and gene co-expression networks. However, most of the structure-based network control methods focus on the structure of complex systems with linear dynamics. Thus, the ultimate purpose to control biological networks is still too complicated to be directly solved by such network control methods. We currently lack a framework to control the biological networks with nonlinear and undirected dynamics theoretically and computationally. Here, we discuss the concept of the nonlinear control problem of undirected dynamical networks (NCU) and present the novel graphic-theoretic algorithm from the perspective of a feedback vertex set for identifying the possible sets with minimum input nodes in controlling the networks. The NCUA searches the minimum set of input nodes to drive the network from the undesired attractor to the desired attractor, which is different from conventional linear network control, such as that found in the Maximum Matching Sets (MMS) and Minimum Dominating Sets (MDS) algorithms. In this work, we evaluated the NCUA on multiple synthetic scale-free networks and real complex networks with nonlinear dynamics and found the novel control characteristics of the undirected scale-free networks. We used the NCUA to thoroughly investigate the sample-specific networks and their nonlinear controllability corresponding to cancer samples from TCGA which are enriched with known driver genes and known drug target as controls of pathologic phenotype transitions. We found that our NCUA control method has a better predicted performance for indicating and quantifying the patient biological system changes than that of the state-of-the-art linear control methods. Our approach provides a powerful tool for theoretical research on network control, especially in a range of biological fields.",

    "abstract": "The association of amphipathic  helices in water leads to -helical-bundle protein structures. However, the driving force for this--the hydrophobic effect--is not specific and does not define the number or the orientation of helices in the associated state. Rather, this is achieved through deeper sequence-to-structure relationships, which are increasingly being discerned. For example, for one structurally extreme but nevertheless ubiquitous class of bundle--the -helical coiled coils--relationships have been established that discriminate between all-parallel dimers, trimers and tetramers. Association states above this are known, as are antiparallel and mixed arrangements of the helices. However, these alternative states are less-well understood. Here, we describe a synthetic-peptide system that switches between parallel hexamers and various up-down-up-down tetramers in response to single-amino-acid changes and solution conditions. The main accessible states of each peptide variant are characterized fully in solution and, in most cases, to high-resolution X-ray crystal structures. Analysis and inspection of these structures helps rationalize the different states formed. This navigation of the structural landscape of -helical coiled coils above the dimers and trimers that dominate in nature has allowed us to design rationally a well-defined and hyperstable antiparallel coiled-coil tetramer (apCC-Tet). This robust de novo protein provides another scaffold for further structural and functional designs in protein engineering and synthetic biology.",

Recently, the use of surfactant microbubbles has been studied as an alternate to aqueous solution in pollutant remediation since they have the advantage of improving the contact with the contaminant due to their surface properties. In this research endeavor, the application potential of microbubble suspension generated using a lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by a marine strain of Bacillus megaterium in tertiary oil recovery was investigated. The microbubbles were generated using a high speed homogenizer and their properties such as stability and size distribution were studied. The microbubble suspension was used as flooding agent to recover gear oil from an artificially saturated sand packed column. The performance of microbubbles in tertiary oil recovery was compared with that of aqueous biosurfactant solution. It was found that microbubble suspension generated using biosurfactant had higher oil recovery efficiency (46%) than aqueous solution (36%).\\n\\nMoreover, the pressure buildup across the sand packed column was fairly low while using microbubble suspension. The increased oil recovery using microbubbles can be attributed to their effective permeation through the pores of sand packed column and closer contact between biosurfactant molecules and oil. Thus, the results obtained in this study convincingly indicate that biosurfactant stabilized microbubble suspension, due to its higher performance and lower injection pressure requirement, can serve as a potentially efficient flooding agent for tertiary oil recovery.",

We found that, following fertilization, the re-establishment of accessible chromatin together with transcription factors inherited from oocytes initiates transcription at the 2-cell stage, and then the introduction of active histone modification, H3K4me3, facilitates gene up-regulation at the 4-cell stage, then stabilization of higher-order chromatin structures at the 8-cell stage further enhances transcriptional activity. During the first lineage specification at ICM, transcription activity multifaceted regulation of epigenetic marks.

Until now, only the 18S small subunit of ribosomal RNA gene and the COI gene has been available from A. royi, and only one other cyclopoid copepod had WGS resources available. Overall, the provided resources are the 7th copepod species to have WGS available and the 19th copepod species with TSA information available. We analyze the length and GC content of the provided WGS scaffolds as well as the coverage and gene content of both the WGS and the TSA assembly. Finally, we place the resources within the copepod order Cyclopoida as a member of the Apocyclops genus. We estimate the total genome size of A. royi to 450 Mb, with 181 Mb assembled nonrepetitive, 76 Mb assembled repeats and 193Mb unassembled sequence. The TSA assembly consists of 29,737 genes and an additional 45,756 isoforms. In the WGS and TSA assemblies, >80% and >95% of core genes can be found, though many in fragmented versions.

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of calcium imaging has reached a point where the activity of tens of thousands of cells can be recorded simultaneously. However, the huge amount of data in such records makes it difficult to carry out cell detection manually. Consequently, because the cell detection is the first step of multicellular data analysis, there is a pressing need for automatic cell detection methods for large-scale image data. Automatic cell detection algorithms have been pioneered by a handful of research groups. Such algorithms, however, assume a conventional field of view (FOV) (i.e. 512 x 512 pixels) and need a significantly higher computational power for a wider FOV to work within a practical period of time. To overcome this issue, we propose a method called low computational-cost cell detection (LCCD), which can complete its processing even on the latest ultra-large FOV data within a practical period of time. We compared it with two previously proposed methods, constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) and Suite2P. We found that LCCD makes it possible to detect cells from a huge-amount of high-density imaging data within a shorter period of time and with an accuracy comparable to or better than those of CNMF and Suite2P.",

    "abstract": "One third of the people suffer from iron (Fe) Fe deficiency. An underlying factor for this malnutrition is insufficient Fe intake from the diet. A major part of the human diet includes seeds of staple crops, which contain Fe that is poorly bioavailable. One reason for the low bioavailability is these seeds store Fe in cellular compartments that also contain antinutrients, such as phytate. Thus, several studies focused on decreasing phytate concentrations. As an alternative approach to increase bioavailable Fe, Fe reserves might be directed to cellular compartments such as plastids that are free of phytate. Previous studies indicated that Fe reserves can be relocalized inside the seed to the desired compartment by genetic modification, provided that a suitable iron transporter protein is used. However, to the best of our knowledge, a Fe transporter localizing to plastids have not been identified in seeds to date. To discover novel Fe transporters, we screened Fe patterns in seeds of distinct plant lineages, hypothesizing Fe hyperaccumulating sites would indicate Fe transporter presence. To this end, metal localizations in seeds of more than twenty species were investigated using histochemical or X-ray based techniques. Results showed that in Rosids, the largest clade of eudicots, Fe reserves were primarily confined in the embryo part of the seeds. Furthermore, inside the embryos, Fe was enriched in the endodermal cell layer, a well-known feature that is mediated by vacuolar Fe transporter, VIT1 in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This enrichment was well conserved in and beyond Rosid species. Finally, a few seeds showed novel Fe patterns, including Carica papaya which concentrated large Fe reserves exclusively in plastids called amyloplasts. Generally, Fe stored in amyloplast is considered bioavailable. Taken together, this study suggests dicot seeds store Fe mainly in the embryo, with a VIT1-dependent enrichment in its endodermal cell layer and indicate Carica papaya possess a strong Fe transporter at the plastid membrane. Once it is identified that might be useful in biofortification, as a novel tool to shift Fe to compartments where it is more bioavailable.",

A constraint of multi-trait methods is that they require complete summary data for all traits. While methods for the imputation of summary statistics exist, they lack precision for genetic variants with small effect size. This is benign for univariate analyses where only variants with large effect size are selected a posteriori. However, it can lead to strong p-value inflation in multi-trait testing. Here we present a new approach that improve the existing imputation methods and reach a precision suitable for multi-trait analyses.\\n\\nResultsWe fine-tuned parameters to obtain a very high accuracy imputation from summary statistics. We demonstrate this accuracy for small size-effect variants on real data of 28 GWAS.

    "abstract": "Cyclization of DNA with sticky ends is commonly used to construct DNA minicircles and to measure DNA bendability. The cyclization probability of short DNA (<150 bp) has a strong length dependence, but how it depends on the rotational positioning of the sticky ends around the helical axis is less clear. To shed light upon the determinants of the cyclization probability of short DNA, we measured cyclization and decyclization rates of [~]100-bp DNA with sticky ends over two helical periods using single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The cyclization rate increases monotonically with length, indicating no excess twisting, while the decyclization rate oscillates with length, higher at half-integer helical turns and lower at integer helical turns. The oscillation profile is kinetically and thermodynamically consistent with a three-state cyclization model in which sticky-ended short DNA first bends into a torsionally-relaxed teardrop, and subsequently transitions to a more stable loop upon terminal base stacking. We also show that the looping probability density (the J factor) extracted from this study is in good agreement with the worm-like chain model near 100 bp. For shorter DNA, we discuss various experimental factors that prevent an accurate measurement of the J factor.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of olfactory receptors and major technological advances have greatly accelerated our understanding of chemosensory mechanisms. However, some of this rapid progress may be compromised by inadequate knowledge or characterization of the purity of chemical stimuli used to challenge olfactory or other chemoreceptors when mapping their response profiles. Here, we provide strong evidence that the presence of trace impurities in test stimuli can completely obscure true ligand-receptor relationships. DmOR7a, an olfactory receptor of the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has been reported to respond to several long-chain aliphatic ligands such as a putative Drosophila pheromone1, the pheromone of the silkworm moth Bombyx mori2, and a common fatty acid, linoleic acid3. By contrast, we show that DmOR7a responds with high sensitivity to volatile impurities and degradation products present in minute quantities in authentic standards of those compounds, but not to the standards themselves. Responses to impurities can easily go unnoticed due to two main factors. First, the sensitivity of receptors to key ligands may be greater than that of analytical chemistry instruments used to check sample purity. Second, the concentration of highly volatile impurities in an odour puff may be orders of magnitude higher than the main component of a sample, due to the large differences in vapour pressures between the impurities and the main component. Issues concerning impurities are not limited to studies on olfaction that use odour puffs to characterize receptor-ligand interactions, but may affect all studies on chemosensation, from molecular biology and in-silico predictions to behaviour. Purity, which is crucial in receptor-ligand studies, is always implied, but rarely checked rigorously. To avoid misinterpretations, a proper account of all compounds present in test stimuli and an unequivocal confirmation of ligand affinity should accompany chemosensory studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrug combinations are of great interest for cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the discovery of synergistic combinations by purely experimental means is only feasible on small sets of drugs. In silico modeling methods can substantially widen this search by providing tools able to predict which of all possible combinations in a large compound library are synergistic. Here we investigate to which extent drug combination synergy can be predicted by exploiting the largest available dataset to date (NCI-ALMANAC, with over 290,000 synergy determinations).\\n\\nMethodsEach cell line is modeled using primarily two machine learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), on the datasets provided by NCI-ALMANAC. This large-scale predictive modeling study comprises more than 5000 pair-wise drug combinations, 60 cell lines, 4 types of models and 5 types of chemical features. The application of a powerful, yet uncommonly used, RF-specific technique for reliability prediction is also investigated.\\n\\nResultsThe evaluation of these models shows that it is possible to predict the synergy of unseen drug combinations with high accuracy (Pearson correlations between 0.43 and 0.86 depending on the considered cell line, with XGBoost providing slightly better predictions than RF). We have also found that restricting to the most reliable synergy predictions results in at least two-fold error decrease with respect to employing the best learning algorithm without any reliability estimation. Alkylating agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors are the drugs whose synergy with other partner drugs are better predicted by the models.\\n\\nConclusionsDespite its leading size, NCI-ALMANAC comprises an extremely small part of all conceivable combinations. Given their accuracy and reliability estimation, the developed models should drastically reduce the number of required in vitro tests by predicting in silico which of the considered combinations are likely to be synergistic.",

We trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately identify cell types in the hematopoietic hierarchy and predict their age from their gene expression patterns. We then used this ANN to compare daughter cell identities immediately after HSC divisions, and found that HSC self-renewal declines sharply with age. Furthermore, while HSC cell divisions are deterministic and intrinsically-regulated in young and old age, they become stochastic and niche-sensitive in mid-life. Analysis of evolving division patterns indicated that the self-renewal ability an individual HSC depends upon number times it has divided previously. We propose a model of HSC proliferation that accurately predicts the accumulation of HSCs with age, and reconciles the stochastic and instructive views of fate commitment.",

    "abstract": "Brain stimulation is used clinically to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. The mechanisms of the clinical effects of these brain-based therapies are presumably dependent on their effects on brain networks. It has been hypothesized that using individualized brain network maps is an optimal strategy for defining network boundaries and topologies. Traditional non-invasive imaging can determine correlations between structural or functional time series. However, they cannot easily establish hierarchies in communication flow as done in non-human animals using invasive methods. In the present study, we interleaved functional MRI recordings with non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the attempt to map causal communication between the prefrontal cortex and two subcortical structures thought to contribute to affective dysregulation: the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and the amygdala. In both cases, we found evidence that these brain areas were engaged when TMS was applied to prefrontal sites determined from each participants previous fMRI scan. Specifically, after transforming individual participant images to within-scan quantiles of evoked TMS response, we modeled the average quantile response within a given region across stimulation sites and individuals to demonstrate that the targets were differentially influenced by TMS. Furthermore, we found that the sgACC distributed brain network, estimated in a separate cohort, was engaged in response to sgACC focused TMS and was partially separable from the proximal default mode network response. The amygdala, but not its distributed network, responded to TMS. Our findings indicate that individual targeting and brain response measurements usefully capture causal circuit mapping to the sgACC and amygdala in humans, setting the stage for approaches to noninvasively modulate subcortical nodes of distributed brain networks in clinical interventions and mechanistic human neuroscience studies.",

    "abstract": "The conduction velocity (CV) of action potentials along axons is a key neurophysiological property central to neural communication. The ability to estimate CV in humans in vivo from non-invasive MRI methods would therefore represent a significant advance in neuroscience. However, there are 2 major challenges that this paper aims to address: (1) much of the complexity of the neurophysiology of action potentials cannot be captured with currently available MRI techniques. Therefore, we seek to establish the variability in CV that can be captured when predicting CV purely from parameters that can be estimated from MRI (axon diameter and g-ratio); and (2) errors inherent in existing MRI-based biophysical models of tissue will propagate through to estimates of CV, the extent to which is currently unknown.\n\nIssue (1) is investigated by performing a sensitivity analysis on a comprehensive model of axon electrophysiology and determining the relative sensitivity to various morphological and electrical parameters.\n\nThe investigations suggest that 89.2 % of the variance in CV is accounted for by variation in AD and g-ratio. The observed dependency of CV on AD and g-ratio is well characterised by a previously reported model by Rushton.\n\nIssue (2) is investigated through simulation of diffusion and relaxometry MRI data for a range of axon morphologies, applying models of restricted diffusion and relaxation processes to derive estimates of axon volume fraction (AVF), AD and g-ratio and estimating CV from the derived parameters. The results show that errors in the AVF have the biggest detrimental impact on estimates of CV, particularly for sparse fibre populations (AVF< 0.3). CV estimates are most accurate (below 5% error) where AVF is above 0.3, g-ratio is between 0.6 and 0.85 and AD is below 10 {micro}m. Fortunately, these parameter bounds are typically satisfied by most myelinated axons.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that accurate CV estimates can be inferred in axon populations across a range of configurations, except in some exceptional cases or where axonal density is low. As a proof of concept, for the first time, we generated an in vivo map of conduction velocity in the human corpus callosum with estimates consistent with values previously reported from invasive electrophysiology in primates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSelecting the proper parameter settings for bioinformatic software tools is challenging. Not only will each parameter have an individual effect on the outcome, but there are also potential interaction effects between parameters. Both of these effects may be difficult to predict. To make the situation even more complex, multiple tools may be run in a sequential pipeline where the final output depends on the parameter configuration for each tool in the pipeline. Because of the complexity and difficulty of predicting outcomes, in practice parameters are often left at default settings or set based on personal or peer experience obtained in a trial and error fashion. To allow for the reliable and efficient selection of parameters for bioinformatic pipelines, a systematic approach is needed.\\n\\nResultsWe present doepipeline, a novel approach to optimizing bioinformatic software parameters, based on core concepts of the Design of Experiments methodology and recent advances in subset designs. Optimal parameter settings are first approximated in a screening phase using a subset design that efficiently spans the entire search space, then optimized in the subsequent phase using response surface designs and OLS modeling. doepipeline was used to optimize parameters in four use cases; 1) de-novo assembly, 2) scaffolding of a fragmented genome assembly, 3) k-mer taxonomic classification of Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION reads, and 4) genetic variant calling. In all four cases, doepipeline found parameter settings that produced a better outcome with respect to the characteristic measured when compared to using default values. Our approach is implemented and available in the Python package doepipeline.\\n\\nConclusionsOur proposed methodology provides a systematic and robust framework for optimizing software parameter settings, in contrast to labor- and time-intensive manual parameter tweaking.

However, the SR X-chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura is found at high frequencies in natural populations, forms stable latitudinal clines, appears to be unsuppressed, and shows evidence of being quite long-lived. Despite being a historically significant and well-studied segregation distortion system, the mechanisms allowing for the long-term persistence of the D. pseudoobscura SR chromosome remain unclear. Here, we perform a comparative genomic analysis between SR and uninverted standard X-chromosomes in D. pseudoobscura to study its evolutionary history and dynamics. We find a substantial level of differentiation between the SR and standard chromosome and estimate that the associated inversions have likely existed for the entire lifetime of the species (> 2 million generations). Through direct recombination experiments and population genetic analyses, we infer that this high level of differentiation is maintained by a combination of suppressed recombination and epistatic selection. Finally, our data reveal a massive mutational target size for protein and expression level changes specific to SR generated by its three non-overlapping inversions. Together our results imply that the entire SR chromosome in D. pseudoobscura behaves as a single co-adapted gene complex and has been maintained through a combination of suppressed recombination and epistatic selection. This finding highlights the dramatic consequences segregation distorters can have in shaping chromosome-wide patterns of recombination, nucleotide variation, and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic age (EA) acceleration is associated with higher risk of chronic disease and mortality in adults. However, little is known about whether and how in utero exposures might shape gestational EA acceleration at birth. We aimed to explore associations between maternal psychosocial risk factors and offspring gestational EA acceleration at birth in a South African birth cohort study - the Drakenstein Child Health Study. Maternal psychosocial risk factors included trauma/stressor exposure; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); depression, psychological distress; and alcohol/tobacco use. Offspring gestational EA acceleration at birth was calculated using an epigenetic clock previously devised for neonates. Bivariate linear regression was used to explore unadjusted associations between maternal risk factors and offspring gestational EA acceleration at birth. A stepwise regression method was then used to determine the best multivariable model for adjusted associations. Data from 272 maternal-offspring dyads were included in the current analysis. In the stepwise regression model, maternal trauma exposure ({beta}=7.92; p<0.01) or PTSD ({beta}=7.46; p<0.01) were significantly associated with offspring gestational EA acceleration at birth, controlling for ethnicity, offspring sex, head circumference at birth, maternal HIV status, and prenatal tobacco or alcohol use. In site-stratified models, these associations retained statistical significance and direction of effect. Maternal trauma exposure or PTSD may thus be associated with offspring gestational EA acceleration at birth. Given the novelty of this preliminary finding, and its potential translational relevance, further studies to delineate underlying biological pathways and to explore clinical implications of EA acceleration are warranted.",
