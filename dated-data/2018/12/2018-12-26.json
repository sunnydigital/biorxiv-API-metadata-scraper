    "abstract": "In characterizing a disease, it is common to search for dysfunctional genes by assaying the transcriptome. The resulting differentially expressed genes are typically assessed for shared features, such as functional annotation or co-expression. While useful, the reliability of these systems methods is hard to evaluate. To better understand shared disease signals, we assess their replicability by first looking at gene-level recurrence and then pathway-level recurrence along with co-expression signals across six pedigrees of a rare homogeneous X-linked disorder, TAF1 syndrome. We find most differentially expressed genes are not recurrent between pedigrees, making functional enrichment largely distinct in each pedigree. However, we find two highly recurrent \\\"functional outliers\\\" (CACNA1I and IGFBP3), genes acting atypically with respect to co-expression and therefore absent from a systems-level assessment. We show this occurs in re-analysis of Huntingtons disease, Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. Our results suggest a significant role for genes easily missed in systems approaches.",

    "abstract": "The progressive maturation of cells down differentiation lineages is controlled by collaborative interactions between networks of extracellular signals and intracellular transcription factors. In the vertebrate spinal cord, FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid signaling pathways regulate the progressive caudal-to-rostral maturation of neural progenitors by regulating a poorly understood gene regulatory network of transcription factors. We have mapped out this gene regulatory network in the chicken pre-neural tube, identifying CDX4 as a dual-function core component that simultaneously regulates gradual loss of cell potency and acquisition of differentiation states: in a caudal-to-rostral direction, CDX4 represses the early neural differentiation marker Nkx1.2 and promotes the late neural differentiation marker Pax6. Significantly, CDX4 prevents premature PAX6-dependent neural differentiation by blocking Ngn2 activation. This regulation of CDX4 over Pax6 is restricted to the rostral pre-neural tube by Retinoic Acid signaling. Together, our results show that in the spinal cord, CDX4 is part of the gene regulatory network controlling the sequential and progressive transition of states from high to low potency during neural progenitor maturation. Given CDX well-known involvement in Hox gene regulation, we propose that CDX factors coordinate the maturation and axial specification of neural progenitor cells during spinal cord development.",

    "abstract": "ChIP-seq is a technique to determine binding locations of transcription factors, which remains a central challenge in molecular biology. Current practice is to use a \\\"control\\\" dataset to remove background signals from a immunoprecipitation (IP) target dataset. We introduce the AlControl framework, which eliminates the need to obtain a control dataset and instead identifies binding peaks by estimating the distributions of background signals from many publicly available control ChIP-seq datasets. We thereby avoid the cost of running control experiments while simultaneously increasing the accuracy of binding location identification. Specifically, AIControl can (1) estimate background signals at fine resolution, (2) systematically weigh the most appropriate control datasets in a data-driven way, (3) capture sources of potential biases that may be missed by one control dataset, and (4) remove the need for costly and time-consuming control experiments. We applied AIControl to 410 IP datasets in the ENCODE ChIP-seq database, using 440 control datasets from 107 cell types to impute background signal. Without using matched control datasets, AIControl identified peaks that were more enriched for putative binding sites than those identified by other popular peak callers that used a matched control dataset. We also demonstrated that our framework identifies binding sites that recover documented protein interactions more accurately.",

    "abstract": "Conjugative plasmids from the IncHI incompatibility group are relevant vectors for multidrug resistance. In this study, a comparison of the similarities and differences in the 44 publicly available sequences of IncHI plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae (1961-2013), revealed extensive conservation of their coding sequences. However, each genome had accessory regions with features of degradation or resistance to antibacterial agents. This article elucidates the IncHI1, IncHI2 and IncHI3 subgroup plasmids from the evolutive line based on multiple drug-resistant modules, explains the origin of the IncHI1 pAKU1-like composite transposon lineage, typifies the subgroup IncHI3, which is distantly related to IncHI1 and IncHI2 in phylogenetic analyses, confirms the relations within the transfer regions of H-group plasmids, and points to the divergence time of evolution with phylogenetic trees. Homology between subgroups, as measured by the molecular clock test, indicated that the contemporary IncHI1 and IncHI2 transfer region lineages diverged from an ancestral clone approximately 8,000 years ago (17,000 years ago if the divergent IncHI3 plasmids are included), although the IncH backbone was older. The uniformity of the composite transposon shared by most IncHI1 subgroup plasmids might be functionally equivalent to the heavy metal resistance that is mediated by some operons in the IncHI2 subgroup plasmids. A comparison of the DNA among these closely related plasmids provided insights on the horizontal and vertical transfers that were involved in their development.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic molecular clusters are assembled through weak multivalent interactions and are platforms for cellular functions, especially receptor-mediated signaling. Clustering is also a prerequisite for liquid-liquid phase separation. But it is not well understood how molecular structure and cellular organization control clustering. Using coarse-grain kinetic Langevin dynamics, we performed computational experiments on a prototypical ternary system modeled after membrane-bound nephrin, the adaptor Nck1 and the actin nucleation promoting factor NWASP. Steady state cluster size distributions favored stoichiometries that optimized binding (stoichiometry matching), but still were quite broad. At high concentrations, the system can be driven beyond the saturation boundary such that cluster size is limited only by the number of available molecules. This behavior would be predictive of phase separation. Domains close to binding sites sterically inhibited clustering much less than terminal domains because the latter effectively restrict access to the cluster interior. Increased flexibility of interacting molecules diminished clustering by shielding binding sites within compact conformations. Membrane association of nephrin increased the cluster size distribution in a density-dependent manner. These properties provide insights into how molecular ensembles function to localize and amplify cell signaling.",

It is thus important to assess the safety and nutritional value of wild greens foraged in urban environments.\\n\\nMethodsField observations, soil tests, and nutritional and toxicology tests on plant tissue were conducted for three sites, each roughly 9 square blocks, in disadvantaged neighborhoods in the East San Francisco Bay Area in 2014-2015. The sites included mixed-use areas and areas with high vehicle traffic.\\n\\nResultsEdible wild greens were abundant, even during record droughts. Soil at some survey sites had elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium, but tissue tests suggest that rinsed greens of the tested species are safe to eat. Daily consumption of standard servings comprise less than the EPA reference doses of lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals. Pesticides, glyphosate, and PCBs were below detection limits.\\n\\nThe nutrient density of 6 abundant species compared favorably to that of the most nutritious domesticated leafy greens.\\n\\nConclusionsWild edible greens harvested in industrial, mixed-use, and high-traffic urban areas in the San Francisco East Bay area are abundant and highly nutritious. Even grown in soils with elevated levels of heavy metals, tested species were safe to eat after rinsing in tap water. This does not mean that all edible greens growing in contaminated soil are safe to eat--tests on more species, in more locations, and over a broader range of soil chemistry are needed to determine what is generally safe and what is not. But it does suggest that wild greens could contribute to nutrition, food security, and sustainability in urban ecosystems. Current laws, regulations, and public-health guidance that forbid or discourage foraging on public lands, including urban areas, should be revisited.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing application of deep learning methods to the modelling of regulatory DNA sequences has come an interest in exploring what types of architecture are best suited to the domain. Networks designed to predict many functional characteristics of noncoding DNA in a multitask framework have to recognise a large number of motifs and as a result benefit from large numbers of convolutional filters in the first layer. The use of large first layers in turn motivates an exploration of strategies for addressing the sparsity of output and possibility for overfitting that result. To this end we propose the use of a dimensionality-reducing linear projection layer after the initial motif-recognising convolutions. In experiments with a reduced version of the DeepSEA dataset we find that inserting this layer in combination with dropout into convolutional and convolutional-recurrent architectures can improve predictive performance across a range of first layer sizes. We further validate our approach by incorporating the projection layer into a new convolutional-recurrent architecture which achieves state of the art performance on the full DeepSEA dataset. Analysis of the learned projection weights shows that the inclusion of this layer simplifies the networks internal representation of the occurrence of motifs, notably by projecting features representing forward and reverse-complement motifs to similar positions in the lower dimensional feature space output by the layer.",

    "abstract": "SWATH-MS has been widely used for proteomics analysis given its high-throughput and reproducibility but ensuring consistent quantification of analytes across large-scale studies of heterogeneous samples such as human-plasma remains challenging. Heterogeneity in large-scale studies can be caused by large time intervals between data-acquisition, acquisition by different operators or instruments, intermittent repair or replacement of parts, such as the liquid chromatography column, all of which affect retention time (RT) reproducibility and successively performance of SWATH-MS data analysis. Here, we present a novel algorithm for retention time alignment of SWATH-MS data based on direct alignment of raw MS2 chromatograms using a hybrid dynamic programming approach. The algorithm does not impose a chronological order of elution and allows for alignment of elution-order swapped peaks. Furthermore, allowing RT-mapping in a certain window around coarse global fit makes it robust against noise. On a manually validated dataset, this strategy outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, on a real-world clinical data, our approach outperforms global alignment methods by mapping 98% of peaks compared to 67% cumulatively and DIAlignR can reduce alignment error up to 30-fold for extremely distant runs. The robustness of technical parameters used in this pairwise alignment strategy has also been demonstrated.

They regulate gene expression levels at the post-transcriptional stage, which results in cleavage of mRNAs or repression of their translation. Some miRNAs, including the miR-302 cluster, are critical regulators for the stemness state of embryonic stem cells and cell fate patterning. The miR-302 cluster is located in the intron of a non-coding gene that has no other reported function, other than hosting miR-302, and grant a complex expression regulation through upstream its regulatory sequences. To date, analysis of the miR-302 expression pattern in a transgenic mouse model has not been reported. In this study, we generated transgenic mice that expressed EGFP driven by miR-302 upstream regulatory sequences that harbored the core promoter of its host gene. We examined the activity of the miR-302 promotor in somatic tissues of transgenic mice, transgenic blastocysts, and embryonic stem cells derived from transgenic blastocysts. Our results showed that miR-302 highly expressed in both blastocysts and the first passages of transgenic embryonic stem cells, and has low expression in the somatic tissues of transgenic mice.

    "abstract": "GCaMP-6f is among the best calcium indicators and has been widely used for monitoring neuronal activity in the brain. Applications are at cellular level (calcium transients of action potentials) or population activity (fluorimetry) during network events. Two important issues remain less explored: 1) Is GCaMP-6f signal sensitive enough for detecting subthreshold activity, similar to the sensitivity of local field potential (LFP)? 2) Is the GCaMP-6f signal fast enough for detecting network oscillations seen in LFP? Here the two issues are explored in a number of network events including hippocampus sharp waves (SWs), carbachol induced theta oscillations, interictal-like spikes and neuronal response evoked by high frequency stimuli. SWs are a typical network event with the majority of neurons receiving subthreshold excitatory or inhibitory synaptic input without firing action potentials. The excitatory/inhibitory post synaptic potentials (EPSP/IPSP) in the neuropil become detectable in local field potential (LFP) signals. We compare simultaneously recorded LFP and optical recording of GCaMP-6f fluorescent signals in Thy1-GCaMP-6f mice hippocampal slices. We found that the occurrence of SWs produces a clear population GCaMP-6f signal of 0.3% dF/F. This population GCaMP-6f signal correlated well with the LFP, albeit a delay of ~50 ms was observed. The population GCaMP-6f signal follows well with the 20 Hz population activity evoked by electric stimuli, while activity up to 40 Hz was detected with reduced amplitude. GCaMP-6f and LFP signals showed a large amplitude discrepancy. The amplitude of GCaMP increased ~1000 times from SW to carbachol induced theta burst, while the LFP changed less than 10 times. Our results suggested that population GCaMP-6f signals may become a sensitive tool for detecting network activity, especially for that with low LFP amplitude during elevated spiking rate but asynchronized events. GCaMP signal is fast enough for monitoring theta and beta oscillations (<25Hz) in the neuronal population. Faster calcium indicators (e.g., GCaMP-7) may improve the frequency response property for detecting gamma band oscillations. In addition, population GCaMP recordings are non-contact and free from stimulation artifacts. These features may be useful for high throughput recordings and applications sensitive to stimulus artifact, e.g., monitoring response during continuous stimulations.",

How the interplay of filopodia and synapse assembly ensures robust connectivity in the brain has remained a challenging problem. Here, we developed a new 4D analysis method for filopodial dynamics and a data-driven computational model of synapse formation for R7 photoreceptor axons in developing Drosophila brains. Our live data support a  serial synapse formation model, where at any time point only a single  synaptogenic filopodium suppresses the synaptic competence of other filopodia through competition for synaptic seeding factors. Loss of the synaptic seeding factors Syd-1 and Liprin- leads to a loss of this suppression, filopodial destabilization and reduced synapse formation, which is sufficient to cause the destabilization of entire axon terminals. Our model provides a filopodial  winner-takes-all mechanism that ensures the formation of an appropriate number of synapses.",

Here, we combine ancestral protein reconstruction with biochemical, structural, and mutational analyses to characterize the functional evolution of methyl-parathion hydrolase (MPH), a xenobiotic organophosphate-degrading enzyme. We identify five mutations that are necessary and sufficient for the evolution of MPH from an ancestral dihydrocoumarin hydrolase. In-depth analyses of the adaptive landscapes encompassing this evolutionary transition revealed that a complex interaction network, defined in part by higher-order epistasis, determined the adaptive pathways that were available. By also characterizing the adaptive landscapes in terms of their functional activity towards three other OP substrates, we reveal that subtle differences in substrate substituents drastically alter the enzymes epistatic network by changing its intramolecular interactions. Our work suggests that the mutations function collectively to enable substrate recognition via subtle structural repositioning.",

    "abstract": "Half of all humans harbor Helicobacter pylori in their stomachs. Helical cell shape is thought to facilitate H. pyloris ability to bore into the protective mucus layer in a corkscrew-like motion, thus enhancing colonization of the stomach. H. pylori cell shape mutants show impaired colonization of the mouse stomach, highlighting the importance of cell shape in infection. To gain a deeper understanding of how helical cell morphology promotes host colonization by H. pylori, we used 3D-confocal microscopy to visualize the clinical isolate PMSS1 and an isogenic straight rod mutant ({Delta}csd6) within thick longitudinal mouse stomach sections and performed volumetric image analysis to quantify the number of bacteria residing within corpus and antral glands in addition to measuring total colony forming units (CFU). We found that straight rods show attenuation during acute colonization of the stomach (one day or one week post-infection) as measured by total CFU. Our quantitative imaging revealed that wild-type bacteria extensively colonized antral glands at one week post-infection, while csd6 mutants showed variable colonization of the antrum at this timepoint. During chronic infection (one or three months post-infection), total CFU were highly variable, but similar for wild-type and straight rods. Both wild-type and straight rods persisted and expanded in corpus glands during chronic infection. However, the straight rods showed reduced inflammation and disease progression. Thus, helical cell shape contributes to tissue interactions that promote inflammation during chronic infection, in addition to facilitating niche acquisition during acute infection.",

We focused on non-structured domains of the scaffold Nups and performed in vitro self-assembled particle assays with those derived from channel-forming FG-Nups. We found that non-structured domains of ELYS and Nup35N interacted with channel-forming FG-Nups to form a self-assembled particle. Sequential addition of FG-Nups into the scaffold particle revealed that ELYS, which initiates post-mitotic NPC reassembly, interacts with early assembling FG-Nups (Nups98 and 153) but not middle stage-assembling FG-Nups (Nups58 and 62). Nup35, which assembles between the early and middle stages, facilitated the assembly of Nup62 into the early assembling Nups both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that ELYS and Nup35 have a role of facilitator in the ordered assembly of channel-forming FG-Nups during mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Cells respond to protein-damaging insults by activating heat shock factors (HSFs), key transcription factors of proteostasis. Abnormal HSF protein levels occur in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of the tight control of HSF expression. HSF2 is a short-lived protein, but it is abundant in the prenatal brain cortex and required for brain development. Here, we reveal that HSF2 is acetylated and co-localized with the lysine-acetyl transferases CBP and EP300 in human brain organoids. Using unbiased, biochemical, cell-imaging, and in silico approaches, we show that CBP/EP300 acetylates HSF2 at specific lysine residues, which promotes HSF2 stabilization, whereas the lysine deacetylase HDAC1 catalyzes its proteasomal degradation. The CBP KIX domain and KlX-recognizing motifs in HSF2 are critical for its interaction with acetylating enzymes. The functional importance of acetylated HSF2 is evidenced in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), characterized by mutated CBP or EP300. We show that RSTS patient cells exhibit decreased HSF2 levels and impaired heat shock response. The dysregulated HSF pathway in RSTS opens new avenues for understanding the molecular basis of this multifaceted pathology.",

    "abstract": "The family Hepadnaviridae is characterized by partially dsDNA circular viruses of approximately 3.2 kb, which are reverse transcribed from RNA intermediates. Hepadnaviruses (HBVs) have a broad host range which includes humans (Hepatitis B virus), other mammals (genus Orthohepadnavirus), and birds (Avihepadnavirus). HBVs host specificity has been expanded by reports of new viruses infecting fish, amphibians, and reptiles. The tibetan frog hepatitis B virus (TFHBV) was recently discovered in Nanorana parkeri (Family Dicroglossidae) from Tibet. To increase understanding of hepadnavirus in amphibian host, we identified the full-length genome of a divergent strain TFHBV-Ot associated to the concave-eared torrent frog Odorrana tormota (Family Ranidae) from China by searching deep sequencing data. TFHBV-Ot shared the genomic organization and a 76.6% overall genome nucleotide identity to the prototype TFHBV associated to N. parkeri (TFHBV-Np). TFHBV-Ot amino acid pairwise identity with TFHBV-Np predicted gene products ranged between 63.9% and 77.9%. Multiple tissue/organ specific RNAseq datasets suggest a broad tropism of TFHBV including muscles, gonads and brains. In addition, we provide for the first time evidence of virus derived small RNA from an amphibian hepadnavirus, tentatively enriched in 19-20 nt species and cytidine as first base. The results presented here expand the genetic diversity and the host range of TFHBV to Ranidae frogs, and warrant investigation on hepadnaviral infection of amphibian brains.",

A microfluidic droplet system and Xenopus oocyte extracts enabled us to build an artificial cell and study minimal requirements for cellular self-organization. Mathematical modeling reveals the interaction of lipid membranes with any filament system through molecular motors as a universal principle of cytoplasmic self-organization. Both cytoskeletal systems form mechanisms to establish robust 2-dimensional selforganization and self-centering. Pharmacologic inhibition of the cytoskeletal network systems helps dissect specific contributions of each network in the interplay with lipid membranes with regards to 2- and 3-dimensional organization, time and length scale of cytoplasmic organization and the degree of concentration of the centered elements. While microtubules provide 3-dimensional polarity, actin filaments ensure fast and dense compaction and long-range organization.",

    "abstract": "During early embryogenesis, mechanical signals, localized biochemical signals and neighboring cell layers interaction coordinate around anteroposterior axis determination and symmetry breaking. Deciphering their relative roles, which are hard to tease apart in vivo, will enhance our understanding of how these processes are driven. In recent years, in vitro 3D models of early mammalian development, such as embryoid bodies (EBs) and gastruloids, were successful in mimicking various aspects of the early embryo, providing high throughput accessible systems for studying the basic rules shaping cell fate and morphology during embryogenesis. Using Brachyury (Bry), a primitive streak and mesendoderm marker in EBs, we study how contact, biochemical and neighboring cell cues affect the positioning of a primitive streak-like locus, determining the AP axis. We show that a Bry-competent layer must be formed in the EB before Bry expression initiates, and that Bry onset locus selection depends on contact points of the EB with its surrounding. We can maneuver Bry onset to occur at a specific locus, a few loci, or in an isotropic peripheral pattern. By spatially separating contact and biochemical signal sources, we show these two modalities can be integrated by the EB to generate a single Bry locus. Finally, we show Foxa2+ cells are predictive of the future location of Bry onset, demonstrating an earlier symmetry-breaking event. By delineating the temporal signaling pathway dependencies of Bry and Foxa2, we were able to selectively abolish either, or spatially decouple the two cell types during EB differentiation. These findings demonstrate multiple inputs integration during an early developmental process, and may prove valuable in directing in vitro differentiation.",

Applied to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the workflow identifies four subtypes based on global gene expression patterns and ontologies. Three correspond to known subtypes, while the fourth is a previously undescribed neuroendocrine variant (NEv2). Tumor deconvolution with subtype gene signatures shows that all of the subtypes are detectable in varying proportions in human and mouse tumors. To understand how multiple stable subtypes can arise within a tumor, we infer a network of transcription factors and develop BooleaBayes, a minimally-constrained Boolean rule-fitting approach. In silico perturbations of the network identify master regulators and destabilizers of its attractors. Specific to NEv2, BooleaBayes predicts ELF3 and NR0B1 as master regulators of the subtype, and TCF3 as a master destabilizer. Since the four subtypes exhibit differential drug sensitivity, with NEv2 consistently least sensitive, these findings may lead to actionable therapeutic strategies that consider SCLC intratumoral heterogeneity. Our systems-level approach should generalize to other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (Gpr158) is highly expressed in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It gained attention as it was implicated in physiological responses to stress and depression. Recently, Gpr158 has been shown to act as a pathway-specific synaptic organizer in the hippocampus, required for proper mossy fiber-CA3 neurocircuitry establishment, structure, and function. Although rodent Gpr158 expression is highest in CA3, considerable expression occurs in CA1 especially after the first postnatal month. Here, we combined hippocampal-dependent behavioral paradigms with subsequent electrophysiological and morphological analyses from the same group of mice to assess the effects of Gpr158 deficiency on CA1 physiology and function. We demonstrate deficits in spatial memory acquisition and retrieval in the Morris water maze paradigm, along with deficits in the acquisition of extinction memory in the passive avoidance test in Gpr158 KO mice. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed normal basal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, however, Schaffer collateral stimulation yielded dramatically reduced post-synaptic currents. Interestingly, intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidals was found increased, potentially acting as a compensatory mechanism to the reductions in Schaffer collateral-mediated drive. Both ex vivo and in vitro, neurons deficient for Gpr158 exhibited robust reductions in dendritic architecture and complexity, i.e., reduced length, surface, bifurcations, and branching. This effect was localized in the apical but not basal compartment of adult CA1 pyramidals, indicative of pathway-specific alterations. A significant positive correlation between spatial memory acquisition and extent of complexity of CA1 pyramidals was found. Taken together, we provide first evidence of significant disruptions in hippocampal CA1 neuronal dendritic architecture and physiology, driven by Gpr158 deficiency. Importantly, the hippocampal neuronal morphology deficits appear to support the impairments in spatial memory acquisition observed in Gpr158 KO mice.",

    "abstract": "D-site albumin promoter binding protein (DBP) supports the rhythmic transcription of downstream genes, in part by displaying high-amplitude cycling of its own transcripts compared to other circadian clock genes. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that poly(C) motif within DBP proximal promoters, in addition to an E-box element, provoked the transcriptional activation through increased RNA polymerase 2 (Pol2) recruitment by inducing higher chromatin accessibility. We also clarified that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is a key regulator that binds to the poly(C) motif on single-stranded DNAs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation further confirmed the expression-dependent and rhythmic binding of hnRNP K which was inhibited through its cytosolic localization mediated by time-dependent ERK activation. Knockdown of hnRNP K triggered low-amplitude mRNA rhythms in DBP and other core clock genes through transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, transgenic depletion of a Drosophila homolog of hnRNP K in circadian pacemaker neurons lengthened 24-hour periodicity in free-running locomotor behaviors. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the function of hnRNP K as a transcriptional amplifier of DBP, which acts rhythmically through its intracellular localization by the ERK phosphorylation and as an mRNA stabilizer along with its physiological significance in circadian rhythms of Drosophila.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn the case of mood disorders and the aging process, the mRNA expression and amplitude level of clock genes, including DBP, were reported to be diminished. However, the reason behind this decrease of clock gene amplitude and expression level remained unclear. Through this study, we revealed the regulatory mechanism behind the expression of clock genes, especially of DBP mRNA expression. In addition, we discovered that hnRNP K regulates more core clock genes than what we have previously known, such as Clock and Periods. Finally, we demonstrated the physiological significance of hnRNP K in Drosophila through its RNAi line model. Hence, our findings show the regulatory mechanism of circadian rhythm that may provide insight on mood disorder and aging process.",

    "abstract": "Predictions about the effect of natural selection on patterns of linked neutral variation are largely based on models involving the rapid fixation of unconditionally beneficial mutations. However, when phenotypes adapt to a new optimum trait value, the strength of selection on individual mutations decreases as the population adapts. Here, I use explicit forward simulations of a single trait with additive-effect mutations adapting to an optimum shift. Detectable \\\"hitch-hiking\\\" patterns are only apparent if i. the optimum shifts are large with respect to equilibrium variation for the trait, ii. mutation rates to large-effect mutations are low, and iii., large-effect mutations rapidly increase in frequency and eventually reach fixation, which typically occurs after the population reaches the new optimum. For the parameters simulated here, partial sweeps do not appreciably affect patterns of linked variation, even when the mutations are strongly selected. The contribution of new mutations versus standing variation to fixation depends on the mutation rate affecting trait values. Given the fixation of a strongly-selected variant, patterns of hitch-hiking are similar on average for the two classes of sweeps because sweeps from standing variation involving large-effect mutations are rare when the optimum shifts. The distribution of effect sizes of new mutations has little effect on the time to reach the new optimum, but reducing the mutational variance increases the magnitude of hitch-hiking patterns. In general, populations reach the new optimum prior to the completion of any sweeps, and the times to fixation are longer for this model than for standard models of directional selection. The long fixation times are due to a combination of declining selection pressures during adaptation and the possibility of interference among weakly selected sites for traits with high mutation rates.",

Here we introduced the DR structure of plastome in Selaginella vardei (Selaginellaceae, Lycophyta), trying to elucidate the mechanism of DR occurrence and stability maintenance.\\n\\nResultsThe plastome of S. vardei is 121,254 bp in length and encodes 76 different genes, of which 62 encode proteins, 10 encode tRNAs and four encode rRNAs. Unexpectedly, the two identical rRNA gene regions (13,893 bp) are arranged into DR, and a ca. 50-kb trnN-trnF inversion spanning one DR copy exists in S. vardei, comparing to the typical IR organization of Isoetes flaccida (Isoetaceae, Lycophyta). We find extremely rare short dispersed repeats (SDRs) in plastome of S. vardei and is confirmed in its closely related species S. indica. The occurrence time of DR in Selaginellaceae is estimated at late Triassic (ca. 215 Ma) based on the phylogenetic framework of land plants.\\n\\nConclusionsWe propose that the unconventional DR structure, co-occurred with extremely few SDRs, plays key role in maintaining the stability of plastome, and reflects a relic of the environmental upheaval during extinction event. We suggest that the ca. 50-kb inversion resulted in the DR structure, and recombination between DR regions is confirmed to generate multipartite subgenomes and diverse multimers, which shed lights on the diverse structures in plastome of land plants.",

Here we aimed to identify specific genetic variants that are shared between alcoholism, heroin and methamphetamine dependence.\\n\\nMethodsWe first conducted a combined case-control genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of 521 alcoholic, 1,026 heroin and 1,749 methamphetamine patients and 2,859 healthy controls. We then replicated the significant loci using an independent cohort (146 alcoholic, 1,045 heroin, 763 methamphetamine and 1,904 controls). Second, we examined the genetic effects of these identified SNPs on gene expression, addiction characteristics and brain images (gray and white matter). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of these genetic variants on addiction behaviors using self-administration rat models.\\n\\nResultsWe identified and validated four genome-wide significant loci in the combined cohorts in the discovery stage: ADH1B rs1229984 (P=6.45x10-10), ANKS1B rs2133896 (P=4.09x10-8), AGBL4 rs147247472 (P=4.30x10-8) and CTNNA2 rs10196867 (P=4.67x10-8). Association results for each dependence group showed that ADH1B rs1229984 was only associated with alcoholism, while the other three loci were associated with heroin, methamphetamine addiction and alcoholism respectively. Variants that were strongly linked to rs2133896 affected ANKS1B gene expression, heroin use frequency and interacted with heroin dependence to affect gray matter of the left calcarine and white matter of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. In addition, the reduced anks1b expression in the ventral tegmental area increased addiction vulnerability for heroin and methamphetamine in self-administration rat models.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings revealed several novel genome-wide significant SNPs and genes that synchronously affected the vulnerability and phenotypes for alcoholism, heroin and MA dependence.

Next generation sequencing technologies have big potentials to detect the structural variations precisely and comprehensively. Nevertheless, it is still difficult problem to detect large structural variations from short read sequence data. Major efforts have been achieved with paired-end reads, since discordant pairs directly reflect the existence of large rearrangement. Furthermore, approaches to detect structural variations from single-end reads are still worthwhile challenge because they allow wide choices of sequencing platforms.\\n\\nResultWe present ReALLEN, a series of tools to detect genomic rearrangement with base-pair resolution from single-end reads provided by next generation sequencing. We examined the performance of ReALLEN using simulated dataset and real dataset sequenced by Ion Torrent systems. In most cases on the simulated dataset, ReALLEN showed nearly 100% precision and better sensitivity than other major tools. Notably, ReALLEN showed stable scores even if it was on some unfavorable conditions, for example, low coverage or small variant size. On the real dataset sequenced by Ion Torrent systems, ReALLEN accurately found an insertional translocation that was crucial for the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia.\\n\\nConclusionReALLEN is useful to researchers in finding genomic rearrangements. It will contribute to discovery of cancer-specific fusion proteins, precise diagnosis of known types of cancers, and understanding of genetic diseases caused by abnormal chromosomes.",

It is the key to understanding morphology changes among species, inferring ancestral biochemical properties of life, and recovering migration routes in phylogeography. The goal is twofold: to reconstruct the character state at the tree root (e.g. the region of origin of some species), and to understand the process of state changes along the tree (e.g. species flow between countries). Although each goal can be achieved with high accuracy individually, we use mathematics and simulations to demonstrate that it is generally impossible to accurately estimate both the root state and the rates of state changes along the tree branches from the observed data at the tips of the tree. This inherent  Darwinian uncertainty principle concerning the simultaneous estimation of  pattern and  process governs ancestral reconstructions in biology. Increasing the number of tips improves the joint estimation accuracy for certain tree shapes that arise in evolutionary models, however, for other trees shapes it does not.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPChromosomal organization is relatively stable among avian species, especially with regards to sex chromosomes. Members of the large Sylvioidea clade however have a pair of neo-sex chromosomes which is unique to this clade and originate from a parallel translocation of a region of the ancestral 4A chromosome on both W and Z chromosomes. Here, we took advantage of this unusual event to study the early stages of sex chromosome evolution. To do so, we sequenced a female (ZW) of two Sylvioidea species, a Zosterops borbonicus and a Z. pallidus. Then, we organized the Z. borbonicus scaffolds along chromosomes and annotated genes. Molecular phylogenetic dating under various methods and calibration sets confidently confirmed the recent diversification of the genus Zosterops (1-3.5 million years ago), thus representing one of the most exceptional rates of diversification among vertebrates. We then combined genomic coverage comparisons of five males and seven females, and homology with the zebra finch genome (Taeniopygia guttata) to identify sex chromosome scaffolds, as well as the candidate chromosome breakpoints for the two translocation events. We observed reduced levels of within-species diversity in both translocated regions and, as expected, even more so on the neoW chromosome. In order to compare the rates of molecular evolution in genomic regions of the autosomal-to-sex transitions, we then estimated the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms ({pi}N/{pi}S) and substitutions (dN/dS). Based on both ratios, no or little contrast between autosomal and Z genes was observed, thus representing a very different outcome than the higher ratios observed at the neoW genes. In addition, we report significant changes in base composition content for translocated regions on the W and Z chromosomes and a large accumulation of transposable elements (TE) on the newly W region. Our results revealed contrasted signals of molecular evolution changes associated to these autosome-to-sex transitions, with congruent signals of a W chromosome degeneration yet a surprisingly weak support for a fast-Z effect.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of invasion and climate change biology research is to understand the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to anthropogenic disturbance, especially over large spatial and temporal scales. One significant, and sometimes unattainable, challenge of these studies is garnering sufficient numbers of relevant specimens, especially for species spread across multiple continents. We developed a citizen science project, \\\"Pieris Project\\\", to successfully amass thousands of specimens of the invasive agricultural pest Pieris rapae, the small cabbage white butterfly, from 32 countries worldwide. We then generated and analyzed genomic (ddRAD) and mitochondrial DNA sequence data for these samples to reconstruct and compare different global invasion history scenarios. Our results bolster historical accounts of the global spread and timing of P. rapae introductions. The spread of P. rapae over the last [~]160 years followed a linear series of at least four founding events, with each introduced population serving as the source for the next. We provide the first molecular evidence supporting the hypothesis that the ongoing divergence of the European and Asian subspecies of P. rapae ([~]1,200 yrBP) coincides with the domestication of brassicaceous crops. Finally, the international success of the Pieris Project allowed us to nearly double the geographic scope of our sampling (i.e., add >1,000 specimens from 13 countries), demonstrating the power of the public to aid scientists in collections-based research addressing important questions in ecology and evolutionary biology.\\n\\nNon-technical summaryWe provide genetic evidence that the success of the small cabbage white butterfly--its rise to one of the most widespread and abundant butterflies on the planet-- was largely facilitated by human activities, through the domestication of its food plants and the accidental movement of the butterfly by means of trade and human movement (migration). Through an international citizen science project--Pieris Project--people from around the world helped to unravel the global invasion history of this agricultural pest butterfly by collecting samples for DNA analysis.

    "abstract": "One striking characteristic of certain herpesviruses is their ability to induce rapid and widespread RNA decay in order to gain access to host resources. This phenotype is induced by viral endoribonucleases, including SOX in KSHV, muSOX in MHV68, BGLF5 in EBV and vhs in HSV-1. Here, we performed comparative RNA-seq upon expression of these herpesviral endonucleases in order to characterize their effect on the host transcriptome. Consistent with previous reports, we found that approximately two thirds of transcripts are downregulated in cells expressing any of these viral endonucleases. Among transcripts spared from degradation, we uncovered a cluster of transcripts that systematically escape degradation from all tested endonucleases. Among these escapees, we identified C19ORF66 and reveal that like the previously identified escapees, this transcript is protected from degradation by its 3UTR. We then show that C19ORF66, a known anti-viral protein, is a potent KSHV restriction factor, suggesting that its ability to escape viral cleavage may be an important component of the host response to viral infection. Collectively, our comparative approach is a powerful tool to pinpoint key regulators of the viral-host interplay and led us to uncover a novel KSHV regulator.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of human mitochondrial (mt) genome variation has been shown to provide insights to the human history and natural selection. By analyzing 24,167 human mt-genome samples, collected for five continents, we have developed a co-mutation network model to investigate characteristic human evolutionary patterns. The analysis highlighted richer co-mutating regions of the mt-genome, suggesting the presence of epistasis. Specifically, a large portion of COX genes was found to co-mutate in Asian and American populations, whereas, in African, European, and Oceanic populations, there was greater co-mutation bias in hypervariable regions. Interestingly, this study demonstrated hierarchical modularity as a crucial agent for these co-mutation networks. More profoundly, our ancestry-based co-mutation module analyses showed that mutations cluster preferentially in known mitochondrial haplogroups. Contemporary human mt-genome nucleotides most closely resembled the ancestral state, and very few of them were found to be ancestral-variants. Overall, these results demonstrated that subpopulation-based biases may favor mitochondrial gene specific epistasis.",

Here, we combine kinetic nano-scale imaging experiments with analysis of a mathematical model to resolve and compare the division stability of amyloid fibrils. Our theoretical results show that the division of any type of filament is uniquely described by a set of three characteristic properties, resulting in convergence to self-similar length distributions distinct to each fibril type and conditions applied. By applying these results to profile the dynamical stability towards breakage for four different amyloid types, we reveal particular differences in the division properties of disease-related amyloid formed from alpha-synuclein compared with non-disease associated model amyloid, the former showing lowered intrinsic stability towards breakage and increased likelihood of shedding smaller particles. Our results enable the comparison of protein filaments intrinsic dynamic stabilities, which are key to unravelling their toxic and infectious potentials.",

    "abstract": "Variation in natural selection across heterogenous landscapes often produces 1) among-population differences in phenotypic traits, 2) trait-by-environment associations, and 3) higher fitness of local populations. Using a broad literature search, we documented the frequency of these three signatures in plants native to North Americas Great Basin and asked which traits and environmental variables were involved. We also asked, independent of geographic distance, whether populations from more similar environments had more similar traits. From 327 experiments testing 121 taxa in 170 studies, we found 95.1% of 305 experiments reported among-population differences, and 81.4% of 161 experiments reported trait-by-environment associations. Locals showed greater survival in 67% of 24 reciprocal experiments that reported survival, and higher fitness in 90% of 10 reciprocal experiments that reported reproductive output. Variation in eight commonly-measured traits was associated with mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature at the source location, with notably strong relationships for flowering phenology, leaf size, and survival, among others. Although the Great Basin is sometimes perceived as environmentally homogenous, our results demonstrate widespread habitat-related population differentiation and local adaptation, suggesting that locally-sourced plants likely harbor restoration-relevant adaptations, and that certain key traits and environmental variables should be prioritized in future assessments of plants.",

    "abstract": "Both direct repeats (DR) and inverted repeats (IR) are documented in the published plastomes of four Selaginella species indicating the unusual and diverse plastome structure in the family Selaginellaceae. In this study, we newly sequenced complete plastomes of seven species from five main lineages of Selaginellaceae and also re-sequenced three species (S. tamariscina, S. uncinata and S. moellendorffii) to explore the evolutionary trajectory of Selaginellaceae plastomes. Our results showed that the plastomes of Selaginellaceae vary remarkably in size, gene contents, gene order and GC contents. Notably, both DR and IR structure existed in the plastomes of Selaginellaceae with DR structure being an early diverged character. The occurrence of DR structure was right after the Permian-Triassic (P-T) extinction (ca. 246 Ma) and remained in most subgenera of Selaginellaceae, whereas IR structure only reoccurred in the most derived subg. Heterostachys (ca. 23 Ma). The presence of a pair of large repeats psbK-trnQ, together with DR/IR region in S. bisulcata, S. pennata, S. uncinata, and S. hainanensis, could frequently mediate diverse homologous recombination and create approximately equal stoichiometric isomers (IR/DR-coexisting) and subgenomes. High proportion of repeats is presumably responsible for the dynamic IR/DR-coexisting plastomes, which possess a lower synonymous substitution rate (dS) compared with DR-possessing plastomes. We propose that the occurrence of DR structure, together with few repeats, is possibly selected to adapt to the environmental upheaval during the P-T crisis and the IR/DR-coexisting plastomes also reached an equilibrium in plastome organization through highly efficient homologous recombination to maintain stability.\\n\\nData depositionAll the plastomes were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MG272483-MG272484, MH598531-MH598537 and MK156800.",

    "abstract": "A theory of cortical function is proposed, based on a family of recurrent neural circuits, called ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted Neural Integrator Circuits). Here, the theory is applied to working memory and motor control. Working memory is a cognitive process for temporarily maintaining and manipulating information. Most empirical neuroscience research on working memory has measured sustained activity during delayed-response tasks, and most models of working memory are designed to explain sustained activity. But this focus on sustained activity (i.e., maintenance) ignores manipulation, and there are a variety of experimental results that are difficult to reconcile with sustained activity. ORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of activity, and ORGaNICs can be use to manipulate (as well as maintain) information during a working memory task. The theory provides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying responses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. When applied to motor systems, ORGaNICs can be used to convert spatial patterns of premotor activity to temporal profiles of motor control activity: different spatial patterns of pre-motor activity evoke different motor control dynamics. ORGaNICs offer a novel conceptual framework; Rethinking cortical computation in these terms should have widespread implications, motivating a variety of experiments.",

    "abstract": "Root and leaf traits are one means of understanding plant ecophysiological responses to environmental variation and disturbance. In mangroves, both chemical and morphological variations have been recorded in response to changes in inundation, salinity, and nutrient levels. Some have also been noted in urban environments, primarily in response to elevated nutrients and toxic substances. Yet these studies have not attempted to isolate the urban from the non-urban influences on both morphological and chemical traits. This study measured mangrove leaf and root chemical and morphological traits in herbarium samples and in field collected leaves and roots along a quantified urban gradient in three watersheds of Puerto Rico. It then correlated these traits with predictors of surrounding land cover, as well as with metrics of flooding and water chemistry. There were significant lines of evidence leading to an influence of urban sewage and roads on leaf and root traits. Leaf percent nitrogen increased with urbanization and with surface water nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, but its isotopic content decreased with increasing phosphorus, leading to the hypothesis that both nitrogen and phosphorus are fueling an otherwise co-limited community of mangroves and nitrogen fixing microbes. The most urban site harbored some of the highest metal concentrations, and there was evidence that elevated concentrations primarily influence fine roots. Other morphological traits are more likely explained by both water chemistry and leaf chemistry and should be considered when interpreting the influence of urban landscapes on mangroves. Percent nitrogen in herbarium samples increased at the least urban site, but remained unchanged at the most urban site, reflecting the relative levels of urbanization at the time of the first samples and their subsequent changes. Most metals from herbarium samples decreased or remained unchanged, suggesting regulation and infrastructure have helped to reduce the release of trace metals to the estuaries. Understanding the influence of urbanization in the context of water chemistry and flooding dynamics will aid in the management of these systems as global urbanization continues.",

To understand how a sharp gradient is formed within this dynamic environment, we followed the generation of graded nuclear Dorsal (Dl) protein, the hallmark of pattern formation along the dorso-ventral axis, in live embryos. We show that a sharp gradient is formed through extracellular, diffusion-based morphogen shuttling that progresses through several nuclear divisions. Perturbed shuttling in wntD mutant embryos results in a flat activation peak and aberrant gastrulation. Re-entry of Dl into the nuclei at each cycle refines the signaling output, by guiding graded accumulation of the T48 transcript that drives patterned gastrulation. We conclude that diffusion-based ligand shuttling, coupled with dynamic readout, establishes a refined pattern within the diffusible environment of early embryos.",

This is because cloud-scale computing resources, from robust backup to highspeed data transfer to scalable compute and storage, are needed to make these large datasets usable. However, one challenge for large-scale biomedical data on the cloud is providing secure access, especially when datasets are distributed across platforms. While there are open Web protocols for secure authentication and authorization, these protocols are not in wide use in bioinformatics and are difficult to use for even technologically sophisticated users.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed a generic and extensible approach for securely accessing biomedical datasets distributed across cloud computing platforms. Our approach combines OpenID Connect and OAuth2, best-practice Web protocols for authentication and authorization, together with Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org), a web-based computational workbench used by thousands of scientists across the world. With our enhanced version of Galaxy, users can access and analyze data distributed across multiple cloud computing providers without any special knowledge of access/authorization protocols. Our approach does not require users to share permanent credentials (e.g., username, password, API key), instead relying on automatically-generated temporary tokens that refresh as needed. Our approach is generalizable to most identity providers and cloud computing platforms. To the best of our knowledge, Galaxy is the only computational workbench where users can access biomedical datasets across multiple cloud computing platforms using best-practice Web security approaches and thereby minimize risks of unauthorized data access and credential use.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationFreely available for academic and commercial use under the open-source Academic Free License (https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0) from the following Github repositories: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy and https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudauthz\\n\\nContactjalili@ohsu.edu, goecksj@ohsu.edu",

    "abstract": "The allocation of attention can be modulated by the emotional value of a stimulus. In order to understand the biasing influence of emotion on attention allocation further, we require an animal test of how motivational salience modulates attention. In mice, female odour triggers arousal and elicits emotional responses in males. Here, we determined the extent to which objects labelled with female odour modulated the attention of C57BL/6J male mice. Seven experiments were conducted, using a modified version of the spontaneous Novel Object Recognition task. Attention was operationalised as differential exploration time of identical objects that were labelled with either female mouse odour (O+), a non-social odour, almond odour (Oa) or not labelled with any odour (O-). In some experiments we tested trial unique (novel) objects than never carried an odour (X-). We found that when single objects were presented, as well as when two objects were presented simultaneously (so competed with each other for attention), O+ received preferential attention compared to O-. This result was independent of whether O+ was at a novel or familiar location. When compared with Oa at a novel location, O+ at a familiar location attracted more attention. Compared to X-, O+ received more exploration only when placed at a novel location, but attention to O+ and X- was equivalent when they were placed in a familiar location. These results suggest that C57BL/6J male mice weigh up aspects of odour, object novelty and special novelty for motivational salience, and that, in some instances, female odour elicits more attention (object exploration) compared to other olfactory stimuli and visual object novelty. The findings of this study pave the way to using motivationally-significant odours to modulate the cognitive processes that give rise to novel object recognition.",

This performance may be affected by the subjects adjusting their initial posture in anticipation of the perturbation.\\n\\nResearch questionsDo elderly fallers and non-fallers adjust their posture in anticipation of externally-imposed perturbations in a laboratory setting, and how does this impact their balance recovery performance?\\n\\nMethods21 elderly non-fallers, 18 age-matched elderly fallers and 11 young adults performed both a forward waist-pull perturbation task and a Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT) task. Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded. For each group, we evaluated the balance recovery performance in the perturbation task, change in initial center of mass (CoM) position between the CSRT and the perturbation task, and the influence of initial CoM position on task performance.\\n\\nResultsThe balance recovery performance of elderly fallers was equivalent to elderly non-fallers (p > 0.5 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). All subject groups anticipated forward perturbations by shifting their CoM backward compared to the CSRT task (young: 2.1% of lower limb length, elderly non-fallers: 2.7%, elderly fallers: 2.2%, Hodges-Lehmann estimator, p < 0.001 Mann-Whitney U). This backward shift increases the probability of resisting the traction without taking a step.\\n\\nSignificanceThe ability to anticipate perturbations is preserved in elderly fallers and may explain their preserved balance recovery performance in laboratory-based perturbation tasks. Therefore, future studies aimed at predicting fall risk in elderly adults should carefully control for this postural strategy, by interleaving perturbations of different directions for example.",

    "abstract": "Retinal input is frequently lost due to eye blinks, yet humans rarely notice these gaps in visual input. While previous studies focused on the psychophysical and neural correlates of diminished awareness to blinks, the impact of blinks on the perceived time of concurrent events is unknown. Here, we investigated whether the subjective sense of time is altered by spontaneous eye blinks, and how this link may inform mechanisms of time perception. We found that participants significantly underestimated the duration of a visual stimulus when a blink occurred during the stimulus. Importantly, this effect was not present when durations of an auditory stimulus were judged. These results point to a link between spontaneous blinks, previously demonstrated to induce suppression of activity in early visual cortex, and a compression of subjective time. The findings suggest that ongoing encoding within modality-specific sensory cortices, independent of conscious awareness, inform the subjective sense of time.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enables non-invasive modulation of brain activity with both clinical and research applications, but fundamental questions remain about the neural types and elements it activates and how stimulation parameters affect the neural response. We integrated detailed neuronal models with TMS-induced electric fields in the human head to quantify the effects of TMS on cortical neurons. TMS activated with lowest intensity layer 5 pyramidal cells at their intracortical axonal terminations in the superficial gyral crown and lip regions. Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and inhibitory basket cells may be activated too, whereas direct activation of layers 1 and 6 was unlikely. Neural activation was largely driven by the field magnitude, contrary to theories implicating the field component normal to the cortical surface. Varying the induced currents direction caused a waveform-dependent shift in the activation site and provided a mechanistic explanation for experimentally observed differences in thresholds and latencies of muscle responses. This biophysically-based simulation provides a novel method to elucidate mechanisms and inform parameter selection of TMS and other forms of cortical stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Microbial production of butanol and isopropanol, two high value-added chemicals, is naturally occurring in the solventogenic Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423. Despite its ancient discovery, the precise mechanisms controlling alcohol synthesis in this microorganism are poorly understood. In this work, an allyl alcohol tolerant strain obtained by random mutagenesis was characterized. This strain, designated as the AA mutant, shows a dominant production of acids, a severely diminished butanol synthesis capacity, and produces acetone instead of isopropanol. Interestingly, this solvent-deficient strain was also found to have a limited consumption of two carbohydrates and to be still able to form spores, highlighting its particular phenotype. Sequencing of the AA mutant revealed point mutations in several genes including CIBE_0767 (sigL), which encodes the {sigma}54 sigma factor. Complementation with the wild-type sigL gene fully restored solvent production and sugar assimilation, demonstrating that {sigma}54 plays a central role in regulating these pathways in C. beijerinckii DSM 6423. Genomic comparison with other strains further revealed that these functions are probably conserved among the C. beijerinckii strains. The importance of {sigma}54 in C. beijerinckii was further assessed by the characterization of a sigL deletion mutant of the model strain NCIMB 8052 obtained with a CRISPR/Cas9 tool. The resulting mutant exhibited phenotypic traits similar to the AA strain, and was subsequently complemented with the sigL gene from either the wild type or the AA strains. The results of this experiment confirmed the crucial role of {sigma}54 in the regulation of both solventogenesis and sugar consumption pathways in C. beijerinckii.\\n\\nImportanceClostridium beijerinckii shows a significant potential for producing valuable biochemicals and biofuels. One of the major hurdles impeding its widespread usage is its low endogenous production of alcohols, which could be alleviated by metabolic engineering approaches. Despite its former long-time use in the industrial acetone-butanol-ethanol process, the molecular mechanisms controlling solventogenesis in the Clostridium genus still remain elusive, preventing genetic engineering approaches for strain enhancement. In this context, our study provides novel insights into the crucial role of the {sigma}54 transcriptional factor in solvent synthesis regulation in two C. beijerinckii strains. Furthermore, we show that this sigma factor also controls sugar consumption and is therefore a key controller of carbon metabolism in this species.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe introduce a novel animal model of somatosensory stimulation-induced reflex seizures which generates focal seizures without causing damage to the brain.\\n\\nMethodsSpecifically, we electrically stimulated digits or forepaws of adult rats sedated with dexmedetomidine while imaging cerebral blood volume and recording neurophysiological activity in cortical area S1FL. For the recordings, we either inserted a linear probe into the D3 digit representation or we performed surface electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings.\\n\\nResultsPeripheral stimulation of a digit or the forepaw elicited seizures that were followed by a refractory period with decreased neuronal activity, or another seizure or a normal response. LFP amplitudes in response to electrical pulses during the seizures (0.28 {+/-} 0.03 mV) were higher than during normal evoked responses (0.25 {+/-} 0.05 mV) and refractory periods (0.2 {+/-} 0.08 mV). Seizures generated during the stimulation period showed prolonged after-discharges that were sustained for 20.9{+/-}1.9 s following the cessation of the stimulus. High-frequency oscillations were observed prior to and during the seizures, with amplitudes higher than those associated with normal evoked responses. The seizures were initially focal. Optical imaging of the cerebral blood volume response showed that they propagated from the onset zone to adjacent cortical areas, beyond the S1FL representation of the stimulated digit or forepaw. The spatial extent during seizures was on average 1.74 times larger during the stimulation and 4.1 times following its cessation relative to normal evoked responses. Seizures were recorded not only by probes inserted into cortex but also with ECoG arrays (24.1{+/-}5.8 seizures per rat) placed over the dura matter, indicating that the seizures were not induced by damage caused by inserting the probes to cortex. Stimulation of the forepaw elicited more seizures (18.8{+/-}8.5 seizures per rat) than stimulation of a digit (1.7{+/-}0.7). Unlike rats sedated with dexmedetomidine, rats anesthetized with urethane showed no seizures, indicating that the seizures may depend on the use of the mild sedative dexmedetomidine.\\n\\nSignificanceOur proposed animal model generates seizures induced by electrical sensory stimulation free of artifacts and brain damage.

    "abstract": "The mangroves of Puerto Rico occupy a broad gradient of urbanization that offers a chance to test hypotheses on urban faunal communities from both terrestrial and mangrove systems. These hypotheses state that urban avifaunal communities are less diverse, with greater representation by generalists, but that certain mangrove specialists can utilize urban landscapes. Much of this is said to be driven by food resources, with frugivores and nectarivores benefiting from abundant residential flowers and fruits, while insectivores are driven away by low food resources. This study used passive acoustic monitoring to identify the audible anuran and avifaunal species in mangroves across the urban gradient of Puerto Rico. Three anurans and twenty-four avian species were detected across all sites, with eighteen species found at the most diverse site, and six at the least diverse site. The most urban communities were more similar to each other and characterized by low diversity, especially of invertivores, mangrove specialists, and endemics. The least urban communities, however, were less like each other and more diverse than their more urban counterparts. Greater surrounding vegetation cover was the strongest overall predictor of increased faunal diversity, although urban coverage and population density were also strongly correlated with some guilds and species. Soundscape analyses showed that acoustic space use was a strong predictor of site diversity and is thus a sufficiently accurate faster alternative to detecting individual species. This will be an important tool in the continued monitoring of these forests, which may experience changes associated with ongoing urbanization and sea-level rise.",

    "abstract": "External perturbation forces may compromise standing balance. The nervous system can intervene only after a delay greater than 100 ms, during which the body falls freely. With ageing, sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays to understand how the organism should adapt to challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations, for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing. Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBeing able to stand still can be difficult when faced with an unexpected push. It takes the nervous system more than a tenth of a second to respond to such a perturbation, and during this delay the body falls under the influence of its own weight. By co-contracting their ankle muscles in anticipation of a perturbation, subjects can increase their ankle stiffness, which slows down their fall during the neural delay. Young subjects indeed adopt this strategy when they need to remain particularly still (for example when they stand in front of a cliff). Older subjects adopt this strategy even during normal standing. We present a model of standing balance that shows that this postural strategy provides partial compensation for the increase in neural delays with ageing. According to our model, increasing ankle stiffness only improves balance if it is accompanied by a decrease in sensorimotor gain. This provides a novel and functional interpretation for the decrease in spinal feedback observed during ageing, and observed in young subjects when they stand in challenging balance conditions.",

Classical experiments from nearly a century ago reveal that plant shoots respond to the integrated history of light and gravity stimuli rather than just responding instantaneously. We introduce a temporally non-local response function for the dynamics of shoot growth formulated as an integro-differential equation whose solution allows us to qualitatively reproduce experimental observations associated with intermittent and unsteady stimuli. Furthermore, an analytic solution for the case of a pulse light stimulus expresses the response function as function of experimentally tractable variables for the phototropic response of Arabidopsis hypocotyls. All together, our model enables us to predict tropic responses to time-varying stimuli, manifested in temporal integration phenomena, and sets the stage for the incorporation of additional effects such as multiple stimuli, gravitational sagging etc.",

Here, we assess the performance of a convolutional neural network for the detection of acute tibial fractures trained with a limited number of cases in skeletally immature patients. This retrospective study was performed on radiology reports manually classified as normal or tibial fracture. Classified images of orthopaedic implants, casting, and images including other pathology were excluded. The remaining cases constituted 516 studies containing 2118 radiographs. These radiographs were truncated to include a limited investigated field of view which included the distal third of the leg, inclusive of the distal physis. After exclusions, the culled dataset was randomly divided into a training set containing 784 radiographs, a validation set containing 98 radiographs, and a test set 98 radiographs. We used a modified transfer learning approach based on the Xception architecture with additional fully convoluted reasoning and drop-out layers. Of 49 fractures, two were misdiagnosed as normal. Of 49 normal exams, none were misdiagnosed. This led to model accuracy of 97.9%, sensitivity 95.9%, and specificity 100%, comparable to or better than human radiologists. In no instances were normal physes or normal developmental epiphyseal fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity or medial malleolus misclassified as a fracture.

Methods for detection of single-cell epigenomic variation such as DNA methylation sequencing and ATAC-seq hold tremendous promise for delineating distinct cell types and identifying their critical cis-regulatory sequences. Emerging evidence has shown that in addition to cis-regulatory sequences, dynamic regulation of 3D chromatin conformation is a critical mechanism for the modulation of gene expression during development and disease. It remains unclear whether single-cell Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) or Hi-C profiles are suitable for cell type identification and allow the reconstruction of cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps. To address these challenges, we have developed a multi-omic method single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (sn-m3C-seq) to profile chromatin conformation and DNA methylation from the same cell. We have shown that bulk m3C-seq and sn-m3C-seq accurately capture chromatin organization information and robustly separate mouse cell types. We have developed a fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting strategy based on DNA content that eliminates nuclei multiplets caused by crosslinking. The sn-m3C-seq method allows high-resolution cell-type classification using two orthogonal types of epigenomic information and the reconstruction of cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps.",

Oligomerization of RIG-I-like receptors on cytosolic dsRNA nucleates self-assembly of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). In the current signaling model, the caspase recruitment domains of MAVS form helical fibrils that self-propagate like prions to promote signaling complex assembly. However, there is no conclusive evidence that MAVS forms fibrils in cells or with the transmembrane anchor present. We show here with super-resolution light microscopy that MAVS activation by dsRNA induces mitochondrial membrane remodeling. Quantitative image analysis at imaging resolutions as high as 32 nm shows that in the cellular context MAVS signaling complexes and the fibrils within them are smaller than 80 nm. The transmembrane domain of MAVS is required for its membrane remodeling, interferon signaling and proapoptotic activities. We conclude that membrane tethering of MAVS restrains its polymerization and contributes to mitochondrial remodeling and apoptosis upon dsRNA sensing.",

The rationale for these cell therapy trials is derived from animal studies that show a modest but reproducible improvement in cardiac function in models of cardiac ischemic injury7-9. Here we examined the mechanistic basis for cell therapy in mice after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and while heart function was enhanced, it was not associated with new cardiomyocyte production. Cell therapy improved heart function through an acute sterile immune response characterized by the temporal and regional induction of CCR2+ and CX3CR1+ macrophages. Here we observed that intra-cardiac injection of 2 distinct types of progenitor cells, freeze/thaw-killed cells or a chemical inducer of the innate immune response similarly induced regional CCR2+ and CX3CR1+ macrophage accumulation and provided functional rejuvenation to the I/R-injured heart. Mechanistically, this selective macrophage response altered cardiac fibroblast activity and reduced border zone extracellular matrix (ECM) content and enhanced the mechanical properties of the injured area. The functional benefit of cardiac cell therapy is thus due to an acute inflammatory-based wound healing response that rejuvenates the mechanical properties of the infarcted area of the heart. Such results suggest a re-evaluation of strategies underlying cardiac cell therapy in current and planned human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative comparison of epigenomic data across multiple cell types or experimental conditions is a promising way to understand the biological functions of epigenetic modifications. However, differences in sequencing depth and signal-to-noise ratios in the data from different experiments can hinder our ability to identify real biological variation from raw epigenomic data. Proper normalization is required prior to data analysis to gain meaningful insights. Most existing methods for data normalization standardize signals by rescaling either background regions or peak regions, assuming that the same scale factor is applicable to both background and peak regions. While such methods adjust for differences in sequencing depths, they do not address differences in the signal-to-noise ratios across different experiments. We developed a new data normalization method, called S3norm, that normalizes the sequencing depths and signal-to-noise ratios across different data sets simultaneously by a monotonic nonlinear transformation. We show empirically that the epigenomic data normalized by our method, compared to existing methods, can better capture real biological variation, such as impact on gene expression regulation.",

    "abstract": "Germline mutation rates in humans have been estimated for a variety of mutation types, including single nucleotide and large structural variants. Here we directly measure the germline retrotransposition rate for the three active retrotransposon elements: L1, Alu, and SVA. We utilized three tools for calling Mobile Element Insertions (MEIs) (MELT, RUFUS, and TranSurVeyor) on blood-derived whole genome sequence (WGS) data from 603 CEPH individuals, comprising 33 three-generation pedigrees. We identified 27 de novo MEIs in 440 births. The retrotransposition rate estimates for Alu elements, one in 40, is roughly half the rate estimated using phylogenetic analyses, a difference in magnitude similar to that observed for single nucleotide variants. The L1 retrotransposition rate is one in 62 births and is within range of previous estimates (1:20-1:200 births). The SVA retrotransposition rate, one in 55 births, is much higher than the previous estimate of one in 900 births. Our large, three-generation pedigrees allowed us to assess parent-of-origin effects and the timing of insertion events in either gametogenesis or early embryonic development. We find a statistically significant paternal bias in Alu retrotransposition. Our study represents the first in-depth analysis of the rate and dynamics of human retrotransposition from WGS data in three-generation human pedigrees.",
