    "abstract": "In this paper a formal model of associative learning is presented which incorporates representational and computational mechanisms that, as a coherent corpus, empower it to make accurate predictions of a wide variety of phenomena that so far have eluded a unified account in learning theory. In particular, the Double Error Dynamic Asymptote (DDA) model introduces: 1) a fully-connected network architecture in which stimuli are represented as temporally clustered elements that associate to each other, so that elements of one cluster engender activity on other clusters, which naturally implements neutral stimuli associations and mediated learning; 2) a predictor error term within the traditional error correction rule (the double error), which reduces the rate of learning for expected predictors; 3) a revaluation associability rate that operates on the assumption that the outcome predictiveness is tracked over time so that prolonged uncertainty is learned, reducing the levels of attention to initially surprising outcomes; and critically 4) a biologically plausible variable asymptote, which encapsulates the principle of Hebbian learning, leading to stronger associations for similar levels of cluster activity. The outputs of a set of simulations of the DDA model are presented along with empirical results from the literature. Finally, the predictive scope of the model is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Frequency analysis of sound by the cochlea relies on sharp frequency tuning of mechanosensory hair cells along a tonotopic axis. To clarify the underlying biophysical mechanism, we have investigated the micromechanical properties of the hair cells mechanoreceptive hair bundle in the rat cochlea. We studied both inner and outer hair cells, which send nervous signals to the brain and amplify cochlear vibrations, respectively. We find that tonotopy is associated with gradients of stiffness and resting mechanical tension, with steeper gradients for outer hair cells, emphasizing the division of labor between the two hair-cell types. We demonstrate that tension in the tip links that convey force to the mechano-electrical transduction channels increases at reduced Ca2+. Finally, we reveal tonotopic gradients in stiffness and tension at the level of a single tip link. We conclude that intrinsic mechanical gradients of the tip-link complex help specify the characteristic frequency of the hair cell.",

Here we analyze how Notch signaling modulates transcriptional bursting during animal development. Our focus is Notch regulation of transcription in germline stem cells of the nematode C. elegans.

We find that Notch-dependent transcriptional activation is indeed \\\"bursty\\\"; that wild-type Notch modulates burst duration (ON-time) rather than duration of pauses between bursts (OFF-time) or mean burst intensity; and that a mutant Notch receptor, which is compromised for assembly into the Notch transcription factor complex, primarily modifies burst size (duration x intensity).

    "abstract": "The RNA binding protein PTBP2 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2) is a key regulator of tissue-specific alternative RNA splicing. In the testis, PTBP2 is expressed in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells (spermatocytes and spermatids, respectively). In these cells, PTBP2 is required for proper alternative mRNA splicing for over 200 genes, disproportionately affecting genes encoding proteins involved in protein trafficking via transport vesicles. In this study, we used electron microscopy to test the hypothesis that protein trafficking is impaired in the absence of PTBP2, and to further investigate why spermatogenesis abruptly ceases in PTBP2-deficienct spermatids. Ultrastructural analysis shows that protein trafficking in spermatids is aberrant in the absence of PTBP2. Unexpectedly, we also found that mitochondria morphology and number are significantly altered in PTBP2-deficient spermatids, consistent with increased mitochondria fission. Furthermore, we show that genes with key roles in mitochondria dynamics and function are post-transcriptionally regulated by PTBP2 and in different stages of spermatogenesis. Collectively, the data provide ultrastructural evidence that alternative splicing regulation by PTBP2 during spermatogenesis is critical for proper regulation of protein trafficking and mitochondria morphology.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the accelerated aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) can potentially reveal cellular defects associated with physiological aging. HGPS results from expression and abnormal nuclear envelope association of a farnesylated, truncated variant of prelamin A called progerin. We surveyed the diffusional mobilities of nuclear membrane proteins to identify proximal effects of progerin expression. The mobilities of three proteins were reduced in fibroblasts from children with HGPS compared to normal fibroblasts: SUN2, nesprin-2G, and emerin. These proteins function together in nuclear movement and centrosome orientation in fibroblasts polarizing for migration. Both processes were impaired in fibroblasts from children with HGPS and in NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing progerin, but were restored by inhibiting protein farnesylation. Progerin affected both the coupling of the nucleus to actin cables and the oriented flow of the cables necessary for nuclear movement and centrosome orientation. Progerin overexpression increased levels of SUN1, which couples the nucleus to microtubules through nesprin-2G and dynein, and microtubule association with the nucleus. Reducing microtubule-nuclear connections through SUN1 depletion or dynein inhibition rescued the polarity defects. Nuclear movement and centrosome orientation were also defective in fibroblasts from normal individuals over 60 years old and both defects were rescued by reducing the increased level of SUN1 in these cells or inhibiting dynein. Our results identify imbalanced nuclear engagement of the cytoskeleton (microtubules, high; actin filaments, low) as the basis for intrinsic cell polarity defects in HGPS and physiological aging and suggest that rebalancing the connections can ameliorate the defects.\\n\\nSignificanceThe rare, premature aging syndrome HGPS arises from expression of a pathological prelamin A variant, termed progerin. Studies of progerin may identify treatments for HGPS and reveal novel cellular and molecular characteristics of normal aging. Here, we show that progerin selectively affects mobilities of three nuclear membrane proteins, SUN2, nesprin-2G and emerin that position the nucleus and establish cell polarity essential for migration. We find that both processes are defective in fibroblasts from children with HGPS and aged (> 60 years) individuals. The mechanism underlying these defects is excessive interaction of the nucleus with microtubules. Our work identifies nuclear-based defects in cell polarization as intrinsic factors in premature and physiological aging and suggests means for correcting them.",

    "abstract": "Information from developmental signaling pathways must be accurately decoded to generate transcriptional outcomes. In the case of Notch, the intracellular domain (NICD) transduces the signal directly to the nucleus. How enhancers decipher NICD in the real time of developmental decisions is not known. Using the MS2/MCP system to visualize nascent transcripts in single cells in Drosophila embryos we reveal how two target enhancers read Notch activity to produce synchronized and sustained profiles of transcription. By manipulating the levels of NICD and altering specific motifs within the enhancers we uncover two key principles. First, increased NICD levels alter transcription by increasing duration rather than frequency of transcriptional bursts. Second, priming of enhancers by tissue-specific transcription factors is required for NICD to confer synchronized and sustained activity; in their absence, transcription is stochastic and bursty. The dynamic response of an individual enhancer to NICD thus differs depending on the cellular context.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAtherosclerosis is characterized by lipid deposition, monocyte infiltration and foam cell formation in the artery wall. Translocator protein (TSPO) is abundantly expressed in lipid rich tissues. Recently, TSPO has been identified as a potential diagnostic tool in cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the TSPO ligand, 18F-PBR111, can identify early atherosclerotic lesions and if TSPO expression can be used to identify distinct macrophage populations during lesion progression.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsApoE-/- mice were maintained on a high-fat diet for 3 or 12 weeks. C57BL/6J mice maintained on chow diet served as controls. Mice were administered 18F-PBR111 intravenously and PET/CT imaged. After euthanasia, aortas were isolated, fixed and optically cleared. Cleared aortas were immunostained with DAPI, and fluorescently labelled with antibodies to-TSPO, the tissue resident macrophage marker F4/80 and the monocyte-derived macrophage marker CD11b. TSPO expression and the macrophage markers were visualised in fatty streaks and mature lesions by light sheet microscopy. While tissue resident F4/80+ macrophages were evident in the arteries of animals without atherosclerosis, no CD11b+ macrophages were observed in these animals. In contrast, mature plaques had high CD11b and low F4/80 expression. A ~3-fold increase in the uptake of 18F-PBR111 was observed in the aortas of atherosclerotic mice relative to controls.\\n\\nConclusionsImaging of TSPO expression is a new approach for studying atherosclerotic lesion progression and inflammatory cell infiltration. The TSPO ligand, 18F-PBR111, is a potential clinical diagnostic tool for the detection and quantification of atherosclerotic lesion progression in humans.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancers display phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and several lines of evidence support the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in certain breast cancers, a minor population of cells capable of tumor initiation and metastatic dissemination. Identifying factors that regulate the CSC phenotype is therefore important for developing strategies to treat metastatic disease. The Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1 (Id1) and its closely related family member Inhibitor of Differentiation 3 (Id3) (collectively termed Id) are expressed by a diversity of stem cells and are required for metastatic dissemination in experimental models of breast cancer. In this study, we show that ID1 is expressed in rare neoplastic cells within ER-negative breast cancers. To address the function of Id1 expressing cells within tumors, we developed two independent murine models of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in which a genetic reporter permitted the prospective isolation of Id1+ cells. Id1+ cells are enriched for self-renewal in tumorsphere assays in vitro and for tumor initiation in vivo. Conversely, depletion of Id1 and Id3 in the 4T1 murine model of TNBC demonstrates that Id1/3 are required for cell proliferation and self-renewal in vitro, as well as primary tumor growth and metastatic colonization of the lung in vivo. Using combined bioinformatic analysis, we have defined a novel mechanism of Id protein function via negative regulation of the Roundabout Axon Guidance Receptor Homolog 1 (Robo1) leading to activation of a Myc transcriptional programme.",

    "abstract": "NAD+ administration is highly beneficial in numerous models of diseases and aging. It is becoming increasingly important to determine if NAD+ treatment may increase directly the antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions. In current study we tested our hypothesis that NAD+ can enhance directly antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions by using differentiated PC12 cells as a cellular model. We found that NAD+ treatment can increase the GSH/GSSG ratios in the cells under basal conditions. NAD+ can also increase both the mRNA and protein level of {gamma}-glutamylcysteine ligase - a key enzyme for glutathione synthesis, which appears to be mediated by the NAD+-induced increase in Nrf2 activity. These NAD+-induced changes can be prevented by both SIRT2 siRNA and the SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2. The NAD+-induced changes can also be blocked by the ERK signaling inhibitor U0126. Moreover, the NAD+-induced ERK activation can be blocked by both SIRT2 siRNA and AGK2. Collectively, our study has provided the first evidence that NAD+ can enhance directly the antioxidant capacity of the cells under basal conditions, which is mediated by SIRT2, ERK, and Nrf2. These findings have suggested not only the great nutritional potential of NAD+, but also a novel mechanism underlying the protective effects of the NAD+ administration in the disease models: The NAD+ administration can enhance the resistance of the normal cells to oxidative insults by increasing the antioxidant capacity of the cells.",

However, it remains unknown whether whole-brain networks imaged at the cellular level are organized according to similar principles. Here, we analyze whole-brain functional networks reconstructed from calcium imaging data recorded in larval zebrafish. Our analyses reveal that functional connections are distance-dependent and that networks exhibit hierarchical modular structure and hubs that span module boundaries. We go on to show that spon-taneous network structure places constraints on stimulus-evoked reconfigurations of connections and that networks are highly consistent across individuals. Our analyses reveal, for the first time, basic organizing principles of whole-brain functional brain networks at the microscale. Our overarching methodological framework provides a blueprint for studying the correlated activity at the cellular level using a low-dimensional network representation. Our work forms a conceptual bridge between macro- and microscale network neuroscience and opens myriad paths for future studies to investigate network structure of nervous systems at the cellular level.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been reported to be overexpressed in malignancies in humans and is associated with tumorigenesis and cell migration. In previous studies of gastric cancer, alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7-nAChR) overexpression can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promote migration of gastric cancer cells. Recombinant avirulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota strain expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein (rL-RVG) may promote apoptosis of gastric cancer cells and reduces migration of lung cancer metastasis. However, whether rL-RVG inhibits migration of gastric cancer cells and what the underlying functional mechanism is remains unknown. In this study, our findings demonstrate that rL-RVG suppressed migration and reduced EMT of gastric cancer cells via 7-nAChR in vitro. Furthermore rL-RVG decreased the phosphorylation levels of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway such as down-regulating the expression of P-MEK and P-ERK. Additionally, rL-RVG also reduced the expression level of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Vimentin and enhanced the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Lastly, rL-RVG together with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) inhibited gastric cancer epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) which suppressed gastric cancer cell migration. We also found that rL-RVG suppresses the growth of gastric cancer subcutaneous tumor cells in vivo. Thus, rL-RVG inhibits 7-nAChR-MEK/ERK-EMT to suppress migration of gastric cancer cells.",
