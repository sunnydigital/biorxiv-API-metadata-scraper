    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is considered a major driving force of evolution since it generates and expands genetic diversity. Evidence of HR between co-infecting herpesvirus DNA genomes can be found frequently, both in vitro and in clinical isolates. Each herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication compartment (RC) derives from a single incoming genome and maintains a specific territory within the nucleus. This raises intriguing questions about where and when co-infecting viral genomes interact. To study the spatiotemporal requirements for inter-genomic recombination, we developed an assay with dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization which enables detection of HR between different pairs of co-infecting HSV-1 genomes. Our results revealed that when viral RCs enlarge towards each other, there is detectable overlap between territories of genomes from each virus. Infection with paired viruses that allow visualization of HR correlates with increased overlap of RCs. Further, inhibition of RC movement reduces the rate of HR events among co-infecting viruses. Taken together, these findings suggest that inter-genomic HR events take place during replication of HSV-1 DNA and are mainly confined to the periphery of RCs when they coalesce. Our observations have implications on understanding the recombination restrictions of other DNA viruses and cellular DNA.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed traveling-wave-like patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (< 2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the spatiotemporal neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCholinergic interneurons (CINs) are key modulators of the striatal microcircuitry that are necessary for assigning action value and behavioral flexibility. We present a first endoscopic imaging study of multiple molecularly identified CINs in freely moving mice. We reveal the presence of traveling-wave-like activity in the CIN neuropil. We then use ex vivo electrophysiological and imaging techniques to show that the neuropil signal is the integrated fluorescence arising from the axo-dendritic arbors of CINs dispersed throughout the striatum. We conclude that the neuropil signal acts as a mean-field readout of the striatal CIN network activity.",

In this study, we show that the 1RS/1RSRW polymorphism causes differences in root length in field and hydroponic experiments. In the latter, differences in seminal root length were associated with a developmentally regulated arrest of the root apical meristem (RAM). Approximately 10 days after germination, the seminal roots of the 1RSRW plants showed a gradual reduction in elongation rate and stopped growing a week later. Seventeen days after germination, the roots of the 1RSRW plants showed altered gradients of reactive oxygen species and emergence of lateral roots close to the RAM, suggesting a loss of apical dominance. The 1RS/1RSRW isogenic lines also differed in plant biomass and grain yield under normal, terminal drought, and waterlogging field conditions. The differences were larger in fields with reduced or excessive irrigation. These results suggest that this polymorphism may be useful to modulate root architecture and mitigate the negative impacts of excess or reduced water in wheat production.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTA wheat/rye polymorphism in chromosome one affects seminal root length and apical dominance and is associated with differences in drought and waterlogging tolerance in the field.",

In this study, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human post-catalytic spliceosome (P complex) and intron lariat spliceosome (ILS) at average resolutions of 3.0 and 2.9 [A], respectively. In the P complex, the ligated exon remains anchored to loop I of U5 small nuclear RNA, and the 3-splice site is recognized by the junction between the 5-splice site and the branch point sequence. The ATPase/helicase Prp22, along with the ligated exon and eight other proteins, are dissociated in the P-to-ILS transition. Intriguingly, the ILS complex exists in two distinct conformations, one with the ATPase/helicase Prp43 and one without. Comparison of these three late-stage human spliceosomes reveals mechanistic insights into exon release and spliceosome disassembly.",

    "abstract": "Despite high initial efficacy, therapies that target oncogenic kinases eventually fail in advanced, metastatic cancers. This failure in initially responsive tumors is the direct result of the evolution of drug resistance under therapy-imposed selective pressures. In contrast to the massive body of experimental research on the molecular mechanisms of resistance, understanding of its evolutionary origins and dynamics remains fragmented. Using a combination of experimental studies and mathematical modeling, we sought to dissect the evolution of resistance to different clinical ALK inhibitors in an experimental model of ALK positive NSCLC. We found that resistance can originate from heterogeneous, weakly resistant, sub-populations with variable sensitivity to different ALK inhibitors. Instead of the commonly assumed stochastic single hit (epi) mutational transition, or drug-induced reprogramming, we found evidence of a hybrid scenario, of gradual, multifactorial development through acquisition of multiple cooperating genetic and epigenetic adaptive changes, amplified by selection. Additionally, we found that intermediate resistance phenotypes might present unique, temporally restricted collateral sensitivities, absent in therapy naive or fully resistant cells, suggesting new opportunities for therapeutic interference.",

Following viral infection, NK cells display immune memory properties, defined by heightened responses to re-stimulation, an expansion of specific NK cell sup-populations and a protective role against re-infection. However, similar memory to bacterial infection or systemic inflammation, and the molecular mechanisms behind NK cell memory remain elusive. Here we show that following LPS-induced endotoxemia in mice, NK cells acquire cell-intrinsic memory properties as displayed by an amplified production of IFN{gamma} upon secondary stimulation. NK cell memory is acquired even under the post-endotoxemic suppressive environment and is detectable for at least 9 weeks. Furthermore, we define an epigenetic mechanism essential for NK cell memory, where an H3K4me1-marked latent enhancer is uncovered at the ifng locus. Chemical inhibition of histone methyltransferase activity erased the enhancer and prevented NK cells from acquiring memory. Thus, NK cells develop memory to LPS during endotoxemia, in a histone methylation-dependent manner, which ensures a heightened response to secondary stimulation and confers protection against bacterial infection.",

Further, we show that SPT6L enrichment is shifted, unexpectedly, from gene body to the transcription starting site (TSS) when its association with RNAPII is disrupted. Finally, we demonstrate that recruitment of SPT6L starts at TSS, and then spreads to the gene body during transcription. These findings refine the mechanisms underlying SPT6L recruitment in transcription and shed light on the role of SPT6L in transcription initiation.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plastic responses allow organisms to rapidly adjust when facing environmental challenges - these responses comprise morphological, behavioral but also life-history changes. Alteration of life-history traits when exposed to predation risk have been reported often in the ecological and genomic model organism Daphnia. However, the molecular basis of this response is not well understood, especially in the context of fish predation. Here, we characterized the transcriptional profiles of two Daphnia galeata clonal lines with opposed life histories when exposed to fish kairomones. First, we conducted a differential gene expression, identifying a total of 125 candidate transcripts involved in the predator-induced response, uncovering substantial intra-specific variation. Second, we applied a gene co-expression network analysis to find clusters of tightly linked transcripts revealing the functional relations of transcripts underlying the predator-induced response. Our results showed that transcripts involved in remodeling of the cuticle, growth and digestion correlated with the response to environmental change in D. galeata. Furthermore, we used an orthology-based approach to gain functional information for transcripts lacking gene ontology (GO) information, as well as insights into the evolutionary conservation of transcripts. We could show that our candidate transcripts have orthologs in other Daphnia species but almost none in other arthropods. The unique combination of methods allowed us to identify candidate transcripts, their putative functions and evolutionary history associated with predator-induced responses in Daphnia. Our study opens up to the question as to whether the same molecular signature is associated fish kairomones-mediated life-history changes in other Daphnia species.",

Quantitative reductions in select centromeric core and pericentromeric markers were observed in neoplastic samples as compared to healthy counterparts.

In order to answer this question the repertoires of five males were analysed from the viewpoint of network theory. In four of the five males a strong coherence of the repertoire was found to exist in anastomoses between strophe types, same elements being reached from different beginnings. The succession of strophe types in song sessions betrayed a mixture of relatively predictable cycles and chaotic connections. The former should facilitate repeated retrieval of a considerable part of the repertoire, while the chaotic component keeps the whole repertoire readily accessible from any point in a singing session. The same mixture may be considered optimal for binding the attention of conspecific listeners. It is concluded that the existing structure of blackbird song repertoires is favourable for the conservation of its richness, but it is as yet uncertain whether this is due to evolutionary (i.c. sexual) adaptation.",

Can it occur unconsciously? Here we show that it can. Participants underwent classical threat conditioning to visual stimuli that were suppressed from their awareness. One of two images was paired with an electric shock; halfway through the experiment, contingencies were reversed and the shock was paired with the other image. We found that physiological responses reflected changes in stimulus-threat pairings independently of stimulus awareness, demonstrating the sophistication of unconscious affective flexibility.",

However, the relatively modest brightness of signals from single RNA molecules can become limiting in a number of important applications, such as increasing the imaging throughput, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging samples with high degrees of background, such as some tissue samples. Here, we introduce a branched DNA (bDNA) amplification approach for MERFISH measurements. This approach produces a drastic signal increase in RNA FISH samples without increasing the fluorescent spot size for individual RNAs or increasing the variation in brightness from spot to spot. Using this approach in combination with MERFISH, we demonstrated RNA imaging and profiling with a near 100% detection efficiency. We further demonstrated that signal amplification improves MERFISH performance when fewer FISH probes are used for each RNA species, which should allow shorter RNAs to be imaged. We anticipate that the combination of bDNA amplification with MERFISH should facilitate many other applications and extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by this technique in both cell culture and tissues.",

The conversion of point pattern data into a meaningful description of clustering is difficult, especially for biologically derived data, as the definitions of clustering are often subjective or simplistic. Many existing computational approaches are also limited in their ability to process large-scale data-sets or to deal effectively with inhomogeneities in clustering. Here we have developed a supervised machine-learning approach to cluster analysis which is fast and accurate. Trained on a variety of simulated clustered data, the network can then classify all points from a typical localization microscopy data-set (several million points from the entire field of view) as being either clustered or not-clustered, with the potential to include additional classifiers to describe different types of clusters. Clustered points can then be further refined into like-clusters for the measurement of cluster area, shape, and point-density. We demonstrate the performance on simulated data and experimental data of the kinase Csk and the adaptor PAG in both naive and pre-stimulated primary human T cell synapses.",

    "abstract": "A central principle in motor control is that the coordination strategies learned by our nervous system are often optimal. Here we combined human experiments with computational reinforcement learning models to study how the nervous system navigates possible movements to arrive at an optimal coordination. Our experiments used robotic exoskeletons to reshape the relationship between how participants walk and how much energy they consume. We found that while some participants used their relatively high natural gait variability to explore the new energetic landscape and spontaneously initiate energy optimization, most participants preferred to exploit their originally preferred, but now suboptimal, gait. We could nevertheless reliably initiate optimization in these exploiters by providing them with the experience of lower cost gaits suggesting that the nervous system benefits from cues about the relevant dimensions along which to re-optimize its coordination. Once optimization was initiated, we found that the nervous system employed a local search process to converge on the new optimum gait over tens of seconds. Once optimization was completed, the nervous system learned to predict this new optimal gait and rapidly returned to it within a few steps if perturbed away. We model this optimization process as reinforcement learning and find behavior that closely matches these experimental observations. We conclude that the nervous system optimizes for energy using a prediction of the optimal gait, and then refines this prediction with the cost of each new walking step.",

Molecular diagnostic markers that are detectable in early-stage breast cancer can aid in effective clinical intervention. Circular RNAs are a recently identified group of non-coding RNA with potential role in cancer development and progression. In this study, we aimed to identify circular RNAs specific for early stage breast cancer.\\n\\nMethodCircular RNA expression profile was analyzed in early-stage breast cancer tissues (N=5), matched normal counterparts (N=5) and absolute normal samples (N=5) by RNA-sequencing that enables a comprehensive analysis of RNA expression across the transcriptome. Two different algorithms, find_circ and DCC were used to identify the differentially expressed circular RNAs.\\n\\nResultsA total of 58 and 87 circular RNAs were found to be differentially expressed by find_circ and DCC algorithms, respectively, among which 26 circular RNAs were common. Hsa_circ_0001946 (CDR1-as) was found to be upregulated in early stage breast cancer along with other novel circular RNAs (hsa_circ_0008225, hsa_circ_0007766, hsa_circ_0016601). We also found that a few of the identified circular RNAs harbor microRNA binding sites which can lead to microRNA sponging activity and pre-microRNA sequences which can generate mature microRNAs. The identified circular RNAs that are differentially regulated in early stage breast cancer can be of potential diagnostic/prognostic importance.\\n\\nConclusionCircular RNA are differentially expressed in the early-stage breast cancer with potential application in early diagnosis and prognosis. The differentially expressed circular RNA can sequester microRNA and can act as microRNA precursor as well.",

    "abstract": "Viral control of mitochondrial quality and content has emerged as an important mechanism for counteracting the host response to virus infection. Despite the knowledge of this crucial function of some viruses, little is known about how herpesviruses regulate mitochondrial homeostasis during infection. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is an oncogenic virus causally related to AIDS-associated malignancies. Here, we found that HHV-8-encoded viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF-1) promotes mitochondrial clearance by activating mitophagy to support virus replication. Genetic interference with vIRF-1 expression or targeting to the mitochondria inhibits HHV-8 replication-induced mitophagy and leads to an accumulation of mitochondria. Moreover, vIRF-1 binds directly to a mitophagy receptor, NIX, on the mitochondria and activates NIX-mediated mitophagy to promote mitochondrial clearance. Genetic and pharmacological interruption of vIRF-1/NIX-activated mitophagy inhibits HHV-8 productive replication. In short, our findings uncover an essential role of vIRF-1 in mitophagy activation for successful lytic replication of HHV-8.",

    "abstract": "Animal development requires coordination among cyclic processes, sequential cell fate specifications, and once-a-lifetime morphogenic events, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. C. elegans undergo four molts at regular 8-10 h intervals. The pace of the cycle is governed by PERIOD/lin-42 and other as-yet unknown factors. Cessation of the cycle in young adults is controlled by the let-7 family of microRNAs and downstream transcription factors in the heterochronic pathway. Here, we characterize a negative feedback loop between NHR-23, the worm homolog of mammalian retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs), and the let-7 family of microRNAs that regulates both the frequency and finite number of molts. The molting cycle is decelerated in nhr-23 knockdowns, accelerated in let-7(-) mutants, and similar to wild type animals in let-7(-) nhr-23(-) double mutants. NHR-23 binds response elements (ROREs) in the let-7 promoter and activates transcription. In turn, let-7 dampens nhr-23 expression across development via a complementary let-7 binding site (LCS) in the nhr-23 3' UTR. The molecular interactions between NHR-23 and let-7 hold true for other let-7 family microRNAs. Either derepression of nhr-23 transcripts by LCS deletion or high gene dosage of nhr-23 leads to protracted behavioral quiescence and extra molts in adults. NHR-23 and let-7 also co-regulate scores of genes required for execution of the molts, including lin-42. In addition, ROREs and LCSs isolated from mammalian ROR and let-7 genes function in C. elegans, suggesting conservation of this feedback mechanism. We propose that this feedback loop unites the molting timer and the heterochronic gene regulatory network possibly by functioning as a cycle counter.",

    "abstract": "Low serum Se is independently associated with anemia in elderly population, dialysis patients, sickle-cells patients, and hypothyroidism patients. Previous work from our laboratory showed that dietary Se deficiency in mice showed mild anemia indicating activation of stress-erythropoietic mechanisms. Unlike steady state erythropoiesis that is primarily responsible for homeostasis to produce new erythrocytes at a constant rate, stress erythropoiesis predominates when the bone marrow cannot generate sufficient erythrocytes. During such a process, short-term reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+Kit+Sca1+Linneg) migrate to the spleen leading to the proliferation and differentiation of stress-erythroid progenitors (SEPs). These cells lead to stress burst forming unit-erythroid cells (BFU-E) followed by terminal differentiation to erythrocytes. Recent studies demonstrate deficits in selenoproteins block the expansion and development of stress BFU-E with defects in terminal differentiation. Analysis of selenoprotein expression showed that selenoprotein W (SelenoW) was highly expressed in developing SEPs. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of SelenoW blocked the proliferation of immature SEPs in murine and human stress erythropoiesis cultures demonstrating a central role for SelenoW in stress erythropoiesis. Using the two-culture system to generate SEPs, selenoprotein N (SelenoN) expression increased as the progenitors transition from self-renewing \\\"stem cell like\\\" progenitors to form committed erythroid progenitors. SelenoN-/- mice showed significantly slower erythroid recovery following phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced acute hemolytic anemia. As in the muscle satellite cells where SelenoN regulates cellular Ca2+ signaling, SelenoN may also regulate Ca2+ signaling in SEPs to modulate pathways of differentiation. In summary, these data suggest that multiple selenoproteins, including SelenoN and SelenoW, coordinately regulate stress erythropoiesis.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of transposable elements is tightly regulated to prevent damage to the genome. The family of KRAB domain-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) and KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1/TRIM28) play a key role in regulating retrotransposons. KRAB-ZFPs recognize specific retrotransposon sequences and recruit KAP1, which controls the assembly of an epigenetic silencing complex including histone H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1. The chromatin remodeling activities of this complex repress transcription of the targeted transposable element and any adjacent genes. Here, we use biophysical and structural approaches to show that the tripartite motif (TRIM) of KAP1 forms antiparallel dimers, which further assemble into tetramers and higher-order oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner. Structure-based mutations in the B-box 1 domain prevented higher-order oligomerization without a significant loss of retrotransposon silencing activity in a cell-based assay, indicating that, in contrast to other TRIM family members, self-assembly is not essential for the function of KAP1. The crystal structure of the KAP1 RBCC dimer identifies the KRAB domain binding site, in the coiled-coil domain near the dyad. Mutations at this site abolished KRAB binding and transcriptional silencing activity of KAP1. This work identifies the interaction interfaces in the KAP1 RBCC motif responsible for self-association and KRAB binding and establishes their role in retrotransposon silencing.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri causes citrus canker disease worldwide in most commercial varieties of citrus. Its transmission occurs mainly through wind-driven rain. Once on the leaf X. citri can epiphytically survive forming biofilm, which enhances persistence of the bacteria to different environmental stresses and play an important role in the early stages of host infection. Therefore, the study of genes involved in biofilm formation has been an important step towards the understanding of the bacterial strategy to survive and infect the plant host. In this work we show that ecnAB a Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) system, previously identified only in human bacterial pathogen, is conserved in many Xanthomonas spp. In general TA systems consist of a pair of genes in operon that encodes a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin that, under normal conditions, binds to the toxin and blocks its activity. On the other hand, under stress the antitoxin is degraded, allowing the toxin to act decreasing cell growth and metabolism. When normal growth conditions are re-established, the antitoxin is produced, blocking the toxin and allowing the cells to grow. Thus, this mechanism represents an important bacterial strategy of survival under stress conditions. In this work, we show that in X. citri ecnAB is regulated by quorum sensing and it is involved in important processes such as biofilm formation, EPS production, and motility. In addition, we show that ecnAB plays a role in X. citri survival and virulence in plant host.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEVery little is known about TA systems in phytopathogenic bacteria. The ecnAB in special has been only studied in bacterial human pathogens. Here we showed that it is present in a wide range of the phytopathogen Xanthomonas spp., and moreover this is the first work that investigated the functional role of this TA system in Xanthomonas citri biology suggesting an important new role in adaptation and survival with implications in the bacterial pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules ([~]22 nucleotide long) involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies led to the discovery of isomiRs, which are miRNA sequence variants. While many miRNA-seq analysis tools exist, a lack of consensus on miRNA/isomiR analyses exists, and the resulting diversity of output formats hinders accurate comparisons between tools and precludes data sharing and the development of common downstream analysis methods.\\n\\nFindingsTo overcome this situation, we present here a community-based project, miRTOP (miRNA Transcriptomic Open Project) working towards the optimization of miRNA analyses. The aim of miRTOP is to promote the development of downstream analysis tools that are compatible with any existing detection and quantification tool. Based on the existing GFF3 format, we first created a new standard format, mirGFF3, for the output of miRNA/isomiR detection and quantification results from small RNA-seq data. Additionally, we developed a command line Python tool,  mirtop, to manage the mirGFF3 format. Currently, mirtop can convert into mirGFF3 the outputs of commonly used pipelines, such as seqbuster, miRge2.0, isomiR-SEA, sRNAbench, and Prost!, as well as BAM files. Its open architecture enables any tool or pipeline to output results in mirGFF3.\\n\\nConclusionsCollectively a comprehensive isomiR categorization system, along with the accompanying mirGFF3 and mirtop API provide a complete solution for the standardization of miRNA and isomiR analysis, enabling data sharing, reporting, comparative analyses, and benchmarking, while promoting the development of common miRNA methods focusing on downstream steps to miRNA detection, annotation, and quantification.",

    "abstract": "Various organizations have endeavored to develop assessment methods for the identification and management of weaknesses in hospital disaster preparedness. Although the largest number of patients receive their regular care at the primary level, there is no internationally validated tool for the rapid safety assessment of primary health care centers (PHC). Flooding accounts for almost 50% of all disasters related to weather, and climate models consider these events as highly probable in the future. In May 2014, heavy rain caused floods affecting around 1.6 million people in Serbia, leaving the municipality of Obrenovac most severely impacted. This paper aims at assessing the safety of PHC Obrenovac using the Hospital Safety Index (HSI), evaluating the usefulness of HSI for safety assessment of PHCs, and drawing lessons from the 2014 floods. PHC Obrenovac had an overall safety index of 0.82, with structural, nonstructural safety, and disaster management indices of 0.95, 0.74, and 0.75, respectively, implying it is likely to function in disasters. A detailed analysis of individual HSI items underlined the necessary improvements in the field of emergency power and water supply, telecommunication, and emergency medical supplies, which rendered the PHC nonfunctional during the 2014 floods. Most items were considered of same relevance for primary healthcare centers as for hospitals, excluding some items in the medical equipment, patient care, and support services. Fine-tuning the HSI to primary healthcare settings, officially translating it into different languages, facilitating scoring and analysis could result in a valid safety evaluation tool of primary healthcare facilities.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe Hospital Safety Index can be modified and used for primary health care centers\\nC_LIO_LIThe evaluated primary health care Centre is likely to function in disasters\\nC_LIO_LIHSI identified flaws which would disable the PHCs functioning in case of floods\\nC_LIO_LIMost improvements are necessary in the emergency power and water supply categories\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Injuries in the National Football League (NFL) are a concern for reasons of performance, revenue, and player health. In particular, recent discoveries highlighting the long-term repercussions of concussions has drawn popular attention to the violence of the sport of American football and shone a bright light on the NFLs efforts to reduce injuries and their long-term impact. While studies have largely focused on the impact of injuries on players long-term health, there has been less independent work on the evolution of injuries, namely in how the number and extent of injuries have changed over the years and what role, if any, the NFL has played in improving these figures by changing the rules or by improving protective gear technology. Here, we studied injuries from eight seasons 2010-2017, i.e. and address the impact of major rule changes that were enacted in the NFL in 2013 and 2016. We classified injuries into three major categories: arm, leg, and head, i.e. concussions. From publicly available weekly injury reports provided by each team in the NFL, we calculated the number of players who were seriously injured enough to miss at least one game of the season, and the severity of the injuries sustained, as evaluated by the number of games of the season the injured player had to sit out. The 2013 rule changes did not significantly reduce the number of players who suffered a head injury and had to sit out at least one game, and had no impact on leg or arm injuries either. Following the 2016 rule changes, we observed no change in the number of players who got injured but a significant increase in the severity of all three injury types in the two full seasons that followed. Overall, the NFLs efforts to reduce injuries and their severity have had little success, and our findings suggest instead that rule changes or technological changes cannot curb the violence and danger present in the game today.",

    "abstract": "AimSeptiCyte LAB measures the expression of four host-response RNAs in blood to distinguish sepsis from sterile inflammation. Sequential monitoring of this assay may have diagnostic utility in patients at high risk for postoperative infectious complications.\\n\\nMethodsIn this pilot study we studied esophagectomy patients who had developed a complication within 30 days following surgery as well as a random sample of 100 uncomplicated postoperative patients. PAXgene blood samples were collected postoperatively and whenever a complication occurred. SeptiCyte scores (ranging 0-10 with increasing likelihood of infection) were compared to post-hoc physician adjudication of infection likelihood using strict definitions.\\n\\nResultsAmong 370 esophagectomy patients, 120 (32%) subjects developed a complication requiring ICU (re)admission, 63 (53%) of whom could be analyzed. Immediate postoperative SeptiCyte LAB scores were highly variable, yet similar for patients having a complicated and uncomplicated postoperative course (median score of 2.4 (IQR 1.6-3.3) versus 2.2 (IQR 1.3-3), respectively). Scores increased as complications developed, but this rise was higher for 34 subjects having confirmed infection (median difference 4.7 (IQR 4.1-5.8)) then for 12 subjects with a non-infectious complication (2.1 (IQR 0.4-3.6); p<0.0001). When 17 cases with undetermined infectious status were excluded, addition of SeptiCyte LAB to CRP resulted in improved diagnostic discrimination (AUC 0.88 (95%CI 0.77-0.99)) compared to CRP alone (AUC 0.76 (95%CI 0.61-0.91); p=0.04).\\n\\nConclusionsSequential measurement of SeptiCyte LAB may have clinical utility in surgical patients at high risk of postoperative infection, but its diagnostic performance in this setting needs to be further evaluated.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRelapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is the main cause of vivax malaria in many parts of Asia. However at the individual patient level, recurrence of a blood stage infection following treatment within the endemic area can be either a relapse (from dormant liver-stage parasites), a recrudescence (blood-stage treatment failure), or a reinfection (following a new mosquito inoculation). Each requires a different prevention strategy, but previously they could not be distinguished reliably. Time-of-event and genetic data provide complimentary information about the cause of P. vivax recurrence, but the optimum approach to genotyping and analysis remains uncertain.\\n\\nMethodsIndividual-level data from two large drug trials in acute vivax malaria patients (Vivax History: VHX; Best Primaquine Dose: BPD) conducted on the Thailand-Myanmar border with follow-up of one year were pooled (n=1299). A total of 710 isolates from both acute and recurrent P. vivax episodes were genotyped using 3-9 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. These pooled data were analyzed using a novel population statistical model incorporating an assessment of genetic relatedness, treatment drug administered, and the time-to-recurrence.\\n\\nResults99% of genotyped recurrences in individuals who did not receive primaquine (n=365) were estimated to be relapses. In comparison, 14% of genotyped recurrences (n=121) were estimated to be relapses following high-dose supervised primaquine. By comparing episodes across individuals (90194 comparisons), the false-positive rate of relapse identification using genetic data alone was estimated to be 2.2%. We estimated the true failure rate after high-dose primaquine (7mg/kg total dose) to be 2.6% in this epidemiological context, substantially lower the reinfection unadjusted estimate of 12%. Simulation studies show that 9 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers suffice to discriminate between recurrence states. Drug exposures reflected by plasma carboxy-primaquine concentrations were not predictive of treatment failure, but did identify non-adherence.\\n\\nConclusionUsing this novel statistical model, relapse of P. vivax malaria could be distinguished reliably from reinfection. This showed that in this population supervised high-dose primaquine could avert up to 99% of relapses. In low transmission settings, microsatellite genotyping combined with time-to-event data can accurately discriminate between the different causes of recurrent P. vivax malaria.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOne hundred years ago, Plasmodium vivax, the most globally diverse cause of human malaria, was present across most of the old-world, throughout tropical and temperate climes. Its main evolutionary advantage over Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for the most deadly type of human malaria, is its ability to stay dormant in the liver, emerging weeks to years later causing recurring illness and continuing transmission. The dormant liver-stage parasites are called hypnozoites. A recurrent infection can either be hypnozoite-derived (a relapse), a blood-stage treatment failure (recrudescence), or from a new mosquito bite (a reinfection). At a population level, each requires a different preventative strategy but no widely applicable methodology existed to discriminate between the three possible states: relapse, recrudescence and reinfection. Parasite genetic data alone cannot resolve the different possibilities. We developed a novel probabilistic framework which uses both epidemiological and genetic data to determine the most likely cause of vivax recurrence at the individual level. We applied this method to the largest available pooled clinical trial data from Southeast Asia incorporating information from highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, drug treatments received and time-to-recurrent illness. This analysis provides a tool for estimating probabilities of relapse, recrudescence and reinfection and, importantly, shows that hypnozoiticidal high-dose primaquine radical cure is much more effective than previously thought.",
