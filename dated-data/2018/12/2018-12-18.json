    "abstract": "Nowadays, it has become almost a necessity for many biologists to execute bioinformatics workflows (WFs) as part of their research. However, most WF-management software packages require for their operation at least some programming expertise. Here we describe NeatSeq-Flow, a platform that enables users with no programming knowledge to design and execute complex high throughput sequencing WFs. This is achieved by using a compendium of pre-built modules as well as a generic module, both do not require programming expertise. Nonetheless, NeatSeq-Flow retains the flexibility to generate sophisticated WF modules using templates and only basic Python programming abilities. NeatSeq-Flow is designed to enable easy sharing of WFs and modules by conceptually separating modules, WF design, sample information and execution. Moreover, NeatSeq-Flow works hand in hand with CONDA environments for easy installation of the WFs analysis programs in one go. NeatSeq-Flow enables efficient WF execution on computer clusters by parallelizing on both samples and WF steps. NeatSeq-Flow operates by shell-script generation; thus it allows full transparency of the WF process. NeatSeq-Flow offers real-time WF execution monitoring, detailed documentation and self-sustaining WF backups for reproducibility. All of these features make NeatSeq-Flow an easy-to-use WF platform while not compromising for flexibility, reproducibility, transparency and efficiency.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://neatseq-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nContactsklarz@bgu.ac.il",

    "abstract": "Evolved resistance to one antibiotic may be associated with \\\"collateral\\\" sensitivity to other drugs. Here we provide an extensive quantitative characterization of collateral effects in Enterococcus faecalis, a gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. By combining parallel experimental evolution with high-throughput dose-response measurements, we measure phenotypic profiles of collateral sensitivity and resistance for a total of 900 mutant-drug combinations. We find that collateral effects are pervasive but difficult to predict, as independent populations selected by the same drug can exhibit qualitatively different profiles of collateral sensitivity as well as markedly different fitness costs. Using whole-genome sequencing of evolved populations, we identified mutations in a number of known resistance determinants, including mutations in several genes previously linked with collateral sensitivity in other species. While phenotypic drug sensitivity profiles show significant diversity, they cluster into statistically similar groups characterized by selecting drugs with similar mechanisms. To exploit the statistical structure in these resistance profiles, we develop a simple mathematical model based on a stochastic control process and use it to design optimal drug policies that assign a unique drug to every possible resistance profile. Stochastic simulations reveal that these optimal drug policies outperform intuitive cycling protocols by maintaining long-term sensitivity at the expense of short-term periods of high resistance. The approach reveals a new conceptual strategy for mitigating resistance by balancing short-term inhibition of pathogen growth with infrequent use of drugs intended to steer pathogen populations to a more vulnerable future state. Experiments in laboratory populations confirm that model-inspired sequences of four drugs reduce growth and slow adaptation relative to naive protocols involving the drugs alone, in pairwise cycles, or in four-drug uniform cycles.",

    "abstract": "Certain retroviruses, including HIV, insert their DNA in a non-random fraction of the host genome via poorly understood selection mechanisms. Here, we develop a biophysical model for retroviral integrations as stochastic and quasi-equilibrium topological reconnections between polymers. We discover that physical effects, such as DNA accessibility and elasticity, play important and universal roles in this process. Our simulations predict that integration is favoured within nucleosomal and flexible DNA, in line with experiments, and that these biases arise due to competing energy barriers associated with DNA deformations. By considering a long chromosomal region in human T-cells during interphase, we discover that at these larger scales integration sites are predominantly determined by chromatin accessibility. Finally, we propose and solve a reaction-diffusion problem that recapitulates the distribution of HIV hot-spots within T-cells. With few generic assumptions, our model can rationalise experimental observations and identifies previously unappreciated physical contributions to retroviral integration site selection.",

By directly comparing experimental observations with a mean field model of an adapting, recurrent neuronal population, we find that the neocortical alternations reflect a dynamical regime in which a stable active state is interrupted by transient inactive states (slow waves) while the hippocampal alternations reflect a stable inactive state interrupted by transient active states (sharp waves). We propose that during NREM sleep, hippocampal and neocortical populations are excitable: each in a stable state from which internal fluctuations or external perturbation can evoke the stereotyped population events that mediate NREM functions.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged increases in excitation can trigger cell-wide homeostatic responses in neurons, altering membrane channels, promoting morphological changes and ultimately reducing synaptic weights. However, how synaptic downscaling interacts with classical forms of Hebbian plasticity is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether chronic optogenetic stimulation of hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in freely-moving mice could (a) cause morphological changes reminiscent of homeostatic scaling, (b) modulate synaptic currents that might compensate for chronic excitation, and (c) lead to alterations in Hebbian plasticity. After 24 h of stimulation with 15-ms blue light pulses every 90 s, dendritic spine density and area were reduced in the CA1 region of mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) when compared to controls. This protocol also reduced the amplitude of mEPSCs for both the AMPA and NMDA components in ex vivo slices obtained from ChR2-expressing mice immediately after the end of stimulation. Lastly, chronic stimulation impaired the induction of LTP and facilitated that of LTD in these slices. Our results indicate that neuronal responses to prolonged network excitation can modulate subsequent Hebbian plasticity in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Swarming colonies of the light responsive bacteria Serratia marcescens grown on agar exhibit robust fluctuating large-scale collective flows that include arrayed vortices, jets, and sinuous streamers. We study the immobilization and quenching of these large-scale flows when the moving swarm is exposed to light with a substantial ultra-violet component. We map the response to light in terms of two independent parameters - the light intensity and duration of exposure and identify the conditions under which mobility is affected significantly. For small exposure times and/or low intensities, we find collective mobility to be negligibly affected. Increasing exposure times and/or intensity to higher values temporarily suppresses collective mobility. Terminating exposure allows bacteria regain motility and eventually reestablish large scale flows. For long exposure times or at high intensities, exposed bacteria become paralyzed, with macroscopic speeds eventually reducing to zero. In this process, they form highly aligned, jammed domains. Individual domains eventually coalesce into a large macroscopic domain with mean radial extent growing as the square root of exposure time. Post exposure, active bacteria dislodge exposed bacteria from these jammed configurations; initial dissolution rates are found to be strongly dependent on duration of exposure suggesting that caging effects are substantial at higher exposure times. Based on our experimental observations, we propose a minimal Brownian dynamics model to examine the escape of exposed bacteria from the region of exposure. Our results complement studies on planktonic bacteria and inform models for pattern formation in gradated illumination.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions are often influenced by contextual factors. For instance, when engaged in a visual discrimination task against a reference boundary, subjective reports about the judged stimulus feature are biased away from the boundary - a phenomenon termed reference repulsion. Until recently, this phenomenon has been thought to reflect a perceptual illusion regarding the appearance of the stimulus, but new evidence suggests that it may rather reflect a post-perceptual decision bias. To shed light on this issue, we examined whether and how orientation judgments affect perceptual appearance. In a first experiment, we confirmed that after judging a grating stimulus against a discrimination boundary, the subsequent reproduction response was indeed repelled from the boundary. To investigate the perceptual nature of this bias, in a second experiment we measured the perceived orientation of the grating stimulus more directly, in comparison to a reference stimulus visible at the same time. Although we did observe a small repulsive bias away from the boundary, this bias was explained by random trial-by-trial fluctuations in sensory representations together with classical stimulus adaptation effects and did not reflect a systematic bias due to the discrimination judgment. Overall, the current study indicates that discrimination judgments do not elicit a perceptual illusion and points towards a post-perceptual locus of reference repulsion.",

While C. albicans is the predominant species isolated in the human mycobiome and implicated in fungal infection, infections due to non-albicans Candida species are rapidly rising. Studying the factors that contribute to virulence is often challenging and frequently depends on many contexts including host immune status and pathogen genetic background. Here, we utilize the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a perspicuous and efficient model host system to study fungal infections of Candida pathogens. We find that in addition to reducing lifetime host survival, exposure to C. albicans results in delayed reproduction, which significantly reduced lineage growth over multiple generations. Furthermore, we assessed fungal pathogen virulence in C. elegans hosts compromised for innate immune function and detected increased early mortality, reduced brood sizes and delayed reproduction relative to infected healthy hosts. Importantly, by assessing virulence in both healthy and immunocompromised host backgrounds we reveal the pathogen potential in non-albicans Candida species. Taken together, we present a novel lineage growth assay to measure reduction in host fitness associated with fungal infection and demonstrate significant interactions between pathogen and host immune function that contribute to virulence.",

Transcriptomics and metabolomics studies of entomopathogens with post-mortem dissemination from their parasitized hosts have unraveled infection processes and host responses, yet mechanisms underlying active spore transmission by Entomophthoralean fungi in living insects remain elusive. Here we report the discovery, through metabolomics, of the plant-associated amphetamine, cathinone, in four Massospora cicadina-infected periodical cicada populations, and the mushroom-associated tryptamine, psilocybin, in annual cicadas infected with Massospora platypediae or Massospora levispora, which appear to represent a single fungal species. The absence of some fungal enzymes necessary for cathinone and psilocybin biosynthesis along with the inability to detect intermediate metabolites or gene orthologs are consistent with possibly novel biosynthesis pathways in Massospora. The neurogenic activities of these compounds suggest the extended phenotype of Massospora that modifies cicada behavior to maximize dissemination is chemically-induced.",

Thereby, our new algorithm allows for accurate read mapping results for intermediate cycles and supports large reference genomes such as the complete human reference. This enables the combination of real-time read mapping results with complex follow-up analysis. In this study, we showed the accuracy and scalability of our approach by applying real-time read mapping and variant calling to seven publicly available human whole exome sequencing datasets. Thereby, up to 89% of all detected SNPs were already identified after 40 sequencing cycles while showing similar precision as at the end of sequencing. Final results showed similar accuracy to those of conventional post-hoc analysis methods. When compared to standard routines, our live approach enables considerably faster interventions in clinical applications and infectious disease outbreaks. Besides variant calling, our approach can be adapted for a plethora of other mapping-based analyses.",

Age and sex were potential modifiers. We conducted subgroup analyses of those not reporting certain chronic diseases or smoking.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 732 cases and 2195 controls. Age, but not sex, modified the association between BMI and self-rated health. Participants reporting poor health at age 60 had a 1.5 kg/m2 (95%CI: 0.8 to 2.1) higher BMI at the time of reporting than controls, and their BMI had previously increased sharply. After age 75, cases no longer had higher BMI than controls, and their BMI had decreased sharply prior to reporting poor health. Age was also an effect modifier among those without diabetes, however BMI trajectories were more similar among the middle-aged.\\n\\nConclusionDevelopment of BMI was associated with poor self-rated health; however, the nature of the association depended markedly on age.\\n\\nO_TEXTBOXWhat is already known on this subjectO_LIStudies based on a single body mass index measurement have consistently found that being underweight or obese was associated with poor self-rated health.\\nC_LIO_LIHow body mass index developed in the lead up to poor self-rated health was unknown.\\nC_LI\\n\\nC_TEXTBOX\\n\\nO_TEXTBOXWhat this study addsO_LIIn the present study, body mass index trajectories leading up to poor self-rated health were strongly dependent on age at first report of poor health.

    "abstract": "Surface layers (S-layers) are protective protein coats which form around all archaea and most bacterial cells. Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacterium with an S-layer covering its peptidoglycan cell wall. The S-layer in C. difficile is constructed mainly of S-layer protein A (SlpA), which is a key virulence factor and an absolute requirement for disease. S-layer biogenesis is a complex multi-step process, disruption of which has severe consequences for the bacterium. We examined the subcellular localization of SlpA secretion and S-layer growth; observing formation of S-layer at specific sites that coincide with cell wall synthesis, while the secretion of SlpA from the cell is relatively delocalized. We conclude that this delocalized secretion of SlpA leads to a pool of precursor in the cell wall which is available to repair openings in the S-layer formed during cell growth or following damage.",

The prodigious egg output of these parasites is the sole driver of pathology due to infection, yet our understanding of their sexual reproduction is limited because egg production is not sustained for more than a few days in vitro. Here, we describe culture conditions that support schistosome sexual development and sustained egg production in vitro. Female schistosomes rely on continuous pairing with male worms to fuel the maturation of their reproductive organs. Exploiting these new culture conditions, we explore the process of male-stimulated female maturation and demonstrate that physical contact with a male worm, and not insemination, is sufficient to induce female development and the production of viable parthenogenetic haploid embryos. We further report the characterization of a novel nuclear receptor, that we call vitellogenic factor 1, that is essential for female sexual development following pairing with a male worm. Taken together, these results provide a platform to study the fascinating sexual biology of these parasites on a molecular level, illuminating new strategies to control schistosome egg production.",

    "abstract": "The Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) is a Java Library developed for use in mathematical oncology modeling. It is made of simple, efficient, generic components that can be used to model complex spatial systems. HALs components can broadly be classified into: on- and off-lattice agent containers, finite difference diffusion fields, a GUI building system, and additional tools and utilities for computation and data collection. These components are designed to operate independently and are standardized to make them easy to interface with one another. As a demonstration of how modeling can be simplified using our approach, we have included a complete example of a hybrid model (a spatial model with interacting agent-based and PDE components). HAL is a useful asset for researchers who wish to build efficient 1D, 2D and 3D hybrid models in Java, while not starting entirely from scratch. It is available on github at https://github.com/torococo/HAL under the MIT License. HAL requires at least Java 8 or later to run, and the Java JDK version 1.8 or later to compile the source code.\\n\\n1 Author SummaryIn this paper we introduce the Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) with the purpose of simplifying the implementation and sharing of hybrid models for use in mathematical oncology. Hybrid modeling is used in oncology to create spatial models of tissue, typically by modeling cells using agent-based techniques, and by modeling diffusible chemicals using partial differential equations (PDEs). HALs key components are designed to run agent-based models, PDEs, and visualization. The components are standardized and are completely decoupled, so models can be built with any combination of them. We first explore the philosophy behind HAL, then summarize the components. Lastly we demonstrate how the components work together with an example of a hybrid model, and a walk-through of the code used to construct it. HAL is open-source and will produce identical results on any machine that supports Java 8 and above, making it highly portable. We recommend HAL to modelers interested in spatial dynamics, even those outside of mathematical oncology, as the components are general enough to facilitate a variety of model types.

    "abstract": "In Angiosperms, there exists a strong association between mating system and lifespan. Most self-fertilising species are short-lived and most predominant or obligate outcrossers are long-lived. This association is generally explained by the influence of lifespan on the evolution of the mating system, considering lifespan as fixed. Yet, lifespan can itself evolve, and the mating system may as well influence the evolution of lifespan, as is suggested by joint evolutionary shifts of lifespan and mating system between sister species. In this paper, we build modifier models to study the joint evolution of self-fertilisation and lifespan, including both juvenile and adult inbreeding depression. We show that self-fertilisation is expected to promote evolution towards shorter lifespan, and that the range of conditions under which selfing can evolve rapidly shrinks as lifespan increases. We study the effects of inbreeding depression affecting various steps in the life cycle, and discuss how extrinsic mortality conditions are expected to affect evolutionary associations. In particular, we show that selfers may sometimes remain short-lived even in a very stable habitat, as a strategy to avoid the deleterious effects of inbreeding.",

For example, \\\"sensation-seeking\\\" is predictive of the initial propensity to take drugs; whereas \\\"novelty-seeking\\\" predicts compulsive drug-seeking behavior. In addition, the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues can predict the propensity to approach drug cues, and reinstatement or relapse, even after relatively brief periods of drug exposure. The question addressed here is the extent to which these three  vulnerability factors are related; that is, predictive of one another. Some relationships have been reported in small samples, but here a large sample of 1,598 outbred male and female heterogeneous stock rats were screened for Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior (to obtain an index of incentive salience attribution;  sign-tracking), and subsequently tested for sensation-seeking and novelty-seeking. Despite the large N there were no significant correlations between these traits, in either males or females. There were, however, novel relationships between multiple measures of incentive salience attribution and, based on these findings, we generated a new metric that captures \\\"incentive value\\\". Furthermore, there were sex differences on measures of incentive salience attribution and sensation-seeking behavior that were not previously apparent.",

Hopanoid biosynthesis genes are conserved in nitrogen-fixing plant symbionts, and we previously found that the extended (C35) class of hopanoids in Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens are required for efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the tropical legume host Aeschynomene afraspera. Here we demonstrate that the nitrogen fixation defect conferred by extended loss can fully be explained by a reduction in root nodule sizes rather than per-bacteroid nitrogen fixation levels. Using a single-nodule tracking approach to track A. afraspera nodule development, we provide a quantitative model of root nodule development in this host, uncovering both the baseline growth parameters for wild-type nodules and a surprising heterogeneity of extended hopanoid mutant developmental phenotypes. These phenotypes include a delay in root nodule initiation and presence of a subpopulation of nodules with slow growth rates and low final volumes, which are correlated with reduced motility and surface attachment in vitro and lower bacteroid densities in planta, respectively. This work provides a quantitative reference point for understanding the phenotypic diversity of ineffective symbionts in A. afraspera and identifies specific developmental stages affected by extended hopanoid loss for future mechanistic work.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA relationship between asthma and the risk of having cancer has been identified in several studies. However, these studies have used different methodologies, been primarily cross-sectional in nature, and the results have been contradictory. Population-level analyses are required to determine if a relationship truly exists.\n\nMethodsWe developed a novel machine learning tool to infer associations, Causal Inference using the Composition of Transactions (CICT). Two all payers claim datasets of over two hundred million hospitalization encounters from the US-based Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) were used for discovery and validation. Associations between asthma and neoplasms were discovered in data from the State of Florida. Validation was conducted on eight cohorts of patients with asthma, and seven subtypes of asthma and COPD using datasets from the State of California. Control groups were matched by gender, age, race, and history of tobacco use. Odds ratio analysis with Bonferroni-Holm correction measured the association of asthma and COPD with 26 different benign and malignant neoplasms. ICD9CM codes were used to identify exposures and outcomes.\n\nFindingsCICT identified 17 associations between asthma and the risk of neoplasia in the discovery dataset. In the validation studies, 208 case-control analyses were conducted between subtypes of Asthma (N= 999,370, male= 33%, age= 50) and COPD (N=715,971, male = 50%, age=69) with the corresponding matched control groups (N=8,400,004, male= 42%, age= 47). Allergic asthma was associated with benign neoplasms of the meninges, salivary, pituitary, parathyroid, and thyroid glands (OR:1.52 to 2.52), and malignant neoplasms of the breast, intrahepatic biliary system, hematopoietic, and lymphatic system (OR: 1.45 to 2.05). COPD was associated with malignant neoplasms in the lung, bladder, and hematopoietic systems.\n\nInterpretationThe combined use of machine learning methods for knowledge discovery and epidemiological methods shows that allergic asthma is associated with the development of neoplasia, including in glandular organs, ductal tissues, and hematopoietic systems. Also, our findings differentiate the pattern of neoplasms between allergic asthma and obstructive asthma. This suggests that inflammatory pathways that are active in asthma also contribute to neoplastic transformation in specific organ systems such as secretory organs.\n\nFundingNone\n\nAt a Glance CommentaryOver the past three decades, studies have suggested that asthma could increase the risk of developing cancer, but a consensus has not been reached. The debate persists because the current evidence has been derived using cross-sectional statistical designs, limited datasets, and small cohorts and conflicting results. In addition, the mechanism by which allergic airway inflammation contributes to neoplastic transformation is postulated but not proven.\n\nHere, we present the largest study to date on this association in patients with asthma or COPD. A knowledge discovery method was used for hypothesis generation that, when combined with epidemiological reasoning tools, identified associations between airway disease and neoplasia. The results reveal novel relationships between allergic asthma and benign glandular tumors and confirm the well-known connections between COPD and lung cancer. Further, we identified a novel association between COPD and asthma with hematological malignancies. These findings rectify contradictory results from other studies and demonstrate more specifically that the types of neoplasms associated with asthma compared to COPD that infers mechanistic plausibility.",

    "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the standard for diagnosing psychiatric disorders in the United States. However, evidence has suggested that symptoms in psychiatric disorders are not restricted to the boundaries between DSM categories, implying an underlying latent transdiagnostic structure of psychopathology. Here, we applied an importance-guided machine learning technique for model selection to item-level data from self-reported instruments contained within the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics dataset. From 578 questionnaire items, we identified a set of features which consisted of 85 items that were shared across diagnoses of schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A classifier trained on the transdiagnostic features reliably distinguished the patient group as a whole from healthy controls (classification AUC = 0.95) and only 10 items were needed to attain the performance level of AUC being 0.90. A sum score created from the items produced high separability between patients and healthy controls (Cohens d = 2.85), and it outperformed predefined sum scores and sub-scores within the instruments (Cohens d ranging between 0.13 and 1.21). The transdiagnostic features comprised both symptom domains (e.g. dysregulated mood, attention deficit, and anhedonia) and personality traits (e.g. neuroticism, impulsivity, and extraversion). Moreover, by comparing the features that were common across the three patient groups with those that were most predictive of a single patient category, we can describe the unique features for each patient group superimposed on the transdiagnostic feature structure. Overall, our results reveal a latent transdiagnostic symptom/behavioral phenotypic structure shared across SCZ, BD, and ADHD and present a new perspective to understand insights offered by self-report psychiatric instruments.",

Users can then generate the NEURON network, run efficiently parallelized simulations, optimize and explore network parameters through automated batch runs, and use built-in functions for visualization and analysis - connectivity matrices, voltage traces, raster plots, local field potentials, and information theoretic measures. NetPyNE also facilitates model sharing by exporting and importing using NeuroML and SONATA standardized formats. NetPyNE is already being used to teach computational neuroscience students and by modelers to investigate different brain regions and phenomena.",

    "abstract": "To evade the immune system, the lethal human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes produces SpyCEP, an enzyme that cleaves the C-terminal -helix of CXCL8, resulting in markedly impaired recruitment of neutrophils to sites of invasive infection. The basis for chemokine inactivation by SpyCEP is, however, poorly understood, as the core domain of CXCL8 known to interact with CXCL8 receptors is unaffected by enzymatic cleavage.\\n\\nWe examined the in vitro migration of human neutrophils and observed that their ability to efficiently navigate a CXCL8 gradient was compromised following CXCL8 cleavage by SpyCEP. SpyCEP-mediated cleavage of CXCL8 also impaired CXCL8-induced migration of transfectants expressing the human chemokine receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2. Despite possessing an intact N-terminus and preserved disulphide bonds, SpyCEP-cleaved CXCL8 had impaired binding to both CXCR1 and CXCR2, pointing to a requirement for the C terminal -helix. SpyCEP-cleaved CXCL8 had similarly impaired binding to the glycosaminoglycan heparin. Enzymatic removal of neutrophil glycosaminoglycans was observed to ablate neutrophil navigation of a CXCL8 gradient, whilst navigation of an fMLP gradient remained largely intact.\\n\\nWe conclude therefore, that SpyCEP cleavage of CXCL8 results in chemokine inactivation due to a requirement for glycosaminoglycan binding in productive chemokine:receptor interactions. This may inform strategies to inhibit the activity of SpyCEP, but may also influence future approaches to inhibit unwanted chemokine-induced inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Direct coupling analysis (DCA) for protein folding has made very good progress, but it is not effective for proteins that lack many sequence homologs, even coupled with time-consuming folding simulation. We show that we can accurately predict the distance matrix of a protein by deep learning, even for proteins with [~]60 sequence homologs. Using only the geometric constraints given by the resulting distance matrix we may construct 3D models without involving any folding simulation. Our method successfully folded 21 of the 37 CASP12 hard targets with a median family size of 58 effective sequence homologs within 4 hours on a Linux computer of 20 CPUs. In contrast, DCA cannot fold any of these hard targets in the absence of folding simulation, and the best CASP12 group folded only 11 of them by integrating DCA-predicted contacts into complex, fragment-based folding simulation. Rigorous experimental validation in CASP13 shows that our distance-based folding server successfully folded 17 of 32 hard targets (with a median family size of 36 sequence homologs) and obtained 70% precision on top L/5 long-range predicted contacts. Latest experimental validation in CAMEO shows that our server predicted correct fold for two membrane proteins of new fold while all the other servers failed. These results imply that it is now feasible to predict correct fold for proteins lack of similar structures in PDB on a personal computer without folding simulation.\\n\\nSignificanceAccurate description of protein structure and function is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics. Although greatly improved, experimental protein structure determination is still low-throughput and costly, especially for membrane proteins. As such, computational structure prediction is often resorted. Predicting the structure of a protein with a new fold (i.e., without similar structures in PDB) is very challenging and usually needs a large amount of computing power. This paper shows that by using a powerful deep learning technique, even with only a personal computer we can predict new folds much more accurately than ever before. This method also works well on membrane protein folding.",

    "abstract": "The degree of hepatic lipid accumulation in obesity correlates with the severity of hyperinsulinemia and systemic insulin resistance. Here, we propose a mechanism that explains this associative link, whereby, hepatic steatosis dysregulates glucose and insulin homeostasis. Obesity-induced hepatocellular lipid accumulation results in hepatocyte depolarization. We have established that hepatocyte depolarization depresses hepatic afferent vagal nerve firing, increases GABA release from liver slices, and causes hyperinsulinemia. Preventing hepatic GABA release or eliminating the ability of the liver to communicate to the hepatic vagal nerve ameliorates the hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance associated with diet-induced obesity. In people with obesity hepatic expression of GABA transporters is associated with glucose infusion and disposal rates during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in hepatic GABA re-uptake transporters are associated with an increased incidence of type II diabetes mellitus. Herein, we identify GABA as a novel hepatokine that is dysregulated in obesity and whose release can be manipulated to mute or exacerbate the glucoregulatory dysfunction common to obesity.",

    "abstract": "Ecological communities are jointly structured by dispersal, density-independent responses to environmental conditions and density-dependent biotic interactions. Metacommunity ecology provides a framework for understanding how these processes combine to determine community composition among local sites that are regionally connected through dispersal. In 17 temperate seagrass meadows along the British Columbia coast, we tested the hypothesis that eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) epifaunal invertebrate assemblages are influenced by local environmental conditions, but that high dispersal rates at larger spatial scales dampen effects of environmental differences. We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundances patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution. Our results add to mounting evidence that suggests that the biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by seagrass meadows reflect ecological processes occurring both within meadows and across seascapes, and suggest that management of eelgrass habitat for biodiversity may be most effective when both local and regional processes are considered.",

    "abstract": "High quality reference genomes are an important resource in genomic research projects. A consequence is that DNA fragments carrying the reference allele will be more likely to map suc-cessfully, or receive higher quality scores. This reference bias can have effects on downstream population genomic analysis when heterozygous sites are falsely considered homozygous for the reference allele.\\n\\nIn palaeogenomic studies of human populations, mapping against the human reference genome is used to identify endogenous human sequences. Ancient DNA studies usually operate with low sequencing coverages and fragmentation of DNA molecules causes a large proportion of the sequenced fragments to be shorter than 50 bp - reducing the amount of accepted mismatches, and increasing the probability of multiple matching sites in the genome. These ancient DNA specific properties are potentially exacerbating the impact of reference bias on downstream analyses, especially since most studies of ancient human populations use pseudohaploid data, i.e. they randomly sample only one sequencing read per site.\\n\\nWe show that reference bias is pervasive in published ancient DNA sequence data of pre-historic humans with some differences between individual genomic regions. We illustrate that the strength of reference bias is negatively correlated with fragment length. Reference bias can cause differences in the results of downstream analyses such as population affinities, heterozygosity estimates and estimates of archaic ancestry. These spurious results highlight how important it is to be aware of these technical artifacts and that we need strategies to mitigate the effect. Therefore, we suggest some post-mapping filtering strategies to resolve reference bias which help to reduce its impact substantially.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are increasing globally in number and extent despite efforts to restrict their spread. Knowledge of incursion pathways is necessary to prevent new invasions and to design effective biosecurity protocols at source and recipient locations. This study uses genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine the origin of 115 incursive Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito) detected at international ports in Australia and New Zealand. We also genotyped mosquitoes at three point mutations in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Vssc) gene: V1016G, F1534C, and S989P. These mutations confer knockdown resistance to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, widely used for controlling invertebrate pests. We first delineated reference populations using Ae. aegypti sampled from 15 locations in Asia, South America, Australia and the Pacific Islands. Incursives were assigned to these populations using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) and an assignment test with a support vector machine predictive model. Bali, Indonesia, was the most common origin of Ae. aegypti detected in Australia, while Ae. aegypti detected in New Zealand originated from Pacific Islands such as Fiji. Most incursives had the same allelic genotype across the three Vssc gene point mutations, which confers strong resistance to synthetic pyrethroids, the only insecticide class used in current, widely-implemented aircraft disinsection protocols endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Additionally, all internationally-assigned Ae. aegypti had Vssc point mutations linked to pyrethroid resistance that are not found in Australian populations. These findings demonstrate that protocols for preventing introductions of invertebrates must consider insecticide resistance, and highlights the usefulness of genomic datasets for managing global biosecurity objectives.",

Many herpesviruses use the IL-10 pathway to facilitate infection, but how endogenous IL-10 is regulated during primary infection in vivo remains poorly characterized. Here, we infected mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ({gamma}HV68) and analyzed the production, and genetic contribution, of IL-10 by mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight, CyTOF) analysis.{gamma} HV68 infection elicited a breadth of effector CD4 T cells in the lungs of acutely infected mice, including a highly activated effector subset that co-expressed IFN{gamma}, TNF, and IL-10. By using IL-10 green fluorescent protein (gfp) transcriptional reporter mice, we identified that IL-10 was primarily expressed within CD4 T cells during acute infection in the lungs. IL10gfp expressing CD4 T cells were highly proliferative and characterized by the expression of multiple co-inhibitory receptors including PD-1 and LAG-3. When we analyzed acute{gamma} HV68 infection of IL-10 deficient mice, we found that IL-10 limits the frequency of both myeloid and effector CD4 T cell subsets in the infected lung, with minimal changes at a distant mucosal site. These data emphasize the unique insights that high-dimensional analysis can afford in investigating antiviral immunity, and provide new insights into the breadth, phenotype and function of IL-10 expressing effector CD4 T cells during acute virus infection.\\n\\nThis work was funded by National Institutes of Health Grants R01 AI121300 and R01 CA168558 (to L.F.v.D.), an American Heart Association National Scientist Development grant (#13SDG14510023), the Crohns and Colitis Foundation of America (#311295), a pilot grant from the Lung, Head and Neck Cancer program within the University of Colorado Cancer Center, and a Career Enhancement Award from the University of Colorado Lung Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (P50CA58187) (all to E.T.C.).\\n\\nThe Lung, Head and Neck program within the University of Colorado Cancer Center, and the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource, are directly funded through support from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA046934.\\n\\nAbbreviations used in this article",

However, maintenance of zebrafish husbandry records is both time intensive and laborious, and a standardized way to manage and track the large amount of unique lines in a given laboratory or centralized facility has not been embraced by the field. Here we present FishNet, an intuitive, open source, relational database for managing data and information related to zebrafish husbandry and maintenance. By creating a \\\"virtual facility\\\", FishNET enables users to remotely inspect the rooms, racks, tanks and lines within a given facility. Importantly, FishNET scales from one laboratory, to an entire facility with several laboratories, to multiple facilities, generating a cohesive laboratory and community-based platform. Automated data entry eliminates confusion regarding line nomenclature and streamlines maintenance of individual lines, while flexible query forms allow researchers to retrieve database records based on user-defined criteria. FishNet also links associated embryonic and adult biological samples with data, such as genotyping results or confocal images, to enable robust and efficient colony management and storage of laboratory information. A shared calendar function with email notifications and automated reminders for line turnover, automated tank counts and census reports promote communication with both end-users and administrators. The expected benefits of FishNET are improved vivaria efficiency, increased quality control for experimental numbers, and flexible data reporting and retrieval. FishNets easy, intuitive record management and open source, end user-modifiable architecture provides an efficient solution to real-time zebrafish colony management for users throughout a facility and institution, and in some cases across entire research hubs.",

Although previous studies have shown that specific germline variants increase the risk of tumor formation, no previous study has screened many germline variants to identify variants predictive of survival in glioma patients. In this study, we present an approach to identify the small fraction of prognostic germline variants from the pool of over four million variants that we variant called in The Cancer Genome Atlas whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing datasets. We identified two germline variants that are predictive of poor patient outcomes by Cox regression, controlling for eleven covariates. rs61757955 is a germline variant found in the 3 UTR of GRB2 associated with increased KRAS signaling, CIC mutations, and 1p/19q co-deletion. rs34988193 is a germline variant found in the tumor suppressor gene ANKDD1a that causes an amino acid change from lysine to glutamate. This variant was found to be predictive of poor prognosis in two independent low grade glioma datasets and is predicted to be within the top 0.06% of deleterious mutations across the human genome. The wild type residue is conserved in all 22 other species with a homologous protein.\\n\\nImplicationsThis is the first study presenting an approach to screening many germline variants to identify variants predictive of survival and our application of this methodology revealed the germline variants rs61757955 and rs34988193 as being predictive of survival in low grade glioma patients.",

    "abstract": "Tight regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) is essential for biological processes. Fully-grown oocytes, having a large nucleus called the germinal vesicle, arrest at meiotic prophase-I. Upon hormonal stimulus, oocytes resume meiosis to acquire fertilizability. At this time, pHi increases through Na+/H+ exchanger activity. However, regulation and function of this change remains obscure. Here we show that in starfish oocytes, serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) is activated by the PI3K/TORC2/PDK1 signaling after hormonal stimulus, and is required for the pHi increase and cyclin B-Cdk1 activation. Furthermore, when we clamped pHi at 6.7, corresponding to the pHi of unstimulated ovarian oocytes, hormonal stimulus normally induced cyclin B-Cdk1 activation; thereafter, oocytes initiated germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), but failed to complete it. Thus, SGK-dependent pHi increase is likely prerequisite for completion of GVBD in ovarian oocytes. We propose a model that SGK drives meiotic resumption through concomitant regulation of pHi and the cell-cycle machinery.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to regenerate damaged tissues, such as the heart, various enormously amongst species. While heart regeneration is generally very low in mammals 1-3, it can regenerate efficiently in certain amphibian and fish species 4,5. Zebrafish has been used extensively to study heart regeneration, resulting in the identification of proliferating cardiomyocytes that drive this process 5-7. However, mechanisms that drive cardiomyocyte proliferation are largely unknown. Here, using a single-cell mRNA-sequencing approach, we find a transcriptionally distinct population of dedifferentiated and proliferating cardiomyocytes in regenerating zebrafish hearts. While adult cardiomyocytes are known to rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production, these proliferating cardiomyocytes show reduced mitochondrial gene expression and decreased OXPHOS activity. Strikingly, we find that genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes of the glycolysis pathway are induced in the proliferating cardiomyocytes, and inhibiting glycolysis impairs cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry. Mechanistically, glycolytic gene expression is induced by Nrg1/Erbb2 signaling, and this is conserved in a mouse model of enhanced regeneration. Moreover, inhibiting glycolysis in murine cardiomyocytes abrogates the mitogenic effects of Nrg1/ErbB2 signaling. Together these results reveal a conserved mechanism in which cardiomyocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming by activating glycolysis, which is essential for cell cycle reentry and heart regeneration. This could ultimately help develop therapeutic interventions that promote the regenerative capacity of the mammalian heart.",

    "abstract": "The dilemma between in vitro and in vivo drug screening results persisted to hinder preclinical anti-cancer drug development. In this study, drug screening was initially performed on monolayer cultures of HepG2 cells, whereas in vivo drug testing was performed on the subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of HepG2 cells in athymic nude mice. Results showed that Artesunate inhibited HepG2 cell growth in vitro, but was ineffective in vivo. Hence, we investigated the difference between in vitro and in vivo settings using this cell-drug combination as a model. Immuno-staining of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers showed that -fetoprotein (AFP) was unaffected by Artesunate treatment in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that AFP was neither a biomarker nor response indicator. Alternatively, high albumin was detected in both monolayer and organoid cultures; contrariwise, the xenograft tumors prevailed low albumin, in consistency to human HCC with poor prognosis. Artesunate treatment reduced intracellular albumin expression in vitro; Artesunate did not alter tissue and serum albumin in xenograft mice, in coincidence with its irresponsiveness in vivo. However, Artesunate binding to albumin was undetectable. Instead, we observed a transient stimulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation followed by DAPK1 dephosphorylation and apoptosis. Combined treatment of Artesunate with U0126 revoked Erk1/2-DAPK1 phosphorylation and exerted modest proliferative advantage at early time points, but eventually did not rescue HepG2 cells from death. U0126 induced multiploid formation independent of Artesunate, resulting in cell cycle arrest within 24 h post-treatment.\\n\\nSignificanceSystematic investigation of HCC biomarkers AFP and albumin among the in vitro models of monolayer and organoid cultures, and the in vivo models of subcutaneous and liver implantation xenograft mice was conducted.",

    "abstract": "To successfully integrate a neuron into a circuit, a myriad of developmental events must occur correctly and in the correct order. Neurons must be born and grow out towards a destination, responding to guidance cues to direct their path. Once arrived, each neuron must segregate to the correct sub-region before sorting through a milieu of incorrect partners to identify the correct partner with which they can connect. Finally, the neuron must make a synaptic connection with their correct partner; a connection that needs to be broadly maintained throughout the life of the animal while remaining responsive to modes of plasticity and pruning. Though many intricate molecular mechanisms have been discovered to regulate each step, recent work showed that a single family of proteins, the Teneurins, regulates a host of these developmental steps in Drosophila - an example of biological adaptive reuse. Teneurins first influence axon guidance during early development. Once neurons arrive in their target regions, Teneurins enable partner matching and synapse formation in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Despite these diverse processes and systems, the Teneurins use conserved mechanisms to achieve these goals, as defined by two tenets: 1) transsynaptic interactions with each other and 2) membrane stabilization via an interaction and regulation of the cytoskeleton. These processes are further distinguished by 1) the nature of the transsynaptic interaction - homophilic interactions (between the same Teneurins) to engage partner matching and heterophilic interactions (between different Teneurins) to enable synaptic connectivity and the proper apposition of pre- and postsynaptic sites and 2) the location of cytoskeletal regulation (presynaptic cytoskeletal regulation in the CNS and postsynaptic regulation of the cytoskeleton at the NMJ). Thus, both the roles and the mechanisms governing them are conserved across processes and synapses. In this review, we will highlight the contributions of Drosophila synaptic biology to our understanding of the Teneurins and discuss the mechanistic conservation that allows the Teneurins to achieve common neurodevelopmental goals. Finally, we will posit the next steps for understanding how this remarkably versatile family of proteins functions to control multiple distinct events in the creation of a nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Dupuytrens disease is the common inherited tissue-specific fibrotic disorder. Its characterized by progressive and irreversible fibroblastic proliferation affecting the palmar fascia of the hand, with an onset typically in the sixth decade of life. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 24 genomic regions associated with Dupuytrens risk, the biological mechanisms driving signal at these regions remain elusive. We identify potential biological mechanisms for Dupuytrens disease by integrating the most recent, largest GWAS (ncases = 3,871, ncontrols = 4,686) with eQTLs (47 tissue panels from five consortia, total n = 3,975) to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). We identify 43 tissue-specific gene associations with Dupuytrens risk, one of which resides at least 0.5 Mb away from the 24 risk regions previously identified. We also estimate the genome-wide genetic correlation between Dupuytrens disease and 45 complex traits and find significant genetic correlations between Dupuytrens disease and body mass index ([Formula], P = 1.6 x 10-6), type II diabetes ([Formula], P = 1.7 x 10-4), triglycerides ([Formula], P = 3.5 x 10-4), and high-density lipoprotein ([Formula], P = 4.1 x 10-4), which suggests a shared genetic etiology. We further refine the genome-wide genetic correlation signal to identify 8 regions significantly negatively correlated with BMI and 3 regions significantly correlated (1 positively and 2 negatively correlated) with HDL; none of these regions contained the novel gene association identified by TWAS. Our results are consistent with previous epidemiological findings which show that lower BMI increases risk for Dupuytrens disease. These 12 novel risk regions provide new insight into the biological mechanisms of Dupuytrens disease and serve as a starting point for functional validation.",

Topologically associating domains (TADs), one of the building blocks of chromosome structure, are genomic regions with higher contact frequencies within the region than outside the region. A central question is the degree to which TADs are conserved or vary between conditions. We analyze a set of 137 Hi-C samples from 9 different studies under 3 measures in order to quantify the effects of various sources of biological and experimental variation. We observe significant variation in TAD sets between both non-replicate and replicate samples, and show that this variability does not seem to come from genetic sequence differences. The effects of experimental protocol differences are also measured, demonstrating that samples can have protocol-specific structural changes, but that TADs are generally robust to lab-specific differences. This study represents a systematic quantification of the key factors influencing comparisons of chromosome structure.",

Here, we applied a tensor decomposition method to uncover disease-associated gene networks linked to distal genetic variation in stimulated human monocytes and macrophages gene expression profiles. We report robust evidence that some disease-associated genetic variants affect the expression of multiple genes in trans. These include a Parkinsons disease locus influencing the expression of genes mediated by a protease that controls lysosomal function, and Alzheimers disease loci influencing the expression of genes involved in type 1 interferon signaling, myeloid phagocytosis, and complement cascade pathways. Overall, we uncover gene networks in induced innate immune cells linked to disease-associated genetic variants, which may help elucidate the underlying biology of disease.",

    "abstract": "A standard practise in palaeogenome analysis is the conversion of mapped short read data into pseudohaploid sequences, typically by selecting a single high quality nucleotide at random from the stack of mapped reads. This controls for biases due to differential sequencing coverage but it does not control for differential rates and types of sequencing error, which are frequently large and variable in datasets obtained from ancient samples. These errors have the potential to distort phylogenetic and population clustering analyses, and to mislead tests of admixture using D statistics. We introduce Consensify, a method for generating pseudohaploid sequences which controls for biases resulting from differential sequencing coverage while greatly reducing error rates. The error correction is derived directly from the data itself, without the requirement for additional genomic resources or simplifying assumptions such as contemporaneous sampling. For phylogenetic analysis, we find that Consensify is less affected by branch length artefacts than methods based on standard pseudohaploidisation, and it performs similarly for population clustering analysis based on genetic distances. For D statistics, Consensify is more resistant to false positives and appears to be less affected by biases resulting from different laboratory protocols than other available methods. Although Consensify is developed with palaeogenomic data in mind, it is applicable for any low to medium coverage short read datasets. We predict that Consenify will be a useful tool for future studies of palaeogenomes.",

This can potentially reveal not only which brain areas are engaged by a task, but also how. Specifically, bottom-up and top-down responses are associated with distinct laminar profiles. Here, we measured lamina-resolved fMRI responses during a visual task designed to induce concurrent bottom-up and top-down modulations via orthogonal manipulations of stimulus contrast and feature-based attention. BOLD responses were modulated by both stimulus contrast (bottom-up) and by engaging feature-based attention (top-down). Crucially, these effects operated at different cortical depths: Bottom-up modulations were strongest in the middle cortical layer, while top-down modulations were strong at all depths, being significantly stronger in deep and superficial layers compared to bottom-up effects. As such, we demonstrate that laminar activity profiles can discriminate between concurrent top-down and bottom-up processing, and are diagnostic of how a brain region is activated.",

We also detail the large-scale brain dynamics supporting the task from an in-depth study of 32 participants with direct electrophysiological cortical recordings (intracranial EEG) to prove that BLAST involves critically large-scale executive attention networks, with a marked activation of the dorsal attention network and a deactivation of the default-mode network.

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder categorized as severe, mild, and moderate deficiencies in factor VIII (FVIII). Within these categories the variance in bleeding severity is significant and the origins unknown. The number of parameters that could modify bleeding are so numerous that experimental approaches are not feasible for considering all possible combinations. Consequently, we turn to a mathematical model of coagulation under flow to act as a screening tool to identify parameters that are most likely to enhance thrombin generation. We performed global sensitivity analysis on 110,000 simulations that varied coagulation factor levels by 50-150% of their normal values in humans while holding FVIII levels at 1%. These simulations identified low factor V (FV) levels as the strongest candidate, with additional enhancement when combined with high prothrombin levels. This prediction was confirmed in two experimental models: Partial FV inhibition boosted fibrin deposition in flow assays performed at 100 1/s on collagen-tissue factor surfaces using whole blood from individuals with mild and moderate FVIII deficiencies. Low FV (~50%) or partial FV inhibition also augmented thrombin generation in FVIII-inhibited or FVIII-deficient plasma in calibrated automated thrombography. These effects were amplified by high prothrombin levels in both experimental models. Our mathematical model suggests a mechanism in which FV and FVIII compete to bind to factor Xa to initiate thrombin generation in low FV, FVIII-deficient blood. This unexpected result was made possible by a mechanistic mathematical model, providing an example of the potential of such models in making predictions in complex biological networks.",

Here, using NMR relaxation dispersion, including a new strategy for directly observing transient conformational states in large RNAs, we find that stem IIB alone or when part of the larger RREII three-way junction robustly exists in dynamic equilibrium with non-native  excited state (ES) conformations that have a combined population of ~20%. The ESs disrupt the Rev binding site by changing local secondary structure and their stabilization via point substitution mutations decreases the binding affinity to the Rev arginine-rich motif (ARM) by 15- to 80-fold. The ensemble clarifies the conformational flexibility observed in stem IIB, reveals long-range conformational coupling between stem IIB and the three-way junction that may play roles in cooperative Rev binding, and also identifies non-native RRE conformational states as new targets for the development of anti-HIV therapeutics.",

We have established that a conserved serine within the neck region of the sole fission yeast myosin-1 is phosphorylated in a TORC2 dependent manner to modulate myosin function. Myo1 neck phosphorylation brings about a change in the conformation of the neck region and modifies its interaction with calmodulins, Myo1 dynamics at endocytic foci, and promotes calcium dependent switching between different calmodulin light chains. These data provide insight into a novel mechanism by which myosin neck phosphorylation modulates acto-myosin dynamics to control polarised cell growth in response to mitotic and meiotic cell-cycle progression and the cellular environment.",

Man-made canal systems are among the least-studied environments in terms of biodiversity in Britain. Here we focus on a case study along an English canal comparing eDNA metabarcoding with two types of electrofishing techniques (wade-and-reach and boom-boat). In addition to corroborating data obtained by electrofishing, eDNA provided a wider snapshot of fish assemblages. Given the semi-lotic nature of canals, we encourage the use of eDNA as a fast and cost-effective tool to detect and monitor whole fish communities.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual filling-in (PFI) occurs when a physically-present visual target disappears from conscious perception, with its location filled in by the surrounding visual background. Compared to other visual illusions, these perceptual changes are crisp and simple, and can occur for multiple spatially-separated targets simultaneously. Contrasting neural activity during the presence or absence of PFI may complement other multistable phenomena to reveal the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). We presented four peripheral targets over a background dynamically updating at 20 Hz. While participants reported on target disappearances/reappearances via button press/release, we tracked neural activity entrained by the background during PFI using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) recorded in the electroencephalogram. We found background SSVEPs closely correlated with subjective report, and increased with an increasing amount of PFI. Unexpectedly, we found that as the number of filled-in targets increased, the duration of target disappearances also increased, suggesting facilitatory interactions exist between targets in separate visual quadrants. We also found distinct spatiotemporal correlates for the background SSVEP harmonics. Prior to genuine PFI, the response at the second harmonic (40 Hz) increased before the first (20 Hz), which we tentatively link to an attentional effect. There was no difference between harmonics for physically removed stimuli. These results demonstrate that PFI can be used to study multi-object perceptual suppression when frequency-tagging the background of a visual display, and because there are distinct neural correlates for endogenously and exogenously induced changes in consciousness, that it is ideally suited to study the NCC.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIPerceptual filling-in (PFI) has distinct advantages for investigating the neural correlates of consciousness.\\nC_LIO_LIParticipants can accurately report graded changes in consciousness using four simultaneous buttons.\\nC_LIO_LIFrequency-tagging of visual background information tracks changes in visual perception.\\nC_LIO_LISpatiotemporal EEG responses differentiate PFI from phenomenally matched physical disappearances.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "1An important task for any aerial creature is the ability to ascertain their own movement (egomotion) through their environment. Neurons thought to underlie this behaviour have been well-characterised in many insect models including flies, moths and bees. However, dragonfly wide-field motion pathways remain undescribed. Some species of Dragonflies, such as Hemicordulia tau, engage in hawking behaviour, hovering in a single area for extended periods of time whilst also engaging in fast-moving patrols and highly dynamic pursuits of prey and conspecifics. These varied flight behaviours place very different constraints on establishing ego-motion from optic flow cues hinting at a sophisticated wide-field motion analysis system capable of detecting both fast and slow motion.\\n\\nWe characterised wide-field motion sensitive neurons via intracellular recordings in Hemicordulia dragonflies finding similar properties to those found in other species. We found that the spatial and temporal tuning properties of these neurons were broadly similar but differed significantly in their adaptation to sustained motion. We categorised a total of three different subclasses, finding differences between subclasses in their motion adaptation and response to the broadband statistics of natural images. The differences found correspond well with the dynamics of the varied behavioural tasks hawking dragonflies perform. These findings may underpin the exquisite flight behaviours found in dragonflies. They also hint at the need for the great complexity seen in dragonfly early visual processing.\\n\\n2 Significance StatementUnderstanding how animals navigate the world is an inherently difficult and interesting problem. Insect models have elucidated the neuronal mechanisms, which underpin this process. Neurons that encode wide-field motion have been studied previously in insects such as flies, hawkmoths and butterflies. Dragonflies exhibit complex aerobatic behaviours such as hovering, patrolling and aerial combat but little is known of their optic physiology. Moreover, dragonflies lack multimodal inputs (such as halteres in flies), which help enable diverse behaviours. The present study characterises wide-field motion sensitive neurons in the dragonfly. We find that wide-field motion sensitive neurons in dragonflies exhibit multiple subtypes, differentiated by their motion adaptation enabling encoding of a broad range of velocities independent of background contrast.",

We show that antigen receptor engagement controls flux through the methionine cycle and also controls RNA and histone methylations. We establish that the main rate limiting step for the methionine cycle is control of methionine transporter expression by antigen receptors.

    "abstract": "Olfactory perception depends on respiration phases: olfactory cortex processes external odor signals during inhalation whereas it is isolated from the external odor world during exhalation. Olfactory cortex pyramidal cells receive the sensory signals via bottom-up pathways terminating on superficial layer (SL) dendrites while they receive top-down inputs on deep layer (DL) dendrites. Here we asked whether olfactory cortex pyramidal cells spontaneously change the action modes of receiving olfactory sensory inputs and receiving top-down inputs in relation to respiration phases. Current source density analysis of local field potentials recorded in three different olfactory cortex areas of waking immobile rats revealed {beta}- and {gamma}-range fast oscillatory current sinks and a slow current sink in the SL during inhalation, whereas it showed {beta}- and {gamma}-range fast oscillatory current sinks and a slow current sink in the DL during exhalation. Sensory deprivation experiments showed that inhalation-phased olfactory sensory inputs drove the inhalation-phased fast oscillatory potentials in the SL but they drove neither the inhalation-phased slow current sink in the SL nor the exhalation-phased slow current sink in the DL. The results indicate that independent of inhalation-phased olfactory sensory inputs, olfactory cortex pyramidal cells spontaneously generate a slow depolarization in the SL dendrites during inhalation, which may selectively boost the concomitant olfactory sensory inputs to elicit spike outputs. In addition, the pyramidal cells spontaneously generate slow depolarization in the DL dendrites during exhalation, which may assist top-down inputs to elicit spike outputs. We thus hypothesize that the olfactory cortical areas coordinately perform inhalation/exhalation-phased switching of input biasing: inhalation phase is the time window for external odor signals that arrive in the SL dendrites, whereas exhalation phase is assigned to boost top-down signals to the DL dendrites that originate in higher brain centers.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils orchestrate the innate immune response against microorganisms and are increasingly recognized to modulate cancer development in primary tumors and metastases. To address their function in vivo, different approaches are used, the most common ones relying on antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion. By comparing the effects of two widely used antibodies, we demonstrate a strong efficacy but a lack of specificity for anti-Gr1. In contrast, anti-Ly6G lacks neutrophil-depletion capacity in C57BL/6 mice, which can be explained by an insufficient celerity of neutrophil clearance that is counterbalanced by exacerbated mobilization of immature cells. When combined with a secondary antibody, anti-Ly6G treatment results in specific and efficient neutrophil depletion. Using a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we demonstrate the efficacy of this new approach to diminish primary tumor growth and propose the existence of a local intercellular communication between neutrophils and alveolar macrophages that fosters regulatory T cell proliferation in lung cancer.",

Using reverse genetics, amino acid substitutions known to alter BXA susceptibility were introduced into the PA protein resulting in EC50 fold change increases that ranged from 2 to 65. Our study demonstrates that currently circulating viruses are susceptible to BXA and that the newly developed focus reduction assay is well suited to susceptibility monitoring in reference laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) to antibiotics has motivated the development of an efficacious KP human vaccine that would not be subject to antibiotic resistance. Klebsiella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) associated O polysaccharide (OPS) types have provoked broad interest as a vaccine antigen as there are only 4 that predominate worldwide (O1, O2a, O3, O5). Klebsiella O1 and O2 OPS are polygalactans that share a common D-Gal-I structure, for which a variant D-Gal-III was recently discovered. To understand the potential impact of this variability on antigenicity, a detailed molecular picture of the conformational differences associated with the addition of the D-Gal-III (1[-&gt;]4)Gal branch is presented using enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations. In D-Gal-I two major conformational states are observed while the presence of the 1[-&gt;]4 branch in D-Gal-III resulted in only a single dominant extended state. Stabilization of the more folded states in D-Gal-I is due to a O4-H...O2 hydrogen bond in the linear backbone that cannot occur in D-Gal-III as the O4 is in the Galp(1[-&gt;]4)Galp glycosidic linkage. The impact of branching in D-Gal-III also significantly decreases the accessibility of the monosaccharides in the linear backbone region of D-Gal-I, while the accessibility of the terminal D-Gal-II region of the OPS is not substantially altered. The present results suggest that a vaccine that targets both the D-Gal-I and D-Gal-III LPS can be developed by using D-Gal-III as the antigen combined with cross-reactivity experiments using the Gal-II polysaccharide to assure that this region of the LPS is the primary epitope of the antigen.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryKlebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is a bacterial pathogen commonly associated with hospital acquired infections to antibiotics and is of increasing concern due to the development of resistance to antibiotics including those of last resort. Development of an efficacious KP human vaccine would not be subject to the mechanisms governing antibiotic resistance and, is thus, a public health priority. The present study applies computer simulations to understand the effects of branching on the antigenic D-Gal-I and D-Gal-III O polysaccharide (OPS) species of KP. Results show that branching leads to a single dominate extended conformation, though that conformation occurs in both species. In addition, the terminal D-Gal-II region of both OPS sample similar, exposed conformations while regions of the central repeating units of the OPS are potential hindered from interactions with antibodies in the presence of the branched D-Gal-III OPS. The results suggest a strategy for vaccine development based on D-Gal-III as the antigen combined with cross reactivity experiments to assure that the D-Gal-II region is the primary epitope of the antigen.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRabies is a zoonotic viral disease that can occur in all warm-blooded mammals, including man [1]. Vaccinating dogs can protect people from contracting rabies [2]. Annual deaths due to rabies was estimated to 61000 worldwide [1], and Africa represented 35.2% of the deaths [3]. In Rwanda, rabies is a public health threat to the public [4], but the country does not have information on the disease [5].\\n\\nMethodologyThe present study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of rabies and its control among dog owners in Kigali city, Rwanda. We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire among 137 dog owners randomly selected within each of the selected 9 study sites. A series of chi-square tests of association and binary logistic regression were used to determine the important factors associated with the response variables.\\n\\nResultsThe results showed that 99.5% of respondents could mention at least a host susceptible to rabies. Only 22.4 % and 21.3 % knew about canine and human rabies, respectively. Nearly 73.6% knew that human rabies can be transmitted through dog-bites and 99% could identify at least a clinical sign of canine rabies. Nealy 81.8% thought that regularly vaccinating dogs could prevent people from contracting dog-transmitted rabies. Only 43.1% and 26.3% were aware that clinical human and canine rabies are always deadly, respectively. Respondents who would observe a dog for some time, once it bites a man or an animal, represented 69%. Only 20.4% were familiar with cleaning dog-bites wounds with water and soap, before attending health care facilities. Few respondents owning dogs (20.6%) knew that puppies could receive rabies vaccination before the age of three months. Of respondents who owned vaccinated dogs, 78% were happy about the cost of rabies vaccination of dogs (Rwandan Francs 0-30,000). Nearly 57.9% had their dogs vaccinated at home by veterinarians.\\n\\nEighty-two (82%) percent of respondents received rabies information from neighbours, the media and public meetings. Logistic regression analyses indicated that none of respondentssex, education level, and duration of dog ownership was statistically associated with their knowledge of rabies. The respondents who had kept dogs for 5-10 years were less likely to have as sufficient knowledge as those who had kept dogs for more than ten years (AOR=0.96). Male respondents were more likely to adopt a positive attitude (AOR=1.47) and have appropriate practice (A0R=1.40) towards rabies. The respondents who had completed at least primary education, were more likely to have appropriate practice of rabies (AOR=1.41).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study identified gaps in the dog owners rabies knowledge of transmission, treatment and control. In addition, none of respondentssex, educational level, and dog ownership length was statistically associated with their rabies knowledge. Overall, this study indicated that all categories of dog owners in Kigali city did not have good levels of rabies knowledge. Rabies interventions including awareness component in the studied population should be homogeneously improved.",

    "abstract": "Representations of the body and peripersonal space can be distorted for people with some chronic pain conditions. Experimental pain induction can give rise to similar, but transient distortions in healthy individuals. However, spatial and bodily representations are dynamic, and constantly update as we interact with objects in our environment. It is unclear whether induced pain disrupts the mechanisms involved in updating these representations. In the present study, we sought to investigate the effect of induced pain on the updating of peripersonal space and body representations during and following tool-use. We compared performance under three conditions (pain, active placebo, neutral) on a visuotactile crossmodal congruency task and a tactile distance judgement task to measure updating of peripersonal space and body representations, respectively. We induced pain by applying 1% capsaicin cream to the arm, and for placebo we used a gel that induced non-painful warming. Consistent with previous findings, the difference in crossmodal interference from visual distractors in the same compared to opposite visual field to the tactile target was less when tools were crossed than uncrossed. This suggests an extension of peripersonal space to incorporate the tips of the tools. Also consistent with previous findings, estimates of the felt distance between two points (tactile distance judgements) decreased after active tool-use. In contrast to our predictions, however, we found no evidence that pain interfered with performance on either task when compared to the control conditions. This suggests that the updating of peripersonal space and body representations is not disrupted by induced pain. Therefore, acute pain does not account for the distorted representations of the body and peripersonal space that can endure in people with chronic pain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Rice variety, Improved White Ponni is a medium duration crop, but highly susceptible to lodging impacting maximum yield losses. The present investigation aimed to identify early and early semi-dwarf mutants in Improved White Ponni by inducing variations using gamma rays without altering its native grain quality traits. Seeds were treated with various doses of after fixation of the LD50 value of gamma radiation and reported that most of the traits exhibit variations in the mutants at various levels of irradiation. The selection for earliness and dwarf plant height was imposed in M2 and it was confirmed by evaluation of M3 generation. Apart from semi-dwarf early mutants, high tillering habit, narrow rolled leaf, upper albino leaf and grassy stunt and extreme dwarf mutants were also identified. Characterization of mutants using already reported genic and linked microsatellite markers associated with semi-dwarfism and earliness resulted that PIC value ranges between 0.037 and 0.949 with an average of 0.382. Single marker analysis revealed that RM302 and RM310 on chromosome 1 and 8 had exhibited an association with the traits plant height, culm and internodal lengths. Of these gene-specific markers, GA20Oxi_1 and GA20Oxi_2 have shown polymorphism among mutants. GA20Oxi_2 showed null alleles in the dwarf mutants and this clearly emphasized that there are some base deletions exists in the region of exon 2 of sd1 region. GA3 response study shown that identified mutants were GA3 responsive except IWP 11-2, IWP 48-2, IWP 50-11 and IWP 33-2 which showed very low responsive. Agar plate assay revealed that, IWP 50-11, IWP 33-2, IWP 43-1, IWP 47-2 and IWP 18-1 had low production of - amylase. Scanning electron microscope examination on confirmed mutants exhibited larger cell size and a lesser number of cells per unit area than the wild-type which shows that these mutants are defective in GA mediated pathway.",

    "abstract": "Permanently polarized cells have developed transduction mechanisms linking polarity-sites with gene regulation in the nucleus. In neurons, one mechanism is based on long-distance retrograde migration of transcription factors (TFs). Aspergillus nidulans FlbB is the only known fungal TF shown to migrate retrogradely to nuclei from the polarized region of fungal cells known as hyphae. There, FlbB controls developmental transitions by triggering the production of asexual multicellular structures. FlbB dynamics in hyphae is orchestrated by regulators FlbE and FlbD. At least three FlbE domains are involved in the acropetal transport of FlbB, with a final MyoE/actin filament-dependent step from the subapex to the apex. Experiments employing a T2A viral peptide-containing chimera (FlbE::mRFP::T2A::FlbB::GFP) suggest that apical FlbB/FlbE interaction is inhibited in order to initiate a dynein-dependent FlbB transport to nuclei. FlbD controls the nuclear accumulation of FlbB through a cMyb domain and a C-terminal LxxLL motif. Overall, results elucidate a highly dynamic pattern of FlbB interactions, which enable timely developmental induction. Furthermore, this system establishes a reference for TF-based long-distance signaling in permanently polarized cells.",

    "abstract": "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip (Illumina 450K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in the majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, TRIM59, showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Members of the Gram-negative bacterial genus Photorhabdus are all highly insect pathogenic and exist in an obligate symbiosis with the entomopathogenic nematode worm Heterorhabditis. All members of the genus produce the small molecule 3,5-dihydroxy-4-isopropyl-trans-stilbene (IPS) as part of their secondary metabolism. IPS is a multi-potent compound that has antimicrobial, antifungal and anticancer activities and also plays an important role in symbiosis with the nematode. In this study we have examined the response of Photorhabdus itself to exogenous ectopic addition of IPS at physiologically relevant concentrations. We observed that the bacteria had a measureable phenotypic response, which included a decrease in bioluminescence and pigment production. This was reflected in changes in its transcriptomic response, in which we reveal a reduction in transcript levels of genes relating to many fundamental cellular processes, such as translation and oxidative phosphorylation. Our observations suggest that IPS plays an important role in the biology of Photorhabdus bacteria, fulfilling roles in quorum sensing, antibiotic-competition advantage and maintenance of the symbiotic developmental cycle.",

    "abstract": "Body-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a non-invasive way to use and control external devices such as powered wheelchairs. Vibrotactile stimulation has been proposed as a way for BMIs to provide device performance feedback to the user, thereby reducing visual demands of closed-loop control. To advance the goal of developing a compact, multivariate vibrotactile display for BMIs, we performed two 2-alternative, forced choice experiments to determine the extent to which vibrotactile perception might vary across multiple stimulation sites. The first experiment assessed vibrotactile discrimination of sequentially presented stimuli within each of four dermatomes of the arm (C5, C7, C8, T1) and on the ulnar head. The second compared discrimination when pairs of vibrotactile stimuli were presented simultaneously vs. sequentially both within and across dermatomes. Although the first experiment found small but statistically significant differences across dermatomes C7 and T1, discrimination thresholds at the other three locations did not differ one from another or from those at either C7 or T1. These results suggest that stimuli applied to each of the sites may be able to convey approximately the same amount of information. The second experiment found that sequential delivery of vibrotactile stimuli resulted in better discrimination than simultaneous delivery, independent of whether the pairs were located within the same dermatome or across dermatomes. Taken together, our results suggest that the arm may be a viable site to transfer multivariate information via vibrotactile feedback for body-machine interfaces. However, user training may be needed to overcome the perceptual disadvantage of simultaneous vs. sequentially-presented stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Protein complexes play a central role in many aspects of biological function. Knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of protein complexes is critical for gaining insights into the structural basis of interactions and their roles in the biomolecular pathways that orchestrate key cellular processes. Because of the expense and effort associated with experimental determination of 3D structures of protein complexes, computational docking has evolved as a valuable tool to predict the 3D structures of biomolecular complexes. Despite recent progress, reliably distinguishing near-native docking conformations from a large number of candidate conformations, the so-called scoring problem, remains a major challenge. Here we present iScore, a novel approach to scoring docked conformations that combines HADDOCK energy terms with a score obtained using a graph representation of the protein-protein interfaces and a measure of evolutionary conservation. It achieves a scoring performance competitive with, or superior to that of the state-of-the-art scoring functions on independent data sets consisting docking software-specific data sets and the CAPRI score set built from a wide variety of docking approaches. iScore ranks among the top scoring approaches on the CAPRI score set (13 targets) when compared with the 37 scoring groups in CAPRI. The results demonstrate the utility of combining evolutionary and topological, and physicochemical information for scoring docked conformations. This work represents the first successful demonstration of graph kernel to protein interfaces for effective discrimination of near-native and non-native conformations of protein complexes. It paves the way for the further development of computational methods for predicting the structure of protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs), with their crucial roles in gene regulation and disease development, have become a rising star in the RNA world. A lot of previous wet-lab studies focused on the interaction mechanisms between circRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), as the knowledge of circRNA-RBP association is very important for understanding functions of circRNAs. Recently, the abundant CLIP-Seq experimental data has made the large-scale identification and analysis of circRNA-RBP interactions possible, while no computational tool based on machine learning has been developed yet.\\n\\nWe present a new deep learning-based method, CRIP (CircRNAs Interact with Proteins), for the prediction of RBP binding sites on circRNAs, using only the RNA sequences. In order to fully exploit the sequence information, we propose a stacked codon-based encoding scheme and a hybrid deep learning architecture, in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) learns high-level abstract features and a recurrent neural network (RNN) learns long dependency in the sequences. We construct 37 datasets including sequence fragments of binding sites on circRNAs, and each set corresponds to one RBP. The experimental results show that the new encoding scheme is superior to the existing feature representation methods for RNA sequences, and the hybrid network outperforms conventional classifiers by a large margin, where both the CNN and RNN components contribute to the performance improvement. To the best of our knowledge, CRIP is the first machine learning-based tool specialized in the prediction of circRNA-RBP interactions, which is expected to play an important role for large-scale function analysis of circRNAs.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMathematics and physics based computational models have the potential to help interpret and encapsulate biological phenomena in a computable and reproducible form. Similarly, comprehensive descriptions of such models encoded in computable form help to ensure that such models are accessible, discoverable, and reusable. To this end, researchers have developed tools and standards to encode mathematical models of biological systems enabling reproducibility and reuse; tools and guidelines to facilitate semantic description of mathematical models; and repositories in which to archive, share, and discover models. Biologists and clinicians can leverage these resources to investigate specific questions and hypotheses.\\n\\nResultsWe have comprehensively annotated a cohort of models with biological semantics. These annotated models are freely available in the Physiome Model Repository (PMR). To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, we have developed a web-based tool which enables users to discover models relevant to their work, with a particular focus on epithelial transport. In helping a user to discover relevant models this tool will provide users with suggestions for similar or alternative models they may wish to explore or utilize in their model based on the models they would like to use. The semantic annotation and the web tool we have developed is a new contribution enabling scientists to discover relevant models in the PMR as candidates for reuse in their own scientific endeavours. We believe that this approach demonstrates how semantic web technologies and methodologies can contribute to biomedical and clinical research.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationhttps://github.com/dewancse/model-discovery-tool",

Three human cell lines including 293T, Hepg2 and LO2 were selected as infection targets. After detecting the expression of DANA, we found that the expression of DANA retroposon in three cells had different effects on cell lines through chromosome walking. Among these cells, LO2 showed no DANA retrotrans-position, while 293T and Hepg2 cell lines displayed retrotrans-position with the formation of some zebrafish genome fragments. Thereafter, we constructed a mutant of DANA retroposon and infected it in 293T cells, but no retrotrans-position was found after chromosome walking. Re-sequencing of the two cell lines (293T and Hepg2) showed that a large number of zebrafish genome fragments were found in the genomes of both cell lines, which could be divided into four types. The first type was zebrafish microsatellite sequence, accounting for 79.23% and 74.45% in 293T cell line and Hepg2 cell line, respectively. The second type was the sequence with a small amount of poly A or T, and the third type was the sequence with poly G or C, and the second and third types accounted very low proportion. The fourth type was composed of coding sequence and non-coding sequence, with large difference and very low proportion of common sequences between the two cell lines. Taken together, this study indicated that zebrafish DANA retroposon can result in retrotrans-position using the retrotrans system of human cell lines.",

For comparison, we also captured exomes of a primate species more closely related to humans (Macaca mulatta, n= 4). We mapped reads to both the human reference assembly and the most closely related reference for each species before calling variants. We used measures of mapping quality and read coverage to compare capture success.\\n\\nResultsWe observed high and comparable mapping qualities for both species when mapped to their respective nearest-relative reference genomes. When investigating breadth of coverage, we found greater capture success in macaques than sifakas using both nearest-relative and human assemblies. Exome capture in sifakas was still highly successful with more than 90% of annotated coding sequence in the sifaka reference genome captured, and 80% sequenced to a depth greater than 7x using Nimblegen baits. However, this success depended on probe design: the use of IDT probes resulted in substantially less callable sequence at low-to-moderate depths.\\n\\nDiscussionOverall, we demonstrate successful exome capture in lemurs using human baits, though success differed between kits tested. These results indicate that exome capture is an effective and economical genomic method of broad utility to evolutionary primatologists working across the entire primate order.",

    "abstract": "Prominent theories suggest that symptoms of schizophrenia stem from learning deficiencies resulting in distorted internal models of the world. To further test these theories, we here use a visual statistical learning task known to induce rapid implicit learning of the stimulus statistics (Chalk et al., 2010). In this task, participants are presented with a field of coherently moving dots and need to report the presented direction of the dots (estimation task) and whether they saw any dots or not (detection task). Two of the directions were more frequently presented than the others. In controls, the implicit acquisition of the stimuli statistics influences their perception in two ways: 1-motion directions are perceived as being more similar to the most frequently presented directions than they really are (estimation biases); 2-in the absence of stimuli, participants sometimes report perceiving the most frequently presented directions (a form of hallucinations). Such behaviour is consistent with probabilistic inference, i.e. combining learnt perceptual priors with sensory evidence. We investigated whether patients with chronic, stable, treated schizophrenia (n=20) differ from controls (n=23) in the acquisition of the perceptual priors and/or their influence on perception. We found that, although patients were slower than controls, they showed comparable acquisition of perceptual priors, correctly approximating the stimulus statistics. This suggests that patients have no statistical learning deficits in our task. This may reflect our patients relative wellbeing on antipsychotic medication. Intriguingly, however, patients made significantly fewer hallucinations of the most frequently presented directions than controls and fewer prior-based lapse estimations. This suggests that prior expectations had less influence on patients perception than on controls when stimuli were absent or below perceptual threshold.",

Our calculations demonstrated that nanoporous BN allows for rapid water permeability with effective salt rejection. The permeability is not only two orders of magnitude higher than existing commercial techniques but also much higher than nanoporous graphene and molybdenum disulfide membranes. We further showed that the pores with B-h edges or with N-h edges present different desalination efficiency. Compared to N-h pores, B-h pores have better desalination performance in term of higher water flux. To the best of our knowledge, nanoporous BN is the 2D material having the highest water permeability thus far while maintaining high salt rejection. Overall, our results shed light on the potential",

    "abstract": "Tau inclusions are a shared feature of many neurodegenerative conditions and tau mutations lead to frontotemporal dementia. Approaches to treatment of these conditions have focused directly on the tau protein by targeting its post-translational modifications, its levels and its tendency to aggregate. We discovered a novel regulatory pathway for tau degradation that operates through the Rhes protein, a GTPase. Rhes is farnesylated and treatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, lonafarnib, reduced Rhes, attenuated behavioral abnormalities, significantly reduced atrophy, tau inclusions, sumoylation and ubiquitination, as well as microgliosis in the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse. Direct reduction of Rhes levels reproduced the results observed with lonafarnib. The mechanism of lonafarnib action, as mediated by Rhes to reduce tau pathology, operates through the lysosome without involvement of the proteasome. Finally we show that the developmental increase in Rhes levels can be homeostatically regulated in the presence of tau mutations as a protective mechanism through which cells sense abnormal tau before any pathology is present. The extensive human trials of lonafarnib for other conditions, makes this drug ideal for repurposing to treat tauopathies.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryVia a mechanism that involves targeting Rhes, lonafarnib can induce lysosomal-mediated tau degradation and prevent pathology in a tau mouse model",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThree-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) is increasingly used to assess left ventricular (LV) mechanics but the quantitative effect of image quality on measurements is not known.\\n\\nOBJECTIVESTo assess the impact of image quality on 3D-STE derived LV indices.\\n\\nMETHODSEchocardiography was performed in two groups of 18 healthy participants. In the first study, optimal and intentionally poor-quality images were acquired. In the second study, a sheet of ultrasound-attenuating material (neoprene rubber) of three different thicknesses (2, 3 and 4 mm) was used to mimic mildly, moderately and severely impaired image quality respectively.\\n\\nRESULTSIn both studies sub-optimal image quality resulted in a systematic underestimation bias in all LV deformation and rotational indices. LV ejection fraction and volumes were also consistently underestimated. The extent of the bias was proportional to the impairment in image quality (i.e. the poorer the image quality the larger the bias). Reproducibility was also less good for sub-optimal images, although LV volumes and ejection fraction showed excellent reproducibility irrespective of image quality.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSSub-optimal image quality introduces a substantial systematic bias and impairs the reproducibility of 3D-STE. Bias related to image quality might have important clinical implications since its magnitude is similar to that reported in association with disease and may confound associations between disease and LV mechanics.\\n\\nCONDENSED ABSTRACTThree-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) is increasingly used in clinical practice. We assessed the impact of sub-optimal image quality on left ventricular (LV) deformation indices either by poor echocardiographic technique or by impairing ultrasound propagation using a neoprene sheet. Sub-optimal image quality introduces a substantial systematic bias that increases with poorer image quality. Bias due to image quality might have important clinical implications since its magnitude is similar to that reported in association with disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhenotypic variability of human populations is partly the result of gene polymorphism and differential gene expression. As such, understanding the molecular basis for diversity requires identifying genes with both high and low population expression variance and identifying the mechanisms underlying their expression control. Key issues remain unanswered with respect to expression variability in human populations. The role of gene methylation as well as the contribution that age, sex and tissue-specific factors have on expression variability are not well understood.\n\nResultsHere we used a novel method that accounts for sampling error to classify human genes based on their expression variability in normal human breast and brain tissues. We find that high expression variability is almost exclusively unimodal, indicating that variance is not the result of segregation into distinct expression states. Genes with high expression variability differ markedly between tissues and we find that genes with high population expression variability are likely to have age-, but not sex-dependent expression. Lastly, we find that methylation likely has a key role in controlling expression variability insofar as genes with low expression variability are likely to be non-methylated.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that gene expression variability in the human population is likely to be important in tissue development and identity, methylation, and in natural biological aging. The expression variability of a gene is an important functional characteristic of the gene itself and the classification of a gene as one with Hyper-Variability or Hypo-Variability in a human population or in a specific tissue should be useful in the identification of important genes that functionally regulate development or disease.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle that includes specialized stages for transmission between their mosquito and human hosts. These stages are an understudied part of the lifecycle yet targeting them is an essential component of the effort to shrink the malaria map. The human parasite Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the majority of deaths due to malaria. Our goal was to generate transgenic P. falciparum lines that could complete the lifecycle and produce fluorescent transmission stages for more in-depth and high-throughput studies. Using zinc-finger nuclease technology to engineer a marker-free integration site, we generated three transgenic P. falciparum lines in which tdtomato or gfp were stably integrated into the genome. Expression was driven by either stage-specific peg4 and csp promoters or the constitutive ef1a promoter. Phenotypic characterization of these lines demonstrates that they complete the life cycle with high infection rates and give rise to fluorescent mosquito stages. The transmission stages are sufficiently bright for intra-vital imaging, flow cytometry and scalable screening of chemical inhibitors and potentially inhibitory antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Here we demonstrate that during strategic gameplay monkeys behave as if they reason recursively about other individuals beliefs and desires in order to predict their choices and to guide their own actions, especially the decision to cooperate. Neurons in mid superior temporal sulcus (mSTS), the putative homolog of the human temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), signal abstract non-perceptual social information, including payoffs, intentions, and outcomes, and further distinguish between social and nonsocial agents while monkeys play the game. We demonstrate for the first time that a subpopulation of these neurons selectively signals cooperatively obtained rewards. Neurons in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg), an area implicated in vicarious reinforcement and empathy, do not distinguish agency and as a population carry less information about strategic variables. These findings suggest the capacity to mentalize has deep roots in the strategic social behavior of primates, and endorse mSTS as the evolutionary wellspring of these functions.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis encodes ten ARGONAUTE (AGO) effectors of RNA silencing, canonically loaded with either 21-22nt small RNAs (sRNA) to mediate post-transcriptional-gene-silencing (PTGS) or 24nt sRNAs to promote RNA-directed-DNA-methylation. Using full-locus constructs, we characterized the expression, biochemical properties, and possible modes of action of AGO3. Although AGO3 arose from a recent duplication at the AGO2 locus, their expression differs drastically, with AGO2 being expressed in both male and female gametes whereas AGO3 accumulates in aerial vascular terminations and specifically in chalazal seed integuments. Accordingly, AGO3 down-regulation alters gene expression in siliques. Similar to AGO2, AGO3 binds sRNAs with a strong 5-adenosine bias, but unlike most Arabidopsis AGOs - AGO2 included - it binds efficiently both 24nt and 21nt sRNAs. AGO3 immunoprecipitation experiments in siliques revealed that these sRNAs mostly correspond to genes and intergenic regions. in a manner reflecting their respective accumulation from their loci-of-origin. AGO3 localizes to the cytoplasm and co-fractionates with polysomes to possibly mediate PTGS via translation inhibition.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe regulation of gene expression by small RNAs is key for proper plant development and defense. Here, we characterize Arabidopsis AGO3 expression pattern, microRNA regulation and biochemical properties during sexual reproduction.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSocial processes are associated with depression, particularly understanding and responding to others, deficits in which can manifest as callousness/unemotionality (CU). Thus, CU may reflect some of the genetic risk to depression. Further, this vulnerability likely reflects the neurological substrates of depression, presenting biomarkers to capture genetic vulnerability of depression severity. However, heritability varies within brain regions, so a high-resolution genetic perspective is needed.\\n\\nMethod In a sample of 258 same-sex twin pairs from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study (LTS), we developed a toolbox that maps genetic and environmental associations between brain and behavior at high resolution. We used this toolbox to estimate brain areas that are genetically associated with both depressive symptoms and CU. We then overlapped the two maps to generate coordinates that allow for tests of downstream effects of genes influencing our clusters.\\n\\nResults Genetic variance influencing cortical thickness in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) sulci and gyri, ventral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), pre-somatic motor cortex (PreSMA), medial precuneus, left occipital-temporal junction (OTJ), parietal-temporal junction (PTJ), ventral somatosensory cortex (vSMA), and medial and lateral precuneus were genetically associated with both depression and CU. Split-half replication found support for both DLPFC clusters. Meta-analytic term search identified \\\"theory of mind\\\", \\\"inhibit\\\", and \\\"pain\\\" as likely functions. Gene and transcript mapping/enrichment analyses implicated calcium channels.\\n\\nConclusionsCU reflects genetic vulnerability to depression that likely involves executive and social functioning in a distributed process across the cortex. This approach works to unify neuroimaging, neuroinformatics, and genetics to discover pathways to psychiatric vulnerability.",
