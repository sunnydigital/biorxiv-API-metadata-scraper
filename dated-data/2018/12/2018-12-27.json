    "abstract": "Bacteria often live in complex communities in which they interact with other organisms. Consideration of the social environment of bacteria can reveal emergent traits and behaviors that would be overlooked by studying bacteria in isolation. Here we characterize a social trait which emerges upon interaction between the distantly-related soil bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and Pedobacter sp. V48. On hard agar, which is not permissive for motility of the mono-culture of either species, co-culture reveals an emergent phenotype we term  interspecies social spreading, where the mixed colony spreads across the hard surface. We show that initiation of social spreading requires close association between the two species of bacteria. Both species remain associated throughout the spreading colony, with reproducible and non-homogenous patterns of distribution. The nutritional environment influences social spreading; no social behavior is observed under high nutrient conditions, but low nutrient conditions are insufficient to promote social spreading without high salt concentrations. This simple two-species consortium is a tractable model system that will facilitate mechanistic investigations of interspecies interactions and provide insight into emergent properties of interacting species. These studies will contribute to the broader knowledge of how bacterial interactions influence the functions of communities they inhabit.\\n\\nImportanceThe wealth of studies on microbial communities has revealed the complexity and dynamics of the composition of communities in many ecological settings. Fewer studies probe the functional interactions of the community members. Function of the community as a whole may not be fully revealed by characterizing the individuals. In our two-species model community, we find an emergent trait resulting from the interaction of the soil bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and Pedobacter sp. V48. Observation of emergent traits suggests there may be many functions of a community that are not predicted based on a priori knowledge of the community members. These types of studies will provide a more holistic understanding of microbial communities, allowing us to connect information about community composition with behaviors determined by interspecific interactions. These studies increase our ability to understand communities, such as the soil microbiome, plant-root microbiome, and human gut microbiome, with the final goal of being able to manipulate and rationally improve these communities.",

    "abstract": "Modern SNP genotyping technologies allow to measure the relative abundance of different alleles for a given locus and consequently to estimate their allele dosage, opening a new road for genetic studies in autopolyploids. Despite advances in genetic linkage analysis in autotetraploids, there is a lack of statistical models to perform linkage analysis in organisms with higher ploidy levels. In this paper, we present a statistical method to estimate recombination fractions and infer linkage phases in full-sib populations of autopolyploid species with even ploidy levels in a sequence of SNP markers using hidden Markov models. Our method uses efficient two-point procedures to reduce the search space for the best linkage phase configuration and reestimate the final parameters using the maximum-likelihood of the Markov chain. To evaluate the method, and demonstrate its properties, we rely on simulations of autotetraploid, autohexaploid and autooctaploid populations and on a real tetraploid potato data set. The results demonstrate the reliability of our approach, including situations with complex linkage phase scenarios in hexaploid and octaploid populations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn this paper, we present a complete multilocus solution based on hidden Markov models to estimate recombination fractions and infer the linkage phase configuration in full-sib mapping populations with even ploidy levels under random chromosome segregation. We also present an efficient pairwise loci analysis to be used in cases were the multilocus analysis becomes compute-intensive.",

    "abstract": "Sleep slow waves are known to participate in memory consolidation, yet slow waves occurring under anesthesia present no positive effects on memory. Here, we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of extracellular recordings in vivo, in vitro, and computational models. We find two types of slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive slow-wave events. The first type is consistently observed in natural slow-wave sleep, while the second is shown to be ubiquitous under anesthesia. Network models of spiking neurons predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different gain on inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of spike-frequency adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical distinctions between the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by varying adaptation strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which demonstrated a neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves. Finally, we show that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to external stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.",

Here we harness the innate behavioral repertoire of the larval zebrafish to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of feature coding across the entire Purkinje cell population during visual stimuli and the reflexive behaviors that they elicit. Population imaging reveals three spatially-clustered regions of Purkinje cell activity along the rostrocaudal axis. Complementary single-cell electrophysiological recordings assign these Purkinje cells to one of three functional phenotypes that encode a specific visual, and not motor, signal via complex spikes. In contrast, simple spike output of most Purkinje cells is strongly driven by motor-related tail and eye signals. Interactions between complex and simple spikes show heterogeneous modulation patterns across different Purkinje cells, which become temporally restricted during swimming episodes. Our findings reveal how sensorimotor information is encoded by individual Purkinje cells and organized into behavioral modules across the entire cerebellum.",

Compared to heterotrophic microorganisms, however, the cellular economy of phototrophic growth is still insufficiently understood. We provide a quantitative analysis of light-limited, light-saturated, and light-inhibited growth of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 using a reproducible cultivation setup. We report key physiological parameters, including growth rate, cell size, and photosynthetic activity over a wide range of light intensities. Intracellular proteins were quantified to monitor proteome allocation as a function of growth rate. Among other physiological adaptations, we identify an upregulation of the translational machinery and downregulation of light harvesting components with increasing light intensity and growth rate. The resulting growth laws are discussed in the context of a coarse-grained model of phototrophic growth and available data obtained by a comprehensive literature search. Our insights into quantitative aspects of cyanobacterial adaptations to different growth rates have implications to understand and optimize photosynthetic productivity.",

    "abstract": "Cell type specification during early nervous system development in Drosophila melanogaster requires precise regulation of gene expression in time and space. Resolving the programs driving neurogenesis has been a major challenge owing to the complexity and rapidity with which distinct cell populations arise. To resolve the cell type-specific gene expression dynamics in early nervous system development, we have sequenced the transcriptomes of purified neurogenic cell types across consecutive time points covering critical events in neurogenesis. The resulting gene expression atlas comprises a detailed resource of global transcriptome dynamics that permits systematic analysis of how cells in the nervous system acquire distinct fates. We resolve known gene expression dynamics and uncover novel expression signatures for hundreds of genes among diverse neurogenic cell types, most of which remain unstudied. We also identified a set of conserved and processed long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that exhibit spatiotemporal expression during neurogenesis with exquisite specificity. LncRNA expression is highly dynamic and demarcates specific subpopulations within neurogenic cell types. Our spatiotemporal transcriptome atlas provides a comprehensive resource to investigate the function of coding genes and noncoding RNAs during critical stages of early neurogenesis.\\n\\nSummary statementWe present a spatiotemporal transcriptome during early Drosophila embryonic nervous system development, revealing a complex cell type-specific network of mRNAs and IncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria are a major source of novel bioactive natural products. A challenge in the screening of these microorganisms lies in finding the favorable growth conditions for secondary metabolite production and dereplication of known molecules. Here, we report that Streptomyces sp. MBT27 produces 4-quinazolinone alkaloids in response to elevated levels of glycerol, whereby quinazolinones A (1) and B (2) form a new sub-class of this interesting family of natural products. Global Natural Product Social molecular networking (GNPS) resulted in a quinazolinone-related network that included anthranilic acid (3), anthranilamide (4), 4(3H)-quinazolinone (5) and 2,2-dimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinazolin-4(3H)-one (6). Actinomycins D (7) and X2 (8) were also identified in the extracts of Streptomyces sp. MBT27. The induction of quinazolinone production by glycerol combined with biosynthetic insights provide evidence that glycerol is integrated into the chemical scaffold. The unprecedented 1,4-dioxepane ring that is spiro-fused into the quinazolinone backbone, is most likely formed by intermolecular etherification of two units of glycerol. Our work underlines the importance of varying the growth conditions for the discovery of novel natural products and for understanding their biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF{beta}) family plays an important role in many developmental processes and when mutated often contributes to various diseases. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disease with an occurrence of approximately 1 in 5,000. The disease is caused by mutations in fibrillin, which lead to an increase in TGF{beta} ligand activity, resulting in abnormalities of connective tissues which can be life-threatening. Mutations in other components of TGF{beta} signaling (receptors, Smads, Schnurri) lead to similar diseases with attenuated phenotypes relative to Marfan syndrome. In particular, mutations in TGF{beta} receptors, most of which are clustered at the C-terminal end, result in Marfan-like (MFS-like) syndromes. Even though it was assumed that many of these receptor mutations would reduce or eliminate signaling, in many cases signaling is active. From our trafficking work in C. elegans, we noticed that many of these receptor mutations that lead to Marfan-like syndromes overlap with mutations that cause mis-trafficking of the receptor, suggesting a link between Marfan-like syndromes and TGF{beta} receptor trafficking. To test this hypothesis, we introduced some of these key MFS and MFS-like mutations into the C. elegans TGF{beta} receptor and asked if receptor trafficking is altered. We find that some of the mutated receptors localize to the apical surface rather than basolateral surface of the polarized intestinal cells. Further, we find that these mutations result in longer animals, a phenotype due to over-stimulation of the pathway and, importantly, indicating that function of the receptor is not abrogated in these mutants. Our nematode models of Marfan syndrome suggest that MFS and MFS-like mutations in the type II receptor lead to mis-trafficking of the receptor and possibly provides an explanation for the disease, a phenomenon which might also occur in some cancers that possess the same mutations within the type II receptor (e.g. colon cancer).\n\nAuthor SummaryThe transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF{beta}) family plays an important role in many basic biological processes and when mutated often contributes to various diseases. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disease with an occurrence of approximately 1 in 5,000. The disease is caused by mutations in fibrillin, which lead to an increase in TGF{beta} ligand activity, resulting in abnormalities of connective tissues which can be life-threatening. However, some patients with normal fibrillin genes also show symptoms and pathologies associated with Marfan syndrome, known collectively as Marfan-like Syndromes (MFS-like). When these patients were assessed for mutations in other components of the TGF{beta} pathway, several mutations clustered in a small region of the receptors, primarily in the type II TGF{beta} receptor were found.\n\nWe find that mimicking these mutations in the nematode type II TGF{beta} receptor causes the mutant receptor to move to regions of the cell where it is not normally found. Importantly, these mutations do not abrogate the function of the receptor, suggesting that mis-localization of the receptor might be previously unknown cause of disease etiology. We hypothesize that receptor mutations present at the LTA lead to disruptions in interactions with trafficking regulators leading to symptoms of MFS/MFS-like syndromes - a novel disease mechanism of MFS/MFS-like syndromes that might also extend to other cancers bearing similar mutations.",

To understand how a sharp gradient is formed within this dynamic environment, we followed the generation of graded nuclear Dorsal (Dl) protein, the hallmark of pattern formation along the dorso-ventral axis, in live embryos. We show that a sharp gradient is formed through extracellular, diffusion-based morphogen shuttling that progresses through several nuclear divisions. Perturbed shuttling in wntD mutant embryos results in a flat activation peak and aberrant gastrulation. Re-entry of Dl into the nuclei at each cycle refines the signaling output, by guiding graded accumulation of the T48 transcript that drives patterned gastrulation. We conclude that diffusion-based ligand shuttling, coupled with dynamic readout, establishes a refined pattern within the diffusible environment of early embryos.",

For the recordings, we either inserted a linear probe into the D3 digit representation or we performed surface electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings.\\n\\nResultsPeripheral stimulation of a digit or the forepaw elicited seizures that were followed by a refractory period with decreased neuronal activity, or another seizure or a normal response. LFP amplitudes in response to electrical pulses during the seizures (0.28 {+/-} 0.03 mV) were higher than during normal evoked responses (0.25 {+/-} 0.05 mV) and refractory periods (0.2 {+/-} 0.08 mV). Seizures generated during the stimulation period showed prolonged after-discharges that were sustained for 20.9{+/-}1.9 s following the cessation of the stimulus. High-frequency oscillations were observed prior to and during the seizures, with amplitudes higher than those associated with normal evoked responses. The seizures were initially focal. Optical imaging of the cerebral blood volume response showed that they propagated from the onset zone to adjacent cortical areas, beyond the S1FL representation of the stimulated digit or forepaw. The spatial extent during seizures was on average 1.74 times larger during the stimulation and 4.1 times following its cessation relative to normal evoked responses. Seizures were recorded not only by probes inserted into cortex but also with ECoG arrays (24.1{+/-}5.8 seizures per rat) placed over the dura matter, indicating that the seizures were not induced by damage caused by inserting the probes to cortex. Stimulation of the forepaw elicited more seizures (18.8{+/-}8.5 seizures per rat) than stimulation of a digit (1.7{+/-}0.7). Unlike rats sedated with dexmedetomidine, rats anesthetized with urethane showed no seizures, indicating that the seizures may depend on the use of the mild sedative dexmedetomidine.\\n\\nSignificanceOur proposed animal model generates seizures induced by electrical sensory stimulation free of artifacts and brain damage. It can be used for studying the mechanisms underlying the generation and propagation of reflex seizures and for evaluating antiepileptic drugs.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIPeripheral stimulation of the rat forepaw or digits induces seizures\\nC_LIO_LISeizures are evoked with no direct application of convulsants, electro-stimulation or damage to the brain\\nC_LIO_LISeizures are focal at onset, then spread beyond the spatial representation of the digit or forepaw\\nC_LIO_LISeizures persist following the cessation of the stimulus\\nC_LIO_LIProposed animal model may support the study of reflex seizures and improving therapeutic interventions\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Germination of seeds during the transportation or after prolonged storage naturally and inevitably decreases because of ageing, but germination potential can be partially restored with seed priming treatments. A novel attempt was made to investigate the effects of combined treatments and to optimize the conditions for naturally aged seeds of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and Russian wild rye (Psathyrostachys juncea (Fisch.) Nevski) using an orthogonal activity level experimental design [factor A: Azospirillum brasilense concentration, factor B: three seed priming treatments (H2O, MgSO4 and H2O2) and factor C: different priming times]. Multivariate regression model analysis was applied to determine the interactive effects of pairwise factors (A and C) and to optimize experimental conditions. The results showed that the mixed treatments positively affected seed germination and seedling growth. The three seed priming treatments were the dominant factors for germination promotion, whereas the bacterial concentration had the largest effect on seedling growth, especially root elongation. The combined results of all determined attributes showed that A. brasilense bio-priming with H2O2 priming constituted the optimal combination. The optimal bacterial concentration of A. brasilense and the time of seed priming were 52.3 x 106 colony forming units (CFU) mL-1 and 17.0 h, respectively. We also discussed the physiological mechanisms that could repair aged seeds: the malondialdehyde content and antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase) activities were affected.",

    "abstract": "The growing body of experimental and computational data describing how proteins interact with each other has emphasized the multiplicity of protein interactions and the complexity underlying protein surface usage and deformability. In this work, we propose new concepts and methods toward deciphering such complexity. We introduce the notion of interacting region to account for the multiple usage of a proteins surface residues by several partners and for the variability of protein interfaces coming from molecular flexibility. We predict interacting patches by crossing evolutionary, physico-chemical and geometrical properties of the protein surface with information coming from complete cross-docking (CC-D) simulations. We show that our predictions match well interacting regions and that the different sources of information are complementary. We further propose an indicator of whether a protein has a few or many partners. Our prediction strategies are implemented in the dynJET2 algorithm and assessed on a new dataset of 262 protein on which we performed CC-D. The code and the data are available at: http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/dynJET2/.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe multiplicity and versatility of protein interactions make protein surfaces complex biological objects. For instance, a protein may interact with several partners at different moments via the same region at its surface, or it may use several regions, with different shapes and evolutionary origins, to establish different types of interactions. In addition, interfaces can re-adjust depending on environmental conditions. In this work, we introduce the notion of   interaction region\\\", in contrast to   interaction site\\\", which accounts for the interface variability coming from molecular flexibility and for the multiple usage of the protein surface by several partners. Moreover, we use four biologically meaningful descriptors to delineate protein surface patches. Three of them, namely evolutionary conservation, physico-chemical composition and local geometry, are computed for a given protein, without any knowledge on its potential partners. The fourth property is inferred from the behavior of the protein with respect to other proteins, partners or not, in docking simulations. We show that predicted patches match well with known interacting regions, that the four descriptors are complementary and that they enable capturing most of the signal relevant to protein interactions. We further exploit the way patches are grown to precisely localize interaction regions, and to estimate whether a protein have a few or many partners.",

Several mechanisms, including epigenetics, could be related with the cardiovascular phenotype on protein-restricted offspring. Thus, we investigated the morphological cardiac effects of gestational protein restriction and left ventricle miRNAs and target genes expression pattern in both 12-day and 16-week old gestational protein-restricted male offspring.\\n\\nMETHODSPregnant Wistar rats were allocated into two groups, according to protein supply during pregnancy: NP (normal protein diet-17%) or LP (low protein diet - 6%). The study evaluates the effects of maternal protein restriction on food consumption and body weight of both pregnant dams and offspring, systolic blood pressure in 16-wk old offspring and on cardiac morphometric and molecular parameters in both 12-d and 16-wk old offspring.\\n\\nRESULTSDams on the gestational protein-restricted diet had lower body weight gain and higher food intake. Gestational protein-restricted offspring had low birth weight, followed by rapidly body weight recovery, hypertension, and increased myocytes crosssectional area and collagen fraction at 16-week old age.

    "abstract": "TEN1 protein is a key component of CST complex, implicated in maintaining the telomere homeostasis, and provide stability to the eukaryotic genome. Mutations in TEN1 gene have higher chances of deleterious impact; thus, interpreting the number of mutations and their consequential impact on the structure, stability and function is essentially important. Here, we have investigated the structural and functional consequences of nsSNPs in the TEN1 gene. A wide array of sequence- and structure-based computational prediction tools were employed to identify the effects of 78 nsSNPs on the structure and function of TEN1 protein and deleterious nsSNPs were identified. These deleterious or destabilizing nsSNPs are scattered throughout the structure of TEN1. However, major mutations were observed in the 1-helix (12-16) and {beta}5-strand (88-96). We further observed that mutations at C-terminal region were have higher tendency to form aggregate. In-depth structural analysis of these mutations reveals that the pathogenecity of these mutations are driven mainly through larger structural changes because of alterations in non-covalent interactions. This work provides a blue print to pinpoint the possible consequences of pathogenic mutations in the CST complex subunit TEN1.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how polypeptides can efficiently and reproducibly attain a self-entangled conformation is a compelling biophysical challenge, which might shed new light on our general knowledge of protein folding. Complex Lassos, namely self-entangled protein structures characterized by a covalent loop sealed by a cysteine bridge, represent an ideal test system in the framework of entangled folding. Indeed, as cysteine bridges form in oxidizing conditions, they can be used as on/off switches of the structure topology, to investigate the role played by the backbone entanglement in the process.\n\nIn the present work we have used molecular dynamics to simulate the folding of a complex lasso glycoprotein, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, modeling both reducing and oxidizing conditions. Together with a well-established Go-like description, we have employed the elastic folder model, a Coarse-Grained, minimalistic representation of the polypeptide chain, driven by a structure-based angular potential. The purpose of this study is to assess the kinetically optimal pathways, in relation to the formation of the native topology. To this end we have implemented an evolutionary strategy that tunes the elastic folder model potentials to maximize the folding probability within the early stages of the dynamics. The resulting protein model is capable of folding with high success rate, avoiding the kinetic traps that hamper the efficient folding in the other tested models. Employing specifically designed topological descriptors, we could observe that the selected folding routes avoid the topological bottleneck by locking the cysteine bridge after the topology is formed.\n\nThese results provide valuable insights on the selection of mechanisms in self-entangled protein folding while, at the same time, the proposed methodology can complement the usage of established minimalistic models, and draw useful guidelines for more detailed simulations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGhana started its national programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 2000, with mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole as main strategy. We review the progress towards elimination that was made by 2016 for all endemic districts of Ghana and analyze mf prevalence from sentinel and spot-check sites in endemic districts.\\n\\nMethodsWe reviewed district level data on the history of MDA and outcomes of transmission assessment surveys (TAS). We further collated and analyzed microfilaria (mf) prevalence data from sentinel and spot-check sites.\\n\\nResultsMDA was initiated in 2001-2006 in all 98 endemic districts; by the end of 2016, 81 had stopped MDA after passing TAS and after an average of 11 rounds of treatment (range 8 - 14 rounds). The median reported coverage for the communities was 77-80%. Mf prevalence survey data were available for 430 communities from 78/98 endemic districts. Baseline mf prevalence data were available for 53 communities, with an average mf prevalence of 8.7% (0 - 45.7%). Repeated measurements were available for 78 communities, showing a steep decrease in mean mf prevalence in the first few years of MDA, followed by a gradual further decline. In the 2013 and 2014 surveys, 7 and 10 communities respectively were identified with mf prevalence still above 1% (maximum 5.6%). Two stopped MDA in 2015 and 2016 respectively, while the rest of the 15 communities above threshold are all within 13/17 districts where MDA is still ongoing.\\n\\nConclusionsThe MDA programme of the Ghana Health Services has reduced mf prevalence in sentinel sites below the 1% threshold in 81/98 endemic districts in Ghana, yet 15 communities within 13 districts (MDA ongoing) had higher prevalence than this threshold during the surveys in 2013 and 2014. These districts may need to intensify interventions to achieve the WHO 2020 target.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLymphatic filariasis (LF) control in Ghana has relied on ivermectin and albendazole since the year 2000 when the Ghana Filariasis Elimination Programme started. We analyzed trends in microfilaraemia prevalence during MDA, reported coverage, and transmission assessment survey using data obtained from the Ghana Health Services (GHS). The median reported treatment coverage varied between 77-80% over the years. Our results show that the treatment in Ghana made a significant impact in reducing infections <1% in majority of sentinel sites in endemic districts (81/98) by 2016. In the remaining 17 districts, extra efforts may be needed to achieve the same goal. Some of the challenges could be low coverage in some communities, high baseline endemicity, programme logistical challenges etc. The required average rounds of MDA needed for elimination was 11, higher than that proposed by the Global Filariasis Elimination Programme. This article is relevant to LF control programmes in assessing the impact of MDA. It is important for programmes to monitor infections especially within communities where mf prevalence is still above the 1% threshold to ensure that the WHO 2020 elimination target is achieved.",

    "abstract": "GNAS is one of the most complex gene loci in the human genome and encodes multiple gene products. XLas, the extra-large isoform of alpha-subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gas), is paternally inherited. Although XLas can mimic the action of Gas, its significance remains largely unknown in humans. Here we report a patient presented with increased bone mass, hypophosphatemia, and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. His serum calcium was in the lower limit of normal range. DEXA scan revealed progressive increase in the bone density of this patient. Whole exome sequencing of this subject found a novel nonsense mutation c.424G>T (p. G142X) in the first exon of XLas, which was inherited from his father and transmitted to his daughter. This mutation was predicted to exclusively influence the expression of XLas, while may have no significant effects on other gene products of this locus. SaOS2 cells transfected with mutant XLas failed to generate cAMP under parathyroid hormone stimulation, indicating skeletal resistance to this hormone. This subject showed higher circulating SOST, DKK1 and OPG levels, while lower RANKL levels and RANKL/OPG ratio, leading to reduced bone resorption. It is speculated that this patient may belong to a very rare type of pseudohypoparathyroidism with selective skeletal resistance but normal renal tubular response to parathyroid hormone. Our findings indicate that XLas plays a critical role in bone metabolism and GNAS locus should be considered as a candidate gene for high bone mass.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGNAS has been regarded as one of the most complex gene loci and encodes multiple transcripts, including Gs, XLs, NESP55 and A/B transcripts. These isoforms share the same 2-13 exons with alternative first exons. Previously reported mutations often disrupt multiple protein-coding transcripts in addition to that encoding Gs, making it difficult to distinguish the contributions of each transcript to disease phenotypes. Here we first report a novel nonsense mutation c.424G>T (p. G142X) in the first exon of XLas in a subject presenting with high bone mass, unclosed cranial suture, and persistent hypophosphatemia, and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This is the first report of a mutation located in the first exon of XLas in humans, which was predicted to exclusively influence the expression of XLas, while may have no significant effects on other gene products of this locus. SaOS2 cells transfected with mutant XLas failed to generate cAMP under PTH stimulation, indicating skeletal resistance to this hormone. Our study suggests that XLas has an important physiological role in humans, and is involved in skeletal PTH/cAMP pathway. Our findings also indicate GNAS locus should be considered as a candidate gene for high bone mass.\\n\\nFundingThe National Natural Science Foundation of China.\\n\\nDeclaration of InterestsThe authors declare no competing interests.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are the first-line host defense where the invading Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encounters. It has been recently reported that host aerobic glycolysis was elevated post the infection by a couple of virulent mycobacterial species. However, whether this metabolic transition is required for host defense against intracellular pathogens and the underlying mechanisms remain to be further investigated. By analyzing carbon metabolism, we found that macrophages infected by M. marinum, a surrogate mycobacterial specie to Mtb, showed a strong elevation of glycolysis. Next, three glycolysis inhibitors were examined for their ability to inhibit mycobacterial proliferation inside RAW264.7, a murine macrophage-like cell line. Among them, a glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) displayed a protective effect on assisting host to resist mycobacterial infection, which was further validated in zebrafish-infection model. The phagocytosis of M. marinum was significantly decreased in macrophages pre-treated with 2-DG at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mM, at which no inhibitory effect was posed on M. marinum growth in vitro. Moreover, 2-DG pre-treatment exerted a significant protective effect on zebrafish larvae to limit the proliferation of M. marinum, and such effect was correlated to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). On the contrary, the 2-DG treatment post infection did not restrain proliferation of M. marinum in WT zebrafish, and even accelerated bacterial replication in TNF--/- zebrafish. Together, modulation of glycolysis prior to infection boosts host immunity against M. marinum infection, indicating a potential intervention strategy to control mycobacterial infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAs an intracellular pathogen, Mtb exploits multiple strategies to invade and hijack macrophages for its own advantages. Accordingly, recent investigations have shown that Mtb infection is accompanied with an alteration of host glucose metabolism. Macrophage and zebrafish infection models of M. marinum, facilitating our understanding towards mycobacterial pathogenesis, were applied in this study. We found that the pre-treatment of macrophages with a glucose analog, 2-DG, inhibited aerobic glycolysis and made host cells more inert to phagocytose the bud. In infected zebrafish larvae, bacterial load inside host pretreated with 2-DG remains at a significantly lower level compared to the untreated group. These findings imply that the modulation of host glycolysis regulates the fate of M. marinum infection, and indicate a promising metabolic target in TB intervention.",

In this study, modeling and dynamic simulation of ssDNA aptamer (P-18S2) and target (Palytoxin, PTX) were performed separately. Then, the combination mechanism of DNA and PTX were predicted, and docking results showed that PTX can combine steadily in the groove at the top of DNA model trough strong hydrogen-bonds and electrostatic interaction. Therefore, we have further truncated and optimized to P-18S2 by simulating, at the same time, we also confirmed the reliability of simulative results by experimenting. Combining with the experimental and computational results, we provide a more reasonable interpretation for the high affinity and specific binding of P-18S2 and PTX and offer the basis for aptamer development in molecular diagnostics and therapeutic application.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn order to further study the complex structure and interaction of P-18S2 and PTX, a series of molecular modeling program were designed, including modeling, traditional dynamics simulation and molecular docking. Modeling results reveal that the structure of P-18S2 is a DNA G-quadruplex. Meanwhile, the 3D structure of PTX with lowest total energy after equilibrium was selected to use for the subsequent simulations. Then, based on the DNA with G-quadruplex structure, the combination model of DNA and PTX were predicted, and docking results showed that PTX can combine steadily in the groove at the top of DNA model trough strong hydrogen-bonds and electrostatic interaction. Futhermore, we compared the affinity of 6 optimized aptamers by computer simulating to primary P-18S2 bind to PTX respectively, the results showed no significant difference. Therefore, we have further truncated and optimized to P-18S2.

    "abstract": "Exposure to loud sounds has been related to deleterious mental and systemic effects in addition to auditory maladies. Hippocampal function has been shown to be affected to either high intensity sound exposure or long-term sound deprivation. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is inhibited after 10 days of daily exposure to 2 minutes of high-intensity noise (110 dB), in the hippocampi of Wistar rats. He we investigate how the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission mediated by ionotropic receptors is affected by the same protocol of high intensity sound exposure. We found that while the glutamatergic transmission both by AMPA/kainite and NMDA receptors in the Schaffer-CA1 synapses is largely unaffected by long-term exposure to high intensity sound, the amplitude of the inhibitory GABAergic currents is potentiated, but not the frequency of the both spontaneous and miniature currents. We conclude that GABAergic transmission is potentiated at the post-synaptic level in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after a prolonged exposure to short periods of high-intensity sound. This effect could be an important factor for the reduced LTP in the hippocampi of these animals after high intensity sound exposure, and demonstrated that prolonged exposure to high- intensity sound can affect hippocampal inhibitory transmission and consequently its function.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new mathematical model to infer capillary leakage coefficients from dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI data. To this end, we derive an embedded mixed-dimension flow and transport model for brain tissue perfusion on a sub-voxel scale. This model is used to obtain the contrast agent concentration distribution in a single MRI voxel during a perfusion MRI sequence. We further present a magnetic resonance signal model for the considered sequence including a model for local susceptibility effects. This allows modeling MR signal-time curves that can be compared to clinical MRI data. The proposed model can be used as a forward model in the inverse modeling problem of inferring model parameters such as the diffusive capillary wall conductivity. Acute multiple sclerosis lesions are associated with a breach in the integrity of the blood brain barrier. Applying the model to perfusion MR data of a patient with acute multiple sclerosis lesions, we conclude that diffusive capillary wall conductivity is a good indicator for characterizing activity of lesions, even if other patient-specific model parameters are not well-known.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe use of advanced brain imaging techniques has supported in-vivo research targeted to the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. We propose a new type of post-processing for raw image data using contrast agent perfusion simulations on the data-poor capillary scale. Combining modern simulation techniques with the clinical image data allows us to determine patient-specific and pathologically relevant parameters such as the capillary wall conductivity. The presented simulation model is a step towards the quantification of contrast agent leakage in the brain, which is typical for acute multiple sclerosis lesions, but also occurs with other diseases affecting the blood-brain-barrier, such as cerebral gliomas.",

Standard treatment for BU lesions consists of a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin for 8 weeks. However, clinical management of advanced stages of the disease often requires extensive surgical resection of the infected tissue. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative strategies for the treatment of BU. In that sense, we tested the efficacy of Lysin B (Lys B), a phage encoded lipolytic enzyme that degrades the mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex present in the mycobacterial cell wall. In this study, we show that Lys B not only displays lytic activity against M. ulcerans isolates in vitro, but also leads to a reduction in bacterial burdens in M. ulcerans-infected mouse footpads. These findings highlight the potential use of lysins as a novel therapeutic approach against this neglected tropical disease.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod-borne viruses represent a significant public health threat worldwide yet there are few antiviral therapies or prophylaxis targeting these pathogens. In particular, the development of novel antivirals for high-risk populations such as pregnant women is essential to prevent devastating disease such as that which was experienced with the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas. One potential avenue to identify new and pregnancy friendly antiviral compounds is to repurpose well-known and widely used FDA approved drugs. In this study, we addressed the antiviral role of atovaquone, a FDA Pregnancy Category C drug and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor used for the prevention and treatment of parasitic infections. We found that atovaquone was able to inhibit ZIKV and chikungunya virus virion production in human cells and that this antiviral effect occurred early during infection at the initial steps of viral RNA replication. Moreover, we were able to complement viral replication and virion production with the addition of exogenous pyrimidine nucleosides indicating that atovaquone is functioning through the inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway to inhibit viral replication. Finally, using an ex vivo human placental tissue model, we found that atovaquone could limit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner providing evidence that atovaquone may function as an antiviral in humans. Taken together, these studies suggest that atovaquone could be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug and a potential attractive candidate for the prophylaxis or treatment of arbovirus infection in vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe ability to protect vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children from Zika virus and other arbovirus infections is essential to preventing the devastating complications induced by these viruses. One class of antiviral therapies may lie in known pregnancy-friendly drugs that have the potential to mitigate arbovirus infections and disease yet this has not been explored in detail. In this study, we show that the common antiparasitic drug, atovaquone, inhibits arbovirus replication through intracellular nucleotide depletion and can impair ZIKV infection in an ex vivo human placental explant model. Our study provides a novel function for atovaquone and highlights that the rediscovery of pregnancy-acceptable drugs with potential antiviral effects can be the key to better addressing the immediate need for treating viral infections and preventing potential birth complications and future disease.",

Single-cell analysis of genome architecture has been achieved using imaging and chromatin conformation capture methods such as Hi-C. To study variation in chromosome structure between different cell types, computational approaches are needed that can utilize sparse and heterogeneous single-cell Hi-C data. However, few methods exist that are able to accurately and efficiently cluster such data into constituent cell types. Here, we describe HiCluster, a single-cell clustering algorithm for Hi-C contact matrices that is based on imputations using linear convolution and random walk. Using both simulated and real data as benchmarks, HiCluster significantly improves clustering accuracy when applied to low coverage Hi-C datasets compared to existing methods. After imputation by HiCluster, structures similar to topologically associating domains (TADs) could be identified within single cells, and their consensus boundaries among cells were enriched at the TAD boundaries observed in bulk samples.

    "abstract": "IntroductionBecause of the nature of the work, healthcare providers are prone to develop different musculoskeletal problems including low back pain and hospital healthcare workers are groups of healthcare workers who suffered a lot from it. The incidence varies between countries and professions. The situation is somewhat worsen among the frontline healthcare provider in many healthcare facilities. Nurses in Africa are arguably the most important frontline health care workers available in most African healthcare facilities, performing a broad range of tasks and working in settings where no other health workers, including physicians, are available. This situation is considerably important in the causation of work load. Nursing is listed among the highly risky profession for the development of low back pain and has been ranked with in the top tenth professions which have a great risk of having susceptible to low back pain.\\n\\nObjectiveThe aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to ascertain whether LBP is of a significant concern among nurses in African healthcare facilities.\\n\\nMethodsA comprehensive literature search of different data bases with no date limit was conducted from September to November 2018 using the PRISMA guideline. The quality of the included studies were assessed using a 12-item rating system. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed. Cochrans Q and the I2 test were used to assess heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias was evaluated by using Eggers test and visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots.\\n\\nResultDuring the period 2000-2018, nineteen studies with a sample size of 6110 have been carried out. Among them, the lowest and the highest prevalence were found to be 44.1% and 82.7%. Both the highest and the lowest prevalence of low back pain were reported from a studies done in Nigeria. The estimation of the prevalence rate of low back pain among nurses using the random effects model was found to be 64.07% (95% CI: 58.68-69.46; P-value < 0.0001). Heterogeneity of the reviewed studies was I2 = 94.2% and heterogeneity Chi-squared = 310.06 (d.f = 18), P-value < 0.0001. The subgroup analyses showed that the highest prevalence of LBP among nurses was from west African region with prevalence rates of 68.46% (95% CI: 54.94-81.97; P-value <0.0001) and followed by north Africa region with prevalence rate of 67.95% (95% CI: 55.96-79.94; P value <0.0001) had the higher prevalence of LBP as compared to their south African counterparts, 59% (95% CI: 51-66.9; P-value <0.0001).\\n\\nConclusionEven though the overall prevalence of the present study is lower when compared to the western and Asian studies, it indicated that the prevalence of low back pain among nurses is on the move.",

    "abstract": "Late bilinguals often report less emotional involvement in their second language, a phenomenon called reduced emotional resonance in L2. The present study measured pupil dilation in response to high- versus low-arousing words (e.g., riot vs. swamp) in German-English and Finnish-English late bilinguals, both in their first and in their second language. A third sample of English monolingual speakers (tested only in English) served as a control group. To improve on previous research, we controlled for lexical confounds such as length, frequency, emotional valence, and abstractness - both within and across languages. Results showed no appreciable differences in post-trial word recognition judgements (98% recognition on average), but reliably stronger pupillary effects of the arousal manipulation when stimuli were presented in participants first rather than second language. This supports the notion of reduced emotional resonance in L2. Our findings are unlikely to be due to differences in stimulus-specific control variables or to potential word-recognition difficulties in participants second language. Linguistic relatedness between first and second language (German-English vs. Finnish-English) was also not found to have a modulating influence.",

GEMs have been successfully used in different research areas, ranging from systems medicine to biotechnology. However, the different naming conventions (namespaces) of databases used to build GEMs limit model reusability and prevent the integration of existing models. This problem is known in the GEM community but its extent has not been analyzed in depth. In this study, we investigate the name ambiguity and the multiplicity of non-systematic identifiers and we highlight the (in)consistency in their use in eleven biochemical databases of biochemical reactions and the problems that arise when mapping between different namespaces and databases. We found that such inconsistencies can be as high as 83.1%, thus emphasizing the need for strategies to deal with these issues. Currently, manual verification of the mappings appears to be the only solution to remove inconsistencies when combining models. Finally, we discuss several possible approaches to facilitate (future) unambiguous mapping.",

Although the idea of producing biogas and bioethanol from lignocellulosic material is not new, there are currently few regional-level comparisons of the bioenergy potential of high-diversity grasslands that would establish whether this could be a competitive bioenergy feedstock for farmers. Comparing the chemical composition and biogas yields of biomass samples from 13 grasslands in England and 73 other bioenergy feedstocks reveals that the lignin content of biomass from grasslands managed for conservation was up to 50% less than other bioenergy crops. Grasslands managed for conservation yielded up to 160% more biogas per ton dry matter than cereals or crop waste and only slightly less than Miscanthus. GIS modeling of the estimated biogas yields of grasslands managed for conservation and fields currently sown with Miscanthus show that grasslands are larger (20.57 ha) than Miscanthus fields (5.95 ha) and are projected to produce up to 117% more biogas per average field. Future incorporation of high-diversity grasslands into local and nation-wide energy plans may help reduce global fossil-fuel use in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "Decisions we face in real life are inherently risky and can result in one of many possible outcomes. However, most of what we know about choice under risk is based on studies that use options with only two possible outcomes (simple gambles), so it remains unclear how the brain constructs reward values for more complex risky options faced in real life. To address this question, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to examine choice between pairs of simple gambles and pairs of three-outcome gambles in male and female human subjects. We found that subjects evaluated individual outcomes of three-outcome gambles by multiplying functions of reward magnitude and probability. To construct the overall value of each gamble, however, most subjects differentially weighted possible outcomes based on either reward magnitude or probability. These results reveal a novel dissociation between how reward information is processed when evaluating complex gambles: valuation of each outcome is based on an integrated value whereas combination of possible outcomes relies on a single piece of reward information. We show that differential weighting of possible outcomes enabled subjects to make decisions more easily and quickly. Together, these findings reveal a plausible mechanism for how salience, in terms of possible reward magnitude or probability, can influence the construction of subjective values for complex gambles. They also point to separable neural mechanisms for how reward value controls choice and attention in order to allow for more adaptive decision making.",

    "abstract": "The Cort-Fitness hypothesis has generated much interest from investigators integrating field endocrinology with evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation. The hypothesis was developed on the assumption that if glucocorticoid levels increase with environmental challenges and fitness decreases with environmental challenges, then there should be a negative relationship between glucocorticoid levels and fitness. However, studies across diverse taxa have found that the relationship between glucocorticoid levels and fitness is not consistent: some studies show a positive relationship, others negative, and some show no correlation. Hence, support for the hypothesis is not consistent and thus a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between glucocorticoid levels, environmental pressures, and fitness is needed. We propose a mathematical model representing the links between glucocorticoid levels, environmental challenges, and fitness. Our model explores how variation in the predictability and intensity of environmental challenges, reproductive strategies, and fitness metrics can all contribute to the variability observed in empirical tests of the Cort-Fitness hypothesis.

    "abstract": "BRG1 is one of two mutually exclusive ATPases that function as the catalytic subunit of human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes. BRG1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in some cancer types but has been shown to be expressed at elevated levels, relative to normal tissue, in other cancers. Using the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) prostate cancer database, we determined that BRG1 mRNA and protein expression is elevated in prostate tumors relative to normal prostate tissue. Only 3 of 491 (0.6%) sequenced tumors showed amplification of the locus or mutation in the protein coding sequence, arguing against the idea that elevated expression due to amplification or expression of a mutant BRG1 protein is associated with prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that BRG1 expression in prostate tumors inversely correlated with survival. However, BRG1 expression did not correlate with Gleason score/ISUP Grade Group, indicating it is an independent predictor of tumor progression/patient outcome. To experimentally assess BRG1 as a possible therapeutic target, we treated prostate cancer cells with a biologic inhibitor called ADAADi that targets the activity of the SNF2 family of ATPases in biochemical assays but showed specificity for BRG1 in prior tissue culture experiments. The inhibitor decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. When directly injected into xenografts established by injection of prostate cancer cells in mouse flanks, the inhibitor decreased tumor growth and increased survival. These results indicate the efficacy of pursuing BRG1 as both an indicator of patient outcome and as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPHDeciphering principles of inter-individual tumor heterogeneity is essential for refinement of personalized anti-cancer therapy. Unlike cancers of adulthood, pediatric malignancies including Ewing sarcoma (EwS) feature a striking paucity of somatic alterations except for pathognomonic driver-mutations that cannot explain overt variations in clinical outcome.\\n\\nHere we demonstrate in the EwS model how cooperation of a dominant oncogene and regulatory variants determine tumor growth, patient survival and drug response.\\n\\nWe show that binding of the oncogenic EWSR1-FLI1 fusion transcription factor to a polymorphic enhancer-like DNA element controls expression of the transcription factor MYBL2, whose high expression promotes poor patient outcome via activation of pro-proliferative signatures. Analysis of paired germline and tumor whole-genome sequencing data revealed that regulatory variability at this locus is inherited via the germline. CRISPR-mediated interference with this regulatory element almost abolished MYBL2 transcription, and MYBL2 knockdown decreased cell proliferation, cell survival and tumorigenicity of EwS cells. Combined RNA- and ChIP-seq analyses as well as functional experiments and clinical data identified CCNF, BIRC5 and AURKB as direct MYBL2 targets and critical mediators of its phenotype. In drug-response experiments, high MYBL2 levels sensitized EwS cells for inhibition of its activating cyclin dependent kinase CDK2 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting MYBL2 as a predictive biomarker for targeted anti-CDK2-therapy.\\n\\nCollectively, our findings establish cooperation of somatic mutations and regulatory germline variants as a major determinant of tumor progression and indicate the importance of integrating the regulatory genome in the process of developing new diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies to fully harness the potential of precision medicine.",

They are widely used as a non-human primate model for biomedical studies, and the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) at Texas Biomedical Research Institute has maintained a large captive baboon colony for more than 50 years. Unlike other model organisms though, the genomic resources for baboons are severely lacking. This has hindered the progress of studies using baboons as a model for basic biology or human disease. Here, we describe a dataset of 100 high-coverage whole-genome sequences obtained from the mixed colony of olive (P. anubis) and yellow (P. cynocephalus) baboons housed at the SNPRC. These data provide a comprehensive catalog of common genetic variation in baboons, as well as a fine-scale genetic map. We show how the data can be used to learn about ancestry and admixture, and to correct errors in the colony records. Finally, we investigated the consequences of inbreeding within the SNPRC colony and found clear evidence for increased rates of juvenile mortality and increased homozygosity of putatively deleterious alleles in inbred individuals.",

Yet polar species are often morphologically indistinguishable from temperate species, although clearly separated by molecular features. Here we examine four Mamiellophyceae strains from the Canadian Arctic. The 18S rRNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) gene phylogeny place these strains within the family Mamiellaceae (Mamiellales, Mamiellophyceae) in two separate clades of the genus Mantoniella. ITS2 synapomorphies support their placement as two new species, Mantoniella beaufortii and Mantoniella baffinensis. Both species have round green cells with diameter between 3-5 m, one long flagellum and a short reduced flagellum (~1 m) and are covered by spiderweb-like scales, making both species similar to other Mantoniella species. Morphologically, M. beaufortii and M. baffinensis are most similar to the cosmopolitan M. squamata with only minor differences in scale structure distinguishing them. Screening of global marine metabarcoding datasets indicates M. beaufortii has only been recorded in seawater and sea ice samples from the Arctic while no environmental barcode matches M. baffinensis. Like other Mamiellophyceae genera that have distinct polar and temperate species, the polar distribution of these new species suggests they are cold or ice-adapted Mantoniella species.",

PLZF displays an epigenetic specificity by recruiting chromatin-modifying factors but little is known about its role in remodeling chromatin of cells committed towards a given specific hematopoietic lineage. In murine myeloid progenitors, we decipher a new role for PLZF in restraining active genes and enhancers by targeting acetylated lysine 27 of Histone H3 (H3K27ac). Functional analyses reveal that active enhancers bound by PLZF are involved in biological processes related to metabolism and associated with hematopoietic aging. Comparing the epigenome of young and old myeloid progenitors, we reveal that H3K27ac variation at active enhancers is a hallmark of hematopoietic aging. Taken together, these data suggest that PLZF, associated with active enhancers, appears to restrain their activity as an epigenetic gatekeeper of hematopoietic aging.",

    "abstract": "People prefer to move in energetically optimal ways during walking. We have recently found that this preference arises not just through evolution and development, but that the nervous system will continuously optimize step frequency in response to new energetic cost landscapes. Here we test whether energy optimization is also a major objective in the nervous system   s real-time control of step width. To accomplish this, we use a device that can reshape the relationship between step width and energetic cost, shifting the energy optimal width wider than that initially preferred. We find that the nervous system doesn   t spontaneously initiate energy optimization, but instead requires experience with a lower energetic cost step width. After initiating optimization, people converge towards their new energy optimal width within hundreds of steps and update this as their new preferred width, rapidly returning to it when perturbed away. However, energy optimization was incomplete as this new preferred width was slightly narrower than the energetically optimal width. This suggests that the nervous system may determine its preferred width by optimizing energy simultaneously with other objectives such as stability or maneuverability. Collectively, these findings indicate that the nervous systems of able-bodied people continuously optimize energetic cost to determine preferred step width.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) has resisted molecular identification for decades. The original model of the MPTP had the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) as the inner membrane pore-forming component. Indeed, reconstitution experiments showed that recombinant or purified ANT generates MPTP-like pores in lipid bilayers. This model was challenged when mitochondria from Ant1/2 double null mouse liver still showed MPTP activity. Because mice contain and express 3 Ant genes, here we reinvestigated the genetic basis for the ANTs as comprising the MPTP. Liver mitochondria from Ant1, Ant2, and Ant4 deficient mice were highly refractory to Ca2+-induced MPT, and when also given cyclosporine A, MPT was completely inhibited. Moreover, liver mitochondria from mice with quadruple deletion of Ant1, Ant2, Ant4 and Ppif (cyclophilin D, target of CsA) lacked Ca2+-induced MPT. Finally, inner membrane patch clamping in mitochondria from Ant1, Ant2 and Ant4 triple null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed a loss of MPT-like pores. Our findings suggest a new model of MPT consisting of two distinct molecular components, one of which is the ANTs and the other of which is unknown but requires CypD.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryGenetic deletion of Ant1/2/4 and Ppif in mice fully inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore",

    "abstract": "Cellular ability to maintain proper protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is essential for survival upon protein-damaging conditions. Heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2) is one of the human HSFs activated in response to proteotoxic stress. HSF2 is dispensable for cell survival during acute heat stress, but its amount and DNA-binding activity increase under prolonged proteotoxic stress conditions, such as proteasome inhibition. Nevertheless, the specific role(s) of HSF2 and the global HSF2-dependent gene expression profile during sustained stress have remained elusive. We found that HSF2 is required for cell survival during prolonged proteotoxicity, as shown by treating wild-type and HSF2-deficient human osteosarcoma U2OS cells with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib. Strikingly, our RNA-seq analyses revealed that HSF2 disruption leads to marked downregulation of cadherin superfamily genes and subsequent functional impairment of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. We propose HSF2 as a key regulator of genes belonging to the cadherin superfamily. We also demonstrate that HSF2-dependent downregulation of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion predisposes U2OS cells to Bortezomib-induced proteotoxic stress. In conclusion, we show that by maintaining cell-cell adhesion HSF2 is essential for cell survival and thereby we describe a novel regime in the HSF-mediated protection against stress-induced protein damage.",

    "abstract": "The development of methods to quantify hormones from non-invasively collected samples such as urine or feces has facilitated endocrinology research on wild-living animals. To ensure that hormone measurements are biologically meaningful, method validations are highly recommended for each new species or sample matrix. Our aim was to validate three commonly used enzyme immunoassays (EIA), one for analysis of cortisol and two for analysis of testosterone, to assess adrenocortical and gonadal activity, respectively, from the urine of male Barbary macaques. We compared EIA and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) results to determine if the EIA measurements truly reflect levels of the target hormone and to determine if cross-reactivities with other steroids were potentially confounding results. Furthermore, we conducted a biological validation of testosterone to ensure that both EIA and LC-MS were able to capture physiologically meaningful differences in hormone levels. We found that cortisol measured by EIA correlated strongly with cortisol measured by LC-MS in both adult and immature males, without the need for deconjugation of steroids in the urine. Both testosterone EIAs correlated strongly with LC-MS in adult males, but only if steroids in the urine were deconjugated by enzymatic hydrolysis prior to analysis. However, in immature males, EIA and LC-MS results did not correlate significantly. Further correlation analyses suggest this is likely due to cross-reactivity of the testosterone antibody with other adrenal steroids such as cortisol, DHEA, and likely others, which are present at much higher concentrations relative to testosterone in immature males. Testosterone levels were significantly higher in adult compared to immature males as measured by LC-MS but not as measured by EIA. Taken together, our results suggest that the testosterone EIAs are suitable to assess gonadal activity in adult but not immature males, and only if a hydrolysis of the urine is conducted prior to analysis.",

Most devices have been designed to study the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana at higher throughput than conventional methods. However, there is a need for microfluidic devices which enable in vivo studies of root development and root-microbe interactions in woody plants. Here, we developed the RMI-chip, a simple microfluidic setup in which Populus tremuloides (aspen tree) seedlings can grow for over a month, allowing continuous microscopic observation of interactions between live roots and rhizobacteria. We find that the colonization of growing aspen roots by Pseudomonas fluorescens in the RMI-chip involves dynamic biofilm formation and dispersal, in keeping with previous observations in a different experimental set-up. Also, we find that whole-cell biosensors based on the rhizobacterium Bacillus subtilis can be used to monitor compositional changes in the rhizosphere but that the application of these biosensors is limited by their efficiency at colonizing aspen roots and persisting. These results indicate that functional imaging of dynamic root-bacteria interactions in the RMI-chip requires careful matching between the host plant and the bacterial root colonizer.",

    "abstract": "The neural crest, which has been referred to as the fourth germ layer, comprises a multipotent cell population which will specify diverse cells and tissues, including craniofacial cartilage and bones, melanocytes, the adrenal medulla and the peripheral nervous system. These cell fates are known to be determined by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) acting at various stages of neural crest development, such as induction, specification, and migration. Although transcription factor hierarchies and some of their interplay with morphogenetic signalling pathways have been characterised, the full complexity of activities required for regulated development remains uncharted. Deregulation of these pathways may contribute to tumourigenesis, as in the case of neuroblastoma, a frequently lethal embryonic cancer thought to arise from the sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest.\\n\\nIn this conceptual analysis, we utilise next generation sequencing data from neuroblastoma cells and tumours to evaluate the possible influences of Wnt signalling on neural crest GRNs and on neuroblastoma cell lineages. We provide evidence that Wnt signalling is a major determinant of regulatory networks that underlie mesenchymal/NCC-like cell identities through PRRX1 and YAP/TAZ transcription factors. Furthermore, Wnt may also co-operate with Hedgehog signalling in driving proneural differentiation programmes along the adrenergic lineage. We propose that elucidation of Signalling Regulatory Networks can augment and complement GRNs in characterising cell identities, which will in turn contribute to the design of improved therapeutics tailored to primary and relapsing neuroblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular basis of cell function and ultimate phenotypes is crucial for the development of biological markers. With this aim, several RNA-seq studies have been devoted to characterize the transcriptome of ejaculated spermatozoa in relation to sperm quality and fertility. Semen quality follows a seasonal pattern and decays in the summer months in several animal species. The aim of this study was to deeply profile the transcriptome of the boar sperm and to evaluate its seasonal changes. We sequenced the total and the short fractions of the sperm RNA from 10 Pietrain boars, 5 collected in summer and 5 five sampled in winter, and identified a complex and rich transcriptome with 4,436 coding genes of moderate to high abundance. Transcript fragmentation was high but less obvious in genes related to spermatogenesis, chromatin compaction and fertility. Short non-coding RNAs mostly included piwi-interacting RNAs, transfer RNAs and micro-RNAs. We also compared the transcriptome of the summer and the winter ejaculates and identified 34 coding genes and 7 micro-RNAs with a significantly distinct distribution. These genes were mostly related to oxidative stress, DNA damage and autophagy. This is the deepest characterization of the boar sperm transcriptome and the first study linking the transcriptome and the seasonal variability of semen quality in animals. The annotation described here can be used as a reference for the identification of markers of sperm quality in pigs.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes requires continuous communication and a high level of compatibility between them, so that alterations in one genetic compartment need adjustments in the other. The co-evolution of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes has been poorly studied, even though the consequences and effects of this interaction are highly relevant for human health, as well as for crop improvement programs and for genetic engineering. The mitochondria of plants represent an excellent system to understand the mechanisms of genomic rearrangements, chimeric gene formation, incompatibility between nucleus and cytoplasm, and horizontal gene transfer. We carried out detailed analyses of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of a repeated cybrid between the solanaceae Nicotiana tabacum and Hyoscyamus niger. The mtDNA of the cybrid was intermediate between the size of parental mtDNAs and the sum of them. Noticeably, most of the homologous sequences inherited from both parents were lost. In contrast, the majority of the sequences exclusive of a single parent were maintained. The mitochondrial gene content included a majority of N. tabacum derived genes, but also chimeric, two-parent derived, and H. niger-derived genes in a tobacco nuclear background. Any of these alterations in the gene content could be the cause of CMS in the cybrid. The parental mtDNAs interacted through 28 homologous recombination events and a single case of illegitimate recombination. Three main homologous recombination mechanisms were recognized in the cybrid mitochondria. Break induced replication (BIR) pathway was the most frequent. We propose that BIR could be one of the mechanisms responsible for the loss of the majority of the repeated regions derived from H. niger.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decision making is influenced by reward expected from alternative options or actions, but the underlying neural mechanisms are currently unknown. More specifically, it is debated whether reward effects are mediated through changes in sensory processing and/or later stages of decision making. To address this question, we conducted two experiments in which human subjects made saccades to what they perceived to be the first or second of two visually identical but asynchronously presented targets, while we manipulated expected reward from correct and incorrect responses on each trial. We found that unequal reward caused similar shifts in target selection (reward bias) between the two experiments. Moreover, observed reward biases were independent of the individuals sensitivity to sensory signals. These findings suggest that the observed reward effects were determined heuristically via modulation of decision-making processes instead of sensory processing and thus, are more compatible with response bias rather than perceptual bias. To further explain our findings and uncover plausible neural mechanisms, we simulated our experiments with a cortical network model and tested alternative mechanisms for how reward could exert its influence. We found that our observations are more compatible with reward-dependent input to the output layer of the decision circuit. Together, our results suggest that during a temporal judgment task, the influence of reward information on perceptual choice is more compatible with changing later stages of decision making rather than early sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is described as a disease in which complex psychopathology together with cognitive and behavioral impairments are related to widely disrupted brain circuitry causing a failure in coordinating information across multiple brain sites. This led to the hypothesis of schizophrenia as a network disease e.g. in the cognitive dysmetria model and the dysconnectivity theory. Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding localized mechanisms, namely dysfunction of certain networks underlying the multifaceted symptomatology.\\n\\nIn this study, we investigated potential functional disruptions in 35 schizophrenic patients and 41controls using complex cerebral network analysis, namely network-based statistic (NBS) and graph theory in resting state fMRI. NBS can reveal locally impaired subnetworks whereas graph analysis characterizes whole brain network topology.\\n\\nUsing NBS we observed a local hyperconnected thalamo-cortico-cerebellar subnetwork in the schizophrenia group. Furthermore, nodal graph measures retrieved from the thalamo-cortico-cerebellar subnetwork revealed that the total number of connections from/to (degree) of the thalamus is higher in patients with schizophrenia. Interestingly, graph analysis on the whole brain functional networks did not reveal group differences. Together, our results suggest that disruptions in the brain networks of schizophrenia patients are situated at the local level of the hyperconnected thalamo-cortico-cerebellar rather than globally spread in brain.\\n\\nOur results provide further evidence for the importance of the thalamus and cerebellum in schizophrenia and to the notion that schizophrenia is a network disease in line with the dysconnectivity theory and cognitive dysmetria model.",

    "abstract": "Recently deep learning methods have been applied to process biological data and greatly pushed the development of the biological research forward. However, the interpretability of the deep learning methods still needs to improve. Here for the first time, we present scCapsNet, a totally interpretable deep learning model adapted from CapsNet. The scCapsNet model retains the capsule parts of CapsNet but replaces the part of convolutional neural networks with several parallel fully connected neural networks. We apply scCapsNet to scRNA-seq data. The results show that scCapsNet performs well as a classifier and also that the parallel fully connected neural networks function like feature extractors as we supposed. The scCapsNet model provides contribution of each extracted feature to the cell type recognition. Evidences show that some extracted features are nearly orthogonal to each other. After training, through analysis of the internal weights of each neural network connected inputs and primary capsule, and with the information about the contribution of each extracted feature to the cell type recognition, the scCapsNet model could relate gene sets from inputs to cell types. The specific gene set is responsible for the identification of its corresponding cell types but does not affect the recognition of other cell types by the model. Many well-studied cell type markers are in the gene set with corresponding cell type. The internal weights of neural network for those well-studied cell type markers are different for different primary capsules. The internal weights of neural network connected to a primary capsule could be viewed as an embedding for genes, convert genes to real value low dimensional vectors. Furthermore, we mix the RNA expression data of two cells with different cell types and then use the scCapsNet model trained with non-mixed data to predict the cell types in the mixed data. Our scCapsNet model could predict cell types in a cell mixture with high accuracy.",

Our analysis shows that phenotypic plasticity and anticipatory maternal effects are sufficient to explain growth rate dynamics, but that a carryover model where epigenetic memory is imperfectly transmitted and might be reset at each generation is a better fit to the data.

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe 2015 dengue outbreak in southern Taiwan caused substantial mortality rates in the elderly. We analyzed here the causes of death among adults with dengue.\\n\\nMethodsThe retrospective study was conducted at a medical center in Tainan from the 1st of August to 31th of December in the year 2015. The detection of the dengue NS1 antigen IgM or viral RNA in patients blood were used to diagnose dengue. Clinical courses and causes of death were retrieved from chart reviews by two intensivists.\\n\\nResultsThere were 4,488 cases of dengue diagnosed in the study hospital, and these cases had an in-hospital case fatality rate of 1.34% (60 cases). Of these, the mean age was 73 years and gender did not predict outcome. Twenty-eight (46.7%) cases died of severe dengue, and 29 (48.3%) deaths were possibly caused by dengue-related complications, which were mostly secondary infections (24 cases). Most of the families of fatal case (70%) signed do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders prior to the patients death. When the dengue epidemic peaked, 13 cardiac arrest events, including out-of-hospital (5 events) and in-hospital (8) cardiac arrests at the emergency department, occurred within four weeks of the dengue epidemic. Notably, in half (7) of these cases, the patients did not search for medical aid prior to experiencing cardiac arrest. Of the 40 cases that had early death (occurring within one week after hospitalization), 60% died of severe dengue. In contrast, 50% of the 20 deaths that occurred later than one week after hospitalization were related to hospital-acquired infections, mainly pneumonia.\\n\\nConclusionThe elderly that experience dengue fever may die of severe dengue early or die of secondary infections later. Cardiac arrests can also occur unpredictably at the first aids, which highlight the need of professional and patient education regarding the danger signs that are related to severe dengue in an epidemic setting.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe 2015 dengue outbreak in Tainan City caused substantial deaths among the elderly. The main causes of death were severe dengue and its complications. We here highlight the deaths caused by heart complications of dengue that the elderly has underlying cardiovascular comorbidities is more prone to be involved. The presentations of heart complications vary, ranging from arrythmia to myocarditis and to unexpected cardiac arrest. Clinicians should carefully evaluate and monitor the heart function of patients with severe dengue and provide timing intervention. Secondary infections or healthcare-associated infections may occur throughout the whole hospitalized course. They were also the leading causes of death during the late or recovery phase of dengue in the study. Judicious application of antimicrobial agents and early elimination of infection source may be beneficial. Overall, the substantial deaths during this outbreak may be related to low public awareness of dengue, emergency department overclouding, and lack of clinical experience. Professional and public education regarding the danger signs that are related to severe dengue is necessary in an epidemic setting.",

    "abstract": "Grid cells constitute a crucial component of the \\\"GPS\\\" in the mammalian brain. Recent experiments revealed that grid cell activity is anchored to environmental boundaries. More specifically, these results revealed a slight yet consistent offset of 8 degrees relative to boundaries of a square environment. The causes and possible functional roles of this orientation are still unclear. Here we propose that this phenomenon maximizes the spatial information conveyed by grid cells. Computer simulations of the grid cell network reveal that the universal grid orientation at 8 degrees optimizes spatial coding specifically in the presence of noise. Our model also predicts the minimum number of grid cells in each module. In addition, analytical results and a dynamical reinforcement learning model reveal the mechanism underlying the noise-induced orientation preference at 8 degrees. Together, these results suggest that the experimentally observed common orientation of grid cells serves to maximize spatial information in the presence of noise.\\n\\nAuthor summarySpatial navigation depends on several specialized cell types including place and grid cells. Grid cells have multiple firing fields that are arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern. The axes of this pattern are anchored to environmental boundaries at a universal angle of 8{degrees}. Here, we combine computer simulations of the grid cell network with analytical derivations and a reinforcement learning model to explain the functional relevance of this universal grid cell orientation. We show that spatial information provided by grid cells is maximized at the experimentally observed grid orientation within a broad parameter range. This relationship occurs only in the presence of noise. The model allows for several experimentally testable predictions including the number of grid cells.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifiers have emerged as important regulators of tumor progression. We identified histone methyltransferase KMT2D as a potent tumor-suppressor through an in vivo epigenome-focused pooled RNAi screen in melanoma. KMT2D harbors frequent somatic point mutations in multiple tumor types. How these events contribute to tumorigenesis and whether they impart therapeutic vulnerability are poorly understood. To address these questions, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma based on conditional and melanocyte-specific deletion of KMT2D. We demonstrate KMT2D as a bona fide tumor suppressor which cooperates with activated BRAF. KMT2D-deficient tumors showed substantial reprogramming of key metabolic pathways including glycolysis. Glycolysis enzymes, intermediate metabolites and glucose consumption rate were aberrantly upregulated in KMT2D mutant cells. The pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis reduced proliferation and tumorigenesis preferentially in KMT2D mutant cells. Mechanistically, KMT2D loss caused drastic reduction of H3K4me1-marked active enhancer states. Loss of distal enhancer and subsequent reduction in expression of IGFBP5 activated IGF1R-AKT to increase glycolysis in KMT2D-deficient cells. We conclude that KMT2D loss promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating increased usage of glycolysis pathway for enhanced biomass needs via enhancer reprogramming. Our data imply that inhibition of glycolysis or IGFR pathway could be a potential therapeutic strategy in KMT2D mutant tumors.",

    "abstract": "In 2012, the genome of a novel rhabdovirus, Bas-Congo virus, was discovered in the acute-phase serum of a Congolese patient with presumed viral hemorrhagic fever. In the absence of a replicating virus isolate, fulfilling Kochs postulates to determine whether Bas-Congo virus is indeed a human virus and/or pathogen has been impossible. However, experiments with vesiculoviral particles pseudotyped with Bas-Congo glycoprotein suggested that Bas-Congo virus particles can enter cells from multiple animals, including humans. In 2015, genomes of two related viruses, Ekpoma virus 1 and Ekpoma virus 2, were detected in human sera in Nigeria. Isolates could not be obtained. Phylogenetic analyses led to the classification of Bas-Congo virus, Ekpoma virus 1, and Ekpoma virus 2 in the same genus, Tibrovirus, together with five biting midge-borne rhabdoviruses (i.e., Beatrice Hill virus, Bivens Arm virus, Coastal Plains virus, Sweetwater Branch virus, and Tibrogargan virus) not known to infect humans. Using individual recombinant vesiculoviruses expressing the glycoproteins of all eight known tibroviruses and more than 75 cell lines representing different animal species, we demonstrate that the glycoproteins of all tibroviruses can mediate vesiculovirus particle entry into human, bat, nonhuman primate, cotton rat, boa constrictor, and Asian tiger mosquito cells. Using four of five isolated authentic tibroviruses (i.e., Bivens Arm virus, Coastal Plains virus, Sweetwater Branch virus, and Tibrogargan virus), our experiments indicate that many cell types may be partially resistant to tibrovirus replication after virion cell entry. Consequently, experimental data solely obtained from experiments using tibrovirus surrogate systems (e.g., vesiculoviral pseudotypes, recombinant vesiculoviruses) cannot be used to predict whether Bas-Congo virus, or any other tibrovirus, infects humans.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, ocean temperature in the U.S. Northeast Continental Shelf (U.S. NES) has warmed faster than the global average and is associated with observed distribution changes of the northern stock of black sea bass (Centropristis striata). Mechanistic models based on physiological responses to environmental conditions can improve future habitat suitability projections. We measured maximum, resting metabolic rate, and hypoxia tolerance (Scrit) of the northern adult black sea bass stock to assess performance across the known temperature range of the species. A subset of individuals was held at 30{degrees}C for one month (30chronic{degrees}C) prior to experiments to test acclimation potential. Absolute aerobic scope (maximum - resting metabolic rate) reached a maximum of 367.21 mgO2 kg-1 hr-1 at 24.4{degrees}C while Scrit continued to increase in proportion to resting metabolic rate up to 30{degrees}C. The 30chronic{degrees}C group had a significant decrease in maximum metabolic rate and absolute aerobic scope but resting metabolic rate or Scrit were not affected. This suggests a decline in performance of oxygen demand processes (e.g. muscle contraction) beyond 24{degrees}C despite maintenance of oxygen supply. The Metabolic Index, calculated from Scrit as an estimate of potential aerobic scope, closely matched the measured factorial aerobic scope (maximum / resting metabolic rate) and declined with increasing temperature to a minimum below 3. This may represent a critical value for the species. Temperature in the U.S. NES is projected to increase above 24{degrees}C in the southern portion of the northern stocks range. Therefore, these black sea bass will likely continue to shift north as the ocean continues to warm.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinases play multiple roles in RNA polymerase II transcription. Cdk7/Kin28, Cdk9/Bur1, and Cdkl2/Ctk1 phosphorylate the polymerase and other factors to drive the dynamic exchange of initiation and elongation complex components over the transcription cycle. We engineered strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for rapid, specific inactivation of individual kinases by addition of a covalent inhibitor. While effective, the sensitized kinases can display some idiosyncrasies, and inhibition can be surprisingly transient. As expected, inhibition of Cdk7/Kin28 blocked phosphorylation of the Rpb1 C-terminal domain heptad repeats at Serines 5 and 7, which are known target sites, but also at Serine 2. Consistent with our previous results using gene deletions, Cdk12/Ctk1 is the predominant kinase responsible for Serine 2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the Rpb1 linker enhances binding of the Spt6 tSH2 domain, and here we show that Bur1/Cdk9 is the kinase responsible for this modification in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Layer 4 (L4) of mammalian neocortex plays a crucial role in cortical information processing, yet a complete census of its cell types and connectivity remains elusive. Using whole-cell recordings with morphological recovery, we identified one major excitatory and seven inhibitory types of neurons in L4 of adult mouse visual cortex (V1). Nearly all excitatory neurons were pyramidal and almost all Somatostatin-positive (SOM+) neurons were Martinotti cells. In contrast, in somatosensory cortex (S1), excitatory cells were mostly stellate and SOM+ cells were non-Martinotti. These morphologically distinct SOM+ interneurons correspond to different transcriptomic cell types and are differentially integrated into the local circuit with only S1 cells receiving local excitatory input. Our results challenge the classical view of a canonical microcircuit repeated through the neocortex. Instead we propose that cell-type specific circuit motifs, such as the Martinotti/pyramidal pair, are optionally used across the cortex as building blocks to assemble cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "The use of microRNAs as biomarkers has been proposed for many diseases including the diagnosis of melanoma. Although hundreds of microRNAs have been identified as differentially expressed in melanomas as compared to benign melanocytic lesions, limited consensus has been achieved across studies, constraining the effective use of these potentially useful markers. In this study we quantified microRNAs by next-generation sequencing from melanomas and their adjacent benign precursor nevi. We applied a machine learning-based pipeline to identify a microRNA signature that separated melanomas from nevi and was unaffected by confounding variables, such as patient age and tumor cell content. By employing the ratios of microRNAs that were either enriched or depleted in melanoma compared to nevi as a normalization strategy, the classifier performed similarly across multiple published microRNA datasets, obtained by microarray, small RNA sequencing, or RT-qPCR. Validation on separate cohorts of melanomas and nevi correctly classified lesions with 83% sensitivity and 71-83% specificity, independent of variation in tumor cell content of the sample or patient age.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide associations studies (GWASes) have identified many germline genetic variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. However, how these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alter biological function in a way that increases cancer risk is still largely unknown. We used a systems biology approach to analyze the regulatory role and functional associations of cancer-risk SNPs in thirteen distinct tissues. Using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we performed an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, keeping both cis- and trans-eQTLs, and representing those significant associations as edges in tissue-specific eQTL bipartite networks. We find that each network is organized into highly modular communities that group sets of SNPs together with functionally-related collections of genes. We mapped cancer-risk SNPs to each tissue-specific eQTL network. Although we find in each tissue that cancer-risk SNPs are distributed across the network, they are not uniformly distributed. Rather they are significantly over-represented in a small number of communities. This includes communities enriched for immune response processes as well as communities representing tissue-specific functions. Moreover, cancer-risk SNPs are over-represented in the central \\\"cores\\\" of communities, meaning they are more likely to influence the expression of many genes within the same community, thus affecting biological processes. And finally, we find that cancer-risk SNPs preferentially target oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, suggesting non-genic mutations may still alter the effects of these key cancer-associated genes. This bipartite eQTL network approach provides a new way of understanding genetic effects on cancer risk and provides a biological context for interpreting the results of GWAS cancer studies.",

    "abstract": "1An overarching goal of neuroscience research is to understand how heterogeneous neuronal ensembles cohere into networks of coordinated activity to support cognition. To investigate how local activity harmonizes with global signals, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) while single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) perturbed occipital and parietal cortices. We estimate the rapid network reconfigurations in dynamic network communities within specific frequency bands of the EEG, and characterize two distinct features of network reconfiguration, flexibility and allegiance, among spatially distributed neural sources following TMS. Using distance from the stimulation site to infer local and global effects, we find that alpha activity (8-12Hz) reflects concurrent local and global effects on network dynamics. Pair-wise allegiance of brain regions to communities on average increased near the stimulation site, whereas TMS-induced changes to flexibility were generally invariant to distance and stimulation site. In contrast, communities within the beta (13-20Hz) band demonstrated a high level of spatial specificity, particularly within a cluster comprising paracentral areas. Together, these results suggest that focal magnetic neurostimulation to distinct cortical sites can help identify both local and global effects on brain network dynamics, and highlight fundamental differences in the manifestation of network reconfigurations within alpha and beta frequency bands.\n\n2 Author SummaryTMS may be used to probe the causal link between local regional activity and global brain dynamics. Using simultaneous TMS-EEG and dynamic community detection, we introduce what we call \"resonating clusters\", or frequency band-specific communities in the brain, as a way to index local and global processing. These resonating clusters within the alpha and beta bands brain display both global (or integrating) behavior and local specificity, highlighting fundamental differences in the manifestation of network reconfigurations.",

    "abstract": "Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii) seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics, employing structural and dynamical information, estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial epilepsy.\\n\\nPACS numbers:\\n\\nI. AUTHOR SUMMARYEpilepsy is characterized by perturbed dynamics that originate in a local network before spreading to other brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of epilepsy patients, comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating epileptiform discharges. Applying stability analysis led to a seizure control strategy that is significantly less invasive than the traditional surgery, which typically resects the epileptogenic regions. The invasiveness of the procedure correlates with graph theoretical importance of the nodes. The novel method subsequently removes the most unstable links, a procedure possible by advent of novel surgery techniques. Our approach is entirely based on structural data, allowing creation of a brain model based on purely non-invasive data prior to any surgery.",
