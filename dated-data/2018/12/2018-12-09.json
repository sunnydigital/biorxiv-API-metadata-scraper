    "abstract": "DNA replication occurs in a defined temporal order known as the replication-timing (RT) program and is regulated during development, coordinated with 3D genome organization and transcriptional activity. However, transcription and RT are not sufficiently coordinated to predict each other, suggesting an indirect relationship. Here, we exploit genome-wide RT profiles from 15 human cell types and intermediate differentiation stages derived from human embryonic stem cells to construct different types of RT regulatory networks. First, we constructed networks based on the coordinated RT changes during cell fate commitment to create highly complex RT networks composed of thousands of interactions that form specific functional sub-network communities. We also constructed directional regulatory networks based on the order of RT changes within cell lineages and identified master regulators of differentiation pathways. Finally, we explored relationships between RT networks and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), by combining them into more complex circuitries of composite and bipartite networks, revealing novel trans interactions between transcription factors and downstream RT changes that were validated with ChIP-seq data. Our findings suggest a regulatory link between the establishment of cell type specific TRNs and RT control during lineage specification.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWModeling discrete phenotypic traits for either ancestral character state reconstruction or morphology-based phylogenetic inference suffers from ambiguities of character coding, homology assessment, dependencies, and selection of adequate models. These drawbacks occur because trait evolution is driven by two key processes - hierarchical and hidden - which are not accommodated simultaneously by the available phylogenetic methods. The hierarchical process refers to the dependencies between anatomical body parts, while the hidden process refers to the evolution of gene regulatory networks underlying trait development. Herein, I demonstrate that these processes can be efficiently modeled using structured Markov models equipped with hidden states, which resolves the majority of the problems associated with discrete traits. Integration of structured Markov models with anatomy ontologies can adequately incorporate the hierarchical dependencies, while the use of the hidden states accommodates hidden evolution of gene regulatory networks and substitution rate heterogeneity. I assess the new models using simulations and theoretical synthesis. The new approach solves the long-standing tail color problem (that aims at coding tail when it is absent) and presents a previously unknown issue called the \\\"two-scientist paradox\\\". The latter issue refers to the confounding nature of the coding of a trait and the hidden processes driving the traits evolution; failing to account for the hidden process may result in a bias, which can be avoided by using hidden state models. All this provides a clear guideline for coding traits into characters. This paper gives practical examples of using the new framework for phylogenetic inference and comparative analysis.",

    "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is a strong predictor of cardiovascular diseases. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase gene (Hmgcr) coding for the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is a crucial regulator of plasma cholesterol levels. However, the post-transcriptional regulation of Hmgcr remains poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of miRNAs in the regulation of Hmgcr expression. Systematic in silico predictions and experimental analyses reveal that miR-27a specifically interacts with the Hmgcr 3-untranslated region in murine and human hepatocytes. Moreover, our data shows that Hmgcr expression is inversely correlated with miR-27a levels in various cultured cell lines, human and rodent tissues. Actinomycin D chase assays and relevant experiments demonstrate that miR-27a regulates Hmgcr by translational attenuation followed by mRNA degradation. Early Growth Response 1 (Egr1) regulates miR-27a expression under basal and cholesterol-modulated conditions. miR-27a augmentation via tail-vein injection of miR-27a mimic in high cholesterol diet-fed Apoe-/- mice shows down-regulation of hepatic Hmgcr and plasma cholesterol levels. Pathway and gene expression analyses show that miR-27a also targets several other genes (apart from Hmgcr) in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Taken together, miR-27a emerges as a key regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis and has therapeutic potential for clinical management of hypercholesterolemia.",

S in humans is constitutively N-terminally acetylated (Sacetyl), although the impact of this modification is relatively unexplored. Here we report that Sacetyl is more effective at inducing intracellular aggregation in primary neurons than unmodified S (Sun). We identify complex N-linked glycans as binding partners for Sacetyl, and demonstrate that cellular internalization of Sacetyl is reduced significantly upon cleavage of extracellular N-linked glycans, but not other carbohydrates. We verify binding of Sacetyl to N-linked glycans in vitro, using both isolated glycans and cell-derived proteoliposomes. Finally, we identify neurexin l{beta}, a neuronal glycoprotein, as capable of driving glycan-dependent uptake of Sacetyl. Importantly, our results are specific to Sacetyl as Sun does not demonstrate sensitivity for N-linked glycans. Our study identifies extracellular N-linked glycans, and neurexin l{beta} specifically, as key modulators of neuronal uptake of physiological Sacetyl drawing attention to the potential therapeutic value of Sacetyl-glycan interactions.",

The process of abstraction solves this by constructing abstract variables describing features shared by different specific instances, reducing dimensionality and enabling generalization in novel situations. Here we characterized neural representations in monkeys performing a task where a hidden variable described the temporal statistics of stimulus-response-outcome mappings. Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural decoders across task conditions not used for training. This type of generalization requires a particular geometric format of neural representations. Neural ensembles in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, and in simulated neural networks, simultaneously represented multiple hidden and explicit variables in a format reflecting abstraction. Task events engaging cognitive operations modulated this format. These findings elucidate how the brain and artificial systems represent abstract variables, variables critical for generalization that in turn confers cognitive flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Wnts are secreted proteins that regulate cell fate specification during development of all metazoans. Wnt proteins were proposed to spread over several cell diameters to activate signalling directly at a distance. In the Drosophila wing epithelium, an extracellular gradient of Wingless (Wg, the homolog of Wnt1) was observed extending over several cells away from producing cells. However, it was also recently shown that a membrane-tethered Neurotactin-Wg fusion protein (NRT-Wg) can rescue the loss-of endogenous Wg, leading to proper patterning of the wing. Therefore, whether Wg spreading is required for correct tissue patterning during development remains controversial and the functional range of wild-type Wg is unclear. Here, by capturing secreted Wg on distally located cells we show that the Wg gradient acts directly up to eleven cell distances. Cells located outside the reach of extracellular Wg depend on the Frizzled2 receptor to maintain target gene expression. We find that NRT-Wg is not restricted to the producing cells and propose that it can rescue signalling defects by perdurance in the receiving cells. These results provide insight into the mechanisms by which Wnt proteins mediate patterning of a rapidly growing tissue.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys are increasingly being used for biodiversity monitoring, principally because they are sensitive and can provide high resolution community composition data. Despite considerable progress in recent years, eDNA studies examining how different environmental sample types can affect species detectability remain rare. Comparisons of environmental samples are especially important for providing best practice guidance on early detection and subsequent mitigation of non-indigenous species. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding of COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and 18S (nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA) genes to compare community composition between sediment and water samples in artificial coastal sites across the United Kingdom. We first detected markedly different communities and a consistently greater number of distinct operational taxonomic units in sediment compared to water. We then compared our eDNA datasets with previously published rapid assessment biodiversity surveys and found excellent concordance among the different survey techniques. Finally, our eDNA surveys detected many non-indigenous species, including several newly introduced species, highlighting the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for both early detection and temporal / spatial monitoring of non-indigenous species. We conclude that careful consideration on environmental sample type is needed when conducting eDNA surveys, especially for studies assessing community change.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in Parkin (PARK2) are the most common genetic cause of early-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). Parkin encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in the turnover of damaged mitochondria. Hundreds of Parkin missense variants have been reported in public databases, yet the role of most of them in PD remains unclear. We analyzed Parkin variants using clinical, experimental, and structural modeling approaches. For most variants, clinical evidence alone was insufficient to determine pathogenicity. Utilizing a cell model that allows measurement of Parkin-mediated mitophagy and Parkin stability, 51 variants were classified into five groups based on their effect on Parkin function. Most variants were like wildtype but, unexpectedly, several enhanced mitophagy. A minority destabilized Parkin or severely disrupted Parkin-mediated mitophagy, most of which were also determined as pathogenic based on clinical evidence alone. Structural simulation predicted discrete mechanisms explaining both increases and decreases in Parkin function. Interestingly, impaired mitophagy in several of the most common pathogenic Parkin variants could be rescued both by naturally-occurring (p.V224A) and structure-guided designer (p.W403A; p.F146A) hyperactive Parkin variants. These findings provide a coherent framework to classify Parkin variants based on pathogenicity and suggest that several pathogenic Parkin variants represent promising targets for genotype-specific drug design.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine is precursor for monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), which is one of the key neurotransmitters in the frontostriatal network and of crucial relevance for mental disorders. Recent research reported that high dose tyrosine application resulted in increased brain DA synthesis, which is consistent with the observation of positive associations between daily tyrosine intake and cognitive test performance. In the present study, we investigated the associations between working memory (WM) dependent tasks and self-reported nutritional tyrosine intake within a large group of healthy elderly humans (286 subjects) by additionally including brain functional data. We observed a negative correlation between tyrosine intake and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the striatum (putamen) and the prefrontal cortex. That is to say, we found higher rsFC in individuals consuming less tyrosine per day. At the same time, this increased rsFC or hyperconnectivity was associated with lower WM performance. These findings suggest that lower or insufficient supply of tyrosine might result in dysfunctional connectivity between striatal and frontal regions leading to lower WM capacity in healthy elderly humans.",

Compound Kushen Injection (CKI), in a breast cancer cell line in which CKI causes apoptosis. Because CKI is a complex mixture of plant secondary metabolites, we used a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation and reconstitution approach to define chemical fractions required for CKI to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our initial fractionation separated major from minor compounds, and showed that the major compounds accounted for little of the activity of CKI. By systematically perturbing the major compounds in CKI we found that removal of no single major compound could alter the effect of CKI on cell viability and apoptosis. However, simultaneous removal of two major compounds identified oxymatrine and oxysophocarpine as critical compounds with respect to CKI activity. We then used RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis to correlate compound removal with gene expression and phenotype data. We determined that many compounds in CKI are required for its effectiveness in triggering apoptosis but that significant modulation of its activity is conferred by a small number of compounds. In conclusion, CKI may be typical of many plant based extracts that contain many compounds in that no single compound is responsible for all of the bioactivity of the mixture and that many compounds interact in a complex fashion to influence a network containing many targets.",

This limits the possibility to automatically transfer knowledge from well-established model organisms. Therefore, specific bioinformatic tools are necessary to infer new biochemical reactions and new metabolic structures that can be checked experimentally. Using an integrative approach combining both genomic and metabolomic data in the red algal model Chondrus crispus, we show that, even metabolic pathways considered as conserved, like sterol or mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA) synthesis pathways, undergo substantial turnover. This phenomenon, which we formally define as \\\"metabolic pathway drift\\\", is consistent with findings from other areas of evolutionary biology, indicating that a given phenotype can be conserved even if the underlying molecular mechanisms are changing. We present a proof of concept with a new methodological approach to formalize the logical reasoning necessary to infer new reactions and new molecular structures, based on previous biochemical knowledge. We use this approach to infer previously unknown reactions in the sterol and MAA pathways.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenome-scale metabolic models describe our current understanding of all metabolic pathways occuring in a given organism. For emerging model species, where few biochemical data are available about really occurring enzymatic activities, such metabolic models are mainly based on transferring knowledge from other more studied species, based on the assumption that the same genes have the same function in the compared species. However, integration of metabolomic data into genome-scale metabolic models leads to situations where gaps in pathways cannot be filled by known enzymatic reactions from existing databases. This is due to structural variation in metabolic pathways accross evolutionary time. In such cases, it is necessary to use complementary approaches to infer new reactions and new metabolic intermediates using logical reasoning, based on available partial biochemical knowledge. Here we present a proof of concept that this is feasible and leads to hypotheses that are precise enough to be a starting point for new experimental work.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphSchizophrenia is a highly hereditary mental disease1 related to abnormal dopaminergic activities.2,3 To elucidate the mechanisms underlying schizophrenias development, genomic studies have sought to identify the pathogenic genetic polymorphisms. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported potential candidate loci that contribute to schizophrenias development.4,5 The risk genetic profiles are not yet established. Here we show that the combination of three functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the key factors of dopaminergic signaling can be used to predict the risk of schizophrenias development, though none of the SNPs is known to be associated by itself. These functional SNPs were reported to demonstrate directional influences in their parent gene activity, perhaps characterizing the integrated properties of dopaminergic signaling. Interestingly, the risk combination presented here included the major genotype as well as the minor polymorphisms, suggesting a possible association of unaffected activities of some dopamine-related genes with the disease development. The phenotype speculated based on the allelic status seemed consistent with the conventional pathophysiological hypotheses, although recently developed predictive methods, such as the polygenic risk score, could miss this potent pathogenic role of carrying a normal genotype by evaluating only minor polymorphisms. Our results demonstrate the presence of a subtype in schizophrenia with the favored genetic background related to dopamine signaling. Our findings indicate the possibility that the combinations could characterize integrated biological functions (including neurotransmission) and therefore identify individuals with a disease risk. The biological microenvironment indicated by the functional SNPs could bring an insight to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, we believe that our approach will contribute to the development of innovative means to predict disease risks even for other multi-factorial diseases and then, the following preventive medicine.",

Super-resolution microscopy demonstrates dynamic localization of SPO11-1 during recombination initiation, with variable numbers of SPO11-1 foci being distributed in nuclei but similar numbers of SPO11-1 foci being found on AEs. Notably, cytological analysis of spo11-1 meiocytes revealed an aberrant AE structure. At leptotene, AEs of wild-type and spo11-1 meiocytes were similarly curly and discontinuous. However, during early zygotene, wild-type AEs become uniform and exhibit shortened axes, whereas the elongated and curly AEs persisted in spo11-1 mutants, suggesting that loss of SPO11-1 compromised AE structural maturation. Our results reveal an interesting relationship between SPO11-1 loading onto AEs and the conformational remodeling of AEs during recombination initiation.\n\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis is essential during sexual reproduction to produce haploid gametes. Recombination is the most crucial step during meiotic prophase I. It enables pairing of homologous chromosomes prior to their reductional division and generates new combinations of genetic alleles for transmission to the next generation. Meiotic recombination is initiated by generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via SPO11, a topoisomerase-related enzyme. The activity, timing and location of this DSB machinery must be controlled precisely, but how this is achieved remains obscure. Here, we show dynamic localization of SPO11-1 on chromatin during meiotic initiation in maize, yet a similar number of SPO11-1 is able to load onto axial elements (AEs), which accompanies a structural change of the AEs of wild-type meiotic chromosomes. Interestingly, loss of SPO11-1 not only affects DSB formation but also impairs structural alterations of AEs, resulting in abnormally long and curly AEs during early meiosis. Our study provides new insights into SPO11-1 localization during recombination initiation and suggests an intimate relationship between DSB formation and AE structural changes.",

They capture different scales of the system under study and provide the opportunity of understanding the interaction between multiple scales. In this paper, we have used our previously developed multi-scale whole body metabolism framework to establish a new approach to include multiple objectives of the human cells in computational analysis. The model has 3555 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) integrated with a genome-scale model of the hepatocyte, including 1826 biochemical reactions. The model has been solved for 74 objective functions simultaneously. Simulation results show that the integration algorithm has promise with respect to convergence, computational efficiency and response to perturbation. The results suggest that this method holds significant potential for the simulation of the range of metabolic phenotypes for mammalian cells where there are multiple objectives.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells within epithelial tissues reside in anatomical structures known as crypts that are known to contribute to the mechanical and chemical milieu important for function. To date, epithelial stem cell therapies have largely ignored the niche and focussed solely on the cell population to be transplanted. Our aim was to recreate the precise geometry of the epithelial stem cell niche using two photon polymerisation and to determine the influence of this structure alone on stem cell phenotype. We were able to recreate crypt structures and following cell seeding, a zonation in cell phenotype along the z-axis emerged. This illustrates that geometry alone, without the use of exogenous signalling molecules, influences cell response. Understanding the role of geometry in the regulation of the stem cell niche will enable significant advances in our ability to influence stem cell behaviour to expedite cellular therapies to the clinic.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/489773v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (30K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152d03eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5b6ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c6c02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14726a5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "During oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), Candida albicans invades and damages oral epithelial cells, which respond by producing proinflammatory mediators that recruit phagocytes to foci of infection. The ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) detects {beta}-glucan and plays a central role in stimulating epithelial cells to release proinflammatory mediators during OPC. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also interacts with C. albicans and is known to be activated by the Als3 adhesin/invasin and the Ece1/Candidalysin pore-forming toxin. Here, we investigated the interactions among EphA2, EGFR, Als3 and Ece1/Candidalysin during OPC. We found that Als3 and Ece1/Candidalysin function in the same pathway to damage epithelial cells in vitro. They also work together to cause OPC in mice. EGFR and EphA2 constitutively associate with each other as part of a physical complex and are mutually dependent for C. albicans-induced activation. In vitro, either Als3 or Ece1/Candidalysin is required for C. albicans to activate EGFR, sustain EphA2 activation, and stimulate epithelial cells to secrete CXCL8/IL-8 and CCL20. In the mouse model of OPC, Ece1/Candidalysin alone activates EGFR and induces CXCL1/KC and CCL20 production. Ece1/Candidalysin is also necessary for the production of IL-1 and IL-17A independently of Als3 and EGFR. These results delineate the complex interplay between host cell receptors and C. albicans virulence factors during the induction of OPC and the resulting oral inflammatory response.\n\nAuthor summaryOropharyngeal candidiasis occurs when the fungus Candida albicans proliferates in the mouth. The disease is characterized by fungal invasion of the superficial epithelium and a localized inflammatory response. Two C. albicans virulence factors contribute to the pathogenesis of OPC, Als3 which enables the organisms to adhere to and invade host cells and Ece1/Candidalysin which is pore-forming toxin that damages host cells. Two epithelial cell receptors, ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are activated by C. albicans. Here, we show that EphA2 and EGFR form part of complex and that each receptor is required to activate the other. Als3 and Ece1/Candidalysin function in the same pathway to damage epithelial cells. In isolated epithelial cells, both of these virulence factors activate EphA2 and EGFR, and stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators. In the mouse model of OPC, Ece1/Candidalysin elicits of a subset of the oral inflammatory response. Of the cytokines and chemokines induced by this toxin, some require the activation of EGFR while others are induced independently of EGFR. This work provides a deeper understanding of the interactions among C. albicans virulence factors and host cell receptors during OPC.",

Here, we studied the function of Myo3 and Myo5 during endocytosis using quantitative live-cell imaging and genetic perturbations. We show that the type-I myosins promote, in a dose-dependent way, the growth and expansion of the actin network, which controls the speed of membrane and coat internalization. We found that this myosin-activity is independent of the actin nucleation promoting activity of myosins, and cannot be compensated for by increasing actin nucleation.

While epistatic effects are difficult to measure precisely, important information about the overall distribution is captured by the mean and variance of log fitnesses for individuals carrying different numbers of mutations. We derive predictions for these quantities from simple fitness landscapes, based on models of optimizing selection on quantitative traits. We also explore extensions to the models, including modular pleiotropy, variable effects sizes, mutational bias, and maladaptation of the wild-type. We illustrate our approach by reanalysing a large data set of mutant effects in a yeast snoRNA. Though characterized by some strong epistatic interactions, these data give a good overall fit to the non-epistatic null model, suggesting that epistasis might have little effect on the evolutionary dynamics in this system. We also show how the amount of epistasis depends on both the underlying fitness landscape, and the distribution of mutations, and so it is expected to vary in consistent ways between new mutations, standing variation, and fixed mutations.",

These microclusters then move centripetally and coalesce into the central supramolecular activation cluster of an immune synapse. The mechanisms controlling BCR organization during immune synapse formation, and how this impacts BCR signaling, are not fully understood. We show that this coalescence of BCR microclusters depends on the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, which nucleates branched actin networks. Moreover, in murine B cells this dynamic spatial reorganization of BCR microclusters amplifies proximal BCR signaling reactions and enhances the ability of membrane-associated antigens to induce transcriptional responses and proliferation. Our finding that Arp2/3 complex activity is important for B cell responses to spatially-restricted membrane-bound antigens, but not for soluble antigens, highlights a critical role for Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin remodelling in B cell responses to APC-bound antigens.",

Some receptors that sense these morphogen signals are known to localize to only the apical or basal membrane of polarized cell lines in vitro.

Here, we show in the early mouse embryo that the formation of a robust BMP signaling gradient depends on restricted, basolateral localization of the BMP receptors. Mis-localizing these receptors to apical membrane leads to ectopic BMP signaling in vivo in the mouse embryo. To reach the basolaterally localized receptors in epiblast, BMP4 ligand, secreted by the extra-embryonic ectoderm, has to diffuses through the narrow interstitial space between the epiblast and the underlying endoderm. This restricted, basolateral diffusion creates a signaling gradient. The embryo geometry further buffers the gradient from fluctuations in the levels of BMP4.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBird plumage exhibits a diversity of colors that serve functional roles ranging from signaling to camouflage and thermoregulation. However, birds must maintain a balance between evolving colorful signals to attract mates, minimizing conspicuousness to predators, and optimizing adaptation to climate conditions. Examining plumage color macroevolution provides a framework for understanding this dynamic interplay over phylogenetic scales. Plumage evolution due to a single overarching process, such as selection, may generate the same macroevolutionary pattern of color variation across all body regions. In contrast, independent processes may partition plumage into sections and produce region-specific patterns. To test these alternative scenarios, we collected color data from museum specimens of an ornate clade of birds, the Australasian lorikeets, using visible-light and UV-light photography, and comparative methods. We predicted that the diversification of homologous feather regions, i.e., patches, known to be involved in sexual signaling (e.g., face) would be less constrained than patches on the back and wings, where new color states may come at the cost of crypsis. Because environmental adaptation may drive evolution towards or away from color states, we tested whether climate more strongly covaried with plumage regions under greater or weaker macroevolutionary constraint.\\n\\nResultsWe found that alternative macroevolutionary models and varying rates best describe color evolution, a pattern consistent with our prediction that different plumage regions evolved in response to independent processes. Modeling plumage regions independently, in functional groups, and all together showed that patches with similar macroevolutionary models clustered together into distinct regions (e.g., head, wing, belly), which suggests that plumage does not evolve as a single trait in this group. Wing patches, which were conserved on a macroevolutionary scale, covaried with climate more strongly than plumage regions (e.g., head), which diversified in a burst.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, our results support the hypothesis that the extraordinary color diversity in the lorikeets was generated by a mosaic of evolutionary processes acting on plumage region subsets. Partitioning of plumage regions in different parts of the body provides a mechanism that allows birds to evolve bright colors for signaling and remain hidden from predators or adapt to local climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "In the trichromatic primate retina, the  midget retinal ganglion cell is the classical substrate for red-green color signaling, with a circuitry that enables antagonistic responses between long (L)- and medium (M)-wavelength sensitive cone inputs. Previous physiological studies show that some OFF midget ganglion cells may receive sparse input from short (S)-wavelength sensitive cones, but the effect of S-cone inputs on the chromatic tuning properties of such cells has been unexplored. Moreover, anatomical evidence for a synaptic pathway from S cones to OFF midget ganglion cells through OFF-midget bipolar cells remains ambiguous. In this study we address both questions for the macaque monkey retina. First, we used serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) to show that every S-cone in the parafoveal retina synapses principally with a single OFF-midget bipolar cell which in turn forms a private-line connection with an OFF midget ganglion cell. Second, we used patch electrophysiology to characterize the chromatic tuning of OFF midget ganglion cells in the near peripheral retina that receive combined input from L, M and S cones. These  S-OFF midget cells have a characteristic S-cone spatial signature, but demonstrate heterogeneous color properties due to variable strength of L, M, and S cone input across the receptive field. Together these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the OFF midget pathway is the major conduit for S-OFF signals in primate retina, and redefines the pathway as a chromatically complex substrate that encodes color signals beyond the classically recognized L vs. M and S vs. L+M cardinal mechanisms.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe first step of color processing in the visual pathway of primates occurs when signals from short- (S), middle- (M) and long- (L) wavelength sensitive cone types interact antagonistically within the retinal circuitry to create color-opponent pathways. The midget (L vs. M or  red-green) and small bistratified (S vs. L+M, or  blue-yellow) appear to provide the physiological origin of the cardinal axes of human color vision. Here we confirm the presence of an additional S-OFF midget circuit in the macaque monkey fovea with scanning block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) and show physiologically that a subpopulation of S-OFF midget cells combine S, L and M cone inputs along non-cardinal directions of color space, expanding the retinal role in color coding.",

    "abstract": "We developed an interacting particle system (IPS) to study the effect of niche construction on metapopulation dynamics in ephemeral landscapes. Using finite scaling theory, we find a divergence in the qualitative behavior at the extinction threshold between analytic (mean field) and numerical (IPS) results when niche construction is confined to a small area in the spatial model. While increasing the area of niche construction leads to a faster rate of range expansion, it also causes a shift from a continuous to discontinuous phase transition, thus returning to the mean field prediction. Furthermore, in the discontinuous regime of the IPS, spatial clustering prior to a critical transition disappears. This is a significant finding as spatial clustering has been considered to be an early warning signal before ecosystems reach their  tipping point. In addition to maintaining stability, we find this local niche construction strategy has an advantage when in competition with an exploiter because of their ability to monopolize the constructed niche due to spatial adjacency. However, as the niche construction neighborhood expands this advantage disappears and the exploiter strategy out-competes the niche constructor. In some cases the exploiter pushes the niche constructor to extinction, thus a tragedy of the commons ensues leading to ecological suicide and a collapse of the niche.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany populations do not exist passively in their environment. Niche construction theory tells us the co-regulatory feedback between a population and its localized environment can have significant impacts on the evolutionary trajectory and ecological stability of the population and broader community. However, if this feedback is not tightly coupled to the niche construction strategy it is left susceptible to exploitation. In some instances this can lead to ecological suicide, where both constructor and exploiter are driven to extinction. This study emphasizes the importance of being spatial when considering the ecological implications of niche construction. Along with adding to the development of niche construction theory, this work has implications for our understanding of critical transitions in vulnerable ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Genome diagnostics have gradually become a prevailing routine for human healthcare. With the advances in understanding the causal genes for many human diseases, targeted sequencing provides a rapid, cost-efficient and focused option for clinical applications, such as SNP detection and haplotype classification, in a specific genomic region. Although nanopore sequencing offers a perfect tool for targeted sequencing because of its mobility, PCR-freeness, and long read properties, it poses a challenging computational problem of how to efficiently and accurately search and map genomic subsequences of interest in a pool of nanopore reads (or raw signals). Due to its relatively low sequencing accuracy, there is no reliable solution to this problem, especially at low sequencing coverage.\\n\\nHere, we propose a brand new signal-based subsequence inquiry pipeline as well as two novel algorithms to tackle this problem. The proposed algorithms follow the principle of subsequence dynamic time warping and directly operate on the electrical current signals, without loss of information in base-calling. Therefore, the proposed algorithms can serve as a tool for sequence inquiry in targeted sequencing. Two novel criteria are offered for the consequent signal quality analysis and data classification. Comprehensive experiments on real-world nanopore datasets show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We further demonstrate the potential applications of the proposed algorithms in two typical tasks in nanopore-based targeted sequencing: SNP detection under low sequencing coverage, and haplotype classification under low sequencing accuracy.",

Lithocholic acid (LCA), a secondary bile acid produced by commensal bacteria, is known to bind to and activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in a manner comparable to calcitriol. In this study, Naive CD4 T cells were isolated from healthy human umbilical mononuclear cells and were stimulated in the presence or absence of LCA. We determined the effect of LCA on human cord blood T cell activation by measuring IFN-{gamma} production and protein expression of IFN-{gamma} receptor-mediated signaling molecules. We found that LCA reduces production of IFN-{gamma} and decreases phosphorylation of STAT1 as well as expression of AhR, STAT1, and IRF1 by activated human cord blood CD4 T cells.

    "abstract": "Uncertainties pose an ongoing challenge for information processing in the nervous system. It is not entirely clear how neurons maintain dynamic stability of information, encoded in the temporal features of spike trains, notwithstanding stochastic influences. Here we examined the contribution of subclasses of membrane sodium currents in real-time noise modulation in sensory neurons. Fast sodium (Na+) currents are essential for spike generation, and a persistent Na+ current can entrain preferred input frequencies via membrane resonance. Using mathematical modeling, theory and experiments, we show that a resurgent Na+ current can stabilize the temporal features of burst discharge and confer noise tolerance. These novel insights reckon the role of biophysical properties of Na+ currents beyond mere spike generation. Instead, these mechanisms might be how neurons perform real-time signal processing to maintain order and entropy in neural discharge. Our model analysis further predicts a negative feedback loop in the molecular machinery of an underlying Nav1.6-type Na+ channel gating considered in this study.",

The anomalous signals from SeMets can be used for phasing as well as sequence markers for subsequent model building. The production of large quantities of SeMet incorporated recombinant proteins is relatively straightforward when expressed in E. coli. In contrast, production of SeMet substituted recombinant proteins expressed in the insect cells is not as robust due to the toxicity of SeMet in eukaryotic systems. Previous protocols for SeMet-incorporation in the insect cells are laborious, and more suited for secreted proteins. In addition, these protocols have generally not addressed the SeMet toxicity issue, and typically result in low recovery of the labeled proteins. Here we report that SeMet toxicity can be circumvented by fully infecting insect cells with baculovirus. Quantitatively controlling infection levels using our Titer Estimation of Quality Control (TEQC) method allows for incorporation of substantial amounts of SeMet, resulting in an efficient and optimal production of labeled recombinant protein complexes. With the method described here, we were able to consistently reach incorporation levels of about 75% and protein yield of 60-90% compared to native protein expression.",

    "abstract": "The identification of physical interactions between drug candidate chemical substances and target biomolecules is an important step in the process of drug discovery, where the standard procedure is the systematic screening of chemical compounds against pre-selected target proteins. However, experimental screening procedures are expensive and time consuming, therefore, it is not possible to carry out comprehensive tests. Within the last decade, computational approaches have been developed with the objective of aiding experimental studies by predicting novel drug-target interactions (DTI), via the construction and application of statistical models. In this study, we propose a large-scale DTI interaction prediction system, DEEPScreen, for early stage drug discovery, using convolutional deep neural networks. One of the main advantages of DEEPScreen is employing readily available simple 2-D images of compounds at the input level instead of engineered complex feature vectors that displayed limited performance in DTI prediction tasks previously. DEEPScreen learns complex features inherently from the 2-D molecular representations, thus producing highly accurate predictions. DEEPScreen system was trained for 704 target proteins (using ChEMBL curated bioactivity data) and finalized with rigorous hyper-parameter optimization tests. We compared the performance of DEEPScreen against shallow classifiers such as the random forest, logistic regression and support vector machines, to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning approach. Additionally, we compared DEEPScreen with other deep learning based state-of-the-art DTI predictors on widely used benchmark datasets and showed that DEEPScreen produces better or comparable results to the top performers. The method proposed here can be employed to computationally scan a large portion of the recorded drug candidate compound and protein spaces to aid the experimentalists working in the field of drug discovery and repurposing by providing a preselection of interesting novel DTIs.",

    "abstract": "The pervasive nature of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires efficient termination. A key player in this process is the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factor PCF11, which directly binds to the Pol II C-terminal domain and dismantles elongating Pol II from DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including: mNET-seq, 3 mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and downstream gene silencing. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript, and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination.",

In line with previous studies of mammalian visual cortex connectivity, substantially more anterograde and retrograde label was present in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the injection site compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Ipsilateral reciprocal connectivity was the strongest within the occipital visual areas, while weaker connectivity strength was observed in the temporal, suprasylvian and parietal visual areas. Callosal connectivity tended to be strongest in the homotopic cortical areas, and revealed a similar areal distribution to that observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere, although often less widespread across cortical areas. Ipsilateral reciprocal connectivity was observed throughout the visual nuclei of the dorsal thalamus, with no contralateral connections to the visual thalamus being observed. The current study, along with previous studies of connectivity in the cat, identified the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian visual area (PMLS) as a distinct network hub external to the occipital visual areas in carnivores, implicating PMLS as a potential gateway to the parietal cortex for dorsal stream processing. These data will also contribute to the Ferretome (www.ferretome.org), a macro connectome database of the ferret brain, providing essential data for connectomics analyses and cross-species analyses of connectomes and brain connectivity matrices, as well as providing data relevant to additional studies of cortical connectivity across mammals and the evolution of cortical connectivity variation.",

Have the molecular mechanisms for mediating this LTP evolved independently or have they converged? Here we report on a distinctive adaptation of the nitric-oxide (NO) system for mediation of the octopus LTP. Unlike the suggested role of NO in LTP induction in the hippocampus, in octopus, inhibitors of NO-synthase (NOS) did not block LTP induction but either 1) reversibly  erased LTP expression, suggesting that a constitutive elevation in NO mediates the presynaptic LTP expression or 2)  reversed LTP induction and maintenance because a second LTP could be induced after inhibitor washout. We therefore propose a protein synthesis-independent  molecular-switch, whereby NO-dependent NOS reactivation maintains NOS in its active state. Thus, while the octopus LTP shows marked evolutionary convergence with LTP in vertebrates, an extreme molecular novelty has evolved to mediate it.",

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a widely used and sensitive technique to obtain structural information on complex mixtures. However, just knowing the molecular masses of the mixtures constituents is almost always insufficient for confident assignment of the associated chemical structures. Structural information can be augmented through MS fragmentation experiments whereby detected metabolites are fragmented giving rise to MS/MS spectra. However, how can we maximize the structural information we gain from fragmentation spectra?\\n\\nWe recently proposed a substructure-based strategy to enhance metabolite annotation for complex mixtures by considering metabolites as the sum of (bio)chemically relevant moieties that we can detect through mass spectrometry fragmentation approaches. Our MS2LDA tool allows us to discover - unsupervised - groups of mass fragments and/or neutral losses termed Mass2Motifs that often correspond to substructures. After manual annotation, these Mass2Motifs can be used in subsequent MS2LDA analyses of new datasets, thereby providing structural annotations for many molecules that are not present in spectral databases.\\n\\nHere, we describe how additional strategies, taking advantage of i) combinatorial in-silico matching of experimental mass features to substructures of candidate molecules, and ii) automated machine learning classification of molecules, can facilitate semi-automated annotation of substructures. We show how our approach accelerates the Mass2Motif annotation process and therefore broadens the chemical space spanned by characterized motifs. Our machine learning model used to classify fragmentation spectra learns the relationships between fragment spectra and chemical features. Classification prediction on these features can be aggregated for all molecules that contribute to a particular Mass2Motif and guide Mass2Motif annotations.\\n\\nTo make annotated Mass2Motifs available to the community, we also present motifDB: an open database of Mass2Motifs that can be browsed and accessed programmatically through an API. MotifDB is integrated within ms2lda.org, allowing users to efficiently search for characterized motifs in their own experiments. We expect that with an increasing number of Mass2Motif annotations available through a growing database we can more quickly gain insight in the constituents of complex mixtures. That will allow prioritization towards novel or unexpected chemistries and faster recognition of known biochemical building blocks.",

We identify high similarity between the repeat-instability in tumors and their patient-matched normal tissues, but also tumor-specific signatures, both in protein expression and in the genome, that strongly correlate with cancer progression and robustly predict the tumorigenic state. In a patient, the hierarchy of genomic repeat instability signatures accurately reconstructs tumor evolution, with primary tumors differentiated from metastases. We find an inverse relationship between repeat-instability and point mutation load, within and across patients, and independently of other somatic aberrations. Thus, repeat-instability is a distinct, transient and compensatory adaptive mechanism in tumor evolution.",

    "abstract": "1The fig and pollinator wasp obligate mutualism is diverse (~750 described species), ecologically important, and ancient (~80-90 Ma), providing model systems for generating and testing many questions in evolution and ecology. Once thought to be a prime example of strict one-to-one cospeciation, current thinking suggests that genera of pollinator wasps co-evolve with corresponding subsections of figs, but the degree to which cospeciation or other processes contributes to the association at finer scales is unclear. Here we use genome-wide sequence data from a community of Panamanian strangler figs (Ficus subgenus Urostigma, section Americana) and associated fig wasp pollinators (Pegoscapus spp.) to infer the process of coevolutionary diversification in this obligate mutualism. Using a model-based approach adapted from the study of gene family evolution, our results indicate pervasive and ongoing host switching of pollinator wasps at this fine phylogenetic and regional scale. Although the model estimates a modest amount of cospeciation, simulations reveal this signal to be consistent with levels of co-association expected under a model of free host switching. Our findings provide an outline for testing how ecological and evolutionary processes can be modeled to evaluate the history of association of interacting lineages in a phylogenetic framework.",

    "abstract": "Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is a topical antiseptic widely used in healthcare settings. In Staphylococcus spp., the pump QacA effluxes CHG, while the closely related QacB cannot due to a single amino acid substitution. We characterized 1,050 cutaneous Staphylococcus isolates obtained from 173 pediatric oncology patients enrolled in a multicenter CHG bathing trial. CHG susceptibility testing revealed 63 (6%) of these isolates had elevated CHG MICs ([&ge;] 4 g/mL). Screening of all 1,050 isolates for qacA/B by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) yielded 56 isolates with a novel qacA/B RFLP pattern, qacAB273. The CHG MIC was significantly higher for qacAB273-positive isolates (MIC50: 4 g/mL, [range: 0.5 - 4 g/mL]) compared to other qac groups: qacA-positive (n=559, 1 g/mL, [0.5 - 4 g/mL]), qacB-positive (n=17, 1 g/mL, [0.25 - 2 g/mL]), and qacA/B-negative (n=418, 1 g/mL, [0.125 - 2 g/mL], p=0.001). The qacAB273-positive isolates also displayed a high proportion of methicillin resistance (96.4%) compared to other qac groups (24.9 - 61.7%, p=0.001). Whole genome sequencing revealed that qacAB273-positive isolates encoded a variant of QacA with 2 amino acid substitutions. This new allele, named qacA4, was carried on the novel plasmid pAQZ1. The qacA4-carrying isolates belonged to the highly resistant S. epidermidis clone ST2 and were collected from multiple centers across the United States and Canada. Curing an isolate of qacA4 resulted in a four-fold decrease in the CHG MIC, confirming the role of qacA4 in the elevated CHG MIC. Our results highlight the importance of further studying qacA4 and its functional role in clinical staphylococci.\\n\\nImportanceStaphylococcus epidermidis is an important cause of infections in patients with implanted devices. Bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), a topical antiseptic, has been shown to reduce rates of device-associated infections, especially those caused by S. epidermidis. In S. epidermidis, reduced susceptibility to CHG is associated with carriage of the qacA gene. As part of a multicenter CHG bathing trial, we obtained cutaneous Staphylococcus isolates from pediatric oncology patients across the United States and Canada. We identified a group of isolates capable of surviving in higher concentrations of CHG and determined a novel allele of qacA, termed qacA4 and carried on the novel plasmid pAQZ1, was responsible for the isolates survival in higher CHG concentrations. The qacA4-carrying S. epidermidis isolates belonged to the highly resistant and virulent ST2 clonal type. Our results highlight the need to understand the global distribution of novel qacA alleles, including qacA4, and their mechanistic effect on efflux.",

It should be noted there are 5,662 unigenes that share good similarity with the four databases and get a relatively perfect functional annotation. Besides, a total of 10,247 differentially expressed genes were screened. To be specific, 6,910 unigenes were up-regulated in the larva stage while 3,337 were down-regulated in the adult stage. To sum up, this study sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of the larval and adult stages of T. pisiformis.

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas gene editing holds substantial promise in many biomedical disciplines and basic research. Due to the important functional implications of non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-14 (HMGN1) in regulating chromatin structure and tumor immunity, we performed gene knockout of HMGN1 by CRISPR in cancer cells and studied the following proteomic regulation events. In particular, we utilized DIA mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and reproducibly measured more than 6200 proteins (protein-FDR 1%) and more than 82,000 peptide precursors in the single MS shots of two hours. HMGN1 protein deletion was confidently verified by DIA-MS in all of the clone- and dish- replicates following CRISPR. Statistical analysis revealed 147 proteins changed their expressions significantly after HMGN1 knockout. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis indicate the deletion of HMGN1 induces the histone inactivation, various stress pathways, remodeling of extracellular proteomes, cell proliferation, as well as immune regulation processes such as complement and coagulation cascade and interferon alpha/ gamma response in cancer cells. These results shed new lights on the cellular functions of HMGN1. We suggest that DIA-MS can be reliably used as a rapid, robust, and cost-effective proteomic screening tool to assess the outcome of the CRISPR experiments.",

    "abstract": "Cosolvents modulate the stability of protein conformations and exhibit contrasting effects on the kinetics of aggregation by globular proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The growth of ordered protein aggregates, after the initial nucleation step is believed to proceed through a dock-lock mechanism. We have studied the effect of two denaturants (guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and urea) and four protective osmolytes (trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), sucrose, sarcosine, and sorbitol) on the free energy surface (FES) of the dock-lock growth step of protein aggregation using a coarse-grained protein model and metadynamics simulations. We have used the proteins cSrc-SH3 and A{beta}9-40 as model systems representing globular proteins and IDPs, respectively. The effect of cosolvents on protein conformations is taken into account using the molecular transfer model (MTM). The computed FES shows that protective osmolytes stabilize the compact aggregates, while denaturants destabilize them for both cSrc-SH3 and A{beta}9-40. However, protective osmolytes increase the effective energy barrier for the multi-step domain swapped dimerization of cSrc-SH3, which is critical to the growth of protein aggregates by globular proteins, thus slowing down overall aggregation rate. Contrastingly, denaturants decrease the effective barrier height for cSrc-SH3 dimerization, and hence enhances the aggregation rate in globular proteins. The simulations further show that cSrc-SH3 monomers unfold before dimerization and the barrier to monomer unfolding regulates the effective rate of agrgegation. In the case of IDP, A{beta}9-40, protective osmolytes decrease and denaturants increase the effective barriers in the dock-lock mechanism of fibril growth, leading to faster and slower growth kinetics, respectively.",

Its genomic impact is challenging to reconstruct because most reversals occurred in the distant evolutionary past and must be inferred indirectly2, and questions remain about the extent of disruption caused by pleiotropy, altered gene expression and loss of homeostasis3. We tested the genomic signature of recent sexual signal loss in Hawaiian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus. Song loss is controlled by a sex-linked Mendelian locus, flatwing, which feminises male wings by erasing sound-producing veins. This variant spread rapidly under pressure from an eavesdropping parasitoid fly. We sequenced, assembled and annotated the T. oceanicus genome, produced a high-density linkage map, and localised flatwing on the X chromosome. We characterised pleiotropic effects of flatwing, including changes in embryonic gene expression and alteration of another sexual signal, chemical pheromones. Song loss is associated with pleiotropy, hitchhiking and genome-wide regulatory disruption which feminises flatwing male pheromones. The footprint of recent adaptive trait loss illustrates R. A. Fishers influential prediction that variants with large mutational effect sizes can invade genomes during the earliest stages of adaptation to extreme pressures, despite having severely disruptive genomic consequences.",

    "abstract": "Neomorphic, membrane-associated skeletal rods are found in disparate vertebrate lineages, but their evolution is poorly understood. Here we show that one of these elements--the calcar of bats (Chiroptera)--is a skeletal novelty that has anatomically diversified. Our comparisons of evolutionary models of calcar length and corresponding disparity-through-time analyses indicate that the calcar diversified early in the evolutionary history of Chiroptera, as bats systematically radiated after evolving the capacity for flight. We find interspecific variation in a variety of anatomical parameters of probable importance for calcar function, which suggests that adaptive advantages provided by the calcar led to its anatomical diversification. In addition to overall length, we find that the calcar varies among bats in its tissue composition, and a synovial joint is present at the articulation between the calcar and the calcaneus ankle bone in some species. This suggests the calcar has a kinematic functional role. Our results demonstrate that novel skeletal additions can become integrated into vertebrate body plans and subsequently evolve into a variety of forms, potentially impacting clade diversification by expanding the available morphological space into which organisms can evolve.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfrican Americans (AAs) are an admixed population with portions of their genome derived from West Africans and Europeans. In AAs, the proportion of West African ancestry (WAA) can vary widely and may explain the genetic drivers of disease, specifically those that disproportionately affect this understudied population. To examine the relationship between the proportion of WAA and gene expression, we used high dimensional data obtained from AA primary hepatocytes, a tissue important in disease and drug response.\n\nMethodsRNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq Platform) was conducted on 60 AA-derived primary hepatocytes, with methylation profiling (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) of 44 overlapping samples. WAA for each sample was calculated using fastSTRUCTURE and correlated to both gene expression and DNA methylation. The GTEx consortium (n = 15) was used for replication and a second cohort (n = 206) was using used for validation using differential gene expression between AAs and European-Americans.\n\nResultsWe identified 131 genes associated with WAA (FDR< 0.1), of which 28 gene expression traits were replicated (FDR<0.1) and enriched in angiogenesis and inflammatory pathways (FDR<0.1). These 28 replicated gene expression traits represented 257 GWAS catalog phenotypes. Among the PharmGKB pharmacogenes, VDR, PTGIS, ALDH1A1, CYP2C19 and P2RY1 were associated with WAA (p < 0.05) with replication of CYP2C19 and VDR in GTEx. Association of DNA methylation with WAA identified 1037 differentially methylated regions (FDR<0.05), with hypomethylated genes enriched in drug response pathways.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfrican Americans (AAs) are an admixed population with portions of their genome derived from West Africans and Europeans. In AAs, the proportion of West African ancestry (WAA) can vary widely and may explain the genetic drivers of disease, specifically those that disproportionately affect this understudied population. To examine the relationship between the proportion of WAA and gene expression, we used high dimensional data obtained from AA primary hepatocytes, a tissue important in disease and drug response.\n\nMethodsRNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq Platform) was conducted on 60 AA-derived primary hepatocytes, with methylation profiling (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) of 44 overlapping samples. WAA for each sample was calculated using fastSTRUCTURE and correlated to both gene expression and DNA methylation. The GTEx consortium (n = 15) was used for replication and a second cohort (n = 206) was using used for validation using differential gene expression between AAs and European-Americans.\n\nResultsWe identified 131 genes associated with WAA (FDR< 0.1), of which 28 gene expression traits were replicated (FDR<0.1) and enriched in angiogenesis and inflammatory pathways (FDR<0.1). These 28 replicated gene expression traits represented 257 GWAS catalog phenotypes. Among the PharmGKB pharmacogenes, VDR, PTGIS, ALDH1A1, CYP2C19 and P2RY1 were associated with WAA (p < 0.05) with replication of CYP2C19 and VDR in GTEx. Association of DNA methylation with WAA identified 1037 differentially methylated regions (FDR<0.05), with hypomethylated genes enriched in drug response pathways. Overlapping of differentially methylated regions with the 131 significantly correlated gene expression traits identified 5 genes with concordant directions of effect: COL26A1, HIC1, MKNK2, RNF135, SNAI1 and TRIM39.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that WAA contributes to variability in hepatic gene expression and DNA methylation with identified genes indicative of diseases disproportionately affecting AAs.

    "abstract": "Colonies of the opportunistic pathogen Proteus mirabilis can distinguish self from non-self: in swarming colonies of two different strains, one strain excludes the other from the expanding colony edge. Predominant models characterize bacterial kin discrimination as immediate antagonism towards non-kin cells, typically through delivery of toxin effector molecules from one cell into its neighbor. Upon effector delivery, receiving cells must either neutralize it by presenting a cognate anti-toxin, as would a clonal sibling, or suffer cell death or irreversible growth inhibition, as would a non-kin cell. Here we expand this paradigm to explain the non-lethal Ids self-recognition system, which stops access to a cooperative social behavior in P. mirabilis through a distinct mechanism: selectively and transiently inducing nonself cells into a lifestyle incompatible with cooperative swarming. This state is characterized by reduced expression of genes associated with protein synthesis, virulence, and motility, and also causes non-self cells to tolerate previously lethal concentrations of antibiotics. We found that entry into this state requires a temporary activation of the stringent response in non-self cells and results in the iterative exclusion of non-self cells as a swarm colony migrates outwards. These data clarify the intricate connection between non-lethal recognition and the lifecycle of P. mirabilis swarm colonies.",

    "abstract": "Performance on cognitive tasks during learning is used to measure intelligence, yet it remains controversial since such testing is susceptible to contextual factors. To what extent does performance during learning depend on the testing context, rather than underlying knowledge? We trained mice, rats and ferrets on a range of tasks to examine how testing context impacts the acquisition of knowledge versus its expression. We interleaved reinforced trials with \\\"probe\\\" trials in which we omitted reinforcement. Across tasks, each animal species performed remarkably better in probe trials during learning and inter-animal variability was strikingly reduced. Reinforcement feedback is thus critical for learning-related plasticity but, paradoxically, masks the expression of underlying knowledge. We capture these results with a network model in which learning occurs during reinforced trials while context modulates only the read-out parameters. Probing learning by omitting reinforcement thus uncovers latent knowledge and identifies context--not \\\"smartness\\\"--as the major source of individual variability.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIKnowledge acquisition and expression can be segregated by the introduction of non-reinforced probe trials across a variety of animal species and behavioral tasks.\\nC_LIO_LIAnimals learn much faster and in a more stereotyped way in non-reinforced probe trials than their performance in the presence of reinforcement suggests.\\nC_LIO_LIUnderperformance and variability in performance arise from sensitivity to the behavioral testing context, not acquisition of sensorimotor associations.\\nC_LIO_LIA circuit model accounts for context-dependent performance by modulating the integration of sensorimotor associations.\\nC_LI\\n\\neTOCKuchibhotla et al. show the acquisition and expression of knowledge can be behaviorally dissociated in mice, rats, and ferrets across a variety of sensorimotor tasks.

    "abstract": "Dispersal and adaptation both allow species to persist in changing environments. Yet, we have limited understanding of how these processes interact to affect species persistence, especially in diverse communities where biotic interactions greatly complicate responses to environmental change. Here we use a stochastic metacommunity model to demonstrate how dispersal and adaptation to environmental change independently and interactively contribute to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal provides spatial insurance, whereby species persist on the landscape by shifting their distributions to track favourable conditions. In contrast, adaptation allows species to persist by allowing for evolutionary rescue. But, when species both adapt and disperse, dispersal and adaptation do not combine positively to affect biodiversity maintenance, even if they do increase the persistence of individual species. This occurs because faster adapting species evolve to hold onto their initial ranges (i.e. monopolization effects), thus impeding slower adapting species from shifting their ranges and thereby causing extinctions. Importantly, these differences in adaptation speed emerge as the result of competition, which alters population sizes and colonization success. By demonstrating how dispersal and adaptation each independently and interactively contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity, we provide a framework that links the theories of spatial insurance, evolutionary rescue, and monopolization. This highlights the expectation that the maintenance of biodiversity in changing environments depends jointly on rates of dispersal and adaptation, and, critically, the interaction between these processes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSpecies can persist when the environment changes by shifting their ranges through dispersal or by adapting to the new conditions that they experience. Thus, we might expect that dispersal and adaptation in combination would increase persistence. Using a simulation model, we show that this may not be the case. Instead, species competition causes dispersal and adaptation to have conflicting contributions to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal and adaptation each independently increase biodiversity maintenance. But when species both disperse and evolve, faster adapting species persist in their current ranges, preventing others from shifting their ranges to track environmental change. These findings highlight the need to consider ecological and evolutionary processes together, or we risk underestimating how global change will impact biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "1. The process of speciation is of key importance in evolutionary biology because it shapes macroevolutionary patterns. This process starts at the microevolutionary level, for instance, when two subpopulations evolve towards different phenotypic optima. The speed at which these optima are reached is controlled by the degree of stabilising selection, which pushes a mean trait towards an optimum within subpopulations, and ongoing migration that pulls the mean phenotype away from that optimum. Traditionally, macro phenotypic evolution with selection has been modelled by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, but these models have ignored the role of migration within species.\\n\\n2. Here, our goal is to reconcile the processes of micro and macroevolution by modelling migration during speciation. More precisely, we introduce an OU model where migration happens between two subpopulations within a branch of a phylogeny and this migration decreases over time as it happens during speciation. We then use this model to study the evolution of trait means along a phylogeny, as well as the way phenotypic disparity between species changes with successive epochs.\\n\\n3. We show that ignoring the effect of migration in sampled time-series data leads to a significant underestimation of the selective forces acting upon it. We also show that migration decreases the expected phenotypic disparity between species and we show the effect of migration in the particular case of niche filling. We further introduce a method to jointly estimate selection and migration from time-series data.\\n\\n4. Our model extends standard results of interactions selection-migration in a microevolutionary time frame across multiple speciation events at a macroevolutionary scale. Our results further proof that not accounting for gene flow has important consequences in inferences at both the micro and macroevolutionary scale.",

Employing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen to find host factors required for EMCV infection, we identified a role for ADAM9 in EMCV infection. CRISPR-mediated deletion of ADAM9 in multiple human cell lines rendered the cells highly resistant to EMCV infection and cell death. Primary fibroblasts from ADAM9 KO mice were also strongly resistant to EMCV infection and cell death. In contrast, ADAM9 KO and WT cells were equally susceptible to infection with other viruses, including the picornavirus Coxsackie virus B. ADAM9 KO cells failed to produce viral progeny when incubated with EMCV. However, bypassing EMCV entry into cells through delivery of viral RNA directly to the cytosol yielded infectious EMCV virions from ADAM9 KO cells, suggesting that ADAM9 is not required for EMCV replication post-entry. These findings establish that ADAM9 is required for the early stage of EMCV infection, likely for virus entry or viral genome delivery to the cytosol.\\n\\nImportanceViral myocarditis is a leading cause of death in the U.S., contributing to numerous unexplained deaths in people [&le;] 35 years old.

    "abstract": "During viral infection, the accumulation of RNA replication intermediates or viral proteins imposes major stress on the host cell. In response, cellular stress pathways can rapidly impose defence mechanisms by shutting off the protein synthesis machinery, which viruses depend on, and triggering the accumulation of mRNAs into stress granules to limit the use of energy and nutrients. Because this threatens viral gene expression, viruses need to evade these pathways to propagate. Human norovirus is responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. Previously we showed that murine norovirus (MNV) regulates the activity of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Here we examined how MNV interacts with the eIF2a signaling axis controlling translation and stress granules accumulation. We show that while MNV infection represses host cell translation, it results in the assembly of virus-specific granules rather than stress granules. Further mechanistic analyses revealed that eIF2a signaling is uncoupled from translational stalling. Moreover the interaction of the RNA-binding protein G3BP1 with viral factors together with a redistribution of its cellular interacting partners could explain norovirus evasion of stress granules assembly. These results identify novel strategies by which norovirus ensure efficient replication propagation by manipulating the host stress response.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with an insidious onset. The disease is characterized by cognitive impairment and a distinct pathology with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\\n\\nGrowing evidence highlights the role of arginase activity in the manifestation of AD. Upregulation of arginase was shown to contribute to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Regulation of arginase activity appears to be a promising approach for interfering with the pathogenesis of AD and other metabolic disorders. Therefore, the enzyme represents a novel therapeutic target.\\n\\nHere, we administer an arginase inhibitor L-norvaline to a mouse model of AD. Then, we evaluate the neuroprotective effect of L-norvaline using immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Finally, we identify the biological pathways activated by the treatment.\\n\\nRemarkably, we find that L-norvaline treatment reverses the cognitive decline in AD mice. We show the treatment is neuroprotective as indicated by reduced beta-amyloidosis, alleviated microgliosis, and TNF transcription levels. Moreover, elevated levels of neuroplasticity related protein PSD-95 were detected in the hippocampi of mice treated with L-norvaline. Furthermore, we disclose several biological pathways, which are involved in cell survival and neuroplasticity and are activated by the treatment.\\n\\nThrough these modes of action, L-norvaline has the potential to improve the symptoms of AD and even interfere with its pathogenesis. As such, L-norvaline is a promising neuroprotective molecule that might be tailored for the treatment of a range of neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "While JUUL electronic cigarettes (ECs) have captured the majority of the EC market with a large fraction of their sales going to adolescents, little is known about their cytotoxicity and potential effects on health. The purpose of this study was to determine flavor chemical and nicotine concentrations in the eight currently marketed pre-filled JUUL EC cartridges (\\\"pods\\\") and to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the different variants (e.g., \\\"Cool Mint\\\" and \\\"Creme Brulee\\\") using in vitro assays. Nicotine and flavor chemicals were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in pod fluid before and after vaping and in the corresponding aerosols. 59 flavor chemicals were identified in JUUL pod fluids, and three were >1 mg/mL. Duplicate pods were similar in flavor chemical composition and concentration. Nicotine concentrations (average 60.9 mg/mL) were significantly higher than any EC products we have analyzed previously. Transfer efficiency of individual flavor chemicals that were >1mg/mL and nicotine from the pod fluid into aerosols was generally 35 - 80%. All pod fluids were cytotoxic at a 1:10 dilution (10%) in the MTT and neutral red uptake assays when tested with BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells. Most aerosols were cytotoxic in these assays at concentrations >1%. The cytotoxicity of aerosols was highly correlated with nicotine and ethyl maltol concentrations and moderately to weakly correlated with total flavor chemical concentration and menthol concentration. Our study demonstrates that: (1) some JUUL flavor pods have high concentrations of flavor chemicals that may make them attractive to youth, and (2) the concentrations of nicotine and some flavor chemicals (e.g. ethyl maltol) are high enough to be cytotoxic in acute in vitro assays, emphasizing the need to determine if JUUL products will lead to adverse health effects with chronic use.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation has been extensively linked to alterations in gene expression, playing a key role in the manifestation of multiple diseases, most notably cancer. For this reason, researchers have long been measuring DNA methylation in living organisms. The relationship between methylation and expression, and between methylation in different genomic regions is of great theoretical interest from a molecular biology perspective. Therefore, several models have been suggested to support the prediction of methylation status in samples. These models, however, have two main limitations: (a) they heavily rely on partially measured methylation levels as input, somewhat defeating the object as one is required to collect measurements from the sample of interest before applying the model; and (b) they are largely based on human mediated feature engineering, thus preventing the model from unveiling its own representations. To address these limitations we used deep learning, with an attention mechanism, to produce a general model that predicts DNA methylation for a given sample in any CpG position based solely on the sample's gene expression profile and the sequence surrounding the CpG.\\n\\nWe show that our model is capable of generalizing to a completely separate test set of CpG positions and subjects. Depending on gene-CpG proximity conditions, our model can attain a Spearman correlation of up to 0.8 and MAE of 0.14 for thousands of CpG sites in the test data. We also identify and analyze several motifs and genes that our model suggests may be linked to methylation activity, such as Nodal and Hand1. Moreover, our approach, and most notably the use of attention mechanisms, offers a novel framework with which to extract valuable insights from gene expression data when combined with sequence information.\\n\\nThe code and trained models are available at: https://github.com/YakhiniGroup/Methylation",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution and domestication of flowering plants. Yet little is known about how plant duplicate genes evolve and are retained over long timescales, particularly those arising from small-scale duplication (SSD) rather than whole-genome duplication (WGD) events. Here we address this question in the Poaceae (grass) family by analyzing gene expression data from nine tissues of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa japonica (rice), and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum). Consistent with theoretical predictions, expression profiles of most grass genes are conserved after SSD, suggesting that functional conservation is the primary outcome of SSD in grasses. However, we also uncover support for widespread functional divergence, much of which occurs asymmetrically via the process of neofunctionalization. Moreover, neofunctionalization preferentially targets younger (child) duplicate gene copies, is associated with RNA-mediated duplication, and occurs quickly after duplication. Further analysis reveals that functional divergence of SSD-derived genes is positively correlated with both sequence divergence and tissue specificity in all three grass species, and particularly with anther expression in B. distachyon. Therefore, as found in many animal species, SSD-derived grass genes often undergo rapid functional divergence that may be driven by natural selection on male-specific phenotypes.",

Clonally related B-cells exist in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meninges, and central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma of MS patients. Longitudinally stable CSF oligoclonal band (OCB) antibody patterns suggest some local CNS B-cell persistence; however, the longitudinal B-cell dynamics within and between the CSF and blood remain unknown. We sought to address this by performing immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region repertoire sequencing on B-cells from longitudinally collected blood and CSF samples of MS patients (n=10). All patients were untreated at the time of the initial sampling; the majority (n=7) were treated with immune modulating therapies 1.2 (+/-0.3 SD) years later during the second sampling. We found clonal persistence of B-cells in the CSF of five patients; these B-cells were frequently immunoglobulin (Ig) class-switched and CD27+. We identified specific blood B-cell subsets that appear to provide input into CNS repertoires over time. We demonstrate complex patterns of clonal B-cell persistence in CSF and blood, even in patients on high-efficacy immune modulating therapy. Our findings support the concept that peripheral B-cell activation and CNS-compartmentalized immune mechanisms are in part therapy-resistant.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNFE2L2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2; Nrf2), is a stress-responsive transcription factor that regulates cellular redox homeostasis. The action mechanism of Nrf2 occurs through sensing oxidative stress in the cellular environment in responses to various stresses including altered metabolism, toxic insult and xenobiotic stresses. However, under the basal condition, the role of excess Nrf2 on global miRNA-mRNA interactions in the myocardium is unknown. Here, we tested a hypothesis that excess Nrf2 (transgene) will promote the transcription of antioxidants, which then might escalate the basal defense mechanisms in the heart. Furthermore, we investigated whether changes in the miRNA profile might have a strong role on the transcriptome in TG hearts.\\n\\nMethodsNon-transgenic (NTG), and Cardiac specific Nrf2 transgenic (Nrf2-TG) mice in the C57/BL6 background at the age of 6-8 months were used to examine transcriptional and post-transcriptional signatures (mRNA and miRNA expressions) by performing next generation sequencing (NGS) for RNA (RNAseq) and small RNA (sRNAseq) for miRNA expressions in the heart (n=3-6/group). Validation of the NGS data was performed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) using specific primers targeting selected miRNAs or mRNAs. Finally, in-silico analyses were performed to determine the miRNA-mRNA interactome networks and the pathways that are potentially regulated by these networks.\\n\\nResultsNGS analysis for mRNA indicated that there were 5727 differently expressed genes (DEGs) in the Nrf2-TG vs. NTG myocardium. Of which, 3552 were upregulated and 2175 were downregulated significantly. Small RNAseq analysis revealed that 112 miRNAs were significantly altered in Nrf2-TG versus NTG hearts. Among these miRNAs, 68 were upregulated and 44 were downregulated significantly. Validation of key targets for mRNA and miRNA by qPCR confirmed the NGS results. In-silico analysis (IPA) revealed that the majority of the miRNAs and mRNAs that are significantly altered in response to transgene expression are potentially involved in Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress response, ILK Signaling, hypoxia signaling in the cardiovascular system and glutathione-mediated detoxification etc.\\n\\nConclusionThese high-throughput sequencing data sets from cardiac specific Nrf2-TG mice revealed the transcriptome-wide effects of Nrf2 in the myocardium. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis indicates that Nrf2 may directly or indirectly regulates these sub-sets of cardiac miRNA-mRNA interactome networks under basal physiological setting.",

However, the extent to which TEPs reflect activity directly evoked by magnetic rather than sensory stimulation is unclear.\\n\\nObjectiveTo characterize and minimize the contribution of sensory inputs to TEPs.\\n\\nMethodsTwenty-four healthy participants received TMS over the motor cortex using two different intensities (below and above cortical motor threshold) and waveforms (monophasic, biphasic). TMS was also applied over the shoulder as a multisensory control condition. Common sensory attenuation measures, including coil padding and noise masking, were adopted. We examined spatiotemporal relationships between the EEG responses to the scalp and shoulder stimulations at sensor and source levels. Furthermore, we compared three different filters (independent component analysis, signal-space projection with source informed reconstruction (SSP-SIR) and linear regression) designed to attenuate the impact of sensory inputs on TEPs.\\n\\nResultsThe responses to the scalp and shoulder stimulations were correlated in both temporal and spatial domains, especially after [~]60 ms, regardless of the intensity and stimuli waveform. Among the three filters, SSP-SIR showed the best trade-off between removing sensory-related signals while preserving data not related to the control condition.\\n\\nConclusionsThe findings demonstrate that TEPs elicited by motor cortex TMS reflect a combination of transcranially and peripherally evoked brain responses despite adopting sensory attenuation methods during experiments, thereby highlighting the importance of adopting sensory control conditions in TMS-EEG studies. Offline filters may help to isolate the transcranial component of the TEP from its peripheral component, but only if these components express different spatiotemporal patterns. More realistic control conditions may help to improve the characterization and attenuation of sensory inputs to TEPs, especially in early responses.",

Emerging as a potent broad-spectrum antioxidant, melatonin was repurposed into extra roles such as the modulation of circadian and seasonal rhythmicity: affecting numerous aspects of physiology and behaviour, including sleep entrainment and locomotor activity. Interestingly, the pineal gland--the melatonin synthesising organ in vertebrates--was suggested to be absent or rudimentary in some mammalian lineages, including Cetacea. In Cetacea, pineal regression is paralleled by their unique bio-rhythmicity, as illustrated by the unihemispheric sleeping behaviour and long-term vigilance. Here, we examined the genes responsible for melatonin synthesis (Aanat and Asmt) and signalling (Mtnr1a and Mtnr1b) in 12 toothed and baleen whale genomes.

NUDT16, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family was selected as a candidate gene on the basis of: 1) it being upregulated in neutrophils exposed in vitro to serum of patients with sepsis, AND 2) the absence of overlap between the NUDT16 and sepsis, inflammation or neutrophil literature. We next sought to corroborate the initial finding in five public transcriptome sepsis datasets in which NUDT16 transcript levels were measured. In each of these dataset NUDT16 transcript abundance was found to be significantly increased in septic patients in vivo in comparison to uninfected controls. Next, biological concepts were extracted from the NUDT16 literature. The main concepts to emerge from profiling this literature were RNA decapping, inosine triphosphate, and inosine diphosphate. Through these concepts, indirect links could be established between NUDT16 and the sepsis/inflammation/neutrophil literature. A potential role for NUDT16 could, in turn, be inferred in the degradation of mRNAs in activated neutrophils. Follow on experiments that would be necessary in order to further explore such inference are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Motor control theories propose that the same motor plans can be employed by different effectors. Skills learned with one effector can therefore  transfer to others, which has potential applications in clinical situations. However, evidence from visuomotor adaptation suggests this effect is asymmetric; learning can be generalized from proximal-to-distal effectors (e.g. arm to hand), but not from distal-to-proximal effectors (e.g. hand to arm). We propose that skill learning may not be subject to this asymmetry, as it relies on multiple learning processes beyond error detection and correction. Participants learned a skill task involving the production of isometric forces. We assessed their ability to perform the task with the hand and arm. One group trained to perform the task using only their hand, while a second trained using only their arm. In a final assessment, we found that participants who trained with either effector improved their skill in performing the task with both their hand and arm. There was no change in a control group that did not train between assessments, indicating that gains were related to the training, not the multiple assessments. These results indicate that in contrast to visuomotor adaptation, motor skills can generalize from both proximal-to-distal and distal-to-proximal effectors. We propose this is due to differences in the processes underlying skill acquisition in comparison to visuomotor adaptation.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyPrior research indicates that motor learning transfers from proximal-to-distal effectors, but not vice-versa. However, this work focused on adapting existing behavior; we questioned whether different results would occur when learning new motor skills. We found that the benefits of training on a skill task with either the hand or arm transferred across both effectors. This highlights important differences between adaptation and skill learning, and may allow therapeutic benefits for patients with impairments in specific effectors.",

    "abstract": "Systems genetic analysis of complex traits involves the integrated analysis of genetic, genomic, and disease related measures. However, these data are often collected separately across multiple study populations, rendering direct correlation of molecular features to complex traits impossible. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have harnessed gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to associate unmeasured gene expression with a complex trait in genotyped individuals, but this approach relies primarily on strong eQTLs. We propose a simple and powerful alternative strategy for correlating independently obtained sets of complex traits and molecular features. In contrast to TWAS, our approach gains precision by correlating complex traits through a common set of continuous phenotypes instead of genetic predictors, and can identify transcript-trait correlations for which the regulation is not genetic. In our approach, a set of multiple quantitative \\\"reference\\\" traits is measured across all individuals, while measures of the complex trait of interest and transcriptional profiles are obtained in disjoint sub-samples. A conventional multivariate statistical method, canonical correlation analysis, is used to relate the reference traits and traits of interest in order to identify gene expression correlates. We evaluate power and sample size requirements of this methodology, as well as performance relative to other methods, via extensive simulation and analysis of a behavioral genetics experiment in 258 Diversity Outbred mice involving two independent sets of anxiety-related behaviors and hippocampal gene expression. After splitting the dataset and hiding one set of anxiety-related traits in half the samples, we identified transcripts correlated with the hidden traits using the other set of anxiety-related traits and exploiting the highest canonical correlation (R = 0.69) between the trait datasets. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms TWAS in identifying associated transcripts. Together, these results demonstrate the validity, reliability, and power of the reference trait method for identifying relations between complex traits and their molecular substrates.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSystems genetics exploits natural genetic variation and high-throughput measurements of molecular intermediates to dissect genetic contributions to complex traits. An important goal of this strategy is to correlate molecular features, such as transcript or protein abundance, with complex traits. For practical, technical, or financial reasons, it may be impossible to measure complex traits and molecular intermediates on the same individuals. Instead, in some cases these two sets of traits may be measured on independent cohorts. We outline a method, reference trait analysis, for identifying molecular correlates of complex traits in this scenario. We show that our method powerfully identifies complex trait correlates across a wide range of parameters that are biologically plausible and experimentally practical. Furthermore, we show that reference trait analysis can identify transcripts correlated to a complex trait more accurately than approaches such as TWAS that use genetic variation to predict gene expression. Reference trait analysis will contribute to furthering our understanding of variation in complex traits by identifying molecular correlates of complex traits that are measured in different individuals.",
