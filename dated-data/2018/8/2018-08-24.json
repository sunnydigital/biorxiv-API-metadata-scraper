    "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate that the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 represents a regulatory mechanism for insulin secretion of pancreatic islet {beta} cell. In vivo, Hv1-de[fi]cient mice display hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to reduced insulin secretion, but normal peripheral insulin sensitivity. In vitro, islets of Hv1-de[fi]cient and heterozygous mice, INS-1 (832/13) cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of Hv1 exhibit a marked defect in glucose- and K+-induced insulin secretion. Hv1 de[fi]ciency decreases both insulin and proinsulin contents, and limits glucose-induced Ca2+ entry and membrane depolarization. Furthermore, loss of Hv1 increases insulin-containing granular pH and decreases cytosolic pH. In addition, histologic studies show a decrease in {beta} cell mass in islets of Hv1-deficient mice. Collectively, our results indicate that Hv1 supports insulin secretion in the {beta} cell by calcium entry, membrane depolarization and intracellular pH regulation.",

    "abstract": "Human memory is strongly influenced by brain states occurring before an event, yet we know little about the underlying mechanisms. We found that activity in the cingulo-opercular network (including bilateral anterior insula and anterior prefrontal cortex) seconds before an event begins can predict whether this event will subsequently be remembered. We then tested how activity in the cingulo-opercular network shapes memory performance. Our findings indicate that prestimulus cingulo-opercular activity affects memory performance by opposingly modulating subsequent activity in two sets of regions previously linked to encoding and retrieval of episodic information. Specifically, higher prestimulus cingulo-opercular activity was associated with a subsequent increase in activity in temporal regions previously linked to encoding and with a subsequent reduction in activity within a set of regions thought to play a role in retrieval and self-referential processing. Together, these findings suggest that prestimulus attentional states modulate memory for real-life events by enhancing encoding and possibly by dampening interference from competing memory substrates.",

    "abstract": "Niche and fitness differences control the outcome of competition, but determining their relative importance in invaded communities - which may be far from equilibrium - remains a pressing concern. Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of non-hierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects, and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly-neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities.",

    "abstract": "Although the structure of TRPV1 has been experimentally determined in both the closed and open states, very little is known about its activation mechanism. In particular, the conformational changes occurring in the pore domain and resulting in ionic conduction have not been identified yet. Here, we suggest a hypothetical molecular mechanism for TRPV1 activation, which involves the rotation of a conserved asparagine in S6 from the S4-S5 linker toward the pore. This rotation is correlated with the dehydration of four peripheral cavities located between S6 and the S4-S5 linker and the hydration of the pore. In light of our hypothesis, we perform bioinformatics analyses of TRP and other evolutionary related ion channels, analyze newly available structures and re-examine previously reported water accessibility and mutagenesis experiments. Overall, we provide several independent lines of evidence that corroborate our hypothesis. Finally, we show that the proposed molecular mechanism is compatible with the currently existing idea that in TRPV1 the selectivity filter acts as a secondary gate.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity has positive effects on brain health and cognitive function throughout the lifespan. Thus far, few studies have examined the effects of physical activity on white matter (WM) microstructure and psychomotor speed within the same, population-based sample (critical if conclusions are to extend to the wider population). Here, using diffusion tensor imaging and a simple reaction time task within a relatively large population-derived sample (N = 399; 18-87 years) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN), we demonstrate that physical activity mediates the effect of age on white matter integrity, measured with fractional anisotropy. Higher self-reported daily physical activity was associated with greater preservation of WM in several frontal tracts, including the genu of corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, external capsule and anterior limb of the internal capsule. We also show that the age-related slowing is mediated by WM integrity in the genu. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work suggesting that a physically active lifestyle may protect against age-related structural disconnection and slowing.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale cancer sequencing studies of patient cohorts have statistically implicated many genes driving cancer growth and progression, and their identification has yielded substantial translational impact. However, a remaining challenge is to increase the resolution of driver prediction from the gene level to the mutation level, because mutation-level predictions are more closely aligned with the goal of precision cancer medicine. Here we present CHASMplus, a computational method, that is uniquely capable of identifying driver missense mutations, including those specific to a cancer type, as evidenced by significantly superior performance on diverse benchmarks. Applied to 8,657 tumor samples across 32 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, CHASMplus identifies over 4,000 unique driver missense mutations in 240 genes, supporting a prominent role for rare driver mutations. We show which TCGA cancer types are likely to yield discovery of new driver missense mutations by additional sequencing, which has important implications for public policy.\n\nSignificanceMissense mutations are the most frequent mutation type in cancers and the most difficult to interpret. While many computational methods have been developed to predict whether genes are cancer drivers or whether missense mutations are generally deleterious or pathogenic, there has not previously been a method to score the oncogenic impact of a missense mutation specifically by cancer type, limiting adoption of computational missense mutation predictors in the clinic. Cancer patients are routinely sequenced with targeted panels of cancer driver genes, but such genes contain a mixture of driver and passenger missense mutations which differ by cancer type. A patients therapeutic response to drugs and optimal assignment to a clinical trial depends on both the specific mutation in the gene of interest and cancer type. We present a new machine learning method honed for each TCGA cancer type, and a resource for fast lookup of the cancer-specific driver propensity of every possible missense mutation in the human exome.",

We applied our method to a corpus of scientific research articles from infectious disease genomic epidemiology and derived a Genomic Epidemiology Visualization Typology (GEViT) that describes how visualizations were created from a series of chart types, combinations, and enhancements. We have also implemented an online gallery that allows others to explore our resulting design space of visualizations. Our results have important implications for visualization design and for researchers intending to develop or use data visualization tools.

    "abstract": "Humans tend to value things not on their absolute values, but relative to reference points such as former experience or expectations. People rate the quality of a new salary relative to their previous salary and the salaries of their peers, instead of appreciating its absolute value. Here, we demonstrate a similar effect in an insect: ants, which had previously experienced a low quality food source, showed higher acceptance of medium quality food (e.g. 0.1M then 0.5M; positive contrast) than if they had received the medium food all along (e.g. 0.5M then 0.5M; control), and vice versa for high expectations. Further experiments demonstrate that these contrast effects arise from cognitive rather than mere sensory or pre-cognitive perceptual causes. Pheromone deposition also correlates with perceived reward value, and ants showed successive contrasts in their pheromone deposition. Relative value perception can therefore be expected to have strong effects not only on individual behaviour, but also on collective decision-making. Contrast effects were also social: the quality of food received from other ants affected the perceived value of food found later. Value judgement is a key element in decision making, and thus relative value perception will strongly influence how animals interact with their environment.",

Here, we studied DNA methylation (DNAm) at over 750,000 CpG sites in mononuclear blood cells collected at birth and age 7 from 196 children of primarily self-reported Black and Hispanic ethnicities to study race-associated DNAm patterns. We developed a novel Bayesian method for high dimensional longitudinal data and showed that race-associated DNAm patterns at birth and age 7 are nearly identical. Additionally, we estimated that up to 51% of all self-reported race-associated CpGs had race-dependent DNAm levels that were mediated through local genotype and, quite surprisingly, found that genetic factors explained an overwhelming majority of the variation in DNAm levels at other, previously identified, environmentally-associated CpGs. These results not only indicate that race-associated DNAm patterns in blood are present at birth and are primarily genetically, and not environmentally, determined, but also that DNAm in blood cells overall is robust to many environmental exposures during the first 7 years of life.",

Early in mitosis, adherent cells partially detach from the substratum, round up and their surface area decreases. This likely results from an endocytic uptake of plasma membrane material. As cells enter cytokinesis they re-adhere, flatten and exhibit an associated increase in surface area. The identity of the membrane donor for this phase of mitosis remains unclear. Here we show by biochemical and imaging approaches that lysosomes undergo exocytosis at telophase and that this requires the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-III{beta}. Inhibition of lysosome exocytosis resulted in mitotic failure in a significant proportion of cells suggesting that this facet of lysosome physiology is essential and represents a new regulatory mechanism in mitosis.",

Association with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DQB1*06:02/DQA1*01:02 (98% vs 25%) heterodimer (DQ0602), T cell receptor (TCR) and other immune loci suggest autoimmunity but autoantigen(s) are unknown. Onset is seasonal and associated with influenza A, notably pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1). An extensive unbiased DQ0602 binding peptide screen was performed encompassing peptides derived from Pandemrix(R) X-179-A pH1N1 influenza-A vaccine, a known T1N trigger, other H1N1 strains, and potential human autoantigens HCRT and RFX4, identifying 109 binders. The presence of cognate tetramer-peptide specific CD4+ T cells was studied in 35 narcolepsy cases and 22 DQ0602 controls after expansion of antigen-specific cells in Peripheral Blood Monocytes Cell (PBMC) cultures. Higher reactivity to influenza epitopes pHA273-287 (pH1N1 specific) and PR8 (H1N1 pre 2009)-specific NP17-31 were observed in T1N. Extensive reactivity to C-amidated but not native version of HCRT54-66 and HCRT86-97, which are two highly homologous peptides (HCRTNH2) was observed with higher frequencies of specific T cells in T1N. TCR/{beta} CDR3 sequences found in pHA273-287, NP17-31 and HCRTNH2 tetramer positive CD4+ cells were also retrieved in single INF{gamma}-secreting CD4+ sorted cells stimulated with Pandemrix(R), confirming immunodominance and functional significance in DQ0602-mediated responses and molecular mimicry. TCR/{beta} CDR3 motifs of HCRT54-66 and HCRT86-97 tetramers were extensively shared. Particularly notable was sharing across subjects of an CDR3, CAVETDSWGKLQF (in association with various CDR3{beta} that used TRAJ24, a chain modulated by Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) rs1154155 and rs1483979 associated with T1N.

    "abstract": "Systematic perturbations in motor adaptation tasks are primarily countered by learning from sensory-prediction errors, with secondary contributions from other learning processes. Despite the availability of these additional processes, particularly the use of explicit re-aiming to counteract observed target errors, patients with cerebellar degeneration are surprisingly unable to compensate for their sensory-prediction-error deficits by spontaneously switching to another learning mechanism. We hypothesized that if the nature of the task was changed - by allowing vision of the hand, which eliminates sensory-prediction errors - patients could be induced to preferentially adopt aiming strategies to solve visuomotor rotations. To test this, we first developed a novel visuomotor rotation paradigm that provides participants with vision of their hand in addition to the cursor, effectively setting the sensory-prediction-error signal to zero. We demonstrated in younger healthy controls that this promotes a switch to strategic re-aiming based on target errors. We then showed that with vision of the hand, patients with spinocerebellar ataxia could also switch to an aiming strategy in response to visuomotor rotations, performing similarly to age-matched participants (older controls). Moreover, patients could retrieve their learned aiming solution after vision of the hand was removed, and retain it for at least one year. Both patients and older controls, however, exhibited impaired overall adaptation performance compared to younger healthy controls (age, 18-33), likely due to age-related reductions in spatial and working memory. Moreover, patients failed to generalize, i.e., they were unable to adopt analogous aiming strategies in response to novel rotations, nor could they further improve their performance without vision of the hand. Hence, there appears to be an inescapable obligatory dependence on sensory-prediction-error-based learning - even when this system is impaired in patients with cerebellar degeneration. The persistence of sensory-prediction-error-based learning effectively suppresses a switch to target-error-based learning, which perhaps explains the unexpectedly poor performance by patients with spinocerebellar ataxia in visuomotor adaptation tasks.",

Risk-taking has been measured using both self-report measures and behavioral tasks designed for the purpose, but there is little consensus in the associations among measures and our understanding of the latent constructs underlying different forms of risk is limited. In the present study we examined the construct of risk using data from over 1000 young adults who completed measures of risk-taking, including self-reports of perception of risk, propensity to engage in risky behaviors and performance on behavioral tasks designed to measure risk. To examine the latent structure of risk preferences, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA revealed a latent structure of three distinct components of risk-taking behavior: \\\"Lifestyle Risk Sensitivity\\\", \\\"Financial Risk Sensitivity\\\", and \\\"Behavioral Risk Sensitivity\\\", which consisted only of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002). As expected, risk-taking and perception of risk differed in men and women. Yet, the PCA components were similar in men and women. Future work utilizing additional measures of risk-taking behavior in more heterogeneous samples will help to identify the true biobehavioral constructs underlying these behaviors.",

    "abstract": "We develop a null model of the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks, and use it to support an adaptive origin for a canonical \"motif\", a 3-node feed-forward loop (FFL) hypothesized to filter out short spurious signals by integrating information from a fast and a slow pathway. Our mutational model captures the intrinsically high prevalence of weak affinity transcription factor binding sites. We also capture stochasticity and delays in gene expression that distort external signals and intrinsically generate noise. Functional FFLs evolve readily under selection for the hypothesized function, but not in negative controls. Interestingly, a 4-node \"diamond\" motif also emerged as a short spurious signal filter. The diamond uses expression dynamics rather than path length to provide fast and slow pathways. When there is no external spurious signal to filter out, but only internally generated noise, only the diamond and not the FFL evolves.",

    "abstract": "Timecourses that exhibit identical behaviour at distinct measurement occasions are reliable. Voodoo connectivity occurs when connectivity among brain regions exceeds within subject timecourse reliability. Thus, timecourse reliability limits the true detectable connectivity. We reproduced a working memory related connectome consisting of 561 paths obtained from 67 individuals. We tested >100000 fc-MRI pipelines and show that Savitzky Golay (SG) filters maximize true connectivity while conserving cognitively relevant changes of signals. This is noteworthy for approaches that focus on rapidly changing aspects of connectomes. Furthermore, SG filters detect zombie activity. These \\\"resting state oscillations\\\" are not under human control and contaminate working state signals. SPM pipelines exhibit more voodoo connectivity than SG pipelines. With the SPM pipeline, we observed a connectivity of r=0.44 and a poor true connectivity of r=0.23, but with the SG pipeline we observed a connectivity of r=0.59 and a fair true connectivity of r=0.43. The number of paths detected with fair true connectivity (r >0.4) was 4 for the SPM pipeline but 352 for the SG based pipeline. However, superior statistical properties of SG pipelines may not reflect neural reality. Hence, causal external validation of fc-MRI pipelines is crucial. Without such studies, different pipelines produce at best \\\"alternative maps\\\".",

    "abstract": "Existing optical microscopy techniques compromise between resolution, photodamage, speed of acquisition and imaging in to deep samples. This often confines a technique to a certain biological system or process. We present a versatile imaging system which can switch between imaging modalities with sub millisecond transition times to adapt to the needs of a wide range of sample types. The imaging modalities provide the minimally invasive but low-resolution epi-fluorescence though increasing invasive but higher resolution confocal and structured illumination until the highest resolution is achieved through the most intrusive, localisation microscopy. The ability of the system to overcome the limitations of conventional single mode microscopy is demonstrated by several biological investigations. The ideas presented in this work allow researchers to move away from the model of a single imaging modality to study a specific process and instead follow those processes using the most suitable method available during the lifetime of the investigation.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput viral genetic sequencing is needed to monitor the spread of drug resistance, direct optimal antiretroviral regimes, and to identify transmission dynamics in generalised HIV epidemics. Public health efforts to sequence HIV genomes at scale face three major technical challenges: (i) minimising assay cost and protocol complexity, (ii) maximising sensitivity, and (iii) recovering accurate and unbiased sequences of both the genome consensus and the within-host viral diversity. Here we present a novel, high-throughput, virus-enriched sequencing method and computational pipeline tailored specifically to HIV (veSEQ-HIV), which addresses all three technical challenges, and can be used directly on leftover blood drawn for routine CD4 testing. We demonstrate its performance on 1,620 plasma samples collected from consenting individuals attending 10 large urban clinics in Zambia, partners of HPTN 071 (PopART). We show that veSEQ-HIV consistently recovers complete HIV genomes from the majority of samples of different subtypes, and is also quantitative: the number of HIV reads per sample obtained by veSEQ-HIV estimates viral load without the need for additional testing. Both quantitativity and sensitivity were assessed on a subset of 126 samples with clinically measured viral loads, and with standardized quantification controls (VL 100 - 5,000,000 RNA copies/ml). Complete HIV genomes were recovered from 93% (85/91) of samples when viral load was over 1,000 copies per ml. The quantitative nature of the assay implies that variant frequencies estimated with veSEQ-HIV are representative of true variant frequencies in the sample. Detection of minority variants can be exploited for epidemiological analysis of transmission and drug resistance, and we show how the information contained in individual reads of a veSEQ-HIV sample can be used to detect linkage between multiple mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral therapy. Less than 2% of reads obtained by veSEQ-HIV were identified as in silico contamination events using updates to the phyloscanner software (phyloscanner clean) that we show to be 95% sensitive and 99% specific at  decontaminating NGS data. The cost of the assay -- approximately 45 USD per sample -- compares favourably with existing VL and HIV genotyping tests, and provides the additional value of viral load quantification and inference of drug resistance with a single test. veSEQ-HIV is well suited to large public health efforts and is being applied to all [~]9000 samples collected for the HPTN 071-2 (PopART Phylogenetics) study.",

Here we study two types of germ granules in the Drosophila embryo: cytoplasmic germ granules that instruct primordial germ cells (PGCs) formation and nuclear germ granules within early PGCs with unknown function. We show that cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules are phase transitioned condensates nucleated by Oskar protein that display liquid as well as hydrogel-like properties. Focusing on nuclear granules, we find that Oskar drives their formation in heterologous cell systems. Multiple, independent Oskar protein domains synergize to promote granule phase separation. Deletion of Oskars nuclear localization sequence specifically ablates nuclear granules in cell systems. In the embryo, nuclear germ granules promote germ cell divisions thereby increasing PGC number for the next generation.",

Previous studies on the mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) showed that neurons with preferential frequency tuning responses are mixed within local cortical regions, despite a large-scale tonotopic organization. Here we found that frequency tuning properties of marmoset A1 neurons are highly uniform within local cortical regions. We first defined tonotopic map of A1 using intrinsic optical imaging, and then used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of large neuronal populations to examine the tonotopic preference at the single-cell level. We found that tuning preferences of layer 2/3 neurons were highly homogeneous over hundreds of micrometers in both horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, marmoset A1 neurons are distributed in a tonotopic manner at both macro- and microscopic levels. Such organization is likely to be important for the organization of auditory circuits in the primate brain.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a major cause of disability and is not effectively managed in half of the patients. We investigated whether mechanical vibration could reduce tremor in ET by selectively recruiting afferent pathways. We used piezoelectric actuators to deliver vibratory stimuli to the hand and forearm during long trials (4 min), while we monitored the tremor using inertial sensors. We analyzed the effect of four stimulation strategies, including different constant and variable vibration frequencies, in 18 ET patients. Although there was not a clear homogeneous response to vibration across patients and strategies, in most cases (50-72%) mechanical vibration was associated with an increase in the amplitude of their tremor. In contrast, the tremor was reduced in 5-22% of the patients, depending on the strategy. However, these results are hard to interpret given the intrinsic variability of the tremor: during equally long trials without vibration, the tremor changed significantly in 67% of the patients (increased in 45%; decreased in 22%). We conclude that mechanical vibration of the limb does not have a systematic effect on tremor in ET. Moreover, the observed intrinsic variability of the tremor should be taken into account when designing future experiments to assess tremor in ET and how it responds to any intervention.",

However, in every cell division, the epigenetic state is disassembled and then re-assembled in the wake of the DNA replication fork. Chromatin restoration on nascent DNA is a complex and regulated process that includes nucleosome assembly and remodeling, deposition of histone variants, and the re-establishment of transcription factor binding. To study the genome-wide dynamics of chromatin restoration behind the DNA replication fork, we developed Nascent Chromatin Occupancy Profiles (NCOPs) to comprehensively profile nascent and mature chromatin at nucleotide resolution. While nascent chromatin is inherently less organized than mature chromatin, we identified locus specific differences in the kinetics of chromatin maturation that were predicted by the epigenetic landscape, including the histone variant H2A.Z which marked loci with rapid maturation kinetics. The chromatin maturation at origins of DNA replication was dependent on whether the origin underwent initiation or was passively replicated from distal-originating replication forks suggesting distinct chromatin assembly mechanisms between activated and disassembled pre-replicative complexes. Finally, we identified sites that were only occupied transiently by DNA-binding factors following passage of the replication fork which may provide a mechanism for perturbations of the DNA replication program to shape the regulatory landscape of the genome.",

Traditionally, objects are thought to be attentionally selected and committed to short-term memory one-by-one. However, few studies directly test this serial encoding assumption. Here, we demonstrate that information from separate objects can be encoded into short-term memory in parallel. We developed models of serial and parallel encoding that describe probabilities of items being present in short-term memory throughout the encoding process, and tested them in a whole-report design. Empirical data from four experiments in healthy individuals were fitted best by the parallel encoding model, even when items were presented unilaterally (processed within one hemisphere). Our results demonstrate that information from several items can be attentionally selected and consequently encoded into short-term memory simultaneously. This suggests the popular feature integration theory needs to be reformulated to account for parallel encoding, and provides important boundaries for computational models of short-term memory.",

In particular, most proteins must be able to alternate between at least one active conformational state and back to an inactive conformer, especially for the macromolecules that perform work and need to optimize energy usage. This property may be invoked by a physical stimulus (temperature, radiation) or by a chemical ligand, and may occur through mapping of the protein external environment onto a subset of protein conformers. We have stimulated with temperature cycles two partners of an immune complex before and after assembly, and revealed that properties of the external stimulus (period, phase) are also found in the characteristics of the immune complex (i.e. periodic variations in the binding affinity).

Here we present a 3.7 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the human 55S mitoribosome-RRFmt complex, which reveals -helix and loop structures for a portion of the NTE that makes multiple mito-specific interactions with functionally critical regions of the mitoribosome.

The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines recognize the calibration curve as the method of choice for estimation of qPCR efficiency. The precision of this method has been reported to be between SD=0.007 (3 replicates) and SD=0.022 (no replicates). In this manuscript we present a novel approach to analysing qPCR data obtained by running a dilution series. Unlike previously developed methods, our method relies on a new formula that describes pairwise relationships between data points on separate amplification curves and thus operates extensive statistics (hundreds of estimations). The comparison of our method with classical calibration curve by Monte Carlo simulation shows that our approach can almost double the precision of efficiency and gene expression ratio estimations on the same dataset.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of a landscape of enhancers across human cells is crucial to deciphering the mechanism of gene regulation, cell differentiation, and disease development. High-throughput experimental approaches, though having successfully reported enhancers in typical cell lines, are still too costly and time consuming to perform systematic identification of enhancers specific to different cell lines under a variety of disease status. Existing computational methods, though capable of predicting regulatory elements purely relying on DNA sequences, lack the power of cell line-specific screening. Recent studies have suggested that chromatin accessibility of a DNA segment is closely related to its potential function in regulation, and thus may provide useful information in identifying regulatory elements. Motivated by the above understanding, we integrate DNA sequences and chromatin accessibility data to accurately predict enhancers in a cell line-specific manner. We proposed DeepCAPE, a deep convolutional neural network to predict enhancers via the integration of DNA sequences and DNase-seq data. We demonstrate that our model not only consistently outperforms existing methods in the classification of enhancers against background sequences, but also accurately predicts enhancers across different cell lines. We further visualize kernels of the first convolutional layer and show the match of identified sequence signatures and known motifs. We finally demonstrate the potential ability of our model to explain functional implications of putative disease-associated genetic variants and discriminate disease-related enhancers.",

We further show that the co-linearly arranged secondary metabolism genes are actively expressed, exhibit mainly eukaryotic transcriptional features, and enable the sequestration and uptake of iron. After transfer to the eukaryotic host, several genetic changes occurred, including the acquisition of polyadenylation sites, structural rearrangements, integration of eukaryotic genes, and secondary loss in some lineages. We conclude that the operon genes were likely captured in the shared insect gut habitat, modified for eukaryotic gene expression, and maintained by selection to adapt to the highly-competitive, iron-limited environment.",

    "abstract": "The Bacillus cereus group comprises multiple species capable of causing emetic or diarrheal foodborne illness. Despite being responsible for tens of thousands of illnesses each year in the U.S. alone, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has not been routinely employed to characterize B. cereus group isolates from foodborne outbreaks. Here, we describe the first WGS-based characterization of isolates linked to an outbreak caused by members of the B. cereus group. In conjunction with a 2016 outbreak traced to a supplier of refried beans served by a fast food restaurant chain in upstate New York, a total of 33 B. cereus group strains were obtained from human cases (n =7) and food samples (n = 26). Emetic (n = 30) and diarrheal (n = 3) isolates were most closely related to B. paranthracis (clade III) and B. cereus sensu stricto (clade IV), respectively. WGS indicated that the 30 emetic isolates (24 and 6 from food and humans, respectively) were closely-related and formed a well-supported clade relative to publicly-available emetic clade III genomes with an identical sequence type (ST 26). When compared to publicly-available emetic clade III ST 26 B. cereus group genomes, the 30 emetic clade III isolates from this outbreak differed from each other by a mean of 8.3 to 11.9 core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while differing from publicly-available genomes by a mean of 301.7 to 528.0 core SNPs, depending on the SNP calling methodology used. Using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay, the strains isolated from this outbreak had only mild detrimental effects on HeLa cell metabolic activity compared to reference diarrheal strain B. cereus ATCC 14579. Based on both WGS and epidemiological data, we hypothesize that the outbreak was a single source outbreak caused by emetic clade III B. cereus belonging to the B. paranthracis species. In addition to showcasing how WGS can be used to characterize B. cereus group strains linked to a foodborne outbreak, we also discuss potential microbiological and epidemiological challenges presented by B. cereus group outbreaks, and we offer recommendations for analyzing WGS data from the isolates associated with them.",

    "abstract": "The physiological processes underlying hemodynamic homeostasis can be modulated by muscle activity and gravitational loading. The effects of antigravity muscle activity on cardiovascular regulation has been observed during orthostatic stress. Here, we evaluated such effects during head-down tilt (HDT). In this posture, the gravitational gradient along the body is different than in upright position, leading to increased central blood volume and reduced venous pooling. We compared the cardiovascular signals obtained with and without antigravity muscle loading during HDT in healthy human subjects, both at rest and during recovery from leg-press exercises. Further, we compared such cardiovascular responses to those obtained during upright position. We found that loading the antigravity muscles during HDT at rest led to significantly higher values of arterial blood pressure than without muscle loading, and restored systolic values to those observed during upright posture. Maintaining muscle loading post-exercise altered the short-term cardiovascular responses, but not the values of the signals five minutes after the exercise. These results demonstrate that antigravity muscle activity modulates cardiovascular regulation during HDT. This modulation should therefore be considered when interpreting cardiovascular responses to conditions that affect both gravity loading and muscle activity, for example bed rest or microgravity.",

    "abstract": "Sympatric diversification is increasingly thought to have played an important role in the evolution of biodiversity around the globe. However, an in situ sympatric origin for co-distributed taxa is difficult to demonstrate empirically because different evolutionary processes can lead to similar biogeographic outcomes-especially in ecosystems with few hard barriers to dispersal that can facilitate allopatric speciation followed by secondary contact (e.g. marine habitats). Here we use a genomic (ddRADseq), model-based approach to delimit a cryptic species complex of tropical sea anemones that are co-distributed on coral reefs throughout the Tropical Western Atlantic. We use coalescent simulations in fastsimcoal2 to test competing diversification scenarios that span the allopatric-sympatric continuum. We recover support that the corkscrew sea anemone Bartholomea annulata (Le Sueur, 1817) is a cryptic species complex, co-distributed throughout its range. Simulation and model selection analyses suggest these lineages arose in the face of historical and contemporary gene flow, supporting a sympatric origin, but an alternative secondary contact model also receives appreciable model support. Leveraging the genome of Exaiptasia pallida we identify five loci under divergent selection between cryptic B. annulata lineages that fall within mRNA transcripts or CDS regions. Our study provides a rare empirical, genomic example of sympatric speciation in a tropical anthozoan-a group that includes reef-building corals. Finally, these data represent the first range-wide molecular study of any tropical sea anemone, underscoring that anemone diversity is under described in the tropics, and highlighting the need for additional systematic studies into these ecologically and economically important species.",

    "abstract": "Populations at the margins of a species geographic range are often thought to be poorly adapted to their environment. According to theoretical predictions, gene flow can inhibit these range edge populations if it disrupts adaptation to local conditions. Alternatively, if range edge populations are small or isolated, gene flow can provide beneficial genetic variation, and may facilitate adaptation to environmental change. We tested these competing predictions in the annual wildflower Clarkia pulchella using greenhouse crosses to simulate gene flow from sources across the geographic range into two populations at the northern range margin. We planted these between-population hybrids in common gardens at the range edge, and evaluated how genetic differentiation and climatic differences between edge populations and gene flow sources affected lifetime fitness. During an anomalously warm study year, gene flow from populations occupying historically warm sites improved fitness at the range edge, and plants with one or both parents from warm populations performed best. The effects of the temperature provenance of gene flow sources were most apparent at early life history stages, but precipitation provenance also affected reproduction. We also found benefits of gene flow that were independent of climate: after climate was controlled for, plants with parents from different populations performed better at later lifestages than those with parents from the same population, indicating that gene flow may improve fitness via relieving homozygosity. Further supporting this result, we found that increasing genetic differentiation of parental populations had positive effects on fitness of hybrid seeds. Gene flow from warmer populations, when it occurs, is likely to contribute adaptive genetic variation to populations at the northern range edge as the climate warms. On heterogeneous landscapes, climate of origin may be a better predictor of gene flow effects than geographic proximity.\\n\\nImpact summaryWhat limits species geographic ranges on the landscape? One process of interest when trying to answer this question is gene flow, which is the movement of genetic material between populations, as might occur in plants when seeds or pollen move across the landscape. One hypothesis that has been proposed is that gene flow from populations in other environments prevents populations at range edges from adapting to their local habitats. Alternatively, it has been suggested that these populations might benefit from gene flow, as it would provide more genetic material for natural selection to act upon.\\n\\nWe tested these predictions in an annual wildflower, Clarkia pulchella. We simulated gene flow by pollinating plants from the range edge with pollen from other populations. Then we planted the resulting seeds into common gardens in the home sites of the range edge populations and recorded their germination, survival, and reproduction. The weather during our experiment was much warmer than historic averages in our garden sites, and perhaps because of this, we found that gene flow from warm locations improved the performance of range edge populations. This result highlights the potential role of gene flow and dispersal in aiding adaptation to warming climates. We also found some positive effects of gene flow that were independent of climate. Even after we statistically controlled for adaptation to temperature and precipitation, plants that were the result of gene flow pollinations produced more seeds and fruits than plants with both parents from the same population. Rather than preventing adaptation, in our experiment, gene flow generally had positive effects on fitness.",

    "abstract": "Pangenome analyses facilitate the interpretation of genetic diversity and evolutionary history of a taxon. However, there is an urgent and unmet need to develop new tools for advanced pangenome construction and visualization, especially for metagenomic data. Here we present an integrated pipeline, named MetaPGN, for construction and graphical visualization of pangenome network from either microbial genomes or metagenomes. Given either isolated genomes or metagenomic assemblies coupled with a reference genome of the targeted taxon, MetaPGN generates a pangenome in a topological network, consisting of genes (nodes) and gene-gene genomic adjacencies (edges) of which biological information can be easily updated and retrieved. MetaPGN also includes a self-developed Cytoscape plugin for layout of and interaction with the resulting pangenome network, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for full exploration of genetic diversity. We demonstrate the utility of MetaPGN by constructing Escherichia coli (E. coli) pangenome networks from five E. coli pathogenic strains and 760 human gut microbiomes respectively, revealing extensive genetic diversity of E. coli within both isolates and gut microbial populations. With the ability to extract and visualize gene contents and gene-gene physical adjacencies of a specific taxon from large-scale metagenomic data, MetaPGN provides advantages in expanding pangenome analysis to uncultured microbial taxa.

    "abstract": "Extensive apoptosis is often seen in patterning mutants, suggesting that tissues can detect and eliminate potentially harmful mis-specified cells. Here we show that the pattern of apoptosis in the embryonic epidermis of Drosophila is not a response to fate mis-specification but can instead be explained by the limiting availability of pro-survival signalling molecules released from locations determined by patterning information. In wild type embryos, the segmentation cascade elicits the segmental production of several EGFR ligands, including the TGF-alpha, Spitz and the Neuregulin, Vein. This leads to an undulating pattern of signalling activity, which prevents expression of the pro-apoptotic gene hid throughout the epidermis. In segmentation mutants, where specific peaks of EGFR ligands fail to form, gaps in signalling activity appear, leading to coincident hid upregulation and subsequent cell death. These data provide a mechanistic understanding of how cell survival, and thus appropriate tissue size, is made contingent on correct patterning.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a central epigenetic modification and has diverse biological functions in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms alike. The IncA/C plasmid genomes are approximately 150kb in length and harbour three methylase genes, two of which demonstrate cytosine specificity. Transformation of the Vibrio cholerae strain C6706 with the IncA/C plasmid pVC211 resulted in a significant relabelling of the methylation patterns on the host chromosomes. The new methylation patterns induced by transformation with IncA/C plasmid were accepted by the restriction enzymes of the hosts restriction modification (RM) system. These data uncover a novel mechanism by which plasmids can be compatible with a hosts RM system and suggest a possible reason that plasmids of the IncA/C family are broad-host-range.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAntibiotic resistance of bacteria is a growing serious problem worldwidely and the horizontal transfer of multi-drug resistance genes mediated by plasmids within and between species of bacteria is the main reason. In the researches of multi-drug resistance of Vibrio cholerae, I have isolated several IncA/C plasmids. What impressed me most is their ability to accumulate the resistant genes. Moreover, they can transfer with high frequency and are stable in several bacterial species. There are at least three Tra regions on the IncA/C plasmid which containing components of the Type 4 Secretion System and are important for conjugative transfer of plasmids. So the horizontal transfer ability of IncA/C plasmids is reasonable. There are three methylase genes on the small genome of IncA/C plasmids, which demonstrate cytosine specificity and are seldom in bacteria. Their modification target and roles are interesting. Here, we analysed the methylation profiles of the host V. choerae induced by the plasmid pVC211 and found that they were completely changed. In addition to replicons, this may be a novel mechanism that plasmid cross the barrier of the hosts RM system and become broad-host range. Changing the activity of methylase in IncA/C plasmids may be a new way to affect the stability of IncA/C plasmids to eliminate these multidrug-resistant plasmids from bacteria.",

The response of each portion in a chronomap is enhanced by preferred and neighboring durations and suppressed by non-preferred durations represented in distant portions of the map. These findings identify duration-sensitive tuning as a neural mechanism underlying the recognition of time and demonstrate for the first time that the representation of an abstract feature such as time can be instantiated by a topographical arrangement of duration-sensitive neural populations.",

Both groups carried out two CPR tests (compression-only and standard CPR) of 10 min divided into five 2-min intermittent periods. The ventilation method was freely chosen by each participant (mouth-to-mouth, pocket-mask or bag-valve-mask). CPR feedback was provided all the time. AMF was measured by tensiomyography at baseline and after each 2-min period of the CPR test, in triceps brachii or rectus abdominis according to the study group.\\n\\nResultsRectus abdominis contraction time increased significantly during the fifth CPR period (p = 0.020).

    "abstract": "BackgroundSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), is a viral hemorrhagic fever with a high case fatality rate. Favipiravir was reported to be effective in the treatment of SFTSV infection in vivo in type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice at treatment dosages of both 60 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day for a duration of 5 days.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, the efficacy of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day against SFTSV infection in an IFNAR-/- mouse infection model was investigated. IFNAR-/- mice were subcutaneously infected with SFTSV at a 1.0 x 106 50% tissue culture infectious dose followed by twice daily administration of favipiravir, comprising a total dose of either 120 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day. The treatment was initiated either immediately post infection or at predesignated time points post infection.\\n\\nResultsAll mice treated with favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day survived when the treatment was initiated at no later than 4 days post infection. A decrease in body weight of mice was observed when the treatment was initiated at 3-4 days post infection. Furthermore, all control mice died. The body weight of mice did not decrease when treatment with favipiravir was initiated immediately post infection at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day.\\n\\nConclusionsSimilar to the literature-reported peritoneal administration of favipiravir at 300 mg/kg/day, the oral administration of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day to IFNAR-/- mice infected with SFTSV was effective.\\n\\nAuthor summarySevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), which is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), is a generalized infectious disease with a high case fatality rate. Currently, no effective therapeutics for SFTS is available; therefore, the development of effective antiviral drugs is needed. Favipiravir exhibits antiviral activity against various RNA viruses, including SFTSV. The present study demonstrated the efficacy of favipiravir in the treatment of SFTSV infection in a lethal mouse model, when the dose was set similar to that approved for anti-influenza drug in humans by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan. The present study suggests that favipiravir is a promising drug for the treatment of SFTSV infection.",

    "abstract": "The brain uses its intrinsic dynamics to actively predict observed sensory inputs, especially under perceptual ambiguity. However, it remains unclear how this inference process is neurally implemented in biasing perception of ambiguous inputs towards the predicted percepts. Using electroencephalography and intracranial recordings, we first show that the alpha-band frequency defines a unified time window for perceptual grouping across both space and time: information segments, either spatially or temporally segregated, will be integrated if they fall within the same alpha cycle. Moreover, predictions employ this prior knowledge on intrinsic alpha frequency to shift perceptual inference towards the most possibly observed percepts. Multivariate decoding analysis showed that perceptual inference, based on variance in prestimulus alpha frequency (PAF), biases post-stimulus neural representations by inducing preactivation of the predicted percepts. fMRI results additionally showed that prestimulus activity and intrinsic organization status in the frontoparietal attentional network predict perceptual outcomes, probably by modulating occipitoparietal PAFs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the role of the epigenome in protein misfolding diseases remains a challenge in light of genetic diversity found in the world-wide population revealed by human genome sequencing efforts and the highly variable respond of the disease population to any therapeutic. An ever-growing body of evidence has shown that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) can have significant benefit in correcting protein misfolding diseases that occur in response to both familial and somatic mutation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a familial autosomal recessive disease, caused by genetic diversity in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, a cAMP-dependent chloride channel expressed at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells in multiple tissues. The potential utility of HDACi in correcting F508del as well as the over 2000 CF-associated variants remains controversial. To address this concern, we examined the impact of FDA-approved HDACi on the trafficking and function of a panel of CFTR variants. Our data reveal that panobinostat (LBH-589) and romidepsin (FK-228) provide functional correction of class II and III CFTR variants, restoring cell surface chloride channel activity in primary human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells. We further demonstrate a synergistic effect of these HDACi with Vx809, that together can significantly restore channel activity for multiple CFTR variants. These data suggest that HDACi can serve to level the cellular playing field for correcting CF-causing mutations, a leveling effect that might also extend to other protein misfolding diseases.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks control the timing of animal behavior rhythms to anticipate daily environmental changes. Fruit flies gradually increase their activity and reach a peak of activity around dawn and dusk. microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. Here we identify Drosophila miR-210 as a critical regulator of circadian rhythms. Under light-dark conditions, flies lacking miR-210 (miR-210KO) exhibit a dramatic phase advance of evening anticipatory behavior about 2 hours. However, circadian rhythms and molecular pacemaker function are intact in miR-210KO flies under constant darkness. Furthermore, we identify that miR-210 determines the evening phase of activity through repression of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2 (Fas2). Ablation of the miR-210 binding site within the 3 UTR of Fas2 (Fas2{Delta}miR-210) by CRISPR-Cas9 advances the evening phase as in miR-210KO. Indeed, miR-210 genetically interacts with Fas2. Moreover, Fas2 abundance is significantly increased in the optic lobe of miR-210KO and Fas2{Delta}miR-210. In addition, overexpression of Fas2 in the miR-210 expressing cells recapitulates the phase advance behavior phenotype of miR-210KO. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which miR-210 regulates circadian locomotor behavior.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCircadian clocks control the timing of animal physiology. Drosophila has been a powerful model in understanding the mechanisms of circadian regulation. Fruit flies anticipate daily environmental changes and exhibit two peaks of locomotor activity around dawn and dusk. Here we identify miR-210 as a critical regulator of evening anticipatory behavior. Depletion of miR-210 in flies advances evening anticipation. Futhermore, we identify the cell adhesion molecular Fas2 as miR-210s target in circadian regulation. Fas2 abundance is increased in fly brain lacking of miR-210. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method, we deleted the miR-210 binding site on 3 untranslated region of Fas2 and observed similar phenotype as miR-210 mutants.

Despite this role, it is genetically dispensable for cell cycle exit in primary fibroblasts in response to growth arrest signals. Mice engineered to be defective for RB-E2F transcriptional control at cell cycle genes were also found to live a full lifespan with no susceptibility to cancer. Based on this background we sought to probe the vulnerabilities of RB-E2F transcriptional control defects found in Rb1R461E,K542E mutant mice (Rb1G) through genetic crosses with other mouse strains. We generated Rb1G/G mice in combination with Trp53 and Cdkn1a deficiencies, as well as in combination with KrasG12D. The Rb1G mutation enhanced Trp53 cancer susceptibility, but had no effect in combination with Cdkn1a deficiency or KrasG12D. Collectively, this study indicates that compromised RB-E2F transcriptional control is not uniformly cancer enabling, but rather has potent oncogenic effects when combined with specific vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Influenza infects an estimated 9 to 35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multi-institution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the US for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of 7 targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the US, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1, 2 and 3 weeks ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision-making.",

However, the estimation of HDL-CEC is based on in vitro cell assays that are laborious and hamper large-scale phenotyping.

We applied the new method in a population-based study of 7,603 individuals including 574 who developed incident coronary heart disease (CHD) during 15 years of follow-up, making this the largest quantitative study for HDL-CEC. As estimated by NMR-spectroscopy, a 1-SD higher HDL-CEC was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD (hazards ratio 0.86; 95%CI 0.79-0.93, adjusted for traditional risk factors and HDL-C). These findings are consistent with published associations based on in vitro cell assays. These corroborative large-scale findings provide further support for a potential protective role of HDL-CEC in CHD, and substantiate this new method and its future applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh adiposity is associated with higher risks for a variety of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of age-adjusted mortality and increased morbidity. This has important implications for the management of healthcare systems, since the endocrinal, cardiometabolic and other changes associated with increased adiposity may be associated with substantial healthcare costs.\\n\\nMethodsWe studied the association between various measures of adiposity and inpatient hospital costs through record linkage between UK Biobank and records of inpatient care in England and Wales. UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort study that aimed to recruit men and women aged between 40 and 69 from 2006 to 2010. We applied generalised linear models to cost per person year to estimate the marginal effect and averaged adjusted predicted cost of adiposity on inpatient costs.\\n\\nResultsValid cost and body mass index (BMI) data from 457,689 participants were available for inferential analysis. Some 54.4% of individuals included in the analysis sample had positive inpatient healthcare costs over the period of follow-up. Median hospital costs per person year of follow-up were {pound}89, compared to mean costs of {pound}481. Mean BMI overall was 27.4 kg/m2 (standard deviation 4.8). The marginal effect of a unit increase in BMI was {pound}13.61 (99% confidence interval: {pound}12.60 to {pound}14.63) per person year of follow up. The marginal effect of a standard deviation increase in BMI was {pound}69.20 (99% confidence interval: {pound}64.98 to {pound}73.42). The marginal effect of becoming obese was {pound}136.35 (99% confidence interval: {pound}124.62 to {pound}148.08). Average adjusted predicted inpatient hospital costs increased almost linearly when modelled using continuous measure of adiposity. Sensitivity analysis of different scenarios did not substantially change these conclusions, although there was some evidence of attenuation of the effects of adiposity when controlling for waist-hip ratios, and when individuals who self-reported any pre-existing conditions were excluded from analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsHigher adiposity is associated with higher inpatient hospital costs. Further scrutiny using causal inferential methods is warranted to establish if further public health investments are required to manage the large healthcare costs observationally associated with overweight and obesity.",

    "abstract": "A recent study reported on a tuberculosis outbreak in a largely Inuit village. Among recently infected individuals, exposure to additional active cases was associated with an increasing probability of developing active disease within a year. Using binomial risk models, we evaluated two potential mechanisms by which multiple infections during the first year following initial infection could account for increasing disease risk with increasing exposures. In the reinfection model, multiple exposures have an independent risk of becoming an infection, and infections contribute independently to active disease. In the threshold model, disease risk follows a sigmoidal function with small numbers of exposures conferring a low risk of active disease and large numbers of exposures conferring a high risk. To determine the dynamic impact of reinfection during the early phase of infection, we performed simulations from a modified Reed-Frost model of TB dynamics following spread from an initial number of cases. We parameterized this model with the maximum likelihood estimates from the reinfection and threshold models in addition to the observed distribution of exposures among recent infections. We find that both models can plausibly account for the observed increase in disease risk with increasing exposures, but the threshold model confers a better fit than a nested model without a threshold (p=0.04). Our simulations indicate that multiple exposures during this critical time period can lead to dramatic increases in outbreak size. In order to decrease TB burden in high-prevalence settings, it may be necessary to implement measures aimed at preventing repeated exposures, in addition to preventing primary infection.",

Nor is it understood how the developmental regulation of let-7 might influence the expression or activities of other microRNAs of the same seed family. Here we show that in C. elegans, the primary let-7 transcript (pri-let-7) is trans-spliced to SL1 splice leader at a position downstream of the let-7 precursor stem-loop, producing a short, polyadenylated downstream mRNA. The trans-splicing event negatively impacts the biogenesis of mature let-7 microRNA in cis, likely by destabilizing the upstream pri-let-7 fragment. Moreover, the trans-spliced downstream mRNA contains complimentary sequences to multiple members of the let-7 seed family (let-7fam), and thereby serves as a sponge to negatively regulate let-7fam function in trans. Thus, this study provides evidence for a mechanism by which splicing of a microRNA primary transcript can negatively regulate said microRNA in cis as well as other microRNAs in trans.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe let-7 primary transcript is trans-spliced to produce an RNA that functions as a sponge that negatively regulates the let-7-family microRNAs.\\nC_LIO_LITrans-splicing of this RNA negatively impacts let-7 microRNA biogenesis.\\nC_LIO_LILIN-28 regulates this trans-splicing event\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sensing environmental temperatures is essential for the survival of ectothermic organisms. In Drosophila, two methodologies are used to study temperature preferences (TP) and the genes involved in thermosensation: two-choice assays and temperature gradients. Whereas two-choice assays reveal a relative TP, temperature gradients can identify the absolute Tp. One drawback of gradients is that small ectothermic animals are susceptible to cold-trapping: a physiological inability to move at the cold area of the gradient. Often cold-trapping cannot be avoided, biasing the resulting TP to lower temperatures. Two mathematical models were previously developed to correct for cold-trapping. These models, however, focus on group behaviour which can lead to overestimation of cold-trapping due to group aggregation. Here we present a mathematical model that estimates the behaviour of individual Drosophilain temperature gradients. The model takes the spatial dimension and temperature difference of the gradient into account, as well as the rearing temperature of the flies. Furthermore, it allows quantifying cold-trapping, reveals true TP, and differentiates between temperature preference and tolerance. Online simulation is hosted at http://igloo.uni-goettingen.de.

    "abstract": "Oculomotor neurons, which regulate eye movement, are resilient to degeneration in the lethal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It would be highly advantageous if motor neuron resilience could be modeled in vitro. Towards this goal, we generated a high proportion of oculomotor neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells through temporal overexpression of Phox2a in neuronal progenitors. We demonstrate, using immunocytochemistry and RNA sequencing, that in vitro generated neurons are bona fide oculomotor neurons based on their similarity to their in vivo counterpart in rodent and man. We also show that in vitro generated oculomotor neurons display a robust activation of survival-promoting Akt signaling and are more resilient to the ALS-like toxicity of kainic acid than spinal motor neurons. Thus, we can generate bona fide oculomotor neurons in vitro which display a resilience similar to that seen in vivo.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSequencing data has become a standard measure for studying diverse cellular activities. For example, gene expression is accurately measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries, protein-DNA interactions are captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), protein-RNA interactions by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP-Seq) or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP-Seq) sequencing, DNA accessibility by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq), and DNase or MNase sequencing libraries. Analysis of these sequencing techniques involve library-specific approaches. However, in all cases, once the sequencing libraries are processed, the result is a count table specifying the estimated number of reads originating from a genomic locus. Differential analysis to determine which loci have different cellular activity under different conditions starts with the count table and iterates through a cycle of data assessment, preparation and analysis. Such iterative approach relies on multiple programs and is therefore a challenge for those without programming skills.\\n\\nResultsWe developed DEBrowser, as an R bioconductor project, to interactively visualize each step of the differential analysis of count data, without any requirement for programming expertise. The application presents a rich and interactive web based graphical user interface based on Rs shiny infrastructure. We use shinys reactive programming interface for a dynamic webpage that responds to user input and integrates its visualization widgets at each stage of the analysis. In this way, every step of the analysis can be displayed in one application that combines many approaches and multiple results. We show DEBrowsers capabilities by reproducing the analysis of two previously published data sets.\\n\\nConclusionsDEBrowser is a flexible, intuitive, web-based analysis platform that enables an iterative and interactive analysis of count data without any requirement of programming knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic data are widely available, and the extent to which they are predictive of protein abundances remains debated. Using multiple public databases, we calculate mRNA and mRNA-to-protein ratio variability across human tissues to quantify and classify genes for protein abundance predictability confidence. We propose that such predictability is best understood as a spectrum. A gene-specific, tissue-independent mRNA-to-protein ratio plus mRNA levels explains [~]80% of protein abundance variance for more predictable genes, as compared to [~]55% for less predictable genes. Protein abundance predictability is consistent with independent mRNA and protein data from two disparate cell lines, and mRNA-to-protein ratios estimated from publicly-available databases have predictive power in these independent datasets. Genes with higher predictability are enriched for metabolic function, tissue development/cell differentiation roles, and transmembrane transporter activity. Genes with lower predictability are associated with cell adhesion, motility and organization, the immune system, and the cytoskeleton. Surprisingly, many genes that regulate mRNA-to-protein ratios are constitutively expressed but also exhibit ratio variability, suggesting a general autoregulation mechanism whereby protein expression profile changes can be implemented quickly, or homeostatic sensing stabilizes protein abundances under fluctuating conditions. Gene classifications and their mRNA-to-protein ratios are provided as a resource to facilitate protein abundance predictions by others.",

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) are essential to the integrity of blood vessels, and therefore an attractive target of therapeutics aimed at improving vascular function. Smooth muscle cells are one of the few cell types that maintain plasticity and can switch phenotypes from differentiated (contractile) to de-differentiated (synthetic) and vice versa. As small regulatory transcripts, miRNAs act as genetic  fine tuners of posttranscriptional events and can act as genetic switches promoting phenotypic switching. The microRNA miR26a targets the BMP signalling effector, smad1. We show that loss of miR26 leads to hemorrhage (a loss of vascular stability) in vivo, suggesting altered vascular differentiation. Reduction in miR26a levels increases smad1 mRNA and phospho-Smad1 (pSmad1) levels. We show that increasing BMP signalling by overexpression of smad1 also leads to hemorrhage and that normalization of Smad1 levels through double knockdown of miR26 and smad1 rescues hemorrhage suggesting a direct relationship between miR26 and smad1 and vascular stability. Using a BMP genetic reporter and pSmad1 staining we show that the effect of miR26 on vascular instability is non-autonomous; BMP signalling is active in embryonic endothelial cells, but not in smooth muscle cells. Nonetheless, increased BMP signalling due to loss of miR26 results in an increase in acta2-expressing smooth muscle cell numbers and promotes a differentiated smooth muscle morphology. Taken together our data suggests that miR26 modulates BMP signalling in endothelial cells and indirectly promotes a differentiated smooth muscle phenotype. Our data also suggests that crosstalk from BMP-responsive endothelium to smooth muscle is important for its differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in sensory areas of the neocortex are known to represent information both about sensory stimuli and behavioral state, but how these two disparate signals are integrated across cortical layers is poorly understood. To study this issue, we measured the coding of visual stimulus orientation and of behavioral state by neurons within superficial and deep layers of area V4 in monkeys while they covertly attended or prepared eye movements to visual stimuli. We show that single neurons and neuronal populations in superficial layers convey more information about the orientation of visual stimuli, whereas single neurons and neuronal populations in deep layers convey greater information about the behavioral relevance of those stimuli. In particular, deep layer neurons encode greater information about the direction of prepared eye movements. These results reveal a division of labor between laminae in the coding of visual input and visually guided behavior.",

    "abstract": "Macular Degeneration, Glaucoma, and Retinitis Pigmentosa are all leading causes of irreversible visual impairment in the elderly, affecting hundreds of millions of patients. Muller glia cells (MGC), the main type of glia found in the vertebrate retina, can resume proliferation in the adult injured retina and contribute to tissue repair. Also, MGC can be genetically reprogrammed through the expression of the transcription factor (TF) Achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) into induced neurons (iNs), displaying key hallmarks of photoreceptors, bipolar and amacrine cells, which may contribute to regenerate the damaged retina. Here, we show that the TF neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2) is also sufficient to lineage-reprogram MGC into iNs. The efficiency of MGC lineage conversion by NEUROG2 is similar to that observed after expression of ASCL1. However, reprogramming efficiency is affected by previous exposure to EGF and FGF2 during the expansion of MGC population. Transduction of either Neurog2 or Ascl1 led to the upregulation of key retina neuronal genes in MGC-derived iNs, but only NEUROG2 induced a consistent increase in the expression of putative retinal ganglion cell (RGC) genes. In vivo electroporation of Neurog2 in the neonatal retina also induced a shift in the generation of retinal cell subtypes, favoring the differentiation RGCs at the expense of MGCs. Altogether, our data indicate that Neurog2 induces lineage conversion of MGCs into RGC-like iNs.",
