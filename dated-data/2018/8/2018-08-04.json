    "abstract": "Motor imagery, that is the mental rehearsal of a motor skill, can lead to improvements when performing the same skill. Here we show a powerful and complementary role, in which motor imagery of movements after actually performing a skill allows learning that is not possible without imagery. We leverage a well-studied motor learning task in which subjects reach in the presence of a dynamic (force-field) perturbation. When two opposing perturbations are presented alternately for the same physical movement, there is substantial interference, preventing any learning. However, when the same physical movement is associated with follow-through movements that differ for each perturbation, both skills can be learned. Here we show that when subjects perform the skill and only imagine the follow-through, substantial learning occurs. In contrast, without such motor imagery there was no learning. Therefore, motor imagery can have a profound effect on skill acquisition even when the imagery is not of the skill itself. Our results suggest that motor imagery may evoke different neural states for the same physical state, thereby enhancing learning.",

    "abstract": "Cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) has undergone a maturation process akin to standard proteomics by adapting key methods such as false discovery rate control and quantification. A seldom-used search setting in proteomics is the consideration of multiple (lighter) alternative values for the monoisotopic precursor mass to compensate for possible misassignments of the monoisotopic peak. Here, we show that monoisotopic peak assignment is a major weakness of current data handling approaches in cross-linking. Cross-linked peptides often have high precursor masses, which reduces the presence of the monoisotopic peak in the isotope envelope. Paired with generally low peak intensity, this generates a challenge that may not be completely solvable by precursor mass assignment routines. We therefore took an alternative route by  in-search assignment of the monoisotopic peak in Xi (Xi-MPA), which considers multiple precursor masses during database search. We compare and evaluate the performance of established preprocessing workflows that partly correct the monoisotopic peak and Xi-MPA on three publicly available datasets. Xi-MPA always delivered the highest number of identifications with ~2 to 4-fold increase of PSMs without compromising identification accuracy as determined by FDR estimation and comparison to crystallographic models.",

    "abstract": "The visual system is supposed to extract distance information from the environment in order to scale the size and distance of objects in the visual scene. The purpose of this article is to challenge this account in three stages: First, I identify three shortcomings of the literature on vergence as our primary cue to near distances. Second, I present the results from two experiments that control for these shortcomings, but at the cost of eradicating vergence and accommodation as effective distance cues (average gain of y = 0.161x + 38.64). Third, I argue that if all our cues to distance are either (a) ineffective (vergence; accommodation; motion parallax), (b) merely relative (angular size; diplopia), or (c) merely cognitive (familiar size; vertical disparity), then the visual system does not appear to extract absolute distance information, and we should be open to the possibility that vision functions without scale.",

    "abstract": "Cleavage of the amyloid precursor proteins (APP) transmembrane domain (TMD) by {gamma}-secretase is a crucial step in the aetiology of Alzheimers Disease (AD). Mutations in the APP TMD alter cleavage and lead to familial forms of AD (FAD). The majority of FAD mutations shift the preference of initial cleavage from {varepsilon}49 to {varepsilon}48, thus raising the AD-related A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratio. The I45T mutation is among the few FAD mutations that do not alter {varepsilon}-site preference, while it dramatically reduces the efficiency of {varepsilon}-cleavage. Here, we investigate the impact of the I45T mutation on the backbone dynamics of the substrate TMD. Amide exchange experiments and molecular dynamics simulations in solvent and a lipid bilayer reveal an increased stability of amide hydrogen bonds at the {zeta}-and {gamma}-cleavage sites. Stiffening of the H-bond network is caused by an additional H-bond between the T45 side chain and the TMD backbone, which alters dynamics within the cleavage domain. In particular, the increased H-bond stability inhibits an upward movement of the {varepsilon}-sites in the I45T mutant. Thus, an altered presentation of {varepsilon}-sites to the active site of {gamma}-secretase as a consequence of restricted local flexibility provides a rationale for reduced {varepsilon}-cleavage efficiency of the I45T mutant.",

Stochastic external inputs are applied to the leaves causing large spiking events. Those events propagate along the tree branches and, eventually, exciting the root node. Using Hodgkin-Huxley type nodal elements, such a setup serves as a model for sensory neurons with branched myelinated distal terminals. We focus on the influence of the variability of tree structures on the spike train statistics of the root node. We present a statistical description of random tree network and show how the structural variability translates into the collective network dynamics. In particular, we show that in the physiologically relevant case of strong coupling the variability of collective response is determined by the joint probability distribution of the total number of leaves and nodes. We further present analytical results for the strong coupling limit in which the entire tree network can be represented by an effective single element.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.19.ll, 87.19.lb, 87.19.lc, 05.45.Xt, 05.10.Gg",

    "abstract": "On the basis of the perturbation nature of allosteric communication, a computational framework is proposed for estimating the energetics of signaling caused by the ligand binding and mutations. The perturbations are modelled as alterations of the strenght of interactions in the protein contact network in the binding sites and neighborhoods of mutated residues. The combination of protein harmonic modelling with effect of perturbations and the estimate of local partition functions allow one to evaluate the energetics of allosteric communication at single residue level. The potential allosteric effect of a protein residue position, modulation range, is given by the difference between responses to stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. We show a versatility of the approach on three case studies of proteins with different mechanisms of allosteric regulation, testing it on their known regulatory and functional sites. Allosteric Signaling Maps (ASMs) obtained on the basis of residue-by-residue scanning are proposed as a comprehensive tool to explore a relationship between mutations allosterically modulating protein activity and those that mainly affect protein stability. Analysis of ASMs shows distance dependence of the mode switching in allosteric signaling, emphasizing the role of domains/subunits in protein allosteric communication as elements of a percolative system. Finally, ASMs can be used to complement and tune already existing signaling and to design new elements of allosteric regulation.\\n\\nSignificanceUniversality of allosteric signaling in proteins, molecular machines, and receptors and great advantages of prospected allosteric drugs in highly specific, non-competitive, and modulatory nature of their actions call for deeper theoretical understanding of allosteric communication. In the energy landscape paradigm underliying the molecular mechanisms of protein function, allosteric signalling is the result of any perturbation, such as ligand binding, mutations, intermolecular interactions etc. We present a computational model, allowing to tackle the problem of modulating the energetics of protein allosteric communication. Using this method, Allosteric Signaling Maps (ASMs) are proposed as an approach to exhaustively describe allosteric signaling in the protein, making it possible to take protein activity under allosteric control.",

An sCMOS camera can effectively increase the imaging rate due to its large field of view and fast imaging speed. Using an sCMOS camera for SMLM imaging can significantly improve the imaging time resolution, but the unique single pixel-dependent readout noise of sCMOS cameras severely limits their application in SMLM imaging. This paper develops a Hessian-based SMLM (Hessian-SMLM) method that can correct the variance, gain and offset of a single pixel of a camera and effectively eliminate the pixel-dependent readout noise of sCMOS cameras, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Using Hessian SMLM to image mEos3.2-labeled actin was able to significantly reduce the artifacts due to camera noise.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the circuits that promote an efficient resolution of inflammation is crucial to deciphering the molecular and cellular processes required to promote tissue repair. Macrophages play a central role in the regulation of inflammation, resolution and repair/regeneration. Using a model of skeletal muscle injury and repair, herein we identify Annexin A1 (AnxA1) as the extracellular trigger of macrophage skewing towards a pro-reparative phenotype. Brought into the injured tissue initially by migrated neutrophils, and then over-expressed in infiltrating macrophages, AnxA1 activates FPR2/ALX receptors and the downstream AMPK signalling cascade leading to macrophage skewing, dampening of inflammation and regeneration of muscle fibres. Mice lacking AnxA1 in all cells or in myeloid cells only display a defect in this reparative process. In vitro experiments recapitulated these properties, with AMPK null macrophages lacking AnxA1-mediated polarization. Collectively, these data identify the AnxA1/FPR2/AMPK axis as a novel pathway in skeletal muscle injury regeneration.",

    "abstract": "During cell division, chromosomes must be folded into their compact mitotic form to ensure their segregation. This process is thought to be largely controlled by the action of condensin SMC protein complexes on chromatin fibers. However, how condensins organize metaphase chromosomes is not understood. We have combined micromanipulation of single human mitotic chromosomes, sub-nanonewton force measurement, siRNA interference of condensin subunit expression, and fluorescence microscopy, to analyze the role of condensin in large-scale chromosome organization. Condensin depletion leads to a dramatic (~10 fold) reduction in chromosome elastic stiffness relative to the native, non-depleted case. We also find that prolonged metaphase stalling of cells leads to overloading of chromosomes with condensin, with abnormally high chromosome stiffness. These results demonstrate that condensin is a main element controlling the stiffness of mitotic chromosomes. Isolated, slightly stretched chromosomes display a discontinuous condensing staining pattern, suggesting that condensins organize mitotic chromosomes by forming isolated compaction centers that do not form a continuous scaffold.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are designed to serve as a single summary measure, condensing information from a large number of genetic variants associated with a disease. They have been used for stratification and prediction of disease risk. The construction of a PRS often depends on the purpose of the study, the available data/summary estimates, and the underlying genetic architecture of a disease. In this paper, we consider several choices for constructing a PRS using summary data obtained from various publicly-available sources including the UK Biobank and evaluate their abilities to predict outcomes derived from electronic health records (EHR). Weexamine the three most common skin cancer subtypes in the USA: basal cellcarcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The genetic risk profiles of subtypes may consist of both shared and unique elements and we construct PRS to understand the common versus distinct etiology. This study is conducted using data from 30,702 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European descent from the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. Using these PRS for various skin cancer subtypes, we conduct a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) within the MGI data to evaluate their association with secondary traits. PheWAS results are then replicated using population-based UK Biobank data. We develop an accompanying visual catalog called PRSweb that provides detailed PheWAS results and allows users to directly compare different PRS construction methods. The results of this study can provide guidance regarding PRS construction in future PRS-PheWAS studies using EHR data involving disease subtypes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn the study of genetically complex diseases, polygenic risk scores synthesize information from multiple genetic risk factors to provide insight into a patients risk of developing a disease based on his/her genetic profile. These risk scores can be explored in conjunction with health and disease information available in the electronic medical records. They may be associated with diseases that may be related to or precursors of the underlying disease of interest. Limited work is available guiding risk score construction when the goal is to identify associations across the medical phenome. In this paper, we compare different polygenic risk score construction methods in terms of their relationships with the medical phenome. We further propose methods for using these risk scores to decouple the shared and unique genetic profiles of related diseases and to explore related diseases shared and unique secondary associations. Leveraging and harnessing the rich data resources of the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and the larger population-based UK Biobank study, we investigated the performance of genetic risk profiling methods for the three most common types of skin cancer: melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.",

In budding yeast, replication originates from Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARSs), generally located in intergenic regions. The influence of transcription on ARSs function has been studied for decades, but these earlier studies have necessarily neglected the role of non-annotated transcription. We studied the relationships between pervasive transcription and replication origin activity using high-resolution transcription maps. We show that ARSs alter the pervasive transcription landscape by pausing and terminating neighboring RNAPII transcription, thus limiting the occurrence of pervasive transcription within origins. We provide evidence that quasi-symmetrical binding of the ORC complex to ARS borders is responsible for pausing/termination. We also show that low, physiological levels of pervasive transcription impact the function of replication origins. Overall, our results have important implications for understanding the impact of genomic location on origin function.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of mutation rate helps us build evolutionary models and make sense of genetic variation. Recent work indicates that the frequencies of specific mutation types have been elevated in Europe, and that many more, subtler signatures of global polymorphism variation may yet remain unidentified. Here, we present an analysis of the 1,000 Genomes Project (phase 3), suggesting additional putative signatures of mutation rate variation across populations and the extent to which they are shaped by local sequence context. First, we compiled a list of the most significantly variable polymorphism types in a cross-continental statistical test. Clustering polymorphisms together, we observed four sets of substitution types that showed similar trends of relative mutation rate across populations, and describe the patterns of these mutational clusters among continental groups. For the majority of these signatures, we found that a single flanking base pair of sequence context was sufficient to determine the majority of enrichment or depletion of a mutation type. However, local genetic context up to 2-3 base pairs away contributes additional variability, and helps to interpret a previously noted enrichment of certain polymorphism types in some East Asian groups. Building our understanding of mutation rate in this way can help us to construct more accurate evolutionary models and better understand the mechanisms that underlie genetic change.",

    "abstract": "Failure of the most recent tuberculosis (TB) vaccine trial to boost BCG mediated anti-TB immunity despite highly durable Th1-specific central (TCM) and effector (TEM) memory cell responses, highlights the importance of identifying optimal T cell targets for protective vaccines. Here we describe a novel, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific IFN-{gamma}+CD4+ T cell population expressing surface markers characteristic of naive T cells (TNLM), that were induced in both human (CD45RA+CCR7+CD27+CD95-) and murine (CD62L+CD44-Sca-1+CD122-) systems in response to mycobacteria. In BCG vaccinated subjects and those with latent TB infection, TNLM cells, compared to bonafide naive CD4+ T cells were identified by absence of CD95 expression and had increased expression CCR7 and CD27, the activation markers T-bet, CD69 and PD-1 and the survival marker CD74. Increased TNLM frequencies were noted in the lung and spleen of wild type C57BL6 mice at 2 weeks after infection with Mtb, and progressively decreased at later time points, a pattern not seen in TNF-+CD4+ T cells expressing naive cell surface markers. Importantly, adoptive transfer of highly purified TNLM from vaccinated ESAT-61-20-specific TCR transgenic mice conferred superior protection against Mtb infection in Rag-/- mice when compared with total meory populations (central and effector memory cells). Thus, TNLM cells may represent a memory T cell population that if optimally targeted may significantly improve future TB vaccine responses.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo identify therapeutic a bacteriophage that kills diarrheagenic enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) while leaving the human microbiome intact.\\n\\nMethodologyPhages from wastewater in Portland, OR, were screened for bacteriolytic activity using an overlay assay, and isolated in a sequential procedure to enrich for the recognition of core bacterial antigens. Electron microscopy and genome sequencing were performed to classify the isolated phage, and the host range was determined by spot tests and plaque assays. One-step growth curves and time-kill assays were conducted to characterize the life cycle of the phage, and to interrogate the multiplicity of infection (MOI) necessary for killing. A mouse model of infection was used to determine whether the phage could be used therapeutically against EAEC in vivo. Anaerobic culture in the presence of human fecal bacteria determined whether the phage could kill EAEC in vitro, and to assess whether the microbiome had been altered.\\n\\nResultsThe isolated phage, termed Escherichia virus PDX, is a member of the strictly lytic Myoviridae family of viruses. Phage PDX killed EAEC isolate EN1E-0227, a case-associated isolate from a child in rural Tennessee, in a dose-dependent manner, and also formed plaques on case-associated clinical EAEC isolates from Columbian children suffering from diarrhea. A single dose of PDX, at a MOI of 100, one day post infection, reduced the population of recovered EAEC isolate EN1E-0227 bacteria in fecal pellets in a mouse model of colonization, over a five-day period. Phage PDX also killed EAEC EN1E-0227 when cultured anaerobically in vitro in the presence of human fecal bacteria. While the addition of EAEC EN1E-0227 reduced the -diversity of the human microbiota, that of the cultures with either feces alone, feces with EAEC and PDX, or with just the PDX phage were not different statistically, as measured by Chao1 and Shannon diversity indices. Additionally, {beta}-diversity and differential abundance analyses show that conditions with PDX added were not different from feces alone, but all groups were significantly different from feces + EAEC.\\n\\nConclusionsThe strictly bacteriolytic, Myoviridae Escherichia virus PDX killed EAEC isolate EN1E-0227 bacteria both in vivo and in vitro, while simultaneously not altering the diversity of normal human microbiota in anaerobic culture. Thus, the PDX phage could be part of an effective therapeutic intervention for children in developing countries who suffer from acute, or persistent EAEC-mediated diarrhea, and to help reduce the serious effects of environmental enteropathy. Because the emerging pathogen EAEC is now the second leading cause of travelers diarrhea, PDX could also provide therapeutic relief for these individuals, particularly in light of the growing crisis of antibiotic resistances.",

The OM is asymmetric and contains an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or lipooligosaccharides (LOS) and an inner leaflet of glycerophospholipids (GPL). We screened Acinetobacter baumannii transposon mutants and identified a number of mutants with OM defects, including an ABC transporter system homologous to the Mla system in E. coli. We further show that this opportunistic, antibiotic-resistant pathogen uses this multicomponent protein complex and ATP hydrolysis at the inner membrane to promote GPL export to the OM. The broad conservation of the Mla system in Gram-negative bacteria suggests the system may play a conserved role in OM biogenesis. The importance of the Mla system to Acinetobacter baumannii OM integrity and antibiotic sensitivity suggests that its components may serve as new antimicrobial therapeutic targets.",

We pre-treated maize (Zea mays L.) by foliar application of DCPTA and subsequently exposed the plants to soil drought and rewatering conditions during the pre-female inflorescence emergence stage. Exogenous DCPTA significantly alleviated drought-induced decreases in maize yield, shoot and root relative growth rate (RGR), leaf relative water content (RLWC), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr), nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), and soluble protein contents, and nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) activities; increases in the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), the ammonium (NH4+) and free amino acid contents, and the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and protease activities. Simultaneously, exogenous DCPTA improved the spatial and temporal distribution of roots and increased the root hydraulic conductivity (Lp), flow rate of root-bleeding sap and NO3- delivery rates. Moreover, Exogenous DCPTA protected the chloroplast structure from drought injury. Taken together, our results suggest that exogenous DCPTA mitigates the repressive effects of drought on N metabolism and subsequently enhances drought tolerance during the pre-female inflorescence emergence stage of maize.\\n\\nHighlightsThis is the first article that explores the effects of DCPTA on nitrogen metabolism and the first article that explores the effects of DCPTA on crops under soil drought conditions.",

    "abstract": "Common approaches to characterize the structure of the DNA in the nucleus, such as the different Chromosome Conformation Capture methods, have not currently been widely applied to different tissue types due to several practical difficulties including the requirement for intact cells to start the sample preparation. In contrast, techniques based on sodium bisulfite conversion of DNA to assay DNA methylation, have been widely applied to many different tissue types in a variety of organisms. Recent work has shown the possibility of inferring some aspects of the three dimensional DNA structure from DNA methylation data, raising the possibility of three dimensional DNA structure prediction using the large collection of already generated DNA methylation datasets. We propose a simple method to predict the values of the first eigenvector of the Hi-C matrix of a sample (and hence the positions of the A and B compartments) using only the GC content of the sequence and a single whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) experiment which yields information on the methylation levels and their variability along the genome. We train and test our model on 10 samples for which we have data from both bisulfite sequencing and chromosome conformation experiments and our most relevant finding is that the variability of DNA methylation along the sequence is often a better predictor than methylation itself. We then run a prediction on 206 DNA methylation profiles produced by the Blueprint project and use ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data to confirm that the forecasted eigenvector delineates correctly the physical chromatin compartments observed with the Hi-C experiment.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is the result of mutagenic processes that can be inferred from tumor genomes by analyzing rate spectra of point mutations, or \"mutational signatures\". Here we present SparseSignatures, a novel framework to extract signatures from somatic point mutation data. Our approach incorporates a user-specified background signature, employs regularization to reduce noise in non-background signatures, uses cross-validation to identify the number of signatures, and is scalable to large datasets. We show that SparseSignatures outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on simulated data using a variety of standard metrics. We then apply SparseSignatures to whole genome sequences of pancreatic and breast tumors, discovering well-differentiated signatures that are linked to known mutagenic mechanisms and are strongly associated with patient clinical features.\n\nAuthors SummaryCancer is a genetic disease, occurring as a result of mutagenic processes causing DNA somatic mutations in genes controlling cellular growth and division. These somatic mutations arise from processes such as defective DNA repair and environmental mutagens, which massively increase the rate of somatic variants. As a result, due to the specificity of molecular lesions caused by such processes, and the specific repair mechanisms deployed by the cell to mitigate the damage, mutagenic processes generate characteristic point mutation rate spectra which are called mutational signatures. These signatures can indicate which mutagenic processes are active in a tumor, reveal biological differences between cancer subtypes, and may be useful markers for therapeutic response. Here, we develop SparseSignatures, a novel framework for mutational signature discovery capable of both identifying the active signatures in a dataset of point mutations and calculating their exposure values, i.e., the number of mutations originating from each signature in each patient. We show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on simulated data using a variety of standard metrics and then apply SparseSignatures to whole genome sequences of pancreatic and breast tumors, discovering well-differentiated signatures that are linked to known mutagenic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The maternal factor Zelda is broadly bound to zygotic enhancers during early fly embryogenesis, and has been shown to be important for the expression of a large number of genes. However, its function remains poorly understood. Here, we carried out detailed analysis of the functional role of Zelda on the activities of a group of enhancers that drive patterned gene expression along the anterior -posterior axis. We found that among these enhancers, only one lost its activity entirely when all its Zelda bind sites were mutated. For all others, mutations of all of their Zelda binding sites only had limited effect, which varied temporally and spatially. These results suggest that Zld may exert a quantitative effect on a broad range of enhancers, which presumably is critical to generate highly diverse spatial and temporal expression patterns for different genes in the developmental gene network in fly embryo. Lastly, we found that the observed effect of Zelda site mutations was much stronger when a mutant enhancer was tested using a BAC based reporter construct than a simple reporter construct, suggesting that the effect of Zld is dependent on chromatin environment.",

We built and employed IDseq, a cloud-based, open access, bioinformatics platform and service to identify microbes from metagenomic next-generation sequencing of tissue samples. In this pilot study, we evaluated blood, nasopharyngeal, and stool specimens from 94 children (aged 2-54 months) with febrile illness admitted to Tororo District Hospital, Uganda.\\n\\nResultsThe most common pathogens identified were Plasmodium falciparum (51.1% of samples) and parvovirus B19 (4.4%) from blood; human rhinoviruses A and C (40%), respiratory syncytial virus (10%), and human herpesvirus 5 (10%) from nasopharyngeal swabs; and rotavirus A (50% of those with diarrhea) from stool. Among other potential pathogens, we identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx of a child with rash and sepsis.

To address this problem, we developed an automated analysis platform that extracts components of size and shape for carrot shoots and roots, which are necessary to advance carrot breeding and genetics. This method reliably measured variation in shoot size and shape, leaf number, petiole length, and petiole width as evidenced by high correlations with hundreds of manual measurements. Similarly, root length and biomass were accurately measured from the images. This platform quantified shoot and root shapes in terms of principal components, which do not have traditional, manually-measurable equivalents. We applied the pipeline in a study of a six-parent diallel population and an F2 mapping population consisting of 316 individuals. We found high levels of repeatability within a growing environment, with low to moderate repeatability across environments. We also observed co-localization of quantitative trait loci for shoot and root characteristics on chromosomes 1, 2, and 7, suggesting these traits are controlled by genetic linkage and/or pleiotropy. By increasing the number of individuals and phenotypes that can be reliably quantified, the development of a high-throughput image analysis pipeline to measure carrot shoot and root morphology will expand the scope and scale of breeding and genetic studies.",

In two of the mutants, Jumble and Couscous, single cells failed to develop into orderly rosettes but instead aggregated promiscuously into amorphous clumps of cells. Both mutants mapped to lesions in genes encoding glycosyltransferases and the mutations perturbed glycosylation patterns in the extracellular matrix (ECM). In animals, glycosyltransferases transfer activated sugars to donor molecules and thereby sculpt the polysaccharide-rich ECM, regulate integrin and cadherin activity, and, when disrupted, contribute to tumorigenesis. The finding that glycosyltransferases promote proper rosette development and prevent cell aggregation in S. rosetta suggests a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating development and preventing abnormal tumor-like multicellularity.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTA genetic screen reveals that glycosyltransferases are required for proper rosette development and the prevention of cell clumping in one of the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate S. rosetta.",

Using an image-based morphology assay to capture a broad range of phenotypes, we assessed the effect of 12768 pairwise RNAi perturbations in six different conditions. We found that genetic interactions form in different trajectories and developed an algorithm, termed MODIFI, to analyze how genetic interactions rewire over time.

    "abstract": "An accurate estimate of limb position is necessary for movement planning, before and after motor learning. Where we localize our unseen hand after a reach depends on felt hand position, or proprioception, but in studies and theories on motor adaptation this is quite often neglected in favour of predicted sensory consequences based on efference copies of motor commands. Both sources of information should contribute, so here we set out to further investigate how much of hand localization depends on proprioception and how much on predicted sensory consequences. We use a training paradigm combining robot controlled hand movements with rotated visual feedback that eliminates the possibility to update predicted sensory consequences ( exposure training), but still recalibrates proprioception, as well as a classic training paradigm with self-generated movements in another set of participants. After each kind of training we measure participants hand location estimates based on both efference-based predictions and afferent proprioceptive signals with self-generated hand movements ( active localization) as well as based on proprioception only with robot-generated movements ( passive localization). In the exposure training group, we find indistinguishable shifts in passive and active hand localization, but after classic training, active localization shifts more than passive, indicating a contribution from updated predicted sensory consequences. Both changes in open-loop reaches and hand localization are only slightly smaller after exposure training as compared to after classic training, confirming that proprioception plays a large role in estimating limb position and in planning movements, even after adaptation.

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and autism share some genotipic and phenotypic aspects as connectome miswiring and common cognitive deficits. Currently, there are no medical tests available for either disorders, and diagnostics for both of them include direct reports of relatives and clinical evaluation by a psychiatrist. Despite several medical imaging biomarkers have been proposed in the past, novel effective biomarkers or improvements of the existing ones is still need. This work proposes a dynamic functional connectome analysis combined with machine learning techniques to complement the present diagnostic procedure. We used the moving window technique to locate a set of dynamic functional connectivity states, and then use them as features to classify subjects as autism/schizophrenia or control. Moreover, by using dynamic functional connectivity measures we investigate the question whether those two disorders overlap, namely whether schizophrenia is part of the autism spectrum and which brain region could be involved in both disorders. The results reveal that both static and dynamic functional connectivity can be used to classify subjects with schizophrenia or autism. Lastly, some brain regions show similar functional flexibility in both autism and schizophrenia cohorts giving further possible proofs of their overlaps.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the long-held assumption that transposons are normally only expressed in the germ-line, recent evidence shows that transcripts of transposable element (TE) sequences are frequently found in the somatic cells. However, the extent of variation in TE transcript levels across different tissues and different individuals are unknown, and the co-expression between TEs and host gene mRNAs have not been examined.\\n\\nResultsHere we report the variation in TE derived transcript levels across tissues and between individuals observed in the non-tumorous tissues collected for The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found core TE co-expression modules consisting mainly of transposons, showing correlated expression across broad classes of TEs. Despite this co-expression within tissues, there are individual TE loci that exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, when compared across tissues. The core TE modules were negatively correlated with other gene modules that consisted of immune response genes in interferon signaling. KRAB Zinc Finger Proteins (KZFPs) were over-represented gene members of the TE modules, showing positive correlation across multiple tissues. But we did not find overlap between TE-KZFP pairs that are co-expressed and TE-KZFP pairs that are bound in published ChIP-seq studies.\\n\\nConclusionsWe find unexpected variation in TE derived transcripts, within and across non-tumorous tissues. We describe a broad view of the RNA state for non-tumorous tissues exhibiting higher level of TE transcripts. Tissues with higher level of TE transcripts have a broad range of TEs co-expressed, with high expression of a large number of KZFPs, and lower RNA levels of immune genes.",

    "abstract": "Zizania latifolia Turcz., which is mainly distributed in Asia, has had a long cultivation history as a cereal and vegetable crop. On infection with the smut fungus Ustilago esculenta, Z. latifolia becomes an edible vegetable, water bamboo. Two main cultivars, with a green shell and red shell, are cultivated for commercial production in Taiwan. Previous studies indicated that cultivars of Z. latifolia may be related to infection with U. esculenta isolates. However, related research is limited. The infection process of the corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis is coupled with sexual development and under control of the mating type locus. Thus, we aimed to use knowledge of U. maydis to reveal the mating system of U. esculenta. We collected water bamboo and isolated 145 U. esculenta strains from Taiwans major production areas. By using PCR and idiomorph screening among meiotic offspring and field isolates, we identified three idiomorphs of the mating type locus and found no sequence recombination between them. Whole-genome sequencing (Illumina and Pacbio) suggested that the mating system of U. esculenta was bipolar. Mating type locus 1 (MAT-1) was 555,862 bp, and contained 44% repeated sequences. Sequence comparison revealed that U. esculenta MAT-1 shared better conservation with the sex chromosome of U. maydis than U. hordei. These results can be utilized to further explore the genomic diversity of U. esculenta isolates and their application for water bamboo breeding.",

    "abstract": "Visual processing is largely organized into ON and OFF pathways that signal stimulus increments and decrements, respectively. These pathways exhibit natural pairings based on morphological and physiological similarities, such as ON and OFF alpha ganglion cells in the mammalian retina. Several studies have noted asymmetries in the properties of ON and OFF pathways. For example, the spatial receptive fields (RFs) of OFF alpha cells are systematically smaller than ON alpha cells. Analysis of natural scenes suggests these asymmetries are optimal for visual encoding. To test the generality of ON-OFF asymmetries, we measured the spatiotemporal RF properties of multiple RGC types in rat retina. Through a quantitative and serial classification, we identified three functional pairs of ON and OFF RGCs. We analyzed the structure of their RFs and compared spatial integration, temporal integration, and gain across ON and OFF pairs. Similar to previous results from cat and primate, RGC types with larger spatial RFs exhibited briefer temporal integration and higher gain. However, each pair of ON and OFF RGC types exhibited distinct asymmetric relationships between receptive field properties, some of which were opposite to previous reports. These results reveal the functional organization of six RGC types in the rodent retina and indicate that ON-OFF asymmetries are pathway specific.",

    "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes might influence the detoxification activities of the enzymes predisposing individuals to a lot of diseases. Owing to the presence of these genetic variants, inter-individual and ethnic differences in GSTs detoxification capacity have been observed in various populations. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine GST variants in 100 healthy individuals from Goiania - GO with a new methodology. GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 variants were analyzed by a MPLA (Multiplex Ligation by Probe Amplification) approach. The results obtained for the GSTM1 gene in exon 3 we found 43 deletions and 24 duplications, for exon 5 we found 45 deletions and 11 duplications, for the GSTT1 gene in exon 1 we found 14 deletions, and 18 duplications, for exon 5 we found 23 deletions and 28 duplications. For the GSTP1 gene in exon 3, we found only 1 deletion and for exon 4 we do not found any alteration. These findings in healthy population, give us such more information for the future epidemiological and clinical studies. Using to examine the effect of these combinations in drugs metabolism and cancer predisposition, further largest group would be needed, since their frequencies are quite low. To our of GSTs variations, this is the first study with this methodology indicating the frequencies of genetic variants of GST superfamily in a health population in a Goiania population, and this study gives us new possibilities and data for new research using this same methodology.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine (DA) hypothesis posits the increase of mesolimbic dopamine levels as a defining commonality of addictive drugs, initially causing reinforcement, eventually leading to compulsive consumption. While much experimental evidence from psychostimulants supports this hypothesis, it has been challenged for opioid reinforcement. Here, we use genetically encoded DA and calcium indicators as well as cFos to reveal that heroin activates DA neurons located in the medial part of the VTA, preferentially projecting to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations of VTA DA or GABA neurons establish a causal link to heroin reinforcement. Inhibition of DA neurons blocked heroin self-administration, while heroin inhibited optogenetic self-stimulation of DA neurons. Likewise, heroin occluded the self-inhibition of VTA GABA neurons. Together, these experiments support a model of disinhibition of a subset of VTA DA neurons in opioid reinforcement.",
