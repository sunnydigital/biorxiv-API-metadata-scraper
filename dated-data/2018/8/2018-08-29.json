    "abstract": "Diptera is a megadiverse order, reaching its peak of diversity in Neotropics, although our knowledge of dipteran fauna of this region is grossly deficient. This applies even for the most studied families, as Drosophilidae. Despite its position of evidence, most aspects of the biology of these insects are still poorly understood, especially those linked to natural communities. Field studies on drosophilids are highly biased to fruit-breeders species. Flower-breeding drosophilids, however, are worldwide distributed, especially in tropical regions, although being mostly neglected. The present paper shows results of a biodiversity inventory of flower-breeding drosophilids carried out in several localities in Brazil, based on samples of 125 plant species, from 47 families. Drosophilids were found in flowers of 56 plant species, from 18 families. The fauna discovered showed to be highly unknown, comprising 28 species, 12 of them (>40%) still undescribed. Not taking in account opportunist species, two thirds of the diversity exclusive from flowers were undescribed. The Drosophila bromeliae species group was the most representative taxon, with eight species (six undescribed), including four polyphagous and four Solanum-specialised species. This specialisation on Solanum is reported for the first time for Drosophila. Other taxa of restrict flower-breeding drosophilids were the Drosophila lutzii species group and the genus Zygothrica. Some specimens of the genera Cladochaeta, Rhinoleucophenga and Scaptomyza were found, but their relations to flowers are unclear. Additionally, ten species of ample niche was found using flowers opportunistically. Localities and host plants are recorded for all species collected.",

    "abstract": "Flotillin-1 (Flot1) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed lipid raft-associated scaffolding protein. Migration of Flot1-deficient neutrophils is impaired due to a decrease in myosin II-mediated contractility. Flot1 also accumulates in the uropod of polarized T cells, suggesting an analogous role in T cell migration. Here, we analyzed morphology and migration of naive and memory WT and Flot1-/- CD8+ T cells in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues with intravital two-photon microscopy, as well as their clonal expansion during antiviral immune responses. Flot1-/- CD8+ T cells displayed minor alterations in cell shape and motility parameters in vivo but showed comparable homing to lymphoid organs and infiltration into non-lymphoid tissues. Taken together, Flot1 plays a detectable but unexpectedly minor role for CD8+ T cell behavior under physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Due to the preeminence of reductionist approaches, our understanding of plant responses to combined stresses is limited. We speculated that light-quality signals of neighboring vegetation might increase susceptibility to heat shocks because shade reduces tissue temperature and hence the likeness of heat shocks. In contrast, plants of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under low red / far-red ratios typical of shade were less damaged by heat stress than plants grown under simulated sunlight. Shade reduces the activity of phytochrome B (phyB) and the phyB mutant showed high tolerance to heat stress even under simulated sunlight. The enhanced heat tolerance under low red / far-red ratios failed in a multiple mutant of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs. The phyB mutant showed reduced expression of several fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes, proportion of fully unsaturated fatty acids and electrolyte leakage of membranes exposed to a heat shock. Activation of phyB by red light also reduced thermotolerance of dark-grown (etiolated) seedlings but not via changes in FAD gene expression and membrane stability. We propose that the reduced photosynthetic capacity linked to thermotolerant membranes would be less costly under shade, where the light input itself limits photosynthesis.",

To investigate mitochondrial diversity in vivo, we developed an efficient protocol to isolate cell type-specific mitochondria based on a new MitoTag mouse. We profiled the mitochondrial proteome of three major neural cell types in cerebellum and identified a substantial number of differential mitochondrial markers for these cell types in mice and humans. Based on predictions from these proteomes, we demonstrate that astrocytic mitochondria metabolize long-chain fatty acids more efficiently than neurons. Moreover, we identified Rmdn3 as a major determinant of ER-mitochondria proximity in Purkinje cells. Our novel approach enables exploring mitochondrial diversity on the functional and molecular level in many in vivo contexts.",

Here we show that the interplay of both intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics is required to explain the intermittency observed in continuous tracking movements. Using spatiotemporal perturbations in humans, we demonstrate that apparently discrete submovements made 2-3 times per second reflect constructive interference between motor errors and continuous feedback corrections that are filtered by intrinsic circuitry in the motor system. Local field potentials in monkey motor cortex revealed characteristic signatures of a Kalman filter giving rise to both low-frequency cortical cycles during movement, and delta oscillations during sleep. We interpret these results within the framework of optimal feedback control, and suggest that the intrinsic rhythmicity of motor cortical networks reflects an internal model of external dynamics which is used for state estimation during feedback-guided movement.",

In our previous proteomics research, the expression of ITGB2 has differences between epicardial and subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, the association between the reported variants and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) was not confirmed.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a case-control study consisted of 496 CHD patients and 367 controls. The two groups are adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes status and the proportion of dyslipidemia. The genotypes and allele frequency of variants rs838880,rs5888,rs5889 in SRB1 and rs235326,rs2070947,rs2070946 in ITGB2 were determined using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY technology.\\n\\nResultsThe genotypes frequencies of all the six SNPs were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test. For gene SRB1 rs838880, there was a significant difference in the alleles frequency(p=0.017), genotype frequency(p=0.0028), recessive model (p=0.000672) between CHD group and control group. For gene ITGB2 rs2070947, there was a significant difference in the recessive model (p=0.03). By comparing the clinical and serum metabolic indexes of SNP sites by genotype we find that among three genotypes of SRB1 rs5888,there were significant difference in the level of dyslipidemia history and serum LPA, among three genotypes of ITGB2 rs235236,there were significant difference in the levels of serum HDL,APOA1 and hypertension history, among three genotypes of ITGB2 rs2070947,there were significant difference in the level of serum APOA1,hsCRP.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings indicated that SNP rs838880 of gene SRB1 and rs2070947 of gene ITGB2 are associated with the risk of CHD in Chinese han population.",

We report here the results of a large metabolomics study showing that people with DS produce elevated levels of kynurenine and quinolinic acid, two tryptophan catabolites with potent immunosuppressive and neurotoxic properties, respectively. We found that immune cells of people with DS overexpress IDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway (KP) and a known interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between levels of specific inflammatory cytokines and KP dysregulation. Using metabolic flux assays, we found that IFN stimulation causes IDO1 overexpression and kynurenine overproduction in cells with T21, dependent on overexpression of IFN receptors encoded on chromosome 21. Finally, KP dysregulation is conserved in a mouse model of DS carrying triplication of the IFN receptors. Altogether, these results reveal a mechanism by which T21 could drive immunosuppression and neurotoxicity in DS.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drive elements like Spore killer-2 (Sk-2) in Neurospora are transmitted through sexual reproduction to the next generation in a biased manner. Sk-2 achieves this biased transmission through spore killing. Here, we identify rfk-1 as a gene required for the spore killing mechanism. The rfk-1 gene is associated with a 1,481 bp DNA interval (called AH36) near the right border of the 30 cM Sk-2 element, and its deletion eliminates the ability of Sk-2 to kill spores. The rfk-1 gene also appears to be sufficient for spore killing because its insertion into a non-Sk-2 isolate disrupts sexual reproduction after the initiation of meiosis. Although the complete rfk-1 transcript has yet to be defined, our data indicate that rfk-1 encodes a protein of at least 39 amino acids and that rfk-1 has evolved from a partial duplication of gene ncu07086. We also present evidence that rfk-1s location near the right border of Sk-2 is critical for the success of spore killing. Increasing the distance of rfk-1 from the right border of Sk-2 causes it to be inactivated by a genome defense process called meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD), adding to accumulating evidence that MSUD exists, at least in part, to protect genomes from meiotic drive.",

Strikingly, analysis workflows for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data usually neglect the errors introduced by potential contaminations.

We found that contaminations are pervasive and can introduce large biases in variant analysis. We showed that these biases can translate in hundreds of false positive and negative SNPs, even for samples with slight contaminations. Studies investigating complex biological traits from sequencing data can be completely biased if contaminations are neglected during the bioinformatic analysis. We used both real and simulated data to evaluate and implement reliable, contamination-aware analysis pipelines. Our results urge for the implementation of such pipelines as sequencing technologies consolidate as a precision tool in the research and clinical context.",

Containment activities are an essential part of reducing the public health burden caused by dengue, but systematic evidence on the comparative efficacy of activities from the field is lacking. To our knowledge, the effect of containment activities on local (sub-city) scale disease dynamics has never been systematically characterized using empirical containment and case data. We combine data from a comprehensive dengue containment monitoring system with confirmed dengue case data from the local government hospitals to estimate the efficacy of seven common containment activities in two urban areas in Pakistan. We use a modified version of the time series Suspected Infected Recovered frame-work to estimate how the reproductive number, R0, of the outbreak changed in relation to deployment of each containment activity. We also estimate the spatial dependence of cases based on deployment of each containment activity. Both analyses suggest that activities aimed at the adult phase of the mosquito lifecycle have the highest efficacy, with fogging having the largest quantifiable effect in reducing cases immediately after deployment. In examining the efficacy of containment activities contemporaneously deployed in the same locations, results here can guide recommendations for future deployment of resources during dengue outbreaks in urban settings.",

Antibiotic resistance may contribute to the rates of sepsis-related outcomes through lack of clearance of bacterial infections following antibiotic treatment during different stages of infection. However, there is limited information about the relation between prevalence of resistance to various antibiotics in different bacteria and rates of sepsis-related outcomes.\n\nMethodsFor different age groups of adults (18-49y,50-64y,65-74y,75-84y,85+y) and combinations of antibiotics/bacteria, we evaluated associations between state-specific prevalence (percentage) of resistant samples for a given combination of antibiotics/bacteria among catheter-associated urinary tract infections in the CDC Antibiotic Resistance Patient Safety Atlas data between 2011-2014 and rates of hospitalization with septicemia (ICD-9 codes 038.xx present on the discharge diagnosis) reported to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), as well as rates of mortality with sepsis (ICD-10 codes A40-41.xx present on death certificate).\n\nResultsAmong the different combinations of antibiotics/bacteria, prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli had the strongest association with septicemia hospitalization rates for individuals aged over 50y, and with sepsis mortality rates for individuals aged 18-84y.

    "abstract": "The infectious period of a transmissible disease is a key factor for disease spread and persistence. Epidemic models on networks typically assume an identical average infectious period for all individuals, thus allowing an analytical treatment. This simplifying assumption is however often unrealistic, as hosts may have different infectious periods, due, for instance, to individual host-pathogen interactions or inhomogeneous access to treatment. While previous work accounted for this heterogeneity in static networks, a full theoretical understanding of the interplay of varying infectious periods and time-evolving contacts is still missing. Here we consider an SIS epidemic on a temporal network with host-specific average infectious periods, and develop an analytical framework to estimate the epidemic threshold, i.e. the critical transmissibility for disease spread in the host population. Integrating contact data for transmission with outbreak data and epidemiological estimates, we apply our framework to three real-world case studies exploring different epidemic contexts - the persistence of bovine tuberculosis in southern Italy, the spread of nosocomial infections in a hospital, and the diffusion of pandemic influenza in a school. We find that the homogeneous parameterization may cause important biases in the assessment of the epidemic risk of the host population. Our approach is also able to identify groups of hosts mostly responsible for disease diffusion who may be targeted for prevention and control, aiding public health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Cities face rapid changes leading to increasing inequalities and emerging public health issues that require cost-effective interventions. The urban exposome framework constitutes a novel approach in tackling city-wide challenges, such as those of drinking water quality and quality of life. In this proof-of-concept study, we presented part of the urban exposome of Limassol (Cyprus) focusing on chemical and microbial drinking water quality parameters and their association with urban neighborhood indicators. A perceptions study and an urban population study was conducted. We mapped the water quality parameters and participants opinions on city life (i.e. neighborhood life, health care and green space access) using quarters (small administrative areas) as the reference unit of the city. In an exploratory environment-wide association study analysis, we used all variables (questionnaire responses and water quality metrics) to describe correlations between them accounting, also, for self-reported health status. Overall, urban drinking-water quality using conventional indicators of chemical (disinfection byproducts-trihalomethanes) and microbial (coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococci) quality did not raise particular concerns. The general health and chronic health status of the urban participants were significantly (all >FDR corrected p value of 0.1) associated with different health conditions such as hypertension and asthma, or having financial issues in access to dental care. Additionally, correlations between trihalomethanes and participant characteristics (e.g. household cleaning, drinking water habits) were documented. This proof-of-concept study showed the potential of using integrative approaches to develop urban exposomic profiles and identifying within-city differentiated environmental and health indicators. The characterization of the urban exposome of Limassol will be expanded via the inclusion of biomonitoring tools and untargeted metabolomics platforms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMycoplasma genitalium is increasingly seen as an emerging sexually transmitted pathogen, and has been likened to Chlamydia trachomatis, but its natural history is poorly understood. The objectives of this systematic review were to determine M. genitalium incidence, persistence, concordance between sexual partners, and the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\\n\\nMethodsWe searched Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, IndMed and African Index Medicus from 1 January 1981 until 17 March 2018. Two independent researchers screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We examined results in forest plots, assessed heterogeneity and conducted meta-analysis where appropriate. Risk of bias was assessed for all studies.\\n\\nResultsWe screened 4634 records and included 17 studies; five (4100 women) reported on incidence, five (636 women) on persistence, 10 (1346 women and men) on concordance and three (5139 women) on PID. Incidence in women in two very highly developed countries was 1.07 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.53, I2 0%). Median persistence of M. genitalium was estimated from one to three months in four studies but 15 months in one study. In ten studies measuring M. genitalium infection status in couples, 39-50% of male or female sexual partners of infected participants also had M. genitalium detected. In prospective studies, the incidence of PID was higher in women with M. genitalium than those without (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.77, I2 0%, 2 studies).\\n\\nDiscussionBased on findings from this and our linked review of prevalence, concordant M. genitalium might be less common than for C. trachomatis and the age distributions of the infections differ. The synthesised data about prevalence, incidence and persistence of M. genitalium infection are inconsistent. Taken together with evidence about antimicrobial resistance in the two infections, M. genitalium is not the new chlamydia.\\n\\nRegistration NumbersPROSPERO: CRD42015020420, CRD42015020405\\n\\nKEY MESSAGESO_LIThere are calls for widespread screening for Mycoplasma genitalium, but the natural history of this emerging sexually transmitted pathogen is poorly understood.\\nC_LIO_LIM. genitalium incidence was 1.07 (95% confidence intervals, CI 0.61 to 1.53) per 100-person years in women in highly developed countries, 39-50% of infected individuals had a heterosexual partner with M. genitalium and the risk ratio for pelvic inflammatory disease was 1.68 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.77).\\nC_LIO_LIThe duration of untreated M. genitalium infection is probably longer than persistent detection of M. genitalium, as measured in most cohort studies, in which inadvertent treatment cannot be ruled out.\\nC_LIO_LIThe results of this systematic review and other evidence sources show important differences in the epidemiology and dynamics of M. genitalium and Chlamydia trachomatis infection.\\nC_LI",

Participants reported whether they experienced chronic coughing, phlegm, wheezing, or dyspnea during visits at 18-month intervals. We used mixed-effect logistic regression models (separately for each symptom) to assess overall heterogeneity in the occurrence of symptoms between individuals, and the proportion of variation in symptom burden explained by lung function versus all other clinical characteristics of participants.\\n\\nResults548 participants (54% male, mean age 67 years) contributed 1,086 visits in total, and 82% of patients reported at least one symptom during follow-up. There was substantial heterogeneity in the individual-specific probabilities for the occurrence of symptoms. This heterogeneity was highest for dyspnea and lowest for phlegm (interquartile range of probabilities: 0.15-0.77 and <0.01-0.53, respectively). FEV1 explained 82% of the variation between individuals in the occurrence of phlegm, 26% for dyspnea, 3% for cough, and <0.1% for wheeze.

    "abstract": "With hospital-onset Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) still a common occurrence in the U.S., this paper examines the relationship between unit-wide CDI susceptibility and inpatient mobility and creates a predictive measure of CDI called \\\"Contagion Centrality\\\". A mobility network was constructed using two years of patient electronic health record (EHR) data within a 739-bed hospital (Jan. 2013 - Dec. 2014; n=72,636 admissions). Network centrality measures were calculated for each hospital unit (node) providing clinical context for each in terms of patient transfers between units (edges). Daily unit-wide CDI susceptibility scores were calculated using logistic regression and compared to network centrality measures to determine the relationship between unit CDI susceptibility and patient mobility. Closeness centrality was a statistically significant measure associated with unit susceptibility (p-value < 0.05), highlighting the importance of incoming patient mobility in CDI prevention at the unit-level. Contagion Centrality (CC) was calculated using incoming inpatient transfer rates, unit-wide susceptibility of CDI, and current hospital CDI infections. This measure is statistically significant (p-value <0.05) with our outcome of hospital-onset CDI cases, and captures the additional opportunities for transmission associated with inpatient transfers. We have used this analysis to create an easily interpretable and informative clinical tool showing this relationship and risk of hospital-onset CDI in real-time. Quantifying and visualizing the combination of inpatient transfers, unit-wide risk, and current infections help identify hospital units at risk of developing a CDI outbreak, and thus provide clinicians and infection prevention staff with advanced warning and specific location data to concentrate prevention efforts.",

    "abstract": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein responsible for controlling the stabilization of microtubules in neurons. Tau function is regulated by phosphorylation. However, in some neurological diseases Tau becomes aberrantly hyperphosphorylated, which contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, known as tauopathies. Western blotting (WB) has been widely employed to determine Tau levels in neurological disease models. However, Tau quantification by WB should be interpreted with care, as this approach has been recognized as prone to produce artifactual results if not properly performed. In this study, our goal was to evaluate the influence of a freeze-and-thaw cycle, a common procedure preceding WB, to the integrity of Tau in brain homogenates from rats, 3xTg-AD mice and human samples. Homogenates were prepared in ice-cold RIPA buffer supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors. Immediately after centrifugation, an aliquot of the extracts was analyzed via WB to quantify total and phosphorylated Tau levels. The remaining aliquots were stored for at least 2 weeks at either -20{degrees}C or -80{degrees}C and then subjected to WB. Extracts from rodent brains submitted to freeze-and-thaw presented a ~25 kDa fragment immunoreactive to anti-Tau antibodies. An in-gel digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis in excised bands revealed this ~25 kDa species corresponds to a Tau fragment. Freeze-and-thaw-induced Tau proteolysis was detected even when extracts were stored at -80{degrees}C. This phenomenon was not observed in human samples at any storage condition tested. Based on these findings, we strongly recommend the use of fresh extracts of brain samples in molecular analysis of Tau levels in rodents.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogels are three-dimensional crosslinked hydrophilic polymer networks capable of swelling or de-swelling reversibly in water and retaining a large volume of liquid in swollen state. Hydrogels can be designed with controllable responses to shrink or expand with changes in external environmental conditions. Among stimulisensitive hydrogels, the pH-sensitive ones are widely-studied and used. Despite these advances, we currently lack a systematic way to optimize the synthesis protocols. Here we propose to use techniques from chemometrics, namely Box-Behnken statistical screening design to optimize the chemical composition of pH-responsive hydrogels for an improved responsiveness as quantified by swelling index. Polymer blends were prepared by mixing different suitable volume of pvp (poly vinyl pyrrolidone) and chitosan aqueous solution in order to obtain a mixture, glutardialdehyde solution was added as crosslinkers to the chitosan/pvp mixture to form semi-IPN(semi-interpenetrating polymeric hydrogel). The pH-dependent swelling properties have been measured and used to obtain a regression model. We characterized the descriptive and predictive abilities of our model. We found a remarkable correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.954) between the observed responses and the responses predicted by the model. Our results demonstrate that Box-Behnken is an appropriate statistical design that can be successfully used in the development of pH-sensitive hydrogels with a predictable swelling ratio. This technology will remarkably reduce the time and cost that is needed for chemical synthesis of hydrogels with a desired pH-sensitivity.",

While most published literature focused on in vitro or single tumour type investigations, we carried out the first multi-omics pan cancer analysis of hypoxia with the aim of gaining a comprehensive understanding of its implication in tumour biology. A core set of 52 mRNAs were curated based on experimentally validated hypoxia gene sets from multiple cancer types. The 52 mRNAs collectively stratified high- and low-hypoxia tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (9698 primary tumours) in each of the 32 cancer types available. High- hypoxia tumours had high expression of not only mRNA but also protein and microRNA markers of hypoxia. In a pan cancer transcriptomic analysis, [&ge;]70% of the known cancer hallmark pathways were enriched in high-hypoxia tumours, most notably epithelial mesenchymal transition potential, proliferation (G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, MYC targets) and immunology response. In a multi-omics analysis, gene expression-determined high- hypoxia tumours had a higher non-silent mutation rate, DNA damage repair deficiency and leukocyte infiltration. The associations largely remained significant after correcting for confounding factors, showing a profound impact of hypoxia in tumour evolution across cancer types. High-hypoxia tumours determined using the core gene set had a poor prognosis in 16/32 cancer types, with statistical significances remaining in five after adjusting for tumour stage and omics biomarkers. In summary, this first comprehensive in vivo map of hypoxia in cancers highlights the importance of this micro-environmental factor in driving tumour progression.",

The heart has a limited regenerative capacity, and bolstering regeneration might represent new therapeutic approaches for heart failure patients. Various progenitor cells in the heart have been proposed to have cardiomyogenic properties, but this evidence is based mostly on cell culture and transplantation studies. One population of interest is characterized by the expression of Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1). Here we tested the hypothesis that Sca-1+ cells are endogenous progenitors for cardiomyocytes in the adult heart.\\n\\nMethodsWe evaluated the innate cardiogenic potential of Sca-1+ cells in vivo by generating a novel mouse model to genetically lineage-trace the fate of Sca-1 expressing cells. This was accomplished by introducing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase into the Sca-1 locus (Sca-1mCm/+). Crossing this mouse line to a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line allowed for genetic lineage-tracing of endogenous Sca-1+ cells (Sca-1mCmR26tdTomato). The frequency of Sca-1+ cardiomyocytes was quantified from dispersed cell preparations and confirmed by in situ histology.\\n\\nResultsWe validated the genetic lineage tracing mouse model in bone marrow and heart. Unlike previous publications suggesting significant cardiogenic potential, we found that less than 0.02% of cardiomyocytes per year were derived from Sca-1+ cells in the adult heart under homeostatic conditions. At six months after myocardial infarction, we found less than 0.01% of cardiomyocytes were derived from Sca-1+ cells.\\n\\nConclusionOur results show that Sca-1+ cells in the adult heart have minimal cardiogenic potential under homeostatic conditions or in response to myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles are under investigation as carrier systems for anti-cancer drugs. They have been shown to accumulate in cancer tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, to reduce toxicity to non-target tissues, and to protect drugs from preliminary inactivation. However, nanoparticle preparations are not commonly compared for their anti-cancer effects at the cellular level. Here, we prepared doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polylactic acid (PLA), and PEGylated PLGA (PLGA-PEG) by solvent displacement and emulsion diffusion approaches. The resulting nanoparticles covered a size range between 73 and 246 nm. PLGA-PEG nanoparticle preparation by solvent displacement resulted in the smallest nanoparticles. In PLGA nanoparticles, the drug load could be optimised using solvent displacement at pH7 reaching 53 {micro}g doxorubicin/mg nanoparticle. In addition, these PLGA nanoparticles displayed sustained doxorubicin release kinetics compared to the more burst-like kinetics of the other preparations. In neuroblastoma cells, doxorubicin-loaded PLGA-PEG nanoparticles (presumably due to their small size) and PLGA nanoparticles prepared by solvent displacement at pH7 (presumably due to their high drug load and superior drug release kinetics) exerted the strongest anti-cancer effects. In conclusion, doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles made by different methods from different materials displayed substantial discrepancies in their anti-cancer activity at the cellular level. Optimised preparation methods resulted in PLGA nanoparticles characterised by increased drug load, controlled drug release, and high anti-cancer efficacy. The design of drug-loaded nanoparticles with optimised anti-cancer activity at the cellular level is an important step in the development of improved nanoparticle preparations for anti-cancer therapy.",

However, the HIV-1 PR prefers to have large hydrophobic amino acids flanking the scissile bond, suggesting PR recognizes two different classes of substrate sequences. We analyzed the cleavage rate of over 150 iterations of six different HIV-1 cleavage sites to explore rate determinants of cleavage. We found that cleavage rates are strongly influenced by the two amino acids flanking the amino acids at the scissile bond (P2-P1/P1-P2), with two complementary sets of rules. When P1 is proline, the P2 side chain interacts with a polar region in the S2 subsite of the PR, while the P2 amino acid interacts with a hydrophobic region of the S2 subsite. When P1 is not proline, the orientations of the P2 and P2 side chains with respect to the scissile bond are reversed; P2 residues interact with a hydrophobic face of the S2 subsite while the P2 amino acid usually engages hydrophilic amino acids in the S2 subsite. These results reveal that the HIV-1 PR has evolved bi-functional S2 and S2 subsites to accommodate the steric effects imposed by a P1 proline on the orientation of P2 and P2 substrate side chains. These results also suggest a new strategy for inhibitor design to engage the multiple specificities in these subsites.",

    "abstract": "The impact of the different reconstruction parameters in super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) onto artifacts is carefully analyzed. They comprise the Wiener filter parameter, an apodization function, zero-frequency suppression and modifications of the optical transfer function. A detailed investigation of the reconstructed image spectrum is concluded to be suitable for identifying artifacts. For this purpose, two samples, an artificial test slide and a more realistic biological system, were used to characterize the artifact classes and their correlation with the image spectra as well as the reconstruction parameters. In addition, a guideline for efficient parameter optimization is suggested and the implementation of the parameters in selected up-to-date processing packages (proprietary and open-source) is depicted.",

    "abstract": "Inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) binding at the N-terminus (NT) of IP3 receptor (IP3R) allosterically triggers the opening of a Ca2+-conducting pore located ~ 100 [A] away from the IP3-binding core (IBC). However, the precise mechanism of IP3 binding and correlated domain dynamics in the NT that are central to the IP3R activation, remains unknown. Our all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations recapitulate the characteristic twist motion of the suppresser domain (SD) and reveal correlated  clam closure dynamics of IBC with IP3-binding, complementing existing suggestions on IP3R activation mechanism. Our study further reveals the existence of inter-domain dynamic correlation in the NT and establishes the SD to be critical for the conformational dynamics of IBC. Also, a tripartite interaction involving Glu283-Arg54-Asp444 at the SD - IBC interface seemed critical for IP3R activation. Intriguingly, during the sub-microsecond long simulation, we observed Arg269 undergoing an SD-dependent flipping of hydrogen bonding between the first and fifth phosphate groups of IP3. This seems to play a major role in determining the IP3 binding affinity of IBC in the presence/absence of the SD. Our study thus provides atomistic details of early molecular events occurring within the NT during and following IP3 binding that lead to channel gating.",
