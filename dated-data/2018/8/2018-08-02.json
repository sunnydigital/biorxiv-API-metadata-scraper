Studies of human cancer typically use matched normal (reference) samples from a distant tissue to increase SNV prediction accuracy. This process both doubles sequencing costs and poses challenges when reference samples are not readily available, such as for many cell-lines. To address these challenges, we created S22S: an approach for the prediction of somatic mutations without need for matched reference tissue. S22S takes underlying sequence data, augments them with genomic background context and population frequency information, and classifies SNVs as somatic or non-somatic. We validated S22S using primary tumor/normal pairs from four tumor types, spanning two different sequencing technologies. S22S robustly identifies somatic SNVs, with the area under the precision recall curve reaching 0.97 in kidney clear cell carcinoma, comparable to the best tumor/normal analysis pipelines.

    "abstract": "Genetic studies of psychiatric disorders often deal with phenotypes that are not directly measurable. Instead, researchers rely on multivariate symptom data from questionnaires and surveys like the PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to indirectly assess a latent phenotype of interest. Researchers subsequently collapse such multivariate questionnaire data into a univariate outcome to represent a surrogate for the latent phenotype. However, when a causal variant is only associated with a subset of collapsed symptoms, the effect will be challenging to detect using the univariate outcome. We describe a more powerful strategy for genetic association testing in this situation that jointly analyzes the original multivariate symptom data collectively using a statistical framework that compares similarity in multivariate symptom-scale data from questionnaires to similarity in common genetic variants across a gene. We use simulated data to demonstrate this strategy provides substantially increased power over standard approaches that collapse questionnaire data into a single surrogate outcome. We also illustrate our approach using GWAS data from the Grady Trauma Project and identify genes associated with BDI not identified using standard univariate techniques. The approach is computationally efficient, scales to genome-wide studies, and is applicable to correlated symptom data of arbitrary dimension (thereby aligning with National Institute of Mental Healths Research Domain Criteria).",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a ubiquitous gaseous molecule that is endogenously produced in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Its role as a pleiotropic signaling molecule has been well characterized in mammals1,2. In contrast, the physiological role of H2S in bacteria only recently became apparent; H2S acts as a cytoprotectant against antibiotics-induced stress and affect the cells ability to maintain redox homeostasis 3-5. In E. coli, endogenous H2S production is primarily dependent on 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), encoded by mstA, previously known as sseA3,4. Here, we show that cells lacking 3MST acquired a unique phenotypic suppressor mutation resulting in compensatory H2S production and tolerance to antibiotics and oxidative stress. Using whole genome sequencing, we mapped a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to uncharacterized Laci-type transcription factor, YcjW. We identified transcriptional regulatory targets of YcjW and discovered a major target, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase PspE, as an alternative mechanism for H2S biosynthesis. Deletion of pspE was sufficient to antagonize phenotypic suppression. Our results reveal a complex interaction between cell metabolism and H2S production and the role, a hithero uncharacterized transcription factor, YcjW, plays in linking the two.",

    "abstract": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infections in pregnant livestock are associated with high rates of fetal demise and have been linked to miscarriage in pregnant women. To address how acute RVFV infection during pregnancy causes detrimental effects on the fetus, we developed an immunocompetent pregnant rodent model of RVFV infection. We found that pregnant rats were more susceptible to RVFV-induced death than their non-pregnant counterparts and that RVFV infection resulted in intrauterine fetal death and severe congenital abnormalities, even in pups from infected asymptomatic pregnant rats. Virus distribution in infected dams was widespread, with a previously unrecognized preference for infection, replication, and tissue damage in the placenta. In human mid-gestation placental tissue, RVFV directly infected placental chorionic villi, with replication detected in the outermost syncytial layer. Our work identifies direct placental infection by RVFV as a mechanism for vertical transmission and points to the teratogenic potential of this virus in humans. This is the first time vertical transmission of RVFV has been shown in species other than livestock. This study highlights the potential impact of a future epidemic of this emerging mosquito-borne virus.",

    "abstract": "In the complete absence of small transients in visual inputs (e.g. by experimentally stabilizing an image on the retina, or in everyday life during intent staring), information perceived by the eyes will fade from the perceptual experience. While the mechanisms of visual fading remain poorly understood, one possibility is that higher-level brain regions actively suppress the stable visual signals via targeted inhibitory feedback onto Early Visual Cortex (EVC). Here, we used positive afterimages and multisensory conflict to induce gestaltlike fading of participants own hands. In two separate experiments, participants rated the perceived quality of their hands both before and after Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied over EVC. In a first experiment, triple pulse TMS was able to make a faded hand appear less faded after the pulses were applied, compared to placebo pulses. A second experiment demonstrated that this was because triple pulse TMS inoculated the removed hand from fading over time. Interestingly, TMS similarly affected the left and right hand, despite being applied only over right EVC. Together, our results suggest that TMS can lift inhibitory processes in EVC and reverse the effects of visual fading. And it might do so by crossing transcollosal connections, or via multimodal integration sites in which both hands are represented.",

    "abstract": "Some people are more willing to make immediate, risky, or costly reward-focused choices than others, which has been hypothesized to be associated with individual differences in dopamine (DA) function. In two studies using PET imaging, one empirical (Study 1: N=144 males and females across 3 samples) and one meta-analytic (Study 2: N=307 across 12 samples), we sought to characterize associations between individual differences in DA and time, probability, and physical effort discounting in human adults. Study 1 demonstrated that individual differences in DA D2-like receptors were not associated with time or probability discounting of monetary rewards in healthy humans, and associations with physical effort discounting were inconsistent across adults of different ages. Meta-analytic results for temporal discounting corroborated our empirical finding for minimal effect of DA measures on discounting in healthy individuals, but suggested that associations between individual differences in DA and reward discounting depend on clinical features. Addictions were characterized by negative correlations between DA and discounting but other clinical conditions like Parkinsons Disease, obesity, and ADHD were characterized by positive correlations between DA and discounting. Together the results suggest that trait differences in discounting in healthy adults do not appear to be strongly associated with individual differences in D2-like receptors. The difference in meta-analytic correlation effects between healthy controls and individuals with psychopathology suggests that individual difference findings related to DA and reward discounting in clinical samples may not be reliably generalized to healthy controls, and vice-versa.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDecisions to forgo large rewards for smaller ones due to increasing time delays, uncertainty, or physical effort have been linked to differences in dopamine (DA) function, which is disrupted in some forms of psychopathology. It remains unclear whether alterations in DA function associated with psychopathology also extend to explaining associations between DA function and decision making in healthy individuals. We show that individual differences in dopamine D2 receptor availability are not consistently related to monetary discounting of time, probability, or physical effort in healthy individuals across a broad age range. By contrast, we suggest that psychopathology accounts for observed inconsistencies in the relationship between measures of dopamine function and reward discounting behavior.",

    "abstract": "Some insects can redirect plant development to form unique organs called galls, which provide these insects with unique, enhanced food and protection from enemies and the elements. Many galls resemble flowers or fruits, suggesting that elements of reproductive development may be involved. We tested this hypothesis using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to quantify the transcriptional responses of wild grapevine (Vitis riparia Michx.) leaves to a galling parasite, phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifolia (Fitch 1855)). If development of reproductive structures is part of gall formation, we expected to find significantly elevated expression of genes involved in flower and/or fruit development in developing galls as opposed to ungalled leaves. We found that reproductive gene ontology (GO) categories were significantly enriched in developing galls, and that expression of many candidate genes involved in floral development were significantly increased, particularly in later gall stages. The patterns of gene expression found in galls suggest that phylloxera exploits vascular cambium to provide meristematic tissue and redirects leaf development towards formation of carpels. The phylloxera leaf gall appears to be phenotypically and transcriptionally similar to the carpel, due to the parasite hijacking underlying genetic machinery in the host plant.",

    "abstract": "Some forms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be the clinical precursor of severe dementia like Alzheimers disease (AD), while other types of MCI tend to remain stable over-time and do not progress to AD pathology. To choose an effective and personalized treatment for AD, we need to identify which MCI patients are at risk of developing AD and which are not.\\n\\nHere, we present a novel deep learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc layer for 3D separable convolutions, which aims at identifying those people with MCI who have a high likelihood of developing AD. Our deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 genotyping data as input measures. The most novel characteristics of our machine learning model compared to previous ones are as follows: 1) multi-tasking, in the sense that our deep learning model jointly learns to simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion, and AD vs healthy classification which facilitates the relevant feature extraction for prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier employs relatively few parameters compared to other deep learning architectures (we use ~550,000 network parameters, orders of magnitude lower than other network designs) without compromising network complexity and hence significantly limits data-overfitting; 3) both structural MRI images and warp field characteristics, which quantify the amount of volumetric change compared to the common template, were used as separate input streams to extract as much information as possible from the MRI data. All the analyses were performed on a subset of the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for a total of n=785 participants (192 AD, 409 MCI, and184 healthy controls (HC)).\\n\\nWe found that the most predictive combination of inputs included the structural MRI images and the demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data, while the warp field metric added little predictive value. We achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.925 with a 10-fold cross-validated accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 85% in classifying MCI patients who developed AD in three years time from those individuals showing stable MCI over the same time-period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest performance reported on a test set achieved in the literature using similar data. The same network provided an AUC of 1 and 100% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity when classifying NC from AD. We also demonstrated that our classification framework was robust to different co-registration templates and possibly irrelevant features / image sections.\\n\\nOur approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging modalities, such as PET, and a more diverse group of clinical data. The convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image dataset and gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis system targeting the prediction of any medical condition utilizing multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical data.",

The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is a useful model system for understanding how trait variability emerges within microbial species: Its functional diversity is overlaid on measurable environmental gradients, providing a powerful lens into large-scale evolutionary processes. Here we examine variation in the ability to use nitrate across hundreds of Prochlorococcus genomes to better understand the modes of evolution influencing the allocation of ecologically important functions within microbial species. We find that nitrate assimilation genes are absent in basal lineages of Prochlorococcus but occur at an intermediate frequency that is randomly distributed within recently emerged clades. The distribution of nitrate assimilation genes within clades appears largely governed by vertical inheritance, stochastic gene loss, and homologous recombination among closely related cells. By mapping this process onto a model of Prochlorococcus macroevolution, we propose that niche-constructing adaptive radiations and subsequent niche partitioning set the stage for loss of nitrate assimilation genes from basal lineages as they specialized to lower light levels. Retention of these genes in recently emerged lineages has likely been facilitated by selection as they sequentially partitioned into niches where nitrate assimilation conferred a fitness benefit.",

Due to this strong selective pressure, antiviral immune genes are some of the fastest evolving genes across metazoans, as highlighted in mammals and insects. While Drosophila melanogaster are frequently exposed to pathogenic RNA viruses, little is known about D. melanogasters ecology in terms of viral exposure, or if they are representative of other Drosophila species. Here, we sequence and assemble the genome of a highly diverged, mushroom-feeding Drosophila species, Drosophila innubila, a species frequently exposed to a highly pathogenic DNA virus. We investigate the evolution of the immune system and find little evidence for rapid evolution of the antiviral RNAi genes, though we do find rapid evolution of several other pathways, suggesting alternate means of viral resistance. This contrasts with D. melanogaster, and suggests that evolution of resistance to DNA viruses differs greatly from that of RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation depends on proteins that bind to specific DNA sites. Such specific recognition often involves severe DNA deformations including sharp kinks. It has been unclear how rigid or flexible these protein-induced kinks are. Here, we investigated the dynamic nature of DNA in complex with integration host factor (IHF), a nucleoid-associated architectural protein known to bend one of its cognate sites (35 base pair H) into a U-turn by kinking DNA at two sites. We utilized fluorescence lifetime based FRET spectroscopy to map the distribution of bent conformations in various IHF-DNA complexes. Our results reveal a surprisingly dynamic specific complex: while 80% of the IHF-H population exhibited FRET efficiency consistent with the crystal structure, 20% exhibited FRET efficiency indicative of unbent or partially bent DNA. This conformational flexibility is modulated by sequence variations in the cognate site. In another site (H1) that lacks an A-tract of H on one side of the binding site, the population in the fully U-bent conformation decreased to 36%, as did the extent of bending. A similar decrease in the U-bent population was observed with a single base mutation in H in a consensus region on the other side. Taken together, these results provide important insights into the finely tuned interactions between IHF and its cognate sites that keep the DNA bent (or not), and yield quantitative data on the dynamic equilibrium between different DNA conformations (kinked or not kinked) that depend sensitively on DNA sequence and deformability. Notably, the difference in dynamics between IHF-H and IHF-H1 reflects the different roles of these complexes in their natural context, in the phage lambda \\\"intasome\\\" (the complex that integrates phage lambda into the E. coli chromosome).",

    "abstract": "During development of the central nervous system oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to both myelinating oligodendrocytes and NG2 glia, which are the most proliferative cells in the adult mammalian brain. NG2 glia retain characteristics of OPCs, and some NG2 glia produce oligodendrocytes, but many others persist throughout adulthood. Why some OPCs differentiate as oligodendrocytes during development whereas others persist as OPCs and acquire characteristics of NG2 glia is not known. Using zebrafish spinal cord as a model, we found that OPCs that differentiate rapidly as oligodendrocytes and others that remain as OPCs arise in sequential waves from distinct neural progenitors. Additionally, oligodendrocyte and persistent OPC fates are specified during a defined critical period by small differences in Shh signaling and Notch activity, which modulates Shh signaling response. Thus, our data indicate that OPCs fated to produce oligodendrocytes or remain as OPCs during development are specified as distinct cell types, raising the possibility that the myelinating potential of OPCs is set by graded Shh signaling activity.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genetic screens play a key role in the systematic discovery of genes underlying cellular phenotypes. Pooling of genetic perturbations greatly increases screening throughput, but has so far been limited to screens of enrichments defined by cell fitness and flow cytometry, or to comparatively low-throughput single cell gene expression profiles. Although microscopy is a rich source of spatial and temporal information about mammalian cells, high-content imaging screens have been restricted to much less efficient arrayed formats. Here, we introduce an optical method to link perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes at the singlecell level in a pooled setting. Barcoded perturbations are read out by targeted in situ sequencing following image-based phenotyping. We apply this technology to screen a focused set of 952 genes across >3 million cells for involvement in NF-{kappa}B activation by imaging the translocation of RelA (p65) to the nucleus, recovering 20 known pathway components and 3 novel candidate positive regulators of IL-1{beta} and TNF-stimulated immune responses.",

Its mechanical properties profoundly influence the fate of cells. The cell-matrix interaction, however, is not well understood due to a lack of experimental techniques to study the mechanical interplay between cells and their local environment. Here we introduce Activity Microscopy, a new way to visualize local network mechanics with single filament resolution. Using collagen I networks in vitro, we localize fibril positions in two-dimensional slices through the network with nanometer precision and quantify the fibrils transverse thermal fluctuations with megahertz bandwidth. Using a fibrils thermal fluctuations as an indicator for its tension, we find a heterogeneous stress distribution, where \\\"cold\\\" fibrils with small thermal fluctuations surround regions of highly fluctuating \\\"hot\\\" fibrils.

    "abstract": "BackgroundFunctional characterisation of the compact genome of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans remains incomplete despite its sequencing twenty years ago. The last decade of research has seen a tremendous increase in the number of non-coding RNAs identified in various organisms. While we have mechanistic understandings of small non-coding RNA pathways, long non-coding RNAs represent a diverse class of active transcripts whose function remains less well characterised.\\n\\nResultsBy analysing hundreds of published transcriptome datasets, we annotated 3,397 potential lncRNAs including 146 multi-exonic loci that showed increased nucleotide conservation and GC content relative to other non-coding regions. Using CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing we generated deletion mutants for ten long non-coding RNA loci. Using automated microscopy for in-depth phenotyping, we show that six of the long non-coding RNA loci are required for normal development and fertility. Using RNA interference mediated gene knock-down, we provide evidence that for two of the long non-coding RNA loci, the observed phenotypes are dependent on the corresponding RNA transcripts.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results highlight that a large section of the non-coding regions of the C. elegans genome remain unexplored. Based on our in vivo analysis of a selection of high-confidence lncRNA loci, we expect that a significant proportion of these high-confidence regions is likely to have biological function at either the genomic or the transcript level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHow and why regulatory networks incorporate additional components, and how novel genes are maintained and functionally integrated into developmental processes are two important and intertwined questions whose answers have major implications for the evolution of development. We recently described a set of novel genes with robust and unique expression patterns along the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo of the wasp Nasonia. Given the unique evolutionary history of these genes, and their apparent integration in to the dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning network, they are collectively an excellent model to study the evolution of regulatory networks, and the fates of novel genes.\\n\\nResultsWe have found that the novel DV genes are part of a large family of rapidly duplicating and diverging ankyrin domain encoding genes that originated most likely by horizontal transfer from Wolbachia in a common ancestor of the wasp superfamilly Chalcidoidea. We tested the function of those ankyrin encoding genes expressed along the DV axis and found that they participate in early embryonic DV patterning. We also developed a new wasp model system (Melittobia) and found that some functional integration of ankyrin genes have been preserved for over 90 million years, while others are lineage specific.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results indicate that regulatory networks can incorporate novel genes that then become necessary for stable and repeatable outputs. Even modest role in developmental networks may be enough to allow novel or duplicate genes to be maintained in the genome and become fully integrated network components.",

    "abstract": "To summarise skewed (asymmetric) distributions, such as reaction times, typically the mean or the median are used as measures of central tendency. Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased: with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that \\\"sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.\\\" Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the medians bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufficient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ: we illustrate a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation.
