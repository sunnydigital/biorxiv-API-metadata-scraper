    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites including Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium spp. manufacture a complex arsenal of secreted proteins used to interact with and manipulate their host environment. These proteins are organised into three principle exocytotic compartment types according to their functions: micronemes for extracellular attachment and motility, rhoptries for host cell penetration, and dense granules for subsequent manipulation of the host intracellular environment. The order and timing of these events during the parasites invasion cycle dictates when exocytosis from each compartment occurs. Tight control of compartment secretion is, therefore, an integral part of apicomplexan biology. Control of microneme exocytosis is best understood, where cytosolic intermediate molecular messengers cGMP and Ca2+ act as positive signals. The mechanisms for controlling secretion from rhoptries and dense granules, however, are virtually unknown. Here, we present evidence that dense granule exocytosis is negatively regulated by cytosolic Ca2+, and we show that this Ca2+-mediated response is contingent on the function of calcium-dependent protein kinases TgCDPK1 and TgCDPK3. Reciprocal control of micronemes and dense granules provides an elegant solution to the mutually exclusive functions of these exocytotic compartments in parasite invasion cycles and further demonstrates the central role that Ca2+ signalling plays in the invasion biology of apicomplexan parasites.",

    "abstract": "Preterm birth (PTB) is leading contributor to infant death in the United States and globally, yet the underlying mechanistic causes are not well understood. Histopathological studies of preterm birth suggest advanced villous maturity may have a role in idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth (isPTB). To better understand pathological and molecular basis of isPTB, we compared placental villous transcriptomes from carefully phenotyped cohorts of PTB due to infection or isPTB between 28-36 weeks gestation and healthy term placentasu. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a unique expression signature for isPTB distinct from the age-matched controls that were delivered prematurely due to infection. This signature included the upregulation of three IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP6), supporting a role for aberrant IGF signaling in isPTB. However, within the isPTB expression signature, we detected secondary signature of inflammatory markers including TNC, C3, CFH, and C1R, which have been associated with placental maturity. In contrast, the expression signature of the gestational age-matched infected samples included upregulation of proliferative genes along with cell cycling and mitosis pathways. Together, these data suggest an isPTB molecular signature of placental hypermaturity, likely contributing to the premature activation of inflammatory pathways associated with birth and providing a molecular basis for idiopathic spontaneous birth.",

    "abstract": "CrAssphage (cross-assembly phage) is a bacteriophage that was first discovered in human gut metagenomic data. CrAssphage belongs to a diverse family of crAss-like bacteriophages thought to infect gut commensal bacteria belonging to Bacteroides species. However, not much is known about the biogeography of crAssphage and whether certain strains are associated with specific human populations. In this study, we screened publicly available human gut metagenomic data from 3,341 samples for the presence of crAssphage sensu stricto (NC_024711.1). We found that crAssphage prevalence is low in traditional, hunter-gatherer populations, such as the Hadza from Tanzania and Matses from Peru, as compared to industrialized, urban populations. Statistical comparisons showed no association of crAssphage prevalence with variables such as age, sex, body mass index, and health status of individuals. Phylogenetic analyses show that crAssphage strains reconstructed from the same individual over multiple time-points, cluster together. CrAssphage strains from individuals from the same study population do not always cluster together. Some evidence of clustering is seen at the level of broadly defined geographic regions, however, the relative positions of these clusters within the crAssphage phylogeny are not well-supported. We hypothesize that this lack of strong biogeographic structuring is suggestive of a recent expansion event within crAssphage. Using a Bayesian dating approach, we estimate this expansion has occurred within the past 200 years. Overall, we determine that crAssphage presence is associated with an industrialized lifestyle. The absence of strong biogeographic structuring within global crAssphage strains is likely due to a recent population expansion within this bacteriophage.",

Emerging evidence indicates a role for neurodegenerative disease linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the cellular stress response. However, the relationships between excitotoxicity, RBP function and pathology have not been explored. Here, we found that excitotoxicity induced the translocation of select ALS-linked RBPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm within neurons. RBPs affected by excitotoxicity include TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and, most robustly, fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS). FUS translocation occurs through a calcium-dependent mechanism and coincides with striking alterations in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Further, glutamate-induced upregulation of Gria2 in neurons was dependent on FUS expression, consistent with a functional role for FUS under excitotoxic stress. These findings reveal a link between prominent factors in neurodegenerative disease, namely excitotoxicity, disease-associated RBPs and nucleocytoplasmic transport.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceElevation of cytosolic Ca2+ is required for the release of neuropeptides from specialised secretory neurons called neuroendocrine cells. Release of Ca2+ stored in the ER, which further triggers Ca2+ entry from the extracellular milieu is called Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). STIM, an ER protein, is a key regulator of SOCE and its contribution to neuroendocrine cell functioning is not well studied. Using Drosophila larval development under nutrient restriction as a paradigm, we identified two SOCE regulated neuropeptides, Corazonin and short Neuropeptide F. Reducing STIM alters the level of these neuropeptides in the fed as well as nutrient restricted condition. This study suggests that STIM-triggered SOCE may regulate the release of neuropeptides whose activity ultimately regulates adaptation to nutritional stress.\\n\\nAbstractCytosolic Ca2+ levels are tightly regulated by the sequestration of Ca2+ within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of ER Ca2+ is sensed by STromal Interacting Molecule (STIM), whose translocation to the plasma membrane triggers Store Operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE), and a subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+. Relatively little is known about SOCEs contribution to neuroendocrine cells; a neuronal sub-type that specializes in the secretion of neuropeptides (NPs) which ultimately regulate animal physiology and behavior. To investigate how SOCE regulates NPs, Drosophila development under nutrient restriction (NR) was used as the biological context. Genetic experiments identified the requirement of two SOCE-regulated NPs-corazonin (Crz) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF) - for the development of NR larvae to pupae and finally, adulthood. Overexpression of SOCE regulators was sufficient to rescue the development of NR larvae with reduced sNPF or Crz levels. To facilitate cellular investigations, a restricted set of neurons that produce sNPF and Crz, and are activated by NR, were identified. Immunohistochemistry on these neurons and mass spectrometric measurements of their projections showed that dSTIM regulates Crz and sNPF levels at steady state and in response to NR, likely by modulating their release. Genetically increasing neuronal output, in the background of reduced dSTIM, robustly rescued development of NR larvae. Because NP action fundamentally underpins how animals adapt to stimuli, regulation of NPs by STIM triggered SOCE is likely to be important. In situations where SOCE is altered, such as neurodegenerative diseases, this regulation may contribute to disease manifestation and progression.",

We divided all individuals genetically confirmed of British ancestry into two sub-cohorts (12,162 and 3,435 subjects for discovery and replication samples, respectively). We found that the heritability of the sulcal opening ranges from 15 to 45% (s.e.= 4.8%).

We identified the most significant variant (rs864736) on this locus as being an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the KCNK2 gene. This gene regulates the immune-cell into the central nervous system (CNS) and controls the CNS inflammation, which is implicated in cortical atrophy and cognitive decline.

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) offers a unique opportunity to study this shared genetic etiology with an extended pedigree of 785 individuals. To investigate this common genetic origin, we took advantage of the HCP dataset, which includes both language and mathematics activation tasks. Using the HCP multimodal parcellation, we identified areals in which inter-individual functional MRI (fMRI) activation variance was significantly explained by genetics. Then, we performed bivariate genetic analyses between the neural activations and behavioral scores, corresponding to the fMRI task accuracies, fluid intelligence, working memory and language performance. We observed that several parts of the language network along the superior temporal sulcus, as well as the angular gyrus belonging to the math processing network, are significantly genetically correlated with these indicators of cognitive performance. This shared genetic etiology provides insights into the brain areas where the human-specific genetic repertoire is expressed. Studying the association of polygenic risk scores, using variants associated with human cognitive ability and brain activation, would provide an opportunity to better understand where these variants are influential.",

We next investigated underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. In cultured keratinocytes, CWO stimulated calcium signaling, resulting in calcineurin-dependent activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). In vivo, CWO induced transcriptional changes in immune-related genes, resulting in cytotoxic T cell-dependent tumor regression. Finally, we identified chemical constituents of CWO that recapitulated effects of the admixture. Together, these studies identify T cell-mediated tumor regression as the mechanism through which a plant-derived essential oil diminishes established tumor burden.\\n\\nSUMMARY BLURBEssential oil derived from the camphor tree acts by stimulating immune cell-dependent regression of skin tumors in a mouse model of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWhile the generation of reference genomes facilitates the elucidation of gene-phenome associations, reference models of the metabolome that are specific to organism, sample type (e.g. plasma, serum, urine, cell-culture), and state (including disease), remain uncommon. In studying heart disease in humans, a reference model describing the relationships between metabolites in plasma has not been determined but would have great utility as a reference for comparing acute disease states such as myocardial infarction.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe present a methodology for deriving probabilistic models that describe the partial correlation structure of metabolite distributions (\\\"interactomes\\\") from metabolomics data. As determining partial correlation structures requires estimating p*(p-1)/2 parameters for p metabolites, the dimension of the search space for parameter values is immense. Consequently, we have developed a Bayesian methodology for the penalized estimation of model parameters in which the magnitude of penalization is drawn from probability distributions with hyperparameters linked to molecular structure similarity. In our work, structural similarity was determined as the Tanimoto coefficient of algorithmically-generated \\\"atom colors\\\" that capture the local structure around each atom within each structure. A Gibbs sampler (a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique) was implemented for simulating the posterior distribution of model parameters. We have made software for implementing this methodology publicly available via the R package BayesianGLasso.\\n\\nResults / ConclusionsFirst, we demonstrate robust performance of our methodology (sensitivity, specificity, and measures of accuracy) for recovering the true underlying partial correlation structure over simulated datasets (with simulated metabolite abundances and simulated known structural similarity). We then present an interactome model for stable heart disease inferred from non-targeted mass spectrometry data via this methodology. Inspection of the local graph topology about cholate reveals probabilistic interactions with other primary bile acids, secondary bile acids, and many steroid hormones sharing the same precursors.",

Diverse genetic factors associated with echocardiographic measures of heart structure and functions have been previously reported. The impact of several apoptotic genes in heart development identified in experimental models prompted us to assess their potential association with indicators of human cardiac function. This study started with the aim to investigate the possible association of variants of apoptotic genes with echocardiographic traits and to identify new genetic markers associated with cardiac function.\\n\\nMethods and resultsGenome wide data from different studies were obtained from public repositories. After quality control and imputation, association analyses confirm the role of caspases and other apoptosis related genes with cardiac phenotypes. Moreover, enrichment analysis showed an over-representation of genes, including some apoptotic regulators, associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). We further explored this unexpected observation which was confirmed by genetic correlation analyses.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings show the association of apoptotic gene variants with echocardiographic indicators of heart function and reveal a novel potential genetic link between echocardiographic measures in healthy populations and cognitive decline later on in life.

    "abstract": "The unique and complex metabolism of Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis has been used for decades for efficiently removing phosphorus during wastewater treatment in reactor configurations that expose the activated sludge to cycles of anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The ability of Accumulibacter to grow and remove phosphorus during cyclic anaerobic and anoxic conditions has also been investigated as a metabolism that could lead to simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus by a single organism. However, although phosphorus removal under cyclic anaerobic and anoxic conditions has been demonstrated, elucidating the role of Accumulibacter in this process has been challenging, since experimental research describes contradictory findings and none of the published Accumulibacter genomes show the existence of a complete pathway for denitrification. In this study, we use an integrated omics analysis to elucidate the physiology of an Accumulibacter strain enriched in a reactor operated under cyclic anaerobic and micro-aerobic conditions. The reactors performance suggested the ability of the enriched Accumulibacter (clade IC) to simultaneously use oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors under micro-aerobic conditions. A draft genome of this organism was assembled from metagenomic reads (hereafter referred to as Accumulibacter UW-LDO-IC) and used as a reference to examine transcript abundance throughout one reactor cycle. The genome of UW-LDO-IC revealed the presence of a full denitrification pathway. The observed patterns of transcript abundance showed evidence of co-regulation of the denitrifying genes along with a cbb3 cytochrome, which is characterized as having high affinity for oxygen, thus supporting the hypothesis that UW-LDO-IC can simultaneously respire nitrate and oxygen. Furthermore, we identified an FNR-like binding motif upstream of the coregulated genes, suggesting transcriptional level regulation of the expression of both denitrifying and respiratory pathways in Accumulibacter UW-LDO-IC. Taken together, the omics analysis provides strong evidence that Accumulibacter UW-LDO-IC simultaneously uses oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors under micro-aerobic conditions.\\n\\nIMPORTANCECandidatus Accumulibater phosphatis is widely found in full-scale wastewater treatment plants, where it has been identified as the key organism for biological removal of phosphorus. Since aeration can account for 50% of the energy use during wastewater treatment, micro-aerobic conditions for wastewater treatment have emerged as a cost-effective alternative to conventional biological nutrient removal processes. Our study provides strong genomics-based evidence that Accumulibacter is not only the main organism contributing to phosphorus removal under micro-aerobic conditions, but also that this organism simultaneously respires nitrate and oxygen in this environment, consequently removing nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater. Such activity could be harnessed in innovative designs for cost-effective and energy-efficient optimization of wastewater treatment systems.",

Measuring the salience of a stimulus using behavioral methods risks confounds with top-down attention, particularly in the case of natural soundscapes. A distraction paradigm is employed here to measure physiological effects of salient auditory stimuli using electroencephalography. Several such effects are presented. In particular, a stimulus entrainment response is reduced by the presentation of distractor salient sounds. A reduction in oscillatory neural responses in the gamma frequency band is also observed following salient stimuli. These measures are used to identify salient portions of the natural scene.

We used single-molecule TIRFM and developed a kinetic model to dissect Ena/VASPs processive mechanism on bundled filaments. Notably, Ena/VASPs processive run length increases with the number of both bundled filaments and Ena arms, revealing avidity facilitates enhanced processivity. Moreover, Ena tetramers form more filopodia than mutant dimer and trimers in Drosophila culture cells. Finally, enhanced processivity on trailing barbed ends of bundled filaments is an evolutionarily conserved property of Ena/VASP homologs and is specific to fascin-bundled filaments. These results demonstrate that Ena tetramers are tailored for enhanced processivity on fascin bundles and avidity of multiple arms associating with multiple filaments is critical for this process. Furthermore, we discovered a novel regulatory mechanism whereby bundle size and bundling protein specificity control activities of a processive assembly factor.",

    "abstract": "The number of chromosomes carried by an individual species is one of its defining characteristics. Some species, however, can also carry supernumerary chromosomes referred to as B chromosomes. B chromosomes were recently identified in a laboratory stock of Drosophila melanogaster--an established model organism with a wealth of genetic and genomic resources--enabling us to subject them to extensive molecular analysis. We isolated the B chromosomes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and determined their composition through next-generation sequencing. Although these B chromosomes carry no known euchromatic sequence, they are rich in transposable elements and long arrays of short nucleotide repeats, the most abundant being the uncharacterized AAGAT satellite repeat. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization on metaphase chromosome spreads revealed this repeat is located on Chromosome 4, strongly suggesting the origin of the B chromosomes is Chromosome 4. Cytological and quantitative comparisons of signal intensity between Chromosome 4 and the B chromosomes supports the hypothesis that the structure of the B chromosome is an isochromosome. We also report the identification of a new B chromosome variant in a related laboratory stock. This B chromosome has a similar repeat signature as the original but is smaller and much less prevalent. We examined additional stocks with similar genotypes and did not find B chromosomes, but did find these stocks lacked the AAGAT satellite repeat. Our molecular characterization of D. melanogaster B chromosomes is the first step towards understanding how supernumerary chromosomes arise from essential chromosomes and what may be necessary for their stable inheritance.",

    "abstract": "The collection all TFs, target genes and their interactions in an organism form a gene regulatory network (GRN), which underly complex patterns of transcription even in unicellular species. However, identifying which interactions regulate expression in a specific temporal context remains a challenging task. With multiple experimental and computational approaches to characterize GRNs, we predicted general and phase-specific cell-cycle expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using four regulatory data sets: chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), TF deletion data (Deletion), protein binding microarrays (PBMs), and position weight matrices (PWMs). Our results indicate that the source of regulatory interaction information significantly impacts our ability to predict cell-cycle expression where the best model was constructed by combining selected TF features from ChIP and Deletion data as well as TF-TF interaction features in the form of feed-forward loops. The TFs that were the best predictors of cell-cycle expression were enriched for known cell-cycle regulators but also include regulators not implicated in cell-cycle regulation previously. In addition, ChIP and Deletion datasets led to the identification different subsets of TFs important for predicting cell-cycle expression. Finally, analysis of important TF-TF interaction features suggests that the GRN regulating cell cycle expression is highly interconnected and clustered around four groups of genes, two of which represent known cell-cycle regulatory complexes, while the other two contain TFs that are not known cell-cycle regulators (Ste12-Tex1 and Rap1-Hap1-Msn4), but are nonetheless important to regulating the timing of expression. Thus, not only do our models accurately reflect what is known about the regulation of the S. cerevisiae cell cycle, they can be used to discover regulatory factors which play a role in controlling expression during the cell cycle as well as other contexts with discrete temporal patterns of expression.",

The MrNV capsid has also been engineered to display heterologous antigens, thus knowledge of its atomic resolution structure will benefit efforts to develop tools based on this platform. Here we present an atomic-resolution model of the MrNV capsid protein, calculated by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) of MrNV virus-like particles (VLPs) produced in insect cells, and three-dimensional image reconstruction at 3.3 [A] resolution. CryoEM of MrNV virions purified from infected freshwater prawn post-larvae yielded a 6.6 [A] resolution structure confirming the biological relevance of the VLP structure.\\n\\nOur data revealed that unlike other known nodaviruses structures, which have been shown to assemble capsids having trimeric spikes, MrNV assembles a T=3 capsid with dimeric spikes. We also found a number of surprising similarities between the MrNV capsid structure and that of the Tombusviridae. 1. An extensive network of N-terminal arms lines the capsid interior forming long-range interactions to lace together asymmetric units. 2. The capsid shell is stabilised by three pairs of Ca2+ ions in each asymmetric unit. 3. The protruding spike domain exhibits a very similar fold to that seen in the spikes of the tombusviruses.

    "abstract": "Tumor progression is dependent on metabolic reprogramming. Metastasis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) are typical tumor progression. The relationship of metastasis, VM and metabolic reprogramming is not clear. In this study, we identified the novel role of Twist1, a VM regulator, in the transcriptional regulation of the expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP). We demonstrated that TP promoted extracellular thymidine metabolization into ATP and amino acids through pentose Warburg effect by coupling the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. Moreover, Twist1 relied on TP-induced metabolic reprogramming to promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis and VM formation mediated by VE-Cad, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 in vitro and in vivo. TP inhibitor tipiracil reduced promotion effect of TP enzyme activity on HCC VM formation and metastasis. Our findings demonstrate that TP, transcriptionally activated by Twist1, promotes HCC VM formation and metastasis through pentose Warburg effect, contributing to tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "To model the responses of neurons in the early visual system, at least three basic components are required: a receptive field, a normalization term, and a specification of encoding noise. Here, we examine how the receptive field, the normalization factor, and the encoding noise impact the model neuron responses to natural images and the signal-to-noise ratio for natural image discrimination. We show that when these components are modeled appropriately, the model neuron responses to natural stimuli are Gaussian distributed, scale-invariant, and very nearly maximize the signal-to-noise ratio for stimulus discrimination. We discuss the statistical models of natural stimuli that can account for these response statistics, and we show how some commonly used modeling practices may distort these results. Finally, we show that normalization can equalize important properties of neural response across different stimulus types. Specifically, narrowband (stimulus- and feature-specific) normalization causes model neurons to yield Gaussian-distributed responses to natural stimuli, 1/f noise stimuli, and white noise stimuli. The current work makes recommendations for best practices and it lays a foundation, grounded in the response statistics to natural stimuli, upon which principled models of more complex visual tasks can be built.",

    "abstract": "The long-term expansion of keratinocytes under serum- and feeder free conditions generally results in diminished proliferation and an increased commitment to terminal differentiation. Here we present a serum and xenogeneic feeder free culture system that retains the self-renewal capacity of primary human keratinocytes. In vivo, the tissue microenvironment is a major contributor to determining cell fate and a key component of the microenvironment is the extracellular matrix (ECM). Accordingly, acellular ECMs derived from human dermal fibroblasts, cultured under macromolecular crowding conditions to facilitate matrix deposition and organisation, were used as the basis for a xenogeneic-free keratinocyte expansion protocol. A phospholipase A2 decellularisation procedure produced matrices which, by proteomics analysis, resembled in composition the core matrix proteins of skin dermis. On these ECMs keratinocytes proliferated rapidly, retained their small size, expressed p63, did not express keratin 10 and rarely expressed keratin 16. Moreover, the colony forming efficiency of keratinocytes cultured on these acellular matrices was markedly enhanced. Collectively these data indicate that the dermal fibroblast-derived matrices support the in vitro expansion of keratinocytes that maintained stem-like characteristics under serum free conditions.",

    "abstract": "The catalog of cancer driver mutations in protein-coding genes has greatly expanded in the past decade. However, non-coding cancer driver mutations are less well-characterized and only a handful of recurrent non-coding mutations, most notably TERT promoter mutations, have been reported. Motivated by the success of pathway and network analyses in prioritizing rare mutations in protein-coding genes, we performed multi-faceted pathway and network analyses of non-coding mutations across 2,583 whole cancer genomes from 27 tumor types compiled by the ICGC/TCGA PCAWG project. While few non-coding genomic elements were recurrently mutated in this cohort, we identified 93 genes harboring non-coding mutations that cluster into several modules of interacting proteins. Among these are promoter mutations associated with reduced mRNA expression in TP53, TLE4, and TCF4. We found that biological processes had variable proportions of coding and non-coding mutations, with chromatin remodeling and proliferation pathways altered primarily by coding mutations, while developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch, altered by both coding and non-coding mutations. RNA splicing was primarily targeted by non-coding mutations in this cohort, with samples containing non-coding mutations exhibiting similar gene expression signatures as coding mutations in well-known RNA splicing factors. These analyses contribute a new repertoire of possible cancer genes and mechanisms that are altered by non-coding mutations and offer insights into additional cancer vulnerabilities that can be investigated for potential therapeutic treatments.",
