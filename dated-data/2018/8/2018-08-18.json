    "abstract": "Long-term field studies coupled with quantitative genomics offer a powerful means to understand the genetic bases underlying quantitative traits and their evolutionary changes. However, analyzing and interpreting the time scales at which adaptive evolution occurs is challenging. First, while evolution is predictable in the short term, with strikingly rapid phenotypic changes in data series, it remains unpredictable in the long term. Second, while the temporal dynamics of some loci with large effect on phenotypic variation and fitness have been characterized, this task can be complicated in cases of highly polygenic trait architecture implicating numerous small effect size loci, or when statistical tests are sensitive to the heterogeneity of some key characteristics of the genome, like recombination rate variations. After introducing these aforementioned challenges, we discuss a recent investigation of the genomic architecture and spatio-temporal variation in great tit bill length, which was related to the recent use of bird feeders. We discuss how this case study illustrates the importance of considering different temporal scales and evolutionary mechanisms both while analyzing trait temporal trends and when searching for and interpreting the signals of putative genomic footprints of selection. More generally this commentary discusses interesting challenges for unraveling the time scale at which adaptive traits evolve and their genomic bases.\\n\\nImpact summaryAn important goal in evolutionary biology is to understand how individual traits evolve, leading to fascinating variations in time and space. Long-term field studies have been crucial in trying to understand the timing, extent, and ecological determinants of such trait variation in wild populations. In this context, recent genomic tools can be used to look for the genetic bases underlying such trait variation and can provide clues on the nature and timing of their evolution. However, the analysis and the interpretation of the time scales at which evolution occurs remain challenging. First, analyzing long-term data series can be tricky; short-term changes are highly predictable whereas long-term evolution is much less predictable. A second difficult task is to study the architecture of complex quantitative traits and to decipher the timing and roles of the several genomic mechanisms involved in their evolution. This commentary introduces these challenges and discusses a recent investigation of the nature and timing of ecological and genomic factors responsible for variation in great tit bill length. Overall, we raise cautionary warnings regarding several conceptual and technical features and limitations when coupling analyses of long-term and genomic data to study trait evolution in wild populations.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale studies using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies generate substantial lists of differentially expressed genes under different experimental conditions. These gene lists need to be further mined to narrow down biologically relevant genes and associated functions in order to guide downstream functional genetic analyses. A popular approach is to determine statistically overrepresented genes in a user-defined list through enrichment analysis tools, which rely on functional annotations of genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Here, we propose a new approach, GenFam, which allows classification and enrichment of genes based on their gene family, thus simplifying identification of candidate gene families and associated genes that may be relevant to the query. GenFam and its integrated database comprises of three-hundred and eighty-four unique gene families and supports gene family classification and enrichment analyses for sixty plant genomes. Four comparative case studies with plant species belonging to different clades and families were performed using GenFam which demonstrated its robustness and comprehensiveness over preexisting functional enrichment tools. To make it readily accessible for plant biologists, GenFam is available as a web-based application where users can input gene IDs and export enrichment results in both tabular and graphical formats. Users can also customize analysis parameters by choosing from the various statistical enrichment tests and multiple testing correction methods. Additionally, the web-based application, source code and database are freely available to use and download. Website: http://mandadilab.webfactional.com/home/.

    "abstract": "Determining the three dimensional structures of macromolecules is a major goal of biological research because of the close relationship between structure and function. Structure determination usually relies on physical techniques including x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Here we present a method that allows the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a biological macromolecule to be determined only from measurements of the activity of mutant variants of the molecule. This genetic approach to structure determination relies on the quantification of genetic interactions (epistasis) between mutations and the discrimination of direct from indirect interactions. This provides a new experimental strategy for structure determination, with the potential to reveal functional and in vivo structural conformations at low cost and high throughput.",

Studies also suggest that REMSD are involved with muscle injury, cardiac injury and neurodegerative diseases.\\n\\nObjective and methodsThe aim of this research was to determine whether REMSD of rats would generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and create oxidative stress in the hepatocytes. We selectively deprived the rats from REM sleep using the standard flower pot method.\\n\\nResultsWe observed that when rats were subjected to REMSD, the levels of ROS in the hepatocytes increased with the increase in the number of days of REMSD by [~]265%, but it returned towards normal levels after recovery sleep for 5 days ([~]36%) compared to controls. Nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and protein was found elevated in hepatocytes in response to REM sleep loss as confirmed by real time PCR and western blot analysis compared to controls. The level of nitric oxide (NO) also increased by [~] 675% in the hepatocytes of REMSD rats as compared to that of control group of animals.\\n\\nDiscussionWe have analyzed the oxidative stress generated and potentiation of hepatocytes against oxidative stress in response to REMSD. Since, REM sleep is known to play an important role for survival of most animals and has important role in maintenance of body physiology. Hence, our findings that loss of REM sleep in hepatocytes of rats can affect the ROS levels and induce iNOS & NO circulation, while making them more susceptible to oxidative stress assumes significance.\\n\\nHighlights of the studyO_LIWe observed elevated levels of ROS in the hepatocytes of REM sleep deprived rats.\\nC_LIO_LIThe hepatocytes of REMSD group of rats were found more susceptible to oxidative stress than that of control groups.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found increased expression of iNOS gene and nitric oxide synthase protein in the hepatocytes of REMSD rats.\\nC_LIO_LIWe observed that nitric oxide levels in the hepatocytes of REM sleep deprived rats increased positively with days of REMSD, but returned to its normal levels after 5 days of recovery sleep.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Infections with several flatworm parasites represent group 1 biological carcinogens, i.e. definite causes of cancer. Infection with the food-borne liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini causes cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Whereas the causative agent for most cancers, including CCA in the West, remains obscure, the principal risk factor for CCA in Thailand is opisthorchiasis. We exploited this established link to explore the role of the secreted parasite growth factor termed liver fluke granulin (Ov-GRN-1) in pre-malignant lesions of the biliary tract. We targeted the Ov-grn-1 gene for programmed knockout and investigated gene-edited parasites in vitro and in experimentally infected hamsters. Both adult and juvenile stages of the liver fluke were transfected with a plasmid encoding a guide RNA sequence specific for exon 1 of Ov-grn-1 and the Cas9 nuclease. Deep sequencing of amplicon libraries from genomic DNA from gene-edited parasites exhibited programmed, Cas9-catalyzed mutations within the Ov-grn-1 locus, and tandem analyses by RT-PCR and western blot revealed rapid depletion of Ov-grn-1 transcripts and protein. Newly excysted juvenile flukes that had undergone editing of Ov-grn-1 colonized the biliary tract, grew and developed over a period of 60 days, were active and motile, and induced a clinically relevant pathophysiological tissue phenotype of attenuated biliary hyperplasia and fibrosis in comparison to infection with wild type flukes. This is the first report of gene knock-out using CRISPR/Cas9 in a parasitic flatworm, demonstrating the activity and utility of the process for functional genomics in these pathogens. The striking clinical phenotype highlights the role in virulence that liver fluke growth factors play in biliary tract morbidity during chronic opisthorchiasis.",

    "abstract": "Cortical actomyosin flows play pivotal roles in cell motility, cell division and animal morphogenesis. According to many model systems, myosin motor induced local contractions are key for generating cortical flows. However, the original mechanism how large-scale directed flows emerge from local motor activity in an apparently isotropic cortex is unknown. We reconstituted and confined minimal actomyosin cortices to the interfaces of emulsion droplets. The presence of ATP leads to myosin-induced cortical contractions that self-organize into directed flow-like actomyosin motions. By combining our experiments with theory, we found that the large-scale directional motion of actomyosin clusters emerges from individual asymmetric cluster vibrations, caused by intrinsic non-isotropic ATP consumption, in conjunction with spherical confinement. By tracking individual actomyosin clusters, we identified fingerprints of vibrational states as the basis of directed motions. These vibrations may represent a generic key driver of directed actomyosin flows under spatial confinement in vitro and in living systems.",

    "abstract": "How proteins localize at the pole remains an enigma. DivIVA/Wag31, which is an essential pole organizing protein in mycobacteria, can assemble at the negatively curved side of the membrane at the growing pole to form a higher order structural scaffold for maintaining cellular morphology and localizing various target proteins for cell-wall biogenesis. A single-site phosphorylation in Wag31 is linked to the regulation of peptidoglycan biosynthesis for optimal mycobacterial growth. The structural organization of polar scaffold formed by coiled-coil rich Wag31, which is a target for anti-tubercular agent amino-pyrimidine sulfonamide, remains to be determined. Here, we report biophysical characterizations of a phospho-mimetic (T73E) and a phospho-ablative (T73A) form of mycobacterial Wag31 using circular dichroism, small angle solution X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. While data obtained from both variants of Wag31 in solution states suggested formation of alpha-helical, large, elongated particles, their structural organizations were different. Atomic force microscopic images of Wag31 indicate polymer formation, with occasional curving, sharp bending and branching. Observed structural features in this first view of the polymeric forms of Wag31 suggest a basis for higher order network scaffold formation for polar protein localization.",

Yet a coherent framework describing pulvinar function remains elusive due to its anatomical complexity and involvement in diverse cognitive processes. Here we combined large-scale anatomical circuit mapping with high-density electrophysiological recordings to dissect a homolog of pulvinar in mice, the lateral posterior nucleus (LP). We define three broad LP subregions based on correspondence between input/output connectivity and functional properties. These subregions form corticothalamic loops biased towards ventral or dorsal stream cortical areas and contain separate representations of visual space. To reveal which input sources drive LP activity, we silenced visual cortex or superior colliculus and found they drive visual tuning properties in separate LP subregions. Thus, by specifying the driving input sources, functional properties, and downstream targets of LP circuits, our data provide a roadmap for understanding the mechanisms of higher-order thalamic function in vision.",

    "abstract": "Protein-small molecule docking programs predict the interaction interface and energy between a given protein target and a small molecule ligand. The accuracy of docking predictions generally improve with the guidance of experimentally derived restraints. One available source of such restraints is structure-activity relationships (SARs). SARs provide information on changes in binding affinity or biological response corresponding to a chemical change in the protein and/or ligand. These chemical changes frequently refer to amino acid mutations on the protein side and functional group modifications on the ligand side. Theoretically, predicted interaction energies should correlate with SARs though in practice, this is challenging due to the difficulties in scoring protein-ligand interactions. We have previously developed RosettaLigandEnsemble (RLE), a protein-ligand docking method that simultaneously docks a congeneric ligand series to a single protein target. RLE is capable of identifying native-like binding modes for a ligand series that match the available ligand SARs. This work in progress reports on the extension of RLE to factor in SARs derived from protein mutagenesis data. The new method, ProteinLigEnsemble (PLE), is also part of the Rosetta Biomolecular Modeling Suite available at https://www.rosettacommons.org/. We have also developed protein ensemble docking features that allow for docking or screening against multiple receptor variants at the same time. We have included a proof of concept study and a tutorial for interested users.",

    "abstract": "CTPsyn is a crucial metabolic enzyme which synthesizes CTP molecules through the de novo or salvage pathway. It has the extraordinary ability to compartmentalize into filaments termed cytoophidia. Although this property is retained amongst orthologues, and cytoophidia are therefore found across kingdoms, the mechanisms behind their formation remain unknown. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA with length of 20 - 22 nucleotides, capable of exerting mRNA silencing and degradation as a form of regulation. D. melanogaster itself has a high total gene count to miRNA gene number ratio, alluding to the possibility that CTPsyn may too come under the regulatory effects of these small RNAs. A thorough miRNA overexpression involving 123 UAS-miRNA lines, followed by staining of ovarian cytoophidia dme-egg chambers, revealed a small group of candidates which confer either a lengthening or truncating effect on the structure. Prime candidates are identified on the basis of consistency. MiR-975 and miR-1014 are both cytoophidia-elongating, whereas miR-190 and miR-932 are cytoophidia-shortening. Though target prediction shows that miR-975 and miR-932 do indeed have binding sites on CTPsyn mRNA, in vitro assays instead revealed that none of the four candidates may actually do so. This suggests that the effects asserted by overexpressed miRNAs indirectly reach CTPsyn and its cytoophidia through the actions of middling elements. In silico target prediction and qPCR quantification indicated that, at least for miR-932 and miR-1014, these undetermined elements may be players in fat metabolism. This is the first study to thoroughly investigate miRNAs in connection to CTPsyn expression and activity in any species. The findings presented could serve as a basis for further queries into not only the fundamental aspects of the enzymes regulation, but may uncover new facets of closely related pathways as well.",

    "abstract": "The development of mechanically functional cartilage and bone tissue constructs of clinically relevant size, as well as their integration with native tissues, remain important challenges for regenerative medicine. The objective of this study was to assess adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in large, three dimensionally woven poly({varepsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds in proximity to viable bone, both in a nude rat subcutaneous pouch model and under simulated conditions in vitro. In Study I, various scaffold permutations: PCL alone, PCL-bone, \\\"point-of- care\\\" seeded MSC-PCL-bone, and chondrogenically pre-cultured Ch-MSC-PCL-bone constructs were implanted in a dorsal, ectopic pouch in a nude rat. After eight weeks, only cells in the Ch- MSC-PCL constructs exhibited both chondrogenic and osteogenic gene expression profiles. Notably, while both tissue profiles were present, constructs that had been chondrogenically pre- cultured prior to implantation showed a loss of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) as well as the presence of mineralization along with the formation of trabecula-like structures. In Study II of the study, the GAG loss and mineralization observed in Study I in vivo were recapitulated in vitro by the presence of either nearby bone or osteogenic culture medium additives but were prevented by a continued presence of chondrogenic medium additives. These data suggest conditions under which adult human stem cells in combination with polymer scaffolds synthesize functional and phenotypically distinct tissues based on the environmental conditions, and highlight the potential influence that paracrine factors from adjacent bone may have on MSC fate, once implanted in vivo for chondral or osteochondral repair.",

    "abstract": "P2x7 and P2x4 receptors (P2x7R and P2x4R, respectively) are ligand-gated ion channels activated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which have been associated to dysfunctional processes in stress responses linked to depression, such as neurotransmitter release, cognition, sleep, energy, appetite, immune and endocrine dysfunction. Clinical studies indicate that polymorphisms in the P2x7r gene results in increased susceptibility for development of depression. Existing studies have investigated the role of P2x7R and P2x4R in animal models based on stress exposure. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the transcript and protein levels of these receptors in a genetic animal model of depression, the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) and its control group, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats. We found that FSL rats have increased transcript levels of P2x7R and P2x4R in frontal cortex (FC), ventral and dorsal hippocampus (vHip and dHip, respectively) compared to FRL rats. There were no alterations in the protein levels in the FC and dHip, but the P2x7R was lower in FSL than in FRL rats in the vHip. The results suggest that increased transcripts levels of P2x7r and P2x4r in the FSL rats may contribute to the stress-susceptibility observed in these animals.",

    "abstract": "The parafascicular nucleus (Pf) of the thalamus projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a major target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinsons disease (PD), but the function of this projection remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetics, 3D motion capture, in vivo electrophysiology and 1-photon calcium imaging, unsupervised behavioral classification, and viral-based neuroanatomical tracing to examine the contribution of Pf efferents to movement generation in mice. We discovered that Pf neurons are highly correlated with movement velocity and excitation of Pf neurons generates turning and orienting movements. Movement initiation was not due to Pf projections to the striatum, but rather its projections to the STN. Optogenetic excitation of the Pf-STN pathway restores movement in a common mouse model of PD with complete akinesia. Collectively, our results reveal a thalamo-subthalamic pathway regulating movement initiation, and demonstrate a circuit mechanism that could potentially explain the clinical efficacy of DBS for relief of PD motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "A variety of Alzheimers disease (AD) mouse models overexpress mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), producing high levels of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) and forming plaques However, the degree to which these models mimic spatiotemporal patterns of A{beta} deposition in brains of AD patients is unknown. Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of A{beta} plaques across ages in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, hAPP-J20) using in vivo labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial 2-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms. Image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D reference atlas, enabling automated brain-wide quantification of plaque density, number, and location. In both APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice, plaques were identified first in isocortex, followed by olfactory, hippocampal, and cortical subplate areas. In hAPP-J20 mice, plaque density was highest in hippocampal areas, followed by isocortex, with little to no involvement of olfactory or cortical subplate areas. Within the major brain divisions, distinct regions were identified with high (or low) plaque accumulation; e.g., the lateral visual area within the isocortex of APP/PS1 mice had relatively higher plaque density compared with other cortical areas, while in hAPP-J20 mice, plaques were densest in the ventral retrosplenial cortex. In summary, we show how whole brain imaging of amyloid pathology in mice reveals the extent to which a given model recapitulates the regional A{beta} deposition patterns described in AD.",

    "abstract": "Cortical activity is organised across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Most research on the dynamics of neuronal spiking is concerned with timescales of 1 ms - 1 s, and little is known about spiking dynamics on timescales of tens of seconds and minutes. Here, we used frequency domain analyses to study the structure of individual neurons spiking activity and its coupling to local population rate and to arousal level across frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 100 Hz. In mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the spiking dynamics of individual neurons could be quantitatively captured by a combination of interspike interval and firing rate power spectrum distributions. The relative strength of coherence with local population often differed across timescales: a neuron strongly coupled to population rate on fast timescales could be weakly coupled on slow timescales, and vice versa. On slow but not fast timescales, a substantial proportion of neurons showed firing anti-correlated with the population. Infraslow firing rate changes were largely determined by arousal rather than by local factors, which could explain the timescale dependence of population coupling strength of individual neurons. These observations demonstrate how individual neurons simultaneously partake in fast local dynamics, and slow brain-wide dynamics, extending our understanding of infraslow cortical activity beyond the mesoscale resolution of fMRI studies.",

    "abstract": "Self-control is vital for a wide range of outcomes across our lifespan, yet the developmental trajectory of its core components during adolescence remains elusive. Many adolescents can successfully regulate their behavior even when they do not show strong activation in brain regions typically recruited during self-control in adults. Thus, adolescents may rely on other neural and cognitive resources to compensate, including daily experiences navigating and managing complex social relationships that likely bolster self-control processes. Here, we tested whether activity and connectivity in brain systems associated with social cognition (i.e., self-processing and mentalizing) facilitated successful self-control. We measured brain activity using fMRI as 62 adolescents completed a Go/No-Go response inhibition task. Recruitment of social brain systems, especially the self-processing system, was associated with better response inhibition in adolescents. Interestingly, the reliance on the self-processing system was stronger in adolescents with weaker activation in the canonical response inhibition system, suggesting a compensatory role for social brain systems during adolescent development. Furthermore, we examined the importance of social context by computing the size, number of communities, and modularity of our participants real-life social network. We found that adolescents with more friends and more communities in their social networks demonstrated a stronger relationship between response inhibition and recruitment of social brain systems. Collectively, our results identify the importance of social context and its moderating role on the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Furthermore, our results indicate a critical role for social brain systems during the developmental trajectory of self-control throughout adolescence.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe employed a network neuroscience approach to investigate the role of social context and social brain systems in facilitating self-control in adolescents. We found that recruitment of social brain systems was associated with better response inhibition in adolescents, especially for adolescents with weaker activation in the response inhibition system. Moreover, adolescents with more friends and communities in their social networks showed stronger relationships between response inhibition and recruitment of social brain systems. Our results advance understanding of how brain systems facilitate self-control in adolescents, and how these brain responses are associated with features of an adolescents real-life social network. Bringing together findings related to brain networks and social networks provides key insights into how biology and environment mutually influence development.",

    "abstract": "Conductance-based models of neurons are used extensively in computational neuroscience. Working with these models can be challenging due to their high dimensionality and large number of parameters. Here, we present a neuron and network simulator built on a novel automatic type system that binds object-oriented code written in C++ to objects in MATLAB. Our approach builds on the tradition of uniting the speed of languages like C++ with the ease-of-use and feature-set of scientific programming languages like MATLAB. Xolotl allows for the creation and manipulation of hierarchical models with components that are named and searchable, permitting intuitive high-level programmatic control over all parts of the model. The simulators architecture allows for the interactive manipulation of any parameter in any model, and for visualizing the effects of changing that parameter immediately. Xolotl is fully featured with hundreds of ion channel models from the electrophysiological literature, and can be extended to include arbitrary conductances, synapses, and mechanisms. Several core features like bookmarking of parameters and automatic hashing of source code facilitate reproducible and auditable research. Its ease of use and rich visualization capabilities make it an attractive option in teaching environments. Finally, xolotl is written in a modular fashion, includes detailed tutorials and worked examples, and is freely available at https://github.com/sg-s/xolotl, enabling seamless integration into the workflows of other researchers.",
