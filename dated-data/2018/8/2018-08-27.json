    "abstract": "Extinction threatens many species, yet few factors predict this risk across the plant Tree of Life (ToL). Taxon age is one factor that may associate with extinction if occupancy of geographic and adaptive zones varies with time, but evidence for such an association has been equivocal. Age-dependent occupancy can also influence diversification rates and thus extinction risk where new taxa have small range and population sizes. Here we analysed 509 well-sampled genera from across the plant ToL. We found that a greater proportion of species were threatened by extinction in younger and faster-diversifying genera. Repeating our analyses in two large, well-sampled groups, we found that extinction risk increased with evolutionary age in conifer species but not palms. Potential range size decreased in older, non-threatened conifers more strongly than in threatened taxa, suggesting that range size dynamics may explain differing patterns of extinction risk across the ToL with consequences for biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "Protected areas are the primary management tool for conserving ecosystems, yet their intended outcomes may often be compromised by poaching. Consequently, many protected areas are ineffective  paper parks that contribute little towards conserving ecosystems. Poaching can be prevented through enforcement and engaging with community members so they support protected areas. It is not clear how much needs to be spent on enforcement and engagement to ensure they are frequent enough to be effective at conserving biodiversity. We develop models of enforcement against illegal fishing in marine protected areas. We apply the models to data on fishing rates and fish biomass from a marine protected area in Raja Ampat, Indonesia and explore how frequent enforcement patrols need to be to achieve targets for coral reef fish biomass. Achieving pristine levels of reef fish biomass required almost year-round enforcement of the protected area. Surveillance of the protected area may also be enhanced if local fishers who support the reserve report on poaching. The opportunity for local fishing boats to participate in surveillance was too small for it to have much benefit for total reef fish biomass, which increases slowly. However, specific functional groups of fish have much higher population growth rates and their biomass was predicted to increase markedly with community surveillance. We conclude that budgets for park management must balance the cost of conducting frequent patrols against supporting alternative activities, like education to build community support. Optimized budgets will be much more likely to achieve ecological targets for recovering fish biomasses and will contribute to fiscal sustainability of protected areas.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that memories about experienced stimuli are represented by groups of highly interconnected neurons called cell assemblies. This requires allocating and storing information in the neural circuitry, which happens through synaptic weight adaptation. It remains, however, largely unknown how memory allocation and storage can be achieved and coordinated to allow for a faithful representation of multiple memories without disruptive interference between them. In this theoretical study, we show that the interplay between conventional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling organizes synaptic weight adaptations such that a new stimulus forms a new memory and where different stimuli are assigned to distinct cell assemblies. The resulting dynamics can reproduce experimental in-vivo data, focusing on how diverse factors as neuronal excitability and network connectivity, influence memory formation. Thus, the here presented model suggests that a few fundamental synaptic mechanisms may suffice to implement memory allocation and storage in neural circuitry.",

On the premise that the integration of a replicon within the cell cycle is key to deciphering its essential nature, we show that the content in genes involved in the replication, partition and segregation of the replicons and in the cell cycle discriminates the bacterial replicons into chromosomes, plasmids, and another class of essential genomic elements that function as chromosomes. These latter do not derive directly from plasmids. Rather, they arise from the fission of a multi-replicon molecule corresponding to the co-integrated and rearranged ancestral chromosome and plasmid. All essential replicons in a distributed genome are thus neochromosomes. Having a distributed genome appears to extend and accelerate the exploration of the bacterial genome evolutionary landscape, producing complex regulation and leading to novel eco-phenotypes and species diversification.",

As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform.\\nC_LIO_LIIterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We demonstrate how automated iterative near-term forecasting systems for ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long-term study with over 40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data sharing, data manipulation, modeling and forecasting, archiving, and presentation of the forecasts.\\nC_LIO_LIThe forecasting system uses R code for working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long-term maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models. Constructing this forecasting system required a team with expertise ranging from field site experience to software development.\\nC_LIO_LIAutomated near-term iterative forecasting systems will allow the science of ecological forecasting to advance more rapidly and provide the most up-to-date forecasts possible for conservation and management. These forecasting systems will also accelerate basic science by allowing new models of natural systems to be quickly implemented and compared to existing models. Using existing technology, and teams with diverse skill sets, it is possible for ecologists to build automated forecasting systems and use them to advance our understanding of natural systems.\\nC_LI",

We dissected neuronal substrates underlying the identified habituation deficits and integrated genotype-phenotype annotations, gene ontologies and interaction networks to determine the clinical features and molecular processes that are associated with habituation deficits.\\n\\nResultsWe identified more than 100 genes required for habituation learning. For the vast majority of these, 93 genes, a role in habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes characterize ID disorders with overgrowth/macrocephaly and comorbid ASD. Moreover, ASD individuals from the Simons Simplex Collection carrying disruptive de novo mutations in these genes exhibit increased rates of specific aberrant behaviors including stereotypic speech, hyperactivity and irritability. At the molecular level, ID genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic function and converge on Ras-MAPK signaling. Both increased Ras-MAPK signaling in GABAergic and decreased Ras-MAPK signaling in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive habituation response.\\n\\nConclusionsOur work demonstrates the relevance of habituation learning to autism, identifies an unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an emerging role for inhibitory neurons in habituation and reveals an opposing, circuit-level-based mechanism for Ras-MAPK signaling. This establishes habituation as a possible, widely applicable target for pharmacologic intervention in ID/ASD.",

NAc encodes outcome-related cue features such as the magnitude and identity of reward. However, little is known about how features of cues themselves are encoded. We designed a decision making task where rats learned multiple sets of outcome-predictive cues, and recorded single-unit activity in the NAc during performance. We found that coding of cue identity and location occurred alongside coding of expected outcome. Furthermore, this coding persisted both during a delay period, after the rat made a decision and was waiting for an outcome, and after the outcome was revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations to inform future behavior.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria anchor to their host cells through their adhesive pili, which must resist the large mechanical stresses induced by the host as it attempts to dislodge the pathogens. The pili of Gram-positive bacteria are constructed as a single polypeptide made of hundreds of pilin repeats, which contain intramolecular isopeptide bonds strategically located in the structure to prevent their unfolding under force, protecting the pilus from degradation by extant proteases and oxygen radicals. Here, we demonstrate the design of a short peptide that blocks the formation of the isopeptide bond present in the pilin Spy0128 from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, resulting in mechanically labile pilin domains. We use a combination of protein engineering and AFM force spectroscopy to demonstrate that the peptide blocks the formation of the native isopeptide bond and compromises the mechanics of the domain. While an intact Spy0128 is inextensible at any force, peptide-modified Spy0128 pilins readily unfold at very low forces, marking the abrogation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond as well as the absence of a stable pilin fold. We propose that isopeptide-blocking peptides could be further developed as a novel type of highly-specific anti-adhesive antibiotics to treat Gram-positive pathogens.\\n\\nSignificanceAt the onset of an infection, Gram-positive bacteria adhere to host cells through their pili, filamentous structures built by hundreds of repeats of pilin proteins. These proteins can withstand large mechanical challenges without unfolding, remaining anchored to the host and resisting cleavage by proteases and oxygen radicals present in the targeted tissues. The key structural component that gives pilins mechanical resilience are internal isopeptide bonds, strategically placed so that pilins become inextensible structures. We target this bond by designing a blocking peptide that interferes with its formation during folding. We demonstrate that peptide-modified pilins lack mechanical stability and extend at low forces. We propose this strategy as a rational design of mechanical antibiotics, targeting the Achilles Heel of bacterial adhesion.",

To address this, we investigated cytokinesis during the invariant C. elegans embryo lineage and found several reproducibly altered parameters at different stages. During early divisions, furrow ingression asymmetry and midbody inheritance is consistent, suggesting specific regulation of these events. During morphogenesis, we find several unexpected alterations including migration of midbodies to the apical surface during epithelial polarization in different tissues. Aurora B kinase, which is essential for several aspects of cytokinesis, remains localized to the apical membrane after internalization of other midbody components. Inactivation of Aurora B causes cytokinesis failure, which disrupts polarization and tissue formation. Therefore, cytokinesis shows surprising diversity during development and is required during epithelial polarization to establish cellular architecture during morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI fiber tracking provides a non-invasive method for mapping the trajectories of human brain connections, but its false connection problem has been a major challenge. This study introduces topology-informed pruning (TIP), a method that automatically identifies singular tracts and eliminates them to improve the tracking accuracy. The accuracy of the tractography with and without TIP was evaluated by a team of 6 neuroanatomists in a blinded setting to examine whether TIP could improve the accuracy. The results showed that TIP improved the tracking accuracy by 11.93% in the single-shell scheme and by 3.47% in the grid scheme. The improvement is significantly different from a random pruning (p-value < 0.001). The diagnostic agreement between TIP and neuroanatomists was comparable to the agreement between neuroanatomists. The proposed TIP algorithm can be used to automatically clean up noisy fibers in deterministic tractography, with a potential to confirm the existence of a fiber connection in basic neuroanatomical studies or clinical neurosurgical planning.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRNAseq technology provides unprecedented power in the assesment of the transcription abundance and can be used to perform a variety of downstream tasks such as inference of gene-correlation network and eQTL discovery. However, raw gene expression values have to be normalized for nuisance biological variation and technical covariates, and different normalization strategies can lead to dramatically different results in the downstream study.\n\nResultsWe describe a generalization of SVD-based reconstruction for which the common techniques of whitening, rank-k approximation, and removing the top k principle components are special cases. Our simple three-parameter transformation, DataRemix, can be tuned to reweight the contribution of hidden factors and reveal otherwise hidden biological signals. In particular, we demonstrate that the method can effectively prioritize biological signals over noise without leveraging external dataset-specific knowledge, and can outperform normalization methods that make explicit use of known technical factors. We also show that DataRemix can be efficiently optimized via Thompson Sampling approach, which makes it feasible for computationally expensive objectives such as eQTL analysis. Finally we reanalyze the Depression Gene Networks (DGN) dataset, and we highlight new trans-eQTL networks which were not reported in the initial study.\n\nAvailabilityDataRemix is an R package which is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/wgmao/DataRemix).\n\nContactmchikina@pitt.edu",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal DNA encodes the structural RNAs of the ribosomes. Ribosomal DNA instability is a major contributor to aging in yeast, but its role in human aging and longevity is largely unknown. Human 45S rDNA encodes the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal RNAs; ranges in copy number from 60 to > 800 per cell, distributed as tandem repeats along the short arms of the five acrocentric chromosomes (p13, p14, p15, p21, and p22); and is prone to frequent homologous and non-homologous recombination. Here we present two multiplex quantitative PCR assays, one for 18S rDNA normalized to the single copy gene beta-globin (HBB), and the other for 5.8S rDNA normalized to the single copy gene albumin (ALB). Longitudinally-collected pairs of DNAs from bloods drawn approximately 16 years apart from 40 females and 39 males, aged < 1 to 77 years at first blood draw, from the Utah CEPH families were assayed. Ribosomal DNA copy number varied over a four-fold range between subjects and increased approximately 14% across the lifespan. Longitudinal within-individual gains in copy number up to +68% and losses down to -25% were observed, while repeated assays of single DNA samples varied approximately +/- 10%. While 18S and 5.8S rDNA tended to be gained and lost together, the 18S:5.8S ratio was also unstable longitudinally, with increases up to +19% and decreases down to -15% observed. The 18S:5.8S ratio at second draw, relative to that at first draw, increased significantly across the lifespan in males, but not in females. To our knowledge this is the first report of within-individual longitudinal changes in the human 18S and 5.8S rDNA copy numbers. These assays will facilitate investigations of the biology of ribosomal RNA genes and their roles in health and disease across the human lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Colour is a defining feature of many objects, playing a crucial role in our ability to rapidly recognise things in the world around us and make categorical distinctions. For example, colour is a useful cue when distinguishing lemons from limes or blackberries from raspberries. That means our representation of many objects includes key colour-related information. The question addressed here is whether the neural representation activated by knowing that something is red is the same as that activated when we actually see something red, particularly in regard to timing. We addressed this question using neural timeseries (magnetoencephalography, MEG) data to contrast real colour perception and implied object colour activation. We applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to analyse the brain activation patterns evoked by colour accessed via real colour perception and implied colour activation. Applying MVPA to MEG data allows us here to focus on the temporal dynamics of these processes. Male and female human participants (N=18) viewed isoluminant red and green shapes and grey-scale, luminance-matched pictures of fruits and vegetables that are red (e.g., tomato) or green (e.g., kiwifruit) in nature. We show that the brain activation pattern evoked by real colour perception is similar to implied colour activation, but that this pattern is instantiated at a later time. These results suggest that a common colour representation can be triggered by activating object representations from memory and perceiving colours.",

    "abstract": "The enactment of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) initiated scientific efforts to develop reliable methods for comparing prevailing lake conditions against reference (or non-impaired) states, using the state of a set biological elements. Drawing a distinction between impaired and natural conditions can be a challenging exercise, as it stipulates the robust delineation of reference conditions along with the establishment of threshold values for key environmental variables used as proxies for the degree of system impairment. Another important aspect is to ensure that water quality assessment is comparable among the different Member States. In this context, the present paper offers a constructive critique of the practices followed during the WFD implementation in Greece by pinpointing methodological weaknesses and knowledge gaps that undermine our ability to classify the ecological status of Greek lakes. One of the pillars of WDF is a valid lake typology that sets ecological standards transcending geographic regions and national boundaries. The national typology of Greek lakes has failed to take into account essential components (e.g. surface area, altitude, salinity). WFD compliance assessments based on descriptions of phytoplankton communities are oversimplified and as such should be revisited. Exclusion of most chroococcal species from the analysis of cyanobacteria biovolume in Greek lakes and most reservoirs in the Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration Group (Greece, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus) is not consistent with the distribution of those taxa in lakes. Similarly, the total biovolume reference values and the indices used in their classification schemes reflect misunderstandings of WFD core principles. This hampers the comparability of ecological status across Europe and leads to quality standards that are too relaxed to provide an efficient target especially for the protection and management of Greek/transboundary lakes such as Lake Megali Prespa, one of the oldest lakes in Europe.",

Scientific workflow management systems simplify the assembly of such tools into pipelines, assist with job automation and aid reproducibility of analyses. Many contemporary workflow tools are specialized and not designed for highly complex workflows, such as with nested loops, dynamic scheduling and parametrization, which is common in e.g. machine learning.\\n\\nFindingsSciPipe is a workflow programming library implemented in the programming language Go, for managing complex and dynamic pipelines in bioinformatics, cheminformatics and other fields. SciPipe helps in particular with workflow constructs common in machine learning, such as extensive branching, parameter sweeps and dynamic scheduling and parametrization of downstream tasks. SciPipe builds on Flow-based programming principles to support agile development of workflows based on a library of self-contained, re-usable components. It supports running subsets of workflows for improved iterative development, and provides a data-centric audit logging feature that saves a full audit trace for every output file of a workflow, which can be converted to other formats such as HTML, TeX and PDF on-demand. The utility of SciPipe is demonstrated with a machine learning pipeline, a genomics, and a transcriptomics pipeline.\\n\\nConclusionsSciPipe provides a solution for agile development of complex and dynamic pipelines, especially in machine leaning, through a flexible programming API suitable for scientists used to programming or scripting.",

    "abstract": "Nonhuman animals are housed in captivity for a range of purposes in the US and other countries. The regulation, oversight, and public transparency of decisions related to the care and use of those animals varies by species and activity. The goals of this paper are 1) to provide a concise and accessible summary of the number and types of facilities either registered or licensed by the USDA and overseen by the federal agency; and 2) to provide concise comparisons of the relative proportion of different types of use of nonhuman animals that fall under the AWA (Animal Welfare Act). Analysis of the publicly-available list of USDA certificate holders produced descriptive data for each state and the US overall. Licensed exhibitors (N=2,640; 33% of total) and breeders (N=2,701; 34% of total) comprise two-thirds of the 8,002 USDA certificate holders. Registered research facilities (N=1,110) account for 14% of the total USDA certificates. The final 19% consists of licensed dealers (N=763; 9%) and registered carriers or interim handlers (N=788; 10%). The number and distribution of types of certificates varies across states. The largest number of exhibitors and dealers are in Florida, while the largest number of breeders are in Missouri. California has the largest number of research registered facilities. Finally, a comparison of the estimated number of animals in the US that are pets, used in agriculture, exhibition, and research suggests that animals in research are between 0.07-2.3% of the total. The comparison also highlights areas in which public information about captive animals in the US is uneven or missing altogether. Together, the current report provides a concise view of basic information and data relevant to public consideration and policy decisions about animals housed in the set of captive settings to which the AWA applies.",

Here we show that these activities are governed by regulated proteasomal degradation. MutS{gamma} is initially inactive for crossing over due to an N-terminal degron on Msh4 that renders it unstable. Activation of MutS{gamma} requires the Dbf4-dependent kinase, Cdc7 (DDK), which directly phosphorylates and thereby neutralizes the Msh4 degron. Phosphorylated Msh4 is chromatin bound and requires DNA strand exchange and chromosome synapsis, implying that DDK specifically targets MutS{gamma} that has already bound nascent JMs. Our study establishes regulated protein degradation as a fundamental mechanism underlying meiotic crossover control.",

    "abstract": "Signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a central role in the signal trans-duction and regulation of biochemical processes occurring within the cellular environment. Under-standing their mechanisms and dynamics is of major interest in various areas of life sciences and biological sciences. For example controlling stem cell fate decision requires a comprehension of the dynamical behavior of the networks involved in stem cell differentiation and pluripotency mainte-nance. In addition to analytical mathematical methods which are applicable for small or medium sized systems, there are many computational approaches to model and analyze the behavior of larger systems. However, from a dynamical point of view, modeling a combination of signaling pathways and GRNs present several challenges. Indeed, in addition to being of large dimensionality, these systems have specific dynamical features. Among the most commonly encountered is that the signal transduction controlled by the signaling pathways occurs at a different time scale than the transcription and translation processes. Also, stochasticity is known to strongly impact the regulation of gene expression. In this paper, we describe a simple implementation of an optimized version of the Gille-spie algorithm for simulating relatively large biological networks which include delayed reactions.

    "abstract": "Understanding the role of the epigenome in protein misfolding diseases remains a challenge in light of genetic diversity found in the world-wide population revealed by human genome sequencing efforts and the highly variable respond of the disease population to any therapeutic. An ever-growing body of evidence has shown that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) can have significant benefit in correcting protein misfolding diseases that occur in response to both familial and somatic mutation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a familial autosomal recessive disease, caused by genetic diversity in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, a cAMP-dependent chloride channel expressed at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells in multiple tissues. The potential utility of HDACi in correcting F508del as well as the over 2000 CF-associated variants remains controversial. To address this concern, we examined the impact of FDA-approved HDACi on the trafficking and function of a panel of CFTR variants. Our data reveal that panobinostat (LBH-589) and romidepsin (FK-228) provide functional correction of class II and III CFTR variants, restoring cell surface chloride channel activity in primary human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells. We further demonstrate a synergistic effect of these HDACi with Vx809, that together can significantly restore channel activity for multiple CFTR variants. These data suggest that HDACi can serve to level the cellular playing field for correcting CF-causing mutations, a leveling effect that might also extend to other protein misfolding diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSequencing data has become a standard measure for studying diverse cellular activities. For example, gene expression is accurately measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries, protein-DNA interactions are captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), protein-RNA interactions by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP-Seq) or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP-Seq) sequencing, DNA accessibility by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq), and DNase or MNase sequencing libraries. Analysis of these sequencing techniques involve library-specific approaches. However, in all cases, once the sequencing libraries are processed, the result is a count table specifying the estimated number of reads originating from a genomic locus. Differential analysis to determine which loci have different cellular activity under different conditions starts with the count table and iterates through a cycle of data assessment, preparation and analysis. Such iterative approach relies on multiple programs and is therefore a challenge for those without programming skills.\\n\\nResultsWe developed DEBrowser, as an R bioconductor project, to interactively visualize each step of the differential analysis of count data, without any requirement for programming expertise.

    "abstract": "We intended to analyze the effects of DSCAM-AS1, miR-204-5p and RRM2 on breast cancer (BC) cells growth. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR were employed to determine DSCAM-AS1 and miR-204-5p expression in BC. Luciferase reporter assay and cell transfection assay were applied to examine the target relationship between DSCAM-AS1, miR-204-5p and MMR2. CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry were used to detect cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of breast cancer cells. The expression of DSCAM-AS1, miR-204-5p and MMR2 were confirmed by Western Blot. We also conducted In vivo assay to verify the effect of DSCAM-AS1 on tumor formation.DSCAM-AS1 was up-regulated, while miR-204-5p was down-regulated in BC tissues and cells. Meanwhile, DSCAM-AS1 directly targeted miR-204-5p. DSCAM-AS1 promoted the proliferation and invasion of BC cells and restrained cell apoptosis by reducing miR-204-5p and inhibiting miR-204-5p expression. RRM2 was up-regulated in BC cells, and miR-204-5p inhibited RRM2 expression by targeting RRM2. Overexpression of RRM2 stimulated proliferation and cell invasion and impeded apoptosis of BC cells. In vivo experiments showed that knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 decreased the tumorigenesis of BC cells, increased the expression of miR-204-5p while inhibited RRM2 expression.DSCAM-AS1 promoted proliferation and impaired apoptosis of BC cells by reducing miR-204-5p and enhancing RRM2 expression.

    "abstract": "Pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent used for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), functions by inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation, which is involved in transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta}1-induced IPF pathogenesis. However, unlike normal lung fibroblasts, the relationship between pirfenidone responses of TGF-{beta}1-induced human fibrotic lung fibroblasts and lung fibrosis is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of pirfenidone on the functions of two new targets, collagen triple helix repeat containing protein 1 (CTHRC1) and four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2), which included fibroblast activity, collagen gel contraction, and migration toward fibronectin. Compared to control lung fibroblasts, pirfenidone restored TGF-{beta}1-stimulated fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction, migration, and CTHRC1 release in lung fibrotic fibroblasts. Furthermore, pirfenidone attenuated TGF-{beta}1- and CTHRC1-induced fibroblast activity, bone morphogenic protein-4/Gremlin1 upregulation, and -smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and FHL2 downregulation, similar to that observed post-CTHRC1 inhibition. In contrast, FHL2 inhibition suppressed migration and fibronectin expression but did not downregulate CTHRC1. Overall, pirfenidone suppressed fibrotic fibroblast-mediated fibrotic processes via inverse regulation of CTHRC1-induced lung fibroblast activity. Thus, CTHRC1 can be used for predicting pirfenidone response and developing new therapeutic target for lung fibrosis.\\n\\nSummary statementPirfenidone suppressed TGF-{beta}1-mediated fibrotic processes in fibrotic lung fibroblasts by attenuating CTHRC1 expression, suggesting that CTHRC1 may be a novel therapeutic target for treating patients with lung fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Adrenergic signaling is a well-known input into pancreatic islet function. Specifically, the insulin-secreting islet {beta} cell expresses the Gi/o-linked 2-adrenergic receptor, which upon activation suppresses insulin secretion. The use of adrenergic agonist epinephrine at micromolar doses may have supraphysiological effects. We found that pretreating {beta} cells with micromolar concentrations of epinephrine differentially inhibited activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. We chose TrkB as an example because of its relative sensitivity to the effects of epinephrine and due to its potential regulatory role in the {beta} cell. Our characterization of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TrkB signaling in MIN6 {beta} cells showed that TrkB is activated by BDNF as expected, leading to canonical TrkB autophosphorylation and subsequent downstream signaling, as well as chronic effects on {beta} cell growth. Micromolar, but not nanomolar, concentrations of epinephrine blocked BDNF-induced TrkB autophosphorylation and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation, suggesting an inhibitory phenomenon at the receptor level. We determined epinephrine-mediated inhibition of TrkB activation to be Gi/o-dependent using pertussis toxin, arguing against an off-target effect of high dose epinephrine. Published data suggested that inhibition of potassium channels or phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling may abrogate the negative effects of epinephrine, however these did not rescue TrkB signaling in our experiments. Taken together, these results show that 1) TrkB kinase signaling occurs in {beta} cells and 2) use of epinephrine in studies of insulin secretion requires careful consideration of concentration-dependent effects. BDNF-TrkB signaling in {beta} cells may underlie pro-survival or growth signaling and warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function studies often require the tedious cloning of transgene cDNA into vectors for overexpression beyond the physiological expression levels. The rapid development of CRISPR/Cas technology presents promising opportunities to address these issues. Here we report a simple, cloning-free method to induce gene expression at endogenous locus using CRISPR/Cas9 activators. Our strategy utilises synthesized sgRNA expression cassettes to direct a nuclease-null Cas9 complex fused with transcriptional activators (VP64, p65 and Rta) for site-specific induction of endogenous genes. This strategy allows rapid initiation of gain-of-function studies in the same day. Using this cloning-free approach, we tested two CRISPR activation systems, dSpCas9VPR and dSaCas9VPR, for induction of multiple genes in human and rat cells. Our results showed that both CRISPR activators allow efficient induction of six different neural development genes (CRX, RORB, RAX, OTX2, ASCL1 and NEUROD1) in human cells, whereas the rat cells exhibit a more variable and less efficient levels of gene induction, as observed in three different genes (Ascl1, Neurod1, Nrl). Altogether, this study provides a simple method to efficiently activate endogenous gene expression using CRISPR/Cas9 activators, which can be applies as a rapid workflow to initiate gain-of-function studies for a range of molecular and cell biology disciplines.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial transcriptional factors (TFs) and their target promoters are key devices for engineering of complex circuits in many biotechnological applications. Yet, there is a dearth of well characterized inducer-responsive TFs that could be used in the context of an animal or human host. In this work we have deciphered the inducer recognition mechanism of two AraC/XylS regulators from Pseudomonas putida (BenR and XylS) for creating a novel expression system responsive to acetyl salicylate (i.e. Aspirin). Using protein homology modeling and molecular docking with the cognate inducer benzoate and a suite of chemical analogues, we identified the conserved binding pocket of these two proteins. Using site directed mutagenesis, we identified a single amino acid position required for efficient inducer recognition and transcriptional activation. While modification of this position in BenR abolishes protein activity, its modification in XylS increases the response to several aromatic compounds, including acetyl salicylic acid to levels close to those achieved by the canonical inducer. Moreover, by constructing chimeric proteins with swapped N-terminal domains, we created novel regulators with mixed promoter and inducer recognition profiles. As a result, a collection of engineered TFs was generated with enhanced response to a well characterized and largely innocuous molecule with a potential for eliciting heterologous expression of bacterial genes in animal carriers.",

    "abstract": "In specialized cell types, lysosome-related organelles support regulated secretory pathways, while in non-specialized cells, lysosomes can undergo fusion with the plasma membrane in response to a transient rise in cytosolic calcium. Recent evidence also indicates that lysosome secretion can be controlled transcriptionally and promote clearance in lysosome storage diseases. In addition, evidence is also accumulating that low concentrations of cyclodextrins reduce the cholesterol storage phenotype in cells and animals with the cholesterol storage disease Niemann-Pick type C, via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that cyclodextrin triggers the secretion of the endo/lysosomal content in non-specialized cells, and that this mechanism is responsible for the decreased cholesterol overload in Niemann-Pick type C cells. We also find that that the secretion of the endo/lysosome content occurs via a mechanism dependent on the endosomal calcium channel MCOLN1, as well as FYCO1, the AP1 adaptor and its partner Gadkin. We conclude that endolysosomes in non-specialized cells can acquire secretory functions elicited by cyclodextrin, and that this pathway is responsible for the decrease in cholesterol storage in Niemann-Pick C cells.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). Variants associated with T2D are often located in tissue-specific enhancer regions (enhancer clusters, stretch enhancers or super-enhancers). So far, such domains have been defined through clustering of enhancers in linear genome maps rather than in 3D-space. Furthermore, their target genes are generally unknown. We have now created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated enhancers with their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. It further revealed sets of islet enhancers, super-enhancers and active promoters that form 3D higher-order hubs, some of which show coordinated glucose-dependent activity. Hub genetic variants impact the heritability of insulin secretion, and help identify individuals in whom genetic variation of islet function is important for T2D. Human islet 3D chromatin architecture thus provides a framework for interpretation of T2D GWAS signals.",

    "abstract": "Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are an uncommon and heterogeneous group of malignancies that result in high mortality. Metastatic STS have very bad prognosis due to the lack of effective treatments. Dinaciclib is a model drug for the family of CDK inhibitors. Its main targets are cell cycle regulator CDK1 and protein synthesis controller CDK9. We present data supporting Dinaciclib ability to inactivate in vitro different STS models at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, the different rhythms of cell death induction allow us to further study into the mechanism of action of the drug. Cell death was found to respond to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL was identified as the key regulator of this process. Bcl-xL showed a slower decay curve after protein synthesis disruption that in tolerant cell lines was enough to delay apoptosis, as its action cannot be countered by the relative low levels of pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins BIM and PUMA. Combination of Dinaciclib with BH3-mimetics led to quick and massive apoptosis induction in vitro, but in vivo assessment was prevented due to liver toxicity. Additionally, Bcl-xL inhibitor A-1331852 also synergized with conventional chemotherapy drugs as Gemcitabine. Thus, Bcl-xL targeted therapy arises as a major opportunity to the treatment of STS.",

However, the mechanism behind dGTP selectivity is unclear. Here we present the free-, ligand (dGTP)- and inhibitor (GTP)-bound structures of hexameric E. coli dGTPase. To obtain these structures, we applied UV-fluorescence microscopy, video analysis and highly automated goniometer-based instrumentation to map and rapidly position individual crystals randomly-located on fixed target holders, resulting in the highest indexing-rates observed for a serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) experiment. The structure features a highly dynamic active site where conformational changes are coupled to substrate (dGTP), but not inhibitor binding, since GTP locks dGTPase in its apo form. Moreover, despite no sequence homology, dGTPase and SAMHD1 share similar active site and HD motif architectures; however, dGTPase residues at the end of the substrate-binding pocket mimic Watson Crick interactions providing Guanine base specificity, while a 7 [A] cleft separates SAMHD1 residues from dNTP bases, abolishing nucleotide-type discrimination.

    "abstract": "The presence of supernumerary centrosomes is prevalent in cancer, where they promote the formation of transient multipolar mitotic spindles. Active clustering of supernumerary centrosomes enables the formation of a functional bipolar spindle that is competent to complete a bipolar division. Disruption of spindle pole clustering in cancer cells promotes multipolar division and generation of non-proliferative daughter cells with compromised viability. Hence molecular pathways required for spindle pole clustering in cells with supernumerary centrosomes, but dispensable in normal cells, are promising therapeutic targets. Here we demonstrate that Aurora A kinase activity is required for spindle pole clustering in cells with extra centrosomes. While cells with two centrosomes are ultimately able to build a bipolar spindle and proceed through a normal cell division in the presence of Aurora A inhibition, cells with supernumerary centrosomes form multipolar and disorganized spindles that are not competent for chromosome segregation. Instead, following a prolonged mitosis, these cells experience catastrophic divisions that result in grossly aneuploid, and non-proliferative daughter cells. Aurora A inhibition in a panel of Acute Myeloid Leukemia cancer cells has a similarly disparate impact on cells with supernumerary centrosomes, suggesting that centrosome number and spindle polarity may serve as predictive biomarkers for response to therapeutic approaches that target Aurora A kinase function.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of large-scale interphase genome positioning with reference to a nuclear landmark has recently been studied using sequencing-based single cell approaches. However, these approaches are dependent upon technically challenging, time consuming and costly high throughput sequencing technologies, requiring specialized bioinformatics tools and expertise. Here, we propose a novel, affordable and robust microscopy-based single cell approach, termed Topokaryotyping, to analyze and reconstruct the interphase positioning of genomic loci relative to a given nuclear landmark, detectable as banding pattern on mitotic chromosomes. This is accomplished by proximity-dependent histone labeling, where biotin ligase BirA fused to nuclear envelope marker Emerin was coexpressed together with Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP)-histone fusion followed by (i) biotin labeling, (ii) generation of mitotic spreads, (iii) detection of the biotin label on mitotic chromosomes and (iv) their identification by karyotyping. Using Topokaryotyping, we identified both cooperativity and stochasticity in the positioning of emerin-associated chromatin domains in individual cells. Furthermore, the chromosome-banding pattern showed dynamic changes in emerin-associated domains upon physical and radiological stress. In summary, Topokaryotyping is a sensitive and reliable technique to quantitatively analyze spatial positioning of genomic regions interacting with a given nuclear landmark at the single cell level in various experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cytopathic effects (CPEs) are a hallmark of infections. CPEs can be observed by phase contrast or fluorescence light microscopy, albeit at the cost of phototoxicity. We report that digital holo-tomographic microscopy (DHTM) reveals distinct patterns of virus infections in live cells with minimal perturbation. DHTM is label-free, and records the phase shift of low energy light passing through the specimen on a transparent surface. DHTM infers a 3-dimensional (3D) tomogram based on the refractive index (RI). By measuring RI and computing the refractive index gradient (RIG) values DHTM unveils on optical heterogeneity in cells upon virus infection. We find that vaccinia virus (VACV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections progressively and distinctly increased RIG. VACV, but not HSV and RV infection induced oscillations of cell volume, while all three viruses altered cytoplasmic membrane dynamics, and induced apoptotic features akin to the chemical compound staurosporin, but with virus-specific signatures. In sum, we introduce DHTM for quantitative label-free microscopy in infection research, and uncover virus-type specific changes and CPE in living cells at minimal interference.",

    "abstract": "Genomic instability (GIN) can trigger cellular responses including checkpoint activation, senescence, and inflammation. Though extensively studied in cell culture and cancer paradigms, little is known about the impact of GIN during embryonic development, a period of rapid cellular proliferation. We report that GIN-causing mutations in the MCM2-7 DNA replicative helicase render female mouse embryos to be dramatically more susceptible than males to embryonic lethality. This bias was not attributable to X-inactivation defects, differential replication licensing, or X vs Y chromosome size, but rather \\\"maleness,\\\" since XX embryos could be rescued by transgene-mediated sex reversal or testosterone (T) administration. The ability of exogenous or endogenous T to protect embryos was related to its anti-inflammatory properties. The NSAID ibuprofen rescued female embryos containing mutations not only in MCM genes but also Fancm, which have elevated GIN from compromised replication fork repair. Additionally, deficiency for the anti-inflammatory IL10 receptor was synthetically lethal with the GIN-causing Mcm4Chaos3 helicase mutant. Our experiments indicate that embryonic and maternal GIN arising from DNA replication-associated DNA damage induces embryonic inflammation likely via the cGAS-STING response, preferentially killing female embryos while male embryos are protected by high levels of intrinsic T.",

PTC suppression during translation offers a promising approach to treat a variety of genetic disorders, yet small molecules that promote PTC read-through have yielded mixed performance in clinical trials. We present a high-throughput, cell-based assay to identify anticodon engineered transfer RNAs (ACE-tRNA) which can effectively suppress in-frame PTCs and faithfully encode their cognate amino acid. In total, we identified ACE-tRNA with a high degree of suppression activity targeting the most common human disease-causing nonsense codons. Genome-wide transcriptome ribosome profiling of cells expressing ACE-tRNA at levels which repair PTC indicate that there are limited interactions with translation termination codons. These ACE-tRNAs display high suppression potency in mammalian cells, Xenopus oocytes and mice in vivo, producing PTC repair in multiple genes, including disease causing mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).",

    "abstract": "Functional imaging research has already contributed with several results to the study of neural correlates of consciousness. Apart from task-related activation derived in fMRI, PET based glucose metabolism rate or cerebral blood flow account for a considerable proportion of the study of brain activity under different levels of consciousness. Resting state functional connectivity MRI is playing a crucial role to explore the consciousness related functional integration, successfully complementing PET, another widely used neuroimaging technique. Here, spontaneous hemodynamic response is introduced to characterize resting state brain activity giving information on the local metabolism (neurovascular coupling), and useful to improve the time-resolved activity and connectivity measures based on BOLD fMRI. This voxel-wise measure is then used to investigate the loss of consciousness under Propofol anesthesia and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. The dysfunction of hemodynamic response in precuneus and posterior cingulate is found to be a common principle underlying loss of consciousness in both conditions. The thalamus appears to be less obviously modulated by Propofol, compared with frontoparietal regions. However, a significant increase in spontaneous thalamic hemodynamic response was found in patients in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome compared with healthy control. Our results ultimately show that anesthesia- or pathology-induced neurovascular coupling could be tracked by modulated spontaneous hemodynamic response derived from resting state fMRI.",

    "abstract": "Decoding laminar information across deep brain structures and cortical regions is necessary in order to understand the spatiotemporal ensembles that represent cognition and memory. Large animal models are essential for translational research due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. One of the major obstacles to applying the approaches currently utilized in lower order animals are technical limitations in silicon probes, specifically a lack of long-length probes with appropriate stiffness to penetrate to deeper structures with minimal damage to the neural interface. We tested various solutions and designs of multichannel silicon probes developed for large animal electrophysiology by recording neurophysiological signals from deep laminar structures in an acute preparation and in chronically implanted awake behaving Yucatan pigs. Electrophysiological parameters of single units and local field potentials were analyzed to evaluate performance over time of given silicon probes in chronic implantations. The cross-sectional area of silicon probes was found to be a crucial determinant of silicon probes single unit performance over time, potentially due to reduction of damage to the neural interface. EDGE-style probes had the highest yields during intra-hippocampal recordings in pigs, making them the most suitable for chronic implantations and awake behavioral experimentation. Novel CAMB 64-channel EDGE-style probes with linear and poly-2 site arrangement tested acutely had optimal single unit separation and a denser sampling of the laminar structure, identifying them as potential candidates for chronic implantations with less cortical damage above the active portion of the probe. This study provides an analysis of multichannel silicon probes designed for large animal laminar electrophysiology of deep brain structures, and suggests that current designs are reaching the physical thresholds necessary for long-term (~ 1 month) recordings from laminar deep structures with single-unit resolution.",

    "abstract": "We report the frequencies of linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) and, specifically, pitting enamel hypoplasia (PEH) defects in the teeth of Paranthropus robustus, for comparison with four other South African hominin species and three extant nonhuman primate species. Unlike LEH, the lesser known PEH is characterized by multiple circular depression defects across a tooth crown and is often difficult to interpret in terms of developmental timing and etiology. Teeth in all samples were examined macroscopically with type, position and number of defects recorded. Frequencies of teeth with LEH vary among hominin species, but the differences in PEH are considerable. That is, P. robustus has much higher rates of pitting defects, with 47% of deciduous teeth and 14% of permanent teeth affected, relative to 6.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for all other hominin teeth combined; none of the extant primate samples evidence comparable rates. The defects on P. robustus molars are unlike those in other species, with entire crowns often covered in small circular depressions. The PEH is most consistent with modern human examples of amelogenesis imperfecta. Additionally, the defects are: 1) not found on anterior teeth, 2) uniform in shape and size, and 3) similar in appearance/severity on all molars. A possible reason for this form of PEH is as a side effect of selection on another phenotype that shares the same coding gene(s), i.e., a genetic origin. Recent research on the ENAM gene provides one such possibility. Paranthropus likely underwent rapid evolution in the ENAM loci, with changes in this gene contributing to larger posterior teeth and thicker enamel. This same gene is associated with amelogenesis imperfecta; therefore, pleiotropy effects, relating to high selection on this gene during Paranthropus evolution, could have yielded this unique condition.",

    "abstract": "Fungal plant pathogens live in the specific environment of plants. Understanding of the interaction between pathogens and their host plants might open new ways to control plant diseases. Yet, the specificities of the plant environment and its effects on fungal growth are not yet fully explored. Both pH and Eh play a key role during the interaction between the fungus and its host plants, but often studied independently or at different scales. To decipher the interrelation between plant growth and their soil environment, recent theoretical and methodological advances have been made through the joint characterization of the pH and Eh. This opens the prospect to develop similar methods for fungi. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the methods developed for soil could be transposed to fungi. We first worked on artificial media, assessing the impact of fungal growth on the media in cultures. The growth of all 16 species tested significantly altered either Eh, pH or both in agar media. Measuring Eh reveals that even the species not modifying pH can have an impact on the surrounding environment. Reciprocally, altered media were used to characterize sensitivity of fungal growth to both pH and Eh parameters. The response of the six fungi tested to the modified media was quantitative with a decrease in colony diameter. In addition, colony aspect was repeatedly and thoroughly modified. As a first step towards the same studies in conditions matching the natural environment of fungal pathogens, we tested how the measurement can be performed with fungi growing on oilseed rape plants. In infected plant stems, pH and Eh were significantly altered, in opposite directions for L. maculans and S. sclerotiorum. The observed alcalinisation or acidification correlates with canker length. Our series of experiments indicate that the procedure published for Eh and pH in soil can be extended for measurement in agar media and in infected plants. Further, the joint characterization of both parameters opens the way to a more precise understanding of the impact of fungi on their environment, and conversely, of the environment on fungal growth. The availability of methods for measurement opens the prospect to study combinations of stresses, either on agar media or in plants, and get an understanding of the involvement of pH and Eh modifications in these interactions.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have identified networks in parietal and prefrontal cortex that are involved in intentional action. Yet, knowledge about what these networks exactly encoded is still scarce. In this study we look into the content of those processes. We ask whether the neural representations of intentions are context- and reason-invariant, or whether these processes depend on the context we are in, and the reasons we have for choosing an action. We use a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate decoding to directly assess the context- and reason-dependency of the processes underlying intentional action. We were able to decode action decisions in the same context and for the same reasons from the fMRI data, in line with previous decoding studies. Furthermore, we could decode action decisions across different reasons for choosing an action. Importantly, though, decoding decisions across different contexts was at chance level. These results suggest that for voluntary action, there is considerable context-dependency in intention representations. This suggests that established invariance in neural processes may not reflect an essential feature of a certain process, but that this stable character could be dependent on invariance in the experimental setup, in line with predictions from situated cognition theory.",

    "abstract": "Many complex processes, from protein folding and virus evolution to brain activity and neuronal network dynamics, can be described as stochastic exploration of a high-dimensional energy landscape. While efficient algorithms for cluster detection and data completion in high-dimensional spaces have been developed and applied over the last two decades, considerably less is known about the reliable inference of state transition dynamics in such settings. Here, we introduce a flexible and robust numerical framework to infer Markovian transition networks directly from time-independent data sampled from stationary equilibrium distributions. Our approach combines Gaussian mixture approximations and self-consistent dimensionality reduction with minimal-energy path estimation and multi-dimensional transition-state theory. We demonstrate the practical potential of the inference scheme by reconstructing the network dynamics for several protein folding transitions, gene regulatory network motifs and HIV evolution pathways. The predicted network topologies and relative transition time scales agree well with direct estimates from time-dependent molecular dynamics data, stochastic simulations and phylogenetic trees, respectively. The underlying numerical protocol thus allows the recovery of relevant dynamical information from instantaneous ensemble measurements, effectively alleviating the need for time-dependent data in many situations. Owing to its generic structure, the framework introduced here will be applicable to high-throughput RNA and protein sequencing datasets and future cryo-electron-microscopy data, and can guide the design of new experimental approaches towards studying complex multiphase phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a potentially lethal disease, in which patients with nearly identical genetic backgrounds can develop a similar pathology through distinct combinations of genetic alterations. We aimed to reconstruct the evolutionary process underlying tumour initiation, using the combination of convergence and discrepancies observed across 2,742 cancer genomes from 9 tumour types. We developed a framework using the repeatability of cancer development to score the local malignant adaptation (LMA) of genetic clones, as their potential to malignantly progress and invade their environment of origin. Using this framework, we found that pre-malignant skin and colorectal lesions appeared specifically adapted to their local environment, yet insufficiently for full cancerous transformation. We found that metastatic clones were more adapted to the site of origin than to the invaded tissue, suggesting that genetics may be more important for local progression than for the invasion of distant organs. In addition, we used network analyses to investigate evolutionary properties at the system-level, highlighting that different dynamics of malignant progression can be modelled by such a framework in tumour-type-specific fashion. We find that occurrence-based methods can be used to specifically recapitulate the process of cancer initiation and progression, as well as to evaluate the adaptation of genetic clones to given environments. The repeatability observed in the evolution of most tumour types could therefore be harnessed to better predict the trajectories likely to be taken by tumours and pre-neoplastic lesions in the future.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres dictate the sites for kinetochore assembly on chromosomes, while their own position on each chromosome is determined epigenetically by a specific histone H3 variant CENP-A. For all eukaryotic species, the chromosomal position of each centromere is distinct and inherited with high fidelity, although the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic stability and its functional significance remain largely unknown. Here in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we show that mutations in inner kinetochore components influence centromeric chromatin organization to various levels. In extreme cases, a single deletion of wip1, mhf1 and mhf2 (the conserved CENP-T-W-S-X complex subunits) or double deletions of cnp3 (a homologue of mammalian CENP-C) and fta6 (a pombe specific component) induce centromere repositioning - inactivation of the original centromere and formation of a neocentromere - in one of the three chromosomes at random. Neocentromeres tend to locate in pericentromeric heterochromatin regions, although heterochromatin is not required for centromere inactivation. Cells carrying a neocentromere are competent in mitosis and in meiosis of homozygotes. However, when these cells are crossed to cells carrying the original centromere, the progeny suffers severe lethality due to defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. These results recapitulate a meiosis barrier that could initiate genetic divergence between two populations with mismatched centromeres, documenting a potential role of the Evolutionary New Centromeres (ENCs) in speciation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn eukaryotes, centromeres are chromosomal regions where kinetochores are assembled and the positions of centromeres are accurately inherited. While the centromere and kinetochore assembly are extensively studied, the mechanisms that each centromere maintain its identity on chromosomes are still not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the inner kinetochore is required for the normal centromere identity as single depletion of the inner kinetochore CENP-T-W-S-X complex or double deletions of cnp3/CENP-C and fta6 induce centromere repositioning. We further showed cells carrying a neocentromere are reproductively isolated from the wildtype population carrying the original centromere. Taken together, these results suggest that induced centromere repositioning mimics the evolutionary new centromeres and is sufficient to cause reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial homeostasis requires balanced progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas disrupting this equilibrium fosters degeneration or cancer. Here we studied how cell polarity signaling orchestrates epidermal self-renewal and differentiation. Using genetic ablation, quantitative imaging, mechanochemical reconstitution and atomic force microscopy, we find that mammalian Par3 couples genome integrity and epidermal fate through shaping keratinocyte mechanics, rather than mitotic spindle orientation. Par3 inactivation impairs actomyosin contractility and viscoelasticity, and elicits mitotic failures that trigger aneuploidy, mitosis-dependent DNA damage responses, p53 stabilization and premature differentiation. Importantly, reconstituting myosin activity is sufficient to restore mitotic fidelity, genome integrity, and balanced differentiation and stratification. Collectively, this study deciphers a mechanical signaling network in which Par3 acts upstream of Rho/ROCK-mediated actomyosin contractility to promote intrinsic force generation, thereby maintaining mitotic accuracy and cellular fitness at the genomic level. Disturbing this network may compromise not only epidermal homeostasis but potentially also that of other self-renewing epithelia.",

Similar overall effects were observed for both educational attainment and intelligence on AD risk in the univariable MR analysis; with each SD increase in years of schooling and intelligence, odds of AD were, on average, 37% (95% CI: 23% to 49%) and 35% (95% CI: 25% to 43%) lower, respectively. There was little evidence from the multivariable MR analysis that educational attainment affected AD risk once intelligence was taken into account, but intelligence affected AD risk independently of educational attainment to a similar magnitude observed in the univariate analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsThere is robust evidence for an independent, causal effect of intelligence in lowering AD risk, potentially supporting a role for cognitive training interventions to improve aspects of intelligence. However, given the observed causal effect of educational attainment on intelligence, there may also be support for policies aimed at increasing length of schooling to lower incidence of AD.",

    "abstract": "Lakes and other freshwater bodies are intimately connected to the surrounding land, yet to what extent land-use affects the quality of freshwater and the microbial communities living in various freshwater environments is largely unknown. We address this question through an analysis of the land use surrounding 46 inter-connected lakes located within 7 different drainage basins in northern Germany, and the microbiomes of these lakes during early summer. Lake microbiome structure was not determined by the specific drainage basin or by basin size, and bacterial distribution did not seem to be limited by distance. Instead, land use within the drainage basin could predict, to some extent, NO2+NO3 concentrations in the water, which (together with temperature, chlorophyll a and total phosphorus) affected water microbiome structure. Land use directly surrounding the water bodies, however, had little observable effects on water quality or the microbiome. Several microbial lineages, including environmentally important Cyanobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, were differentially partitioned between the lakes. As the amount of available data on land use (e.g. from remote sensing) increases, identifying relationships between land use, aquatic microbial communities and their effect on water quality will be important to better manage freshwater resources worldwide, e.g. by systemically identifying water bodies prone to ecological changes or the presence of harmful organisms.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a self-destructing mechanism of cell via lysosomal degradation, which helps to degrade/ destroy hazardous substances, proteins, degenerating organelles and recycling nutrient. It plays an important role in cellular homeostasis and regulates internal environment of cell, moreover, when needed causes non-apoptotic programmed death of cell. Its usually detailed with ageing and nutritional stress, but recent researches provide support for its role in innate as well as adaptive immunity. Autophagy has been observed as one of the major factors in parasite clearance in leishmaniasis. Due to intra-cellular pathogen, the cell mediated response is only alternative for adaptive immunity against Leishmania in host. T-cells have been observed as main component of cell mediated immunity in leishmaniasis. The differentiation of T-cells generates either destruction or proliferation of parasite as different kind of cytokine mediate different results. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IL12 and TNF generate Th2 response which helps in active phagocytosis of parasite whereas an anti-inflammatory cytokine like IL10 mediate parasite promotion by blocking autophagic pathways and inhibiting phagocytic actions. TLR2/6 mediated signaling stimulated by LPG produces many pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL12, TNF and IL6 etc. In macrophages, it is found that TNF via autocrine signaling induce autophagy and help in parasite killing of Toxoplasma gondii via JNK phosphorylation in macrophages. The phosphorylated JNK induces Beclin by phosphorylating Bcl2, which inhibits Beclin action, thus releasing Beclin and promoting VpS34 which recruits PI3P for autophagosome formation. Recruitment of PI3P is controlled by ATG9 protein, autophagy related gene protein, which in normal condition is inhibited by mTOR via ULK/ ATG1. IL10 has been observed to inhibit autophagy via starvation induced AKT-PI3K pathway in macrophages and result in inducing mTOR. Thus, we can conclude that IL10 inhibits recruitment of PI3P via mTOR. Through systems aspect, here, we decipher that Atg9-PI3P acts as a negative feedback loop in autophagic machinery of leishmaniasis.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and are implicated in virtually all brain functions. Often they are referred to by their frequency content, i.e., -, {beta}-,{gamma} -oscillations. Although they indeed can be described by a prominent peak in the power spectrum, their waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal and shows a rather complex morphology which needs to be captured with multiple spectral harmonics. Both frequency and temporal descriptions of such non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations can be utilized. However, in non-invasive EEG/MEG recordings the waveform of oscillations often takes a sinusoidal shape which in turn leads to a rather oversimplified view on oscillatory processes.\\n\\nIn this study, we show in simulations how spatial synchronization can mask non-sinusoidal features of the underlying rhythmic neuronal processes. Consequently, the degree of non-sinusoidality can serve as a measure of spatial synchronization. To confirm this empirically, we show that a mixture of EEG components is indeed associated with more sinusoidal oscillations compared to the waveform of oscillations in each constituent component. Using simulations, we also show that the spatial mixing of the non-sinusoidal neuronal signals strongly affects the amplitude ratio of the spectral harmonics constituting the waveform. This in turn has high relevance for the interpretation of the relative strength of spectral peaks, which is commonly used for inferring neuronal signatures corresponding to specific behavioral states.\\n\\nMoreover, our simulations show how spatial mixing can affect the strength and even the direction of the amplitude coupling between constituent neuronal harmonics. Consistently with these simulations, we also demonstrate these effects in real EEG recordings. Our findings have far reaching implications for the neu-rophysiological interpretation of neuronal oscillations and cross-frequency interactions, as well as for the unequivocal determination of oscillatory phase.",

    "abstract": "Our sense of body ownership relies on integrating different sensations according to their temporal and spatial congruency. Nevertheless, there is ongoing controversy about the role of affective congruency during multisensory integration, i.e. whether the stimuli to be perceived by the different sensory channels are congruent or incongruent in terms of their affective quality. In the present study, we applied a widely used multisensory integration paradigm, the Rubber Hand Illusion, to investigate the role of affective, top-down aspects of sensory congruency between visual and tactile modalities in the sense of body ownership. In Experiment 1 (N = 36), we touched participants with either soft or rough fabrics in their unseen hand, while they watched a rubber hand been touched synchronously with the same fabric or with a  hidden fabric of  uncertain roughness. In Experiment 2 (N = 50), we used the same paradigm as in Experiment 1, but replaced the  uncertainty condition with an  incongruent one, in which participants saw the rubber hand being touched with a fabric of incongruent roughness and hence opposite valence. We found that certainty (Experiment 1) and congruency (Experiment 2) between the felt and vicariously perceived tactile affectivity led to higher subjective embodiment compared to uncertainty and incongruency, respectively, irrespective of any valence effect. Our results suggest that congruency in the affective top-down aspects of sensory stimulation is important to the multisensory integration process leading to embodiment, over and above temporal and spatial properties.",

Our results implicate theta oscillations across the MTL as a common neurophysiological substrate for spatial coding in navigation and episodic recall. We further show that spatial context information is initially retrieved in the hippocampus (HC) and subsequently emerges in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG).

    "abstract": "Parasite-mediated anorexia is a ubiquitous, but poorly understood component of host-parasite interactions. These temporary but substantial reductions in food intake (range: 4-100%) limit exposure to parasites and alter within-host physiological processes that regulate parasite development, production, and survival, such as energy allocation, immune function, host-microbiota interactions, and gastrointestinal conditions. By altering the duration, severity, and spread of infection, anorexia could substantially alter ecological, evolutionary, and epidemiological dynamics. However, these higher-order implications are typically overlooked and remain poorly understood -- even though medical (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vaccines, targeted signaling pathways, calorie restriction) and husbandry practices (e.g., antibiotic and diet use for rapid growth, nutrient supplementation) often directly or indirectly alter host appetite and nutrient intake. Here, we develop theory that helps elucidate why reduced food intake (anorexia) can enhance or diminish disease severity and illustrates that the population-level outcomes often contrast with the individual-level outcomes: treatments that increase the intake of high quality nutrients (suppressing anorexia), can drive rapid individual-level recovery, but inadvertently increase infection prevalence and select for more virulent parasites. Such a theory-guided approach offers a tool to improve targeting host nutrition to manage disease in both human and livestock populations by revealing a means to predict how nutrient-driven feedbacks will affect both the host and parasite.",

However, due to the high linkage disequilibrium in the MHC region, it is difficult to define the  real or/and additional independent genetic risks using the conventional HLA genotyping or chip-based microarray technology. By the capture sequencing of entire MHC region for discovery and HLA-typing for validation in 2,773 subjects of Han ancestry, we identified HLA-DQ1:160D as the strongest independent genetic risk for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-positive RA in Han population (P = 6.16 x 10-36, OR=2.29). Further stepwise conditional analysis revealed that DR{beta}1:37N has an independent protective effect on ACPA-positive RA (P = 5.81 x 10-16, OR=0.49). The DQ1:160 coding allele DQA1*0303 displayed high impact on joint radiographic severity, especially in patients with early disease and smoking (P = 3.02 x 10-5). Interaction analysis by comparative molecular modeling revealed that the negative charge of DQ1:160D stabilizes the dimer of dimers, leading to an increased T cell activation. The electrostatic potential surface analysis indicated that the negative charged DR{beta}1:37N encoding alleles could bind with epitope P9 arginine, thus may result in a decreased RA susceptibility.\\n\\nIn this study, we provide the first evidence that HLA-DQA1, instead of HLA-DRB1, is the strongest and independent genetic risk for ACPA-positive RA in Chinese Han population.

We demonstrate the utility of this method by using it to  toggle off the production of ten Cs-derived molecules that accumulate in host tissues.

Clinically, non-invasive ICP monitoring is also required to avoid infection and hemorrhage in patients.

However, real-time non-invasive ICP estimation using these modalities is less well documented. Here, we present a novel algorithm for real-time and non-invasive ICP monitoring with QCBFv and Pa, called direct-current (DC)-ICP. This technique is compared with invasive ICP for 11 traumatic-brain-injury patients admitted to Cheju Halla Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital from July 2017 to June 2018. The inter-subject correlation coefficient between true and estimate was 0.70. The AUCs of the ROCs for prediction of increased ICP for the DC-ICP methods are 0.816. Thus, QCBFv monitoring can facilitate reliable real-time ICP tracking with our novel DC-ICP algorithm, which can provide valuable information under clinical conditions.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of microplastic (MP) in the environment is of global concern. MP risk assessment, however, is currently hampered by lacking ecotoxicological methods due to conceptual and practical problems with particle exposure. Natural particles of similar size as MP, e.g., clay and cellulose, occur abundantly in the environment. For MP risk assessment and regulation it must be established whether the addition of MP to these particles represents an additional hazard. We present a novel approach employing a serial dilution of MP and reference particles, in mixtures, which allows the differentiation of MP effects from other particulates. We demonstrate the applicability of the method using an immobilisation test with Daphnia magna exposed to polyethylene terephthalate (MP) and kaolin clay (reference material). In the concentration range of 0.1 to 10000 mg L-1 of total suspended solids (TSS), with MP contributing 0-100 %, the LC50 values for MP-kaolin mixtures were significantly lower compared to the pure kaolin suspension. MP particles were thus more harmful to daphnids than the reference material. The estimated threshold for %MP contribution above which higher mortality was observed was 1 % MP at 36 mg TSS L-1. This approach has a potential for standardisation of MP ecotoxicological testing as well as other particulate material of anthropogenic origin.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/401331_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (40K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e1153org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e37652org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d3efborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@420d7a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

How to transform prokaryotic experimental chromosome interaction data into spatial structures is an important task and in great need.

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has changed the way we regard evolution. Instead of waiting for the next generation to establish new traits, especially bacteria are able to take a shortcut via HGT that enables them to pass on genes from one individual to another, even across species boundaries. Existing HGT detection approaches usually first identify genes of foreign nature, e.g., using composition-based methods, and then exploit phylogenetic discrepancies of the corresponding gene tree compared to a species tree. These approaches depend on fully sequenced HGT organisms and computable phylogenetic species trees. The tool Daisy offers a different approach based on read mapping that provides complementary evidence compared to existing methods at the cost of relying on the acceptor and donor references of the HGT organism being known. Acceptor and donor identification is akin to species identification in metagenomic samples based on sequencing reads, a problem addressed by metagenomic profiling tools. However, acceptor and donor references have certain properties such that these methods can not be directly applied. We propose DaisyGPS, a mapping-based pipeline that is able to identify acceptor and donor candidates of an HGT organism based on sequencing reads. To do that, DaisyGPS leverages metagenomic profiling strategies and refines them for HGT candidate identification. These candidates can then be further evaluated by tools like Daisy to establish HGT regions. We successfully validated our approach on both simulated and real data, and show its benefits in an investigation of MRSA outbreak data.

    "abstract": "Amyloid aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is linked to insulin-producing islet cell death in type II diabetes. Previous studies have shown the amyloid inhibiting effects of zinc (Zn) and insulin that are co-present with hIAPP in islet cells, and the lipid membrane has been shown to significantly influence the aggregation kinetics. Increasing number of studies report the importance of developing small molecule inhibitors to suppress the hIAPPs toxicity. Particularly, the ability of epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) to inhibit amyloid aggregation of a variety of amyloid peptide/proteins including hIAPP initiated numerous studies including the development of compounds to potentially treat amyloid diseases. In this study, by using a combination of thioflavin-T fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy experiments, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in EGCGs efficiency, when mixed with Zn, to significantly suppress hIAPP amyloid aggregation both in presence and absence of lipid membrane. Circular dichroism experiments indicate the formation and stabilization of a helical structure of hIAPP in presence of EGCG:Zn complex. Our results also reveal the ability of EGCG or EGCG:Zn to suppress hIAPPs cellular toxicity and that the ability of EGCG to chelate with Zn suppresses zincs cellular toxicity. We suggest that the reported results would be useful to develop strategies to trap hIAPP intermediates for further biophysical and structural studies, and also to devise approaches to abolish amyloid aggregation and cellular toxicity.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHuman Papilloma Virus (HPV) associated head and neck cancers, particularly oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), have a superior prognosis to HPV negative cancers. A literature review did not find any studies that analyzed HPV 16, HPV 18 DNA and p16 in the nasopharynx subsite, although it has been reported in the oropharynx. The detection of HPV DNA and p16 in the nasopharynx could have implications for the treatment of NPC. To date no one has reported the detection or concordance rates of HPV associated markers in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\\n\\nMethodsA literature search was undertaken on Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies that used PCR and ISH for detection of HPV DNA and p16 in the nasopharynx. We included studies published between 1992 and 2017 that reported the prognostic impact of HPV DNA and/or p16, treated HPV and p16 as categorical variables with at least 10 patients who tested for p16 and/or HPV16/HPV18 DNA in NPC, irrespective of HPV status. We then collected information from many parameters, and performed a meta-analysis to produce pooled prevalence estimates and explored sources of heterogeneity\\n\\nResults21 studies published between 1992 and 2017 were selected for meta-analysis, with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 1328. The total (random effects) pooled detection of any HPV marker in NPC patients was 19.7% (95% CI: 12.56 to 28.00). The total (random effects) pooled detection of p16 positivity in NPC patients was 23.98% (95% CI: 14.82 to 34.54). The total (random effects) pooled detection of HPV DNA in NPC patients, detected by ISH, was 14.43% (95% CI: 10.13 to 19.33) and for HPV DNA in NPC patients including E6/E7 was 18.13% (95% CI: 11.45 to 25.94). The total (random effects) pooled detection of HPV DNA in NPC patients was 18.13% (95% CI: 11.45 to 25.94). The total (random effects) pooled detection of EBV positivity in NPC patients was 76.21% (95% CI: 66.40 to 84.80). Heterogeneity was high for all of the results. The attributable fraction of p16+ and HPV DNA+ in NPC is 0.029. The attributable fraction of EBV positive and HPV - in NPC is 0.827. The attributable fraction of EBV negative and HPV - in NPC is 0.0639. The attributable fraction of EBV negative and HPV + in NPC is 0.085. The attributable fraction of EBV positive and HPV + in NPC is 0.023. The attributable fraction of HPV positive and mRNA+ in NPC was 0.115. The attributable fraction of p16 in NPC was 0.123.\\n\\nDiscussionThis is the first study that contributes to the concordance and detection rates of HPV related markers in NPC.\\n\\nLimitationsMost of the studies included were of Asian extraction. Most of the papers also did not test for E6/E7 RNA and therefore we are unsure of the amount of active E6/E7 RNA in NPC.",

    "abstract": "Desmogleins are cadherin family adhesion molecules essential for epidermal integrity. Previous studies have shown that desmogleins associate with lipid rafts, but the significance of this association was not clear. Here, we report that the desmoglein transmembrane domain (TMD) is the primary determinant of raft association. Further, we identify a novel mutation in the DSG1 TMD (G562R) that causes severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome. Molecular modeling predicts that this G to R mutation shortens the DSG1 TMD, and experiments directly demonstrate that this mutation compromises both lipid raft association and desmosome incorporation. Finally, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) indicates that the lipid bilayer within the desmosome is ~10% thicker than adjacent regions of the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that differences in bilayer thickness influence the organization of adhesion molecules within the epithelial plasma membrane, with cadherin TMDs recruited to the desmosome via establishment of a specialized mesoscale lipid raft-like membrane domain.",

Plasmodium spp. parasites that cause malaria contain an essential, non-photosynthetic plastid, the apicoplast, which originated from a secondary (eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis. To discover organellar pathways with evolutionary and biomedical significance, we performed a mutagenesis screen for essential genes required for apicoplast biogenesis in P. falciparum. Apicoplast-minus mutants were isolated using a chemical rescue that permits conditional disruption of the apicoplast and a new fluorescent reporter for organelle loss. Five candidate genes were validated (out of 12 identified), including a TIM-barrel protein that likely derived from a core metabolic enzyme but evolved a new activity. Our results demonstrate the first forward genetic screen to assign essential cellular functions to unannotated P. falciparum genes. A putative TIM-barrel enzyme and other newly-identified apicoplast biogenesis proteins open opportunities to discover new mechanisms of organelle biogenesis, molecular evolution underlying eukaryotic diversity, and drug targets against multiple parasitic diseases.",

Here we examine two models for rescue: 1) an  end-driven model in which the depolymerizing end stochastically switches to a stable state; and 2) a  lattice-driven model in which rescue-sites are integrated into the microtubule prior to depolymerization. We test these models using a combination of computational simulations and in vitro experiments with purified tubulin. Our findings support the  lattice-driven model by identifying repeated rescue sites in microtubules. In addition, we discover an important role for divalent cations in determining the frequency and location of rescue sites. We use  wash-in experiments to show that divalent cations inhibit rescue during depolymerization, but not during the polymerization. We propose a unified model in which rescues are driven by embedded rescue sites in microtubules, but the activity of these sites is influenced by changes in the depolymerizing ends.",

Moreover, TH-1 cells enhanced viability when co-cultured in vitro with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSC. In vivo, tail vein injection of TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs into the mouse model of CKD associated with hindlimb ischemia enhanced kidney recovery, the blood perfusion ratio, vessel formation, and prevented limb loss, and foot necrosis along with restored expression of PrPC in the blood serum of the mice.

In this context, the aim of this study was to develop and validate an innovative strategy for drug repurposing as host-targeted inhibitors of influenza viruses and the rapid evaluation of the most promising candidates in Phase II clinical trials.\\n\\nMethodsWe exploited in vivo global transcriptomic signatures of infection directly obtained from a patient cohort to determine a shortlist of already marketed drugs with newly identified, host-targeted inhibitory properties against influenza virus. The antiviral potential of selected repurposing candidates was further evaluated in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo.\\n\\nResultsOur strategy allowed the selection of a shortlist of 35 high potential candidates out of a rationalized computational screening of 1,309 FDA-approved bioactive molecules, 31 of which were validated for their significant in vitro antiviral activity. Our in vivo and ex vivo results highlight diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker currently used in the treatment of hypertension, as a promising option for the treatment of influenza infections. Additionally, transcriptomic signature analysis further revealed the so far undescribed capacity of diltiazem to modulate the expression of specific genes related to the host antiviral response and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, combination treatment with diltiazem and virus-targeted oseltamivir neuraminidase inhibitor further increased antiviral efficacy, prompting rapid authorization for the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial.\\n\\nConclusionsThis original, host-targeted, drug repurposing strategy constitutes an effective and highly reactive process for the rapid identification of novel anti-infectious drugs, with potential major implications for the management of antimicrobial resistance and the rapid response to future epidemic or pandemic (re)emerging diseases for which we are still disarmed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReliability and reproducibility of transcriptomics-based studies are highly dependent on the integrity of RNA. Microfluidics-based techniques based on ribosomal RNA such as the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) are currently the only approaches to evaluate RNA integrity. However, it is not known if ribosomal RNA reflects the integrity of the meaningful part of the sample, the mRNA. Here we test this assumption and present a new integrity index, the Ratio amplicon, Ramp, to monitor mRNA integrity based on the differential amplification of long to short RT-Q-PCR amplicons of the glutamine synthetase A (glnA) transcript.\\n\\nResultsWe successfully designed and tested two Ramp indexes targeting glnA transcripts. We showed in a suite of experimental degradations of RNA extracted from sediment that while the RIN in general did reflect the degradation status of the RNA well the Ramp mapped mRNA degradation better as reflected by changes in Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR) results. Furthermore, we examined the effect of degradation on transcript community structure by amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA, amoA and glnA transcript which was successful even form the highly-degraded samples. While RNA degradation changed the community structure of the mRNA profiles, no changes were observed between successively degraded 16S rRNA transcripts profiles.\\n\\nConclusionAs demonstrated, transcripts can be quantified and sequenced even from highly degraded samples. Therefore, we strongly recommend that a quality check of RNA is conducted to ensure validity of results. For this both the RIN and Ramp are useful, with the Ramp better evaluating mRNA integrity in this study.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTNFAIP3 encodes A20 that negatively regulates nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-{kappa}B), the major transcription factor coordinating inflammatory gene expression. TNFAIP3 polymorphisms have been linked with a spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and recently, loss-of-function mutations in A20 were found to cause a novel inflammatory disease  haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20). Here we describe a family with HA20 caused by a novel TNFAIP3 loss-of-function mutation and elucidate the upstream molecular mechanisms linking HA20 to dysregulation of NF-{kappa}B and the related inflammasome pathway.\\n\\nMethodsNF-{kappa}B activation was studied in a mutation-expressing cell line using luciferase reporter assay. Physical and close-proximity protein-protein interactions of wild-type and TNFAIP3 p.(Lys91*) mutant A20 were analyzed using mass spectrometry. NF-{kappa}B -dependent transcription, cytokine secretion, and inflammasome activation were compared in immune cells of the HA20 patients and control subjects.\\n\\nResultsThe protein-protein interactome of p.(Lys91*) mutant A20 was severely impaired, including inter-actions with proteins regulating NF-{kappa}B activation, DNA repair responses, and the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The p.(Lys91*) mutant A20 failed to suppress NF-{kappa}B signaling, which led to increased NF-{kappa}B -dependent proinflammatory cytokine transcription. Functional experiments in the HA20 patients immune cells uncovered a novel caspase-8-dependent mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome hyperresponsiveness that mediated the excessive secretion of interleukin-1{beta} and -18.\\n\\nConclusionsThe current findings significantly deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HA20 and other diseases associated with reduced A20 expression or function, paving the way for future therapeutic targeting of the pathway.",

We establish that SABER effectively ampli-fies the signal of probes targeting nucleic acids in fixed cells and tissues, can be deployed against at least 17 targets si-multaneously, and detects mRNAs with high efficiency. As a demonstration of the utility of SABER in assays involv-ing genetic manipulations, we apply multiplexed FISH of reporters and cell type markers to the identification of en-hancers with cell type-specific activity in the mouse retina.

    "abstract": "CELF6 is a RNA-binding protein in a family of proteins with roles in human health and disease, however little is known about the mRNA targets or in vivo function of this protein. We utilized CLIP-Seq to identify, for the first time, in vivo targets of CELF6 and identify hundreds of transcripts bound by CELF6 in the brain. We found these are disproportionately mRNAs coding for synaptic proteins. We then conducted functional validation of these targets, testing greater than 400 CELF6 bound sequence elements for their activity, applying a massively parallel reporter assay framework to evaluation of the CLIP data. We also mutated potential binding motifs within these elements and tested their impact. This comprehensive analysis led us to ascribe a previously unknown function to CELF6: we found bound elements were generally repressive of translation, that CELF6 further enhances this repression via decreasing RNA abundance, and this process was dependent on UGU-rich sequence motifs. This greatly extends the known role for CELF6, which had previously been defined only as a splicing factor. We further extend these findings by demonstrating the same function for CELF3, CELF4, and CELF5. Finally, we demonstrate that the CELF6 targets are derepressed in CELF6 mutant mice in vivo, confirming this new role in the brain. Thus, our study demonstrates that CELF6 and other sub-family members are repressive CNS RNA-binding proteins, and CELF6 downregulates specific mRNAs in vivo.",

In this work, we study the neural underpinnings of how the brain combines bits of information into meaningful object representations. Modern theories of semantics posit that the meaning of words can be decomposed into a unique combination of individual semantic features (e.g., \\\"barks\\\", \\\"has citrus scent\\\"). Here, participants received clues of individual objects in form of three isolated semantic features, given as verbal descriptions. We used machine-learning-based neural decoding to learn a mapping between individual semantic features and BOLD activation patterns. We discovered that the recorded brain patterns were best decoded using a combination of not only the three semantic features that were presented as clues, but a far richer set of semantic features typically linked to the target object. We conclude that our experimental protocol allowed us to observe how fragmented information is combined into a complete semantic representation of an object and suggest neuroanatomical underpinnings for this process.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 alpha (HNF4) is required for hepatocyte differentiation and regulates expression of genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism including those that control VLDL secretion and gluconeogenesis. Whereas previous studies have focused on specific genes regulated by HNF4 in metabolism, its overall role in whole body energy utilization has not been studied. In this study, we used indirect calorimetry to determine the effect of hepatocyte-specific HNF4 deletion (HNF4-KO) in mice on whole body energy expenditure (EE) and substrate utilization in fed, fasted, and high fat diet (HFD) conditions. HNF4-KO had reduced resting EE during fed conditions and higher rates of carbohydrate oxidation with fasting. HNF4-KO mice exhibited decreased body mass caused by fat mass depletion despite no change in energy intake and evidence of positive energy balance. HNF4-KO mice were able to upregulate lipid oxidation during HFD suggesting that their metabolic flexibility was intact. However, only hepatocyte specific HNF4-KO mice exhibited significant reduction in basal metabolic rate and spontaneous activity during HFD. Consistent with previous studies, hepatic gene expression in HNF4-KO supports decreased gluconeogenesis and decreased VLDL export and hepatic {beta}-oxidation in HNF4-KO livers across all feeding conditions. Together, our data suggest deletion of hepatic HNF4 increases dependence on dietary carbohydrates and endogenous lipids for energy during fed and fasted conditions by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, hepatic lipid export, and intestinal lipid absorption resulting in decreased whole body energy expenditure. These data clarify the role of hepatic HNF4 on systemic metabolism and energy homeostasis.",

Here we measure the polarization of fluorescence emission from single fluorescently labeled lac repressor (LacI) molecules sliding on stretched DNA. Real-time feedback-coupled confocal single-particle tracking allows us to measure fluorescence correlation of the sliding molecules. We find that the fluctuations in the fluorescence signal on the s timescale are accurately described by rotation-coupled sliding on DNA. On average, LacI moves [~]50 base pairs per revolution, which is significantly longer than the 10.5 bp helical periodicity of DNA. Our data support a facilitated diffusion model1 where the transcription factor (TF) scans the DNA grooves for hydrogen bonding opportunities in a pre-aligned orientation with occasional slippage out of the groove.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal variants have successfully been associated with trait neuroticism in genome-wide analysis of adequately-powered samples. But such studies have so far excluded the X chromosome from analysis. Here, we report genetic association analyses of X chromosome and XY pseudoautosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and trait neuroticism using UK Biobank samples (N = 405,274). Significant association was found with neuroticism on the X chromosome for 204 markers found within three independent loci (a further 783 were suggestive). Most of these significant neuroticism-related X chromosome variants were located in intergenic regions (n = 713). Involvement of HS6ST2, which has been previously associated with sociability behaviour in the dog, was supported by single SNP and gene-based tests. We found that the amino acid and nucleotide sequences are highly conserved between dogs and humans. From the suggestive X chromosome variants, there were 19 nearby genes which could be linked to gene ontology information. Molecular function was primarily related to binding and catalytic activity; notable biological processes were cellular and metabolic, and nucleic acid binding and transcription factor protein classes were most commonly involved. X-variant heritability of neuroticism was estimated at 0.34% (SE = 0.07). A polygenic X-variant score created in an independent sample (maximum N {approx} 7300) did not predict significant variance in neuroticism, psychological distress, or depressive disorder. We conclude that the X chromosome harbours significant variants influencing neuroticism, and might prove important for other quantitative traits and complex disorders.",

    "abstract": "Infection by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a major health risk owing to its chronic nature, ability to reactivate to cause blindness and encephalitis, and high prevalence in human populations. Like nearly all eukaryotes, Toxoplasma glycosylates many of its proteins and lipids and assembles polysaccharides. Unlike most eukaryotes, Toxoplasma divides and differentiates in vacuoles within host cells. While their glycans resemble canonical models, they exhibit species-specific variations that have inhibited deeper investigations into their roles in parasite biology and virulence. The genome of Toxoplasma encodes a suite of likely glycogenes expected to assemble a range of N-glycans, O-glycans, a C-glycan, GPI-anchors, and polysaccharides, along with their requisite precursors and membrane transporters. To facilitate genetic approaches to investigate the roles of specific glycans, we mapped probable connections between 59 glycogenes, their enzyme products, and the glycans to which they contribute. We adapted a double-CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and a mass spectrometry-based glycomics workflow to test these relationships, and conducted infection studies in fibroblast monolayers to probe cellular functions. Through the validated disruption of 17 glycogenes, we also discovered novel Glc0-2-Man6-GlcNAc2-type N-glycans, GalNAc2- and Glc-Fuc-type O-glycans, and a nuclear O-Fuc type glycan. We describe the guide sequences, disruption constructs, and mutant strains, which are freely available to practitioners for application in the context of the relational map to investigate the roles of glycans in their favorite biological processes.",

    "abstract": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Type VII secretion system ESX-5, which has been implicated in virulence, is activated at the transcriptional level by the phosphate starvation responsive Pst/SenX3-RegX3 signal transduction system. Deletion of pstA1, which encodes a Pst phosphate transporter component, causes constitutive activation of the response regulator RegX3, hyper-secretion of ESX-5 substrates and attenuation in the mouse infection model. We hypothesized that constitutive activation of ESX-5 secretion causes attenuation of the {Delta}pstA1 mutant. To test this, we uncoupled ESX-5 from regulation by RegX3. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we defined a RegX3 binding site in the esx-5 locus. Deletion or mutation of the RegX3 binding site reversed hyper-secretion of the ESX-5 substrate EsxN by the {Delta}pstA1 mutant and abrogated induction of EsxN secretion in response to phosphate limitation by wild-type M. tuberculosis. Deletion of the esx-5 RegX3 binding site ({Delta}BS) suppressed attenuation of the {Delta}pstA1 mutant in Irgm1-/- mice, suggesting that constitutive ESX-5 secretion limits M. tuberculosis evasion of host immune responses that are independent of Irgm1. However, the {Delta}pstA1{Delta}BS mutant remained attenuated in both NOS2-/- and C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that factors other than ESX-5 secretion also contribute to attenuation of the {Delta}pstA1 mutant. In addition, a {Delta}pstA1{Delta}esxN mutant lacking the hyper-secreted ESX-5 substrate EsxN remained attenuated in Irgm1-/- mice, suggesting that ESX-5 substrates other than EsxN cause increased susceptibility to host immunity. Our data indicate that while M. tuberculosis requires ESX-5 for virulence, it tightly controls secretion of ESX-5 substrates to avoid elimination by host immune responses.",

    "abstract": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a heterogeneous midbrain structure, containing neurons and astrocytes, that coordinates approach and avoidance behaviors by integrating activity from numerous afferents. Within neuron-astrocyte networks, astrocytes control signals from distinct afferents in a circuit-specific manner, but whether this capacity scales up to drive motivated behavior has been undetermined. Using genetic and optical dissection strategies in vitro and during behavior we report that VTA astrocytes tune glutamatergic signaling selectively on local inhibitory neurons to drive a functional circuit for learned avoidance. In this circuit, VTA astrocytes facilitate excitation of local GABA neurons to increase inhibition of dopamine neurons. The increased inhibition of dopamine neurons elicits real-time and learned avoidance behavior that is sufficient to impede expression of learned preference for reward. Despite the large number of functions performed by astrocytes, loss of one glutamate transporter (GLT-1) from VTA astrocytes selectively blocks these avoidance behaviors and spares preference for reward. Thus, VTA astrocytes selectively regulate excitation of local GABA neurons to drive a distinct learned avoidance circuit that opposes learned approach behavior.",
