    "abstract": "Heterodera glycines, commonly referred to as the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), is an obligatory and sedentary plant parasite that causes over a billion-dollar yield loss to soybean production annually. Although there are genetic determinants that render soybean plants resistant to certain nematode genotypes, resistant soybean cultivars are increasingly ineffective because their multi-year usage has selected for virulent H. glycines populations. The parasitic success of H. glycines relies on the comprehensive re-engineering of an infection site into a syncytium, as well as the long-term suppression of host defense to ensure syncytial viability. At the forefront of these complex molecular interactions are effectors, the proteins secreted by H. glycines into host root tissues. The mechanisms of effector acquisition, diversification, and selection need to be understood before effective control strategies can be developed, but the lack of an annotated genome has been a major roadblock. Here, we use PacBio long-read technology to assemble a H. glycines genome of 738 contigs into 123Mb with annotations for 29,769 genes. The genome contains significant numbers of repeats (34%), tandem duplicates (18.7Mb), and horizontal gene transfer events (151 genes). Using previously published effector sequences, the newly generated H. glycines genome, and comparisons to other nematode genomes, we investigate the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the emergence and diversification of effector genes.",

    "abstract": "Malaria patients can carry one or more clonal lineage of the parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, but the composition of these infections cannot be directly inferred from bulk sequence data. Well-defined, complete haplotypes at single-cell resolution are ideal for describing within-host population structure and unambiguously determining parasite diversity, transmission dynamics and recent ancestry but have not been analyzed on a large scale. We generated 485 near-complete single-cell genome sequences isolated from fifteen P. falciparum patients from Chikhwawa, Malawi, an area of intense malaria transmission. Matched single-cell and bulk genomic analyses revealed patients harbored up to seventeen unique lineages. Estimation of parasite relatedness within patients suggests superinfection by repeated mosquito bites is rarer than co-transmission of parasites from a single mosquito. Our single-cell analysis indicates strong barriers to establishment of new infections in malaria-infected patients and allows high resolution dissection of intra-host variation in malaria parasites.",

    "abstract": "Ankle joint plays a critical role in daily activities involving interactions with environment using force and position control. Neuromechanical dysfunctions (e.g. due to stroke or brain injury), therefore, have a major impact on individuals quality of life. The effective design of neurorehabilitation protocols for robotic rehabilitation platforms, relies on understanding the control characteristics of the ankle joint in interaction with external environment using force and position. This is particularly of interest since the findings in upper-limb may not be generalizable to the lower-limb. This study aimed to characterize the skilled performance of ankle joint in visuomotor position and force control. A 2-degree of freedom (DOF) robotic footplate was used to measure individuals force and position. Healthy individuals (n = 27) used ankle force or position for point-to-point and tracking control tasks in 1-DOF and 2-DOF virtual game environments. Subjects performance was quantified as a function of accuracy and completion time. While the performance measures in 1-DOF control tasks were comparable, the subjects performance in 2-DOF tasks was significantly better with position control. Subjective questionnaires on the perceived difficulty matched the objective experimental results; suggesting that the poor performance in force control was not due to experimental setup or fatigue but can be attributed to the different levels of challenge needed in neural control. It is inferred that in visuomotor coordination, the neuromuscular specialization of ankle provides better control over position rather than force. These findings can inform the design of neuro-rehabilitation platforms, selection of effective tasks, and therapeutic protocols.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study is to demonstrate how one can compute the activating function and surface charge density resulting from application of an external electric field to a high-resolution realistic neuronal morphology. We use the boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM) on an ordinary computer to accurately perform these computations in under 2-10 minutes for a dense surface mesh of a single neuron with approximately 1.4 million triangles. Prior work used commercial finite element method (FEM) software which required creation of a volumetric tetrahedral mesh between fine neuronal arbor, potentially resulting in prohibitively large volume sizes and long mesh generation times. We used the example of a human pyramidal neuron with an externally applied E-field to show how our approach can quickly and accurately compute the induced surface charge density on the cell surface and the activating function of the cable equation. We found that the induced surface charge density perturbs the macroscopically applied E-field on a microscopic spatial scale. The strength of the perturbation depends on the conductivity contrast; the stronger the contrast, the larger the perturbation. In our example, the induced surface charge density may change the average activating function by up to 75%. We also embedded this neuron model into a detailed macroscopic human head model and simulated a realistic TMS excitation using the BEM-FMM method for the combined model. The solution obtained in this case predicted a smaller activating function error. The difference between the microscopic and the macroscopic effect of the externally applied electric field is of much interest to users of extracellular stimulation techniques and merits further study.",

    "abstract": "A biophysical framework needed to interpret electrophysiological data recorded at multiple spatial scales of brain tissue is developed. Micro current sources at membrane surfaces produce local field potentials (LFP), electrocorticography (ECoG), and electroencephalography (EEG). We categorize multi-scale sources as genuine, equivalent, or representative. Genuine sources occur at the micro scale of cell surfaces. Equivalent sources provide identical experimental outcomes over a range of scales and applications. In contrast, each representative source distribution is just one of many possible source distributions that yield similar experimental outcomes. Macro sources (\\\"dipoles\\\") may be defined at the macrocolumn (mm) scale and depend on several features of the micro sources--magnitudes, micro synchrony within columns, and distribution through the cortical depths. These micro source properties are determined by brain dynamics and the columnar structure of cortical tissue. The number of representative sources underlying EEG data depends on the spatial scale of neural tissue under study. EEG inverse solutions (e.g. dipole localization) and high resolution estimates (e.g. Laplacian, dura imaging) have both strengths and limitations that depend on experimental conditions. The proposed theoretical framework informs studies of EEG source localization, source characterization, and low passes filtering. It also facilitates interpretations of brain dynamics and cognition, including measures of synchrony, functional connections between cortical locations, and other aspects of brain complexity.",

    "abstract": "Sucroses sweet intensity is one attribute contributing to the overconsumption of high-energy palatable foods. However, it is not known how sucrose intensity is encoded and used to make perceptual decisions by neurons in taste-sensitive cortices. We trained rats in a sucrose intensity discrimination task and found that sucrose evoked a widespread response in neurons recorded in posterior-Insula (pIC), anterior-Insula (aIC), and Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Remarkably, only a few Intensity-selective neurons conveyed the most information about sucroses intensity, indicating that for sweetness the gustatory system used a compact and distributed code. Sucrose intensity was encoded in both firing-rates and spike-timing. The pIC, aIC, and OFC neurons tracked movement direction, with OFC neurons yielding the most robust response. aIC and OFC neurons encoded the subjects choices, whereas all three regions tracked reward omission. Overall, these multimodal areas provide a neural representation of perceived sucrose intensity, and of task-related information underlying perceptual decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder among adults, especially affecting individuals of advanced age or with neurodegenerative disease. Insomnia is also a common comorbidity across psychiatric disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia; a key component of this intervention is restriction of sleep opportunity, which optimizes matching of sleep ability and opportunity, leading to enhanced sleep drive. Despite the well-documented efficacy of CBT-I, little is known regarding how CBT-I works at a cellular and molecular level to improve sleep, due in large part to an absence of experimentally-tractable animals models of this intervention. Here, guided by human behavioral sleep therapies, we developed a Drosophila model for behavioral modification of sleep. We demonstrate that restriction of sleep opportunity through manipulation of environmental cues improves sleep efficiency and quality in multiple short-sleeping Drosophila mutants. The response to sleep opportunity restriction requires ongoing environmental inputs, but is independent of the molecular circadian clock. We apply this sleep opportunity restriction paradigm to aging and Alzheimers disease fly models, and find that sleep impairments in these models are reversible with sleep restriction, with associated improvement in reproductive fitness and extended lifespan. This work establishes a model to investigate the neurobiological basis of CBT-I, and provides a platform that can be exploited towards novel treatment targets for insomnia.",

    "abstract": "Large walls and other typical boundaries strongly influence neural activity related to navigation and the representations of spatial layouts. They are also major aids to reliable navigation behavior in young children and non-human animals. Is this because they are physical boundaries (barriers to movement), or because they present certain visual features, such as visually extended 3D surfaces? Here, these two factors were dissociated by using immersive virtual reality and real boundaries. Eighty adults recalled target locations in one of four environments: plywood, where a virtual wall coincided with a large piece of real plywood; pass through, where the virtual wall coincided with empty space and participants could pass through it; pass over, where the virtual wall was projected downward to be visible underneath a transparent floor; and cones, where the walls were replaced with traffic cones. One condition had features that were boundaries and looked like boundaries (plywood); two had features that were not boundaries but looked like boundaries (pass over/through); and one had features that were not boundaries and did not look like boundaries (cones). The precision and bias of responses changed only as a function of looking like a boundary. This suggests that variations in spatial coding are more closely linked to the visual properties of environmental layouts than to whether they contain physical boundaries (barriers to movement).",
