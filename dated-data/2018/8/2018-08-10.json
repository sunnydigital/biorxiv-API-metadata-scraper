However, conventional metagenomics strategies necessitate retrograde transfer of samples from extreme or remote environments for later analysis, rendering the powerful insights gained retrospective in nature, striking a contrast with Pasteurs dictum. Here we implement highly portable USB-based nanopore DNA sequencing platforms coupled with field-adapted environmental DNA extraction, rapid sequence library generation and off-line analyses of shotgun metagenome and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon profiles to characterize microbiota dwelling within cryoconite holes upon Svalbard glaciers, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Austrian Alps. We show in-field nanopore sequencing of metagenomes captures taxonomic composition of supraglacial microbiota, while 16S rRNA Furthermore, comparison of nanopore data with prior 16S rRNA gene V1-V3 pyrosequencing from the same samples, demonstrates strong correlations between profiles obtained from nanopore sequencing and laboratory based sequencing approaches. gene amplicon sequencing resolves bacterial community responses to habitat changes. Finally, we demonstrate the fidelity and sensitivity of in-field sequencing by analysis of mock communities using field protocols. Ultimately, in-field sequencing potentiated by nanopore devices raises the prospect of enhanced agility in exploring Earths most remote microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "From foraging for food to learning complex games, many aspects of human behaviour can be framed as a search problem with a vast space of possible actions. Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using a variety of bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, where the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across a variety of diifferent probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian Process function learning--combined with an optimistic Upper Confidence Bound sampling strategy--provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable, and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvaluation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ratios in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems can advance our understanding of biological processes, nutrient cycling and the fate of organic matter (OM) in aquatic ecosystems. Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems can disrupt the accumulation and decomposition of OM which serves as the base of the aquatic food web, and is central to the effectiveness of a treatment wetland. This study investigated nutrient stoichiometry within and between wetland ecosystem compartments (i.e. water column, vegetation, flocculent and soil) of two treatment flow-ways (FWs) in the Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas located in south Florida (USA). These FWs include an emergent aquatic vegetation cell dominated by Typha spp.(cattail) and a submerged aquatic vegetation cell composed of species such as Chara spp. (muskgrass) and Potamogeton spp. (pondweed). The primary objective of this evaluation was to determine if nutrient stoichiometry is consistent within and between ecosystems and compartments to understand biogeochemical cycling and controls of nutrient removal within a treatment wetland ecosystem.\\n\\nResultsThis study demonstrates that C, N, and P stoichiometry can be highly variable among ecosystem compartments and between differing wetland ecosystems. Generally, total P declined along the length of each treatment FW in all ecosystem compartments, whereas trends in total N and C trends were more variable. These changes in C and nutrient concentrations result in variable nutrient stoichiometry along treatment FWs signaling potential changes in absolute and relative nutrient availability and biogeochemical processes.\\n\\nConclusionsAssessment of wetland nutrient stoichiometry between and within ecosystem compartments suggest decoupling of C:N:P relationships likely as a consequence of differential external nutrient supply, differences in primary producer communities and differential decomposition of organic matter. However, stoichiometry varies often monotonous along the flow paths, likely exhibiting a response to nutrient loading. Differences in C:N:P ratios in primary producers, light availability, microbial immobilization in the early stage of decomposition as well as nutrient mining during decomposition of OM are likely feedback mechanisms that lead to deviations from fixed stoichiometry, which in turn may have considerable influence on nutrient removal rates. This information could be used to further understand water treatment performance with respect to stoichiometric processes and OM decomposition.",

    "abstract": "Malarial dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) are cysteine proteases important for parasite development thus making them attractive drug targets. In order to develop inhibitors specific to the parasite enzymes it is necessary to map the determinants of substrate specificity of the parasite enzymes and its mammalian homologue cathepsin C (CatC). Here, we screened peptide-based libraries of substrates and covalent inhibitors to characterize the differences in specificity between parasite DPAPs and CatC, and used this information to develop highly selective DPAP1 and DPAP3 inhibitors. Interestingly, while the primary amino acid specificity of a protease is often used to develop potent inhibitors, we show that equally potent and highly specific inhibitors can be developed based on the sequences of non-optimal peptide substrates. Importantly, analysis of previously published data about the specificity of other proteases also unveiled significant discrepancies in the amino acid preference between substrates and inhibitors. In this article, we also discuss important structural and theoretical reasons that might account for these discrepancies. Overall, this study illustrates that focusing the development of protease inhibitors solely on substrate specificity might overlook important structural features that can be exploited to develop highly potent and selective compounds.",

    "abstract": "The formation of a viral capsid-the highly--ordered protein shell that surrounds the genome of a virus--is the canonical example of self-assembly1. The capsids of many positive-sense RNA viruses spontaneously assemble from in vitro mixtures of the coat protein and RNA2. The high yield of proper capsids that assemble is remarkable, given their structural complexity: 180 identical proteins must arrange into three distinct local configurations to form an icosahedral capsid with a triangulation number of 3 (T = 3)1. Despite a wealth of data from structural studies3-5 and simulations6-10, even the most fundamental questions about how these structures assemble remain unresolved. Experiments have not determined whether the assembly pathway involves aggregation or nucleation, or how the RNA controls the process. Here we use interferometric scattering microscopy11,12 to directly observe the in vitro assembly kinetics of individual, unlabeled capsids of bacteriophage MS2. By measuring how many coat proteins bind to each of many individual MS2 RNA strands on time scales from 1 ms to 900 s, we find that the start of assembly is broadly distributed in time and is followed by a rapid increase in the number of bound proteins. These measurements provide strong evidence for a nucleation-and-growth pathway. We also find that malformed structures assemble when multiple nuclei appear on the same RNA before the first nucleus has finished growing. Our measurements reveal the complex assembly pathways for viral capsids around RNA in quantitative detail, including the nucleation threshold, nucleation time, growth time, and constraints on the critical nucleus size. These results may inform strategies for engineering synthetic capsids13 or for derailing the assembly of pathogenic viruses14.",

Such research is contingent on accurate annotation of transcription start sites (TSSs). However, comprehensive genome-wide maps of TSSs and their usage across commonly applied laboratory conditions and treatments for S. pombe are lacking. To this end, we profiled TSS activity genome-wide in S. pombe cultures exposed to heat shock, nitrogen starvation, hydrogen peroxide and two commonly applied media, YES and EMM2, using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE). CAGE-based annotation of TSSs is substantially more accurate than existing PomBase annotation; on average, CAGE TSSs fall 50-75 bp downstream of PomBase TSSs and co-localize with nucleosome boundaries. In contrast to higher eukaryotes, S. pombe does not show sharp and dispersed TSS distributions. Our data recapitulate known S. pombe stress expression response patterns and identify stress- and mediaresponsive alternative TSSs. Notably, alteration of growth medium induces changes of similar magnitude as some stressors. We show a link between nucleosome occupancy and genetic variation, and that the proximal promoter region is genetically diverse between S. pombe strains. Our detailed TSS map constitute a central resource for S. pombe gene regulation research.",

    "abstract": "In the crowded cell, a strong selective pressure operates on the proteome to limit the competition between functional and non-functional protein-protein interactions. We developed an original theoretical framework in order to interrogate how this competition constrains the behavior of proteins with respect to their partners or random encounters. Our theoretical framework relies on a two-dimensional (2D) representation of interaction energy landscapes with 2D energy maps that reflect in a synthetic way the propensity of a protein to interact with another protein. We investigated the propensity of protein surfaces to interact with functional and arbitrary partners and asked whether their interaction propensity is conserved during the evolution. Therefore, we performed several thousands of cross-docking simulations to systematically characterize the whole energy landscapes of 74 proteins interacting with different sets of homologs, corresponding to their functional partners family or arbitrary protein families. Then, we systematically compared the energy maps resulting from the docking of a given protein with the different protein families of the dataset. Strikingly, we show that the interaction propensity not only of the binding site but also of the rest of the protein surface is conserved for docking partners belonging to the same protein family. Interestingly, this observation holds for docked proteins corresponding to true but also to arbitrary partners. Our theoretical framework enables the characterization of the energy behavior of a protein in interaction with hundreds of selected partners and opens the way for further developments to study the behavior of proteins in a specific environment.",

One popular test of attention and executive functioning is the cancellation task, in which participants perform multi-target visual search to find and  cancel targets among distractors. Although cancellation tasks have been used extensively with neurological patients, it is only partly clear whether performance is affected by demographic variables such as age and education, which can vary wildly among patients. Here, we describe performance in a sample of 523 healthy participants who participated in a web-based cancellation task. Specifically, we examined indices of spatial bias, processing speed, perseveration and revisiting behaviour, and search organisation. In this sample, age, sex, and level of education did not affect cancellation performance. A cluster analysis identified four cognitive profiles: Participants who make many omissions (N=18), who make many revisits (N=18), who have relatively poor search organisation (N=125), and who have relatively good search organisation (N=362). We advise neurologists and neuropsychologists to exercise caution when interpreting scores pertaining to search organisation in patients: Given the large proportion of healthy individuals with poor search organisation, disorganised search in patients might be pre-existing rather than disorder-related. Finally, we include norm scores for indices of spatial bias, perseverations and revisits, processing speed, and search organisation for a popular cancellation task.",

One strategy to combat ambiguity in this process is to combine new information with prior experiences. We investigated the strategy of combining these information sources in color vision. Single cones in human subjects were stimulated and the associated percepts were recorded. Subjects rated each flash for brightness, hue and saturation. Brightness ratings were proportional to stimulus intensity. Saturation was independent of intensity, but varied between cones. Hue, in contrast, was assigned in a stereotyped manner that was predicted by cone type. These experiments revealed that, near the fovea, long (L) and middle (M) wavelength sensitive cones produce sensations that can be reliably distinguished on the basis of hue, but not saturation or brightness.

Here we developed a subchronic peripheral immune challenge model to examine delayed and persistent memory impairments in females and in males. We show that intermittent injections of either lipopolysaccharide or Poly I:C cause memory decline in both sexes that are evident eight weeks after the immune challenge. Importantly, we observed sex-specific patterns of deficits. Females showed impairments in object recognition one week after challenge that persisted for at least eight weeks. In contrast, males had intact memory one week after the immune challenge but exhibited broad impairments in memory tasks including object recognition, and both context and tone fear conditioning several months later. The differential patterns of memory deficits in males and in females were observed without sustained microglial activation or changes in blood-brain barrier permeability. Together, these data suggest that transient neuroimmune activity results in differential vulnerabilities of females and males to memory decline after immune challenge. This model will be an important tool for determining the mechanisms in both sexes that contribute to memory impairments that develop over the weeks and months after recovery from illness. Future studies using this model will provide new insights into the role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of long-lasting memory decline and dementias.",

    "abstract": "To summarise skewed (asymmetric) distributions, such as reaction times, typically the mean or the median are used as measures of central tendency. Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased: with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that \\\"sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.\\\" Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the medians bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufficient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ: we illustrate a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation.

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a highly regulated catabolic pathway that is potently induced by stressors including starvation and infection. An essential component of the autophagy pathway is an ATG16L1-containing E3-like enzyme, which is responsible for lipidating LC3B and driving autophagosome formation. ATG16L1 polymorphisms have been linked to the development of Crohns disease (CD) and phosphorylation of CD-associated ATG16L1 (caATG16L1) has been hypothesized to contribute to cleavage and autophagy dysfunction. Here we show that ULK1 kinase directly phosphorylates ATG16L1 in response to infection and starvation. Moreover, we show that ULK-mediated phosphorylation drives the destabilization of caATG16L1 in response to stress. Additionally, we found that phosphorylated ATG16L1 was specifically localized to the site of internalized bacteria indicating a role for ATG16L1 in the promotion of anti-bacterial autophagy. Lastly, we show that stable cell lines harbouring a phospho-dead mutant of ATG16L1 have impaired xenophagy. In summary, our results show that ATG16L1 is a novel target of ULK1 kinase and that ULK-signalling to ATG16L1 is a double-edged sword, enhancing function of the wildtype ATG16L1, but promoting degradation of caATG16L1.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementIn this study, we show that the loss of the epilepsy-related gene Frrs1l in mice causes a dramatic reduction in AMPA receptor levels at the synapse. This change elicits severe motor and coordination disabilities, hyperactivity, cognitive defects, behavioural seizures and abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns.\\n\\nAbstractLoss of function mutations in the human AMPA receptor-associated protein, ferric chelate reductase 1-like (FRRS1L), are associated with a devastating neurological condition incorporating choreoathetosis, cognitive deficits and epileptic encephalopathies. Furthermore, evidence from overexpression and ex vivo studies have implicated FRRS1L in AMPA receptor biogenesis and assembly, suggesting that changes in glutamatergic signalling might underlie the disorder. Here, we investigated the neurological and neurobehavioural correlates of the disorder using a mouse Frrs1l null mutant. The study revealed several neurological defects that mirrored those seen in human patients. We established that mice lacking Frrs1l suffered from a broad spectrum of early-onset motor deficits with no progressive, age-related deterioration. Moreover, Frrs1l-/- mice were hyperactive irrespective of test environment, exhibited working memory deficits and displayed significant sleep fragmentation. Longitudinal electroencephalographic recordings also revealed abnormal EEG in Frrs1l-/- mice. Parallel investigations into disease aetiology identified a specific deficiency in AMPA receptor levels in the brain of Frrs1l-/- mice, while the general levels of several other synaptic components remained unchanged with no obvious alterations in the number of synapses. Furthermore, we established that Frrsl1 deletion results in glycosylation deficits in GLUA2 and GLUA4 AMPA receptor proteins, leading to cytoplasmic retention and a reduction of those specific AMPA receptor levels in the postsynaptic membrane. Overall, this study determines, for the first time in vivo, how loss of FRRS1L function can affect glutamatergic signalling and provides mechanistic insight into the development and progression of a human hyperkinetic disorder.",

    "abstract": "Non-breeders are those sexually mature individuals that do not breed in a given reproductive cycle of a population. There is a widespread belief that the presence of non-breeders can affect the actual population dynamics, as well as the population responses to environmental change (Lee et al. 2017). Sternberg (1989), using demographic data, has shown that 83% and 62% of males and females, respectively, do not breed in the first year of life in the Lower Saxony (Germany) population of the European Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). Later, with experimental removal of males, it has been proven that in the Lower Saxony and Moscow Region (Russia) populations, there are many non-breeding males (Sternberg et al. 2002). For the Netherlands population of the European Pied Flycatcher, the presence of a large number of non-breeders has been demonstrated using experimental removals for both males and females (Both et al. 2017). Here we have estimated the number of non-breeders in the Western Siberian population of the European Pied Flycatcher using demographic data (11 cohorts from 2001 to 2011 of birth) and experimental removal of males. We have shown that both males and females can start to breed at the age of one to five years. The proportion of non-breeders can be 59.5% and 68.5% for first-year males and females, respectively. We discuss the differences in the proportion of non-breeders between the Western Siberian and European populations of the European Pied Flycatcher, as well as factors affecting the number of non-breeders.",

The local breeds are important genetic resources with cultural and historical heritages, and therefore, their preservation and genetic characterization are important. In this study, we aim to identify genes and biological processes that are important for their adaptation to the cold and harsh conditions. For this purpose, we profiled the whole-blood transcriptome of two native breeds and one commercial breed using high-throughput RNA sequencing. More than 15,000 genes were identified, of which 2, 89, and 162 genes were significantly upregulated exclusively in Northern Finncattle, Yakutian cattle and Holstein cattle, respectively. The functional classification of these significantly differentially expressed genes identified several biological processes and pathways related to signalling mechanisms, cell differentiation, and host-pathogen interactions that, in general, point towards immunity and disease resistance mechanisms. The gene expression pattern observed in Northern Finncattle was more similar to that of Yakutian cattle, despite sharing similar living conditions as the Holstein cattle included in our study. In conclusion, our study identified unique biological processes in these breeds that help them to adapt and survive in sub-arctic environments.",

The genetic bases underlying the evolution of this mammalian landmark are poorly understood. We propose that the emergence of morphological and functional innovations in the mammalian inner ear could have been driven by adaptive molecular evolution.\\n\\nIn this work, we analyzed the complete inner ear transcriptome in order to identify genes that show signatures of adaptive evolution in this lineage. We analyzed approximately 1,300 inner ear expressed genes and found that 13 % show signatures of positive selection in the mammalian lineage. Several of these genes are known to play an important function in the inner ear. In addition, we identified that a significant proportion of genes showing signatures of adaptive evolution in mammals have not been previously reported to participate in inner ear development and/or physiology. We focused our analysis in two of these novel genes: STRIP2 and ABLIM2 by generating null mutant mice and analyzed their auditory function. We found that mice lacking Strip2 displayed a decrease in neural response amplitudes. In addition, we observed a reduction in the number of afferent synapses, suggesting a potential cochlear neuropathy.\\n\\nThus, this study shows the usefulness of pursuing a high-throughput evolutionary approach followed by functional studies to track down novel genes that are important for inner ear function.

It is non-trivial since the size of the graph to be constructed could be very large and each graph consists of hundreds of billions of vertices and edges. Current existing approaches may have unaffordable memory footprints to handle such a large de Bruijn graph. Moreover, it also requires the construction approach to handle very large dataset efficiently, even if in a relatively small RAM space.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a lightweight parallel de Bruijn graph construction approach, de Bruijn Graph Constructor in Scalable Memory (deGSM). The main idea of deGSM is to efficiently construct the Bur-rows-Wheeler Transformation (BWT) of the unipaths of de Bruijn graph in constant RAM space and transform the BWT into the original unitigs. It is mainly implemented by a fast parallel external sorting of k-mers, which allows only a part of k-mers kept in RAM by a novel organization of the k-mers. The experimental results demonstrate that, just with a commonly used machine, deGSM is able to handle very large genome sequence(s), e.g., the contigs (305 Gbp) and scaffolds (1.1 Tbp) recorded in Gen-Bank database and Picea abies HTS dataset (9.7 Tbp). Moreover, deGSM also has faster or comparable construction speed compared with state-of-the-art approaches. With its high scalability and efficiency, deGSM has enormous potentials in many large scale genomics studies.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/hitbc/deGSM.\\n\\nContactydwang@hit.edu.cn (YW) and bo.liu@hit.edu.cn (BL)\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online.",

    "abstract": "The metacognitive ability to introspect about self-performance varies substantially across individuals. Given that effective monitoring of performance is deemed important for effective behavioural control, intervening to improve metacognition may have widespread benefits, for example in educational and clinical settings. However, it is unknown whether and how metacognition can be systematically improved through training independently of task performance, or whether metacognitive improvements generalize across different task domains. Across 8 sessions, here we provided feedback to two groups of participants in a perceptual discrimination task: an experimental group (N = 29) received feedback on their metacognitive judgments, while an active control group (N = 32) received feedback on their decision performance only. Relative to the control group, adaptive training led to increases in metacognitive calibration (as assessed by Brier scores) which generalized both to untrained stimuli and an untrained task (recognition memory). Leveraging signal detection modeling we found that metacognitive improvements were driven both by changes in metacognitive efficiency (meta-d/d) and confidence level, and that later increases in metacognitive efficiency were positively mediated by earlier shifts in confidence. Our results reveal a striking malleability of introspection and indicate the potential for a domain-general enhancement of metacognitive abilities.",

Although ~1.7 billion people are infected with Mtb2, most infections are asymptomatic. Progression to active disease occurs in ~10% of infected individuals and is predicted by an elevated type I interferon (IFN) response3-8. Type I IFNs are vital for antiviral immunity, but whether or how they mediate susceptibility to Mtb has been difficult to study, in part because the standard C57BL/6 (B6) mouse model does not recapitulate the IFN-driven disease that appears to occur in humans3-5,8. Here we examined B6. Sst1S congenic mice that carry the C3H \\\"sensitive\\\" allele of the Sst1 locus that renders them highly susceptible to Mtb infections9,10. We found that B6.Sst1S mice exhibit markedly increased type I IFN signaling, and that type I IFNs were required for the enhanced susceptibility of B6. Sst1S mice to Mtb. Type I IFNs affect the expression of hundreds of genes, several of which have previously been implicated in susceptibility to bacterial infections11,12. Nevertheless, we found that heterozygous deficiency in just a single IFN target gene, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), is sufficient to reverse IFN-driven susceptibility to Mtb. As even a partial reduction in IL-1Ra levels led to significant protection, we hypothesized that IL-1Ra may be a plausible target for host-directed anti-TB therapy. Indeed, antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-1Ra provided therapeutic benefit to Mtb-infected B6. Sst1S mice. Our results illustrate how the diversity of inbred mouse strains can be exploited to better model human TB, and demonstrate that IL-1Ra is an important mediator of type I IFN-driven susceptibility to Mtb infections in vivo.",

Different readout neurons specialize for different clusters, and all input clusters can be learned, as long as the number of readout units is mildly larger than the number of input clusters.

    "abstract": "1Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that many traits are highly polygenic, in that their within-population variance is governed in part by small-effect variants at many genetic loci. Standard population-genetic methods for inferring evolutionary history are ill-suited for polygenic traits--when there are many variants of small effect, signatures of natural selection are spread across the genome and subtle at any one locus. In the last several years, several methods have emerged for detecting the action of natural selection on polygenic scores, sums of genotypes weighted by GWAS effect sizes. However, most existing methods do not reveal the timing or strength of selection. Here, we present a set of methods for estimating the historical time course of a population-mean polygenic score using local coalescent trees at GWAS loci. These time courses are estimated by using coalescent theory to relate the branch lengths of trees to allele-frequency change. The resulting time course can be tested for evidence of natural selection. We present theory and simulations supporting our procedures, as well as estimated time courses of polygenic scores for human height. Because of its grounding in coalescent theory, the framework presented here can be extended to a variety of demographic scenarios, and its usefulness will increase as both GWAS and ancestral recombination graph (ARG) inference continue to progress.",

However, social cognition requires us to represent not only the actions but also the interactions of others. To do so, it is imperative that the motor system can represent multiple observed actions. The current fMRI study investigated whether this is possible by measuring brain activity from 29 participants while they observed two right hands performing sign language gestures. Three key results were obtained. First, brain activity in the premotor and parietal motor cortex was stronger when two hands performed two different gestures than when one hand performed a single gesture. Second, both individual observed gestures could be decoded from brain activity in the same two regions. Third, observing two different gestures compared with two identical gestures activated brain areas related to motor conflict, and this activity was correlated with parietal motor activity. Together, these results show that the motor system is able to represent multiple observed actions, and as such reveal a potential mechanism by which third-party social encounters could be processed in the brain.",

We propose a method for in silico selection of candidates which have a high potential for neo-antigen generation and are likely to appear in multiple patients. This is achieved by carefully screening 33 TCGA data sets for recurrent somatic amino acid exchanges and, for the 1,055 resulting recurrent variants, applying MHC class I binding prediction algorithms. A preliminary confirmation of epitope binding and recognition by CD8 T cells has been carried out for a couple of candidates in humanized mice. Recurrent neo-epitopes may be suitable to supplement existing personalized T cell treatment approaches with precision treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies to the prion protein, PrP, represent a promising therapeutic approach against prion diseases but the neurotoxicity of certain anti-PrP antibodies has caused concern. Here we describe scPOM-bi, a bispecific antibody designed to function as a molecular prion tweezer. scPOM-bi combines the complementarity-determining regions of the neurotoxic antibody POM1 and the neuroprotective POM2, which bind the globular domain (GD) and flexible tail (FT) respectively. We found that scPOM-bi confers protection to prion-infected organotypic cerebellar slices even when prion pathology is already conspicuous. Moreover, scPOM-bi prevents the formation of soluble oligomers that correlate with neurotoxic PrP species. Simultaneous targeting of both GD and FT was more effective than concomitant treatment with the individual molecules or targeting the tail alone, possibly by preventing the GD from entering a toxic-prone state. We conclude that simultaneous binding of the GD and flexible tail of PrP results in strong protection from prion neurotoxicity and may represent a promising strategy for anti-prion immunotherapy.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAntibody immunotherapy is considered a viable strategy against prion disease. We previously showed that antibodies against the so-called globular domain of Prion Protein (PrP) can cause PrP dependent neurotoxicity; this does not happen for antibodies against the flexible tail of PrP, which therefore ought to be preferred for therapy.\\n\\nHere we show that simultaneous targeting of both globular domain and flexible tail by a bispecific, combination of a toxic and a non-toxic antibody, results in stronger protection against prion toxicity, even if the bispecific is administered when prion pathology is already conspicuous.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that neurotoxicity arises from binding to specific \\\"toxicity triggering sites\\\" in the globular domain. We designed our bispecific with two aims: i) occupying one such site and preventing prion or other factors from docking to it and ii) binding to the flexible tail to engage the region of PrP necessary for neurotoxicity.\\n\\nWe also show that neurotoxic antibodies cause the formation of soluble PrP oligomers that cause toxicity on PrP expressing cell lines; these are not formed in the presence of prion protective antibodies. We suggest that these soluble species might play a role in prion toxicity, similarly to what is generally agreed to happen in other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTBluegill sunfish accelerate primarily by increasing the total amount of force produced in each tail beat but not by substantially redirecting forces.\\n\\nABSTRACTIn their natural habitat, fish rarely swim steadily. Instead they frequently accelerate and decelerate. Relatively little is known about how fish produce extra force for acceleration in routine swimming behavior. In this study, we examined the flow around bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus during steady swimming and during forward acceleration, starting at a range of initial swimming speeds. We found that bluegill produce vortices with higher circulation during acceleration, indicating a higher force per tail beat, but do not substantially redirect the force. We quantified the flow patterns using high speed video and particle image velocimetry and measured acceleration with small inertial measurement units attached to each fish. Even in steady tail beats, the fish accelerates slightly during each tail beat, and the magnitude of the acceleration varies. In steady tail beats, however, a high acceleration is followed by a lower acceleration or a deceleration, so that the swimming speed is maintained; in unsteady tail beats, the fish maintains the acceleration over several tailbeats, so that the swimming speed increases. We can thus compare the wake and kinematics during single steady and unsteady tailbeats that have the same peak acceleration. During unsteady tailbeats when the fish accelerates forward for several tailbeats, the wake vortex forces are much higher than those at the same acceleration during single tailbeats in steady swimming. The fish also undulates its body at higher amplitude and frequency during unsteady tailbeats. These kinematic changes likely increase the fluid dynamic added mass of the body, increasing the forces required to sustain acceleration over several tailbeats. The high amplitude and high frequency movements are also likely required to generate the higher forces needed for acceleration. Thus, it appears that bluegill sunfish face a tradeoff during acceleration: the body movements required for acceleration also make it harder to accelerate.",

This has been achieved by super-resolution localization microscopy and single-molecule tracking in conjunction with photoactivatable fluorescent proteins. An alternative labelling approach relies on genetically-encoded protein tags with cell-permeable fluorescent ligands which are brighter and less prone to photobleaching than fluorescent proteins but require a laborious labelling process. Either labelling method is associated with significant advantages and disadvantages that should be taken into consideration depending on the microscopy experiment planned. Here, we describe an optimised procedure for labelling Halo-tagged proteins in live Escherichia coli cells. We provide a side-by-side comparison of Halo tag with different fluorescent ligands against the popular photoactivatable fluorescent protein PAmCherry. Using test proteins with different intracellular dynamics, we evaluated fluorescence intensity, background, photostability, and single-molecule localization and tracking results. Capitalising on the brightness and extended spectral range of fluorescent Halo ligands, we also demonstrate high-speed and dual-colour single-molecule tracking.",

    "abstract": "Depression has well-established influences from genetic and environmental risk factors. This has led to the diathesis-stress theory, which assumes a multiplicative gene-by-environment interaction (GxE) effect on risk. Recently, Colodro-Conde et al. empirically tested this theory, using the polygenic risk score for major depressive disorder (PRS, genes) and stressful life events (SLE, environment) effects on depressive symptoms, identifying significant GxE effects with an additive contribution to liability. We have tested the diathesis-stress theory on an independent sample of 4 919 individuals.\\n\\nWe identified nominally significant positive GxE effects in the full cohort (R2 = 0.08%, p = 0.049) and in women (R2 = 0.19%, p = 0.017), but not in men (R2 = 0.15%, p = 0.07). GxE effects were nominally significant, but only in women, when SLE were split into those in which the respondent plays an active or passive role (R2 = 0.15%, p = 0.038; R2 = 0.16%, p = 0.033, respectively). High PRS increased the risk of depression in participants reporting high numbers of SLE (p = 2.86 x 10-4). However, in those participants who reported no recent SLE, a higher PRS appeared to increase the risk of depressive symptoms in men ({beta} = 0.082, p = 0.016) but had a protective effect in women ({beta} = -0.061, p = 0.037). This difference was nominally significant (p = 0.017). Our study reinforces the evidence of additional risk in the aetiology of depression due to GxE effects. However, larger sample sizes are required to robustly validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious swine disease found worldwide that has caused devastating economic losses. However, there are few efficacious mAbs against the CSF virus (CSFV) that can be used for treatment because most mAbs against CSFV are derived from mouse hybridoma cells and these murine mAbs have disadvantages of inefficient effector functions elicitations and high immunogenicity in vivo. Accordingly, we characterized whole-porcine anti-CSFV neutralizing mAbs (NAbs) isolated directly from single B cells sorted from a CSFV-vaccinated pig using the fluoresceinated conserved linear neutralizing epitope of the CSFV E2 protein and fluorophore conjugated goat anti-pig IgG. Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were isolated via nested PCR, and two porcine mAbs termed HK24 and HK44 were produced. We determined that these mAbs can bind to E2 protein and recognize sites within this major antigenic epitope. In addition, we found that mAbs HK24 and HK44 exhibit potent neutralizing activity against CSFV, and they can protect PK-15 cells from infections in vitro with potent IC50 values of 9.3 g/ml and 0.62 g/ml, respectively. Notably, we demonstrated that these two mAbs can be used as novel reagents for detecting virus infection. These data suggest that our results not only provide a method for efficiently obtaining mAbs against CSFV but also offer promising mAb candidates for development of antibody-based diagnostic and antiviral agents.\\n\\nImportanceNeutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NAbs) can prevent and may slow the spread of virus infection. The discovery of NAbs that recognize classical swine fever virus (CSFV) necessitates new technologies because the NAbs produced by immunization and hybridoma technology could not be transferred to in vivo research. Multiple full-length human therapeutic antibodies have been produced via single-cell polymerase chain reactions but whole-porcine NAbs for CSFV have not been generated. In this study, two whole-porcine mAbs, named HK24 and HK44, were isolated from epitope-specific single B cells. We demonstrate that these two mAbs have potent neutralizing activity against CSFV and can protect cells against viral infection. Therefore, they may facilitate the development of vaccines or antiviral drugs that offer the advantages of stability and low immunogenicity.",

Intermittent fasting (IF) and high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) are natural strategies that, individually, can prevent and ameliorate obesity along with metabolic syndrome and its associated diseases. However, the combinatorial effect of IF and HIIF on energetic metabolism is currently not well understood. We hypothesized that their combination could have a potential for more than strictly additive benefits. Here, we show that two months of every-other-day intermittent fasting regimen combined with a high-intensity intermittent exercise protocol (IF/HIIE) produce a synergetic effect, preventing fat accumulation, enhancing physical performance and optimizing energy production. The IF/HIIE group presented increased glucose uptake, lower levels of serum insulin and a global activation of hexokinases in skeletal muscle, heart and liver comparing to control, IF and HIIE groups. IF/HIIE synergism led to activation of the FoF1 ATP synthase and promoted a more oxidative profile of mitochondria in observed skeletal muscle. Additionally, high-resolution respirometry of muscle fibers showed that animals in the IF/HIIE group presented characteristics suggestive of augmented mitochondrial mass and efficiency. Finally, an important reduction in serum oxidative stress markers were observed in IF/HIIE group. These findings provide new insights for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical strategies to prevent/treat metabolic syndrome and associated diseases.",

These features are used to build a phylogenetic tree given a set of species from insect, fish, bird, and mammal. A novel distance measure in the feature space is proposed for the purpose of reflecting the proximity of these species in the evolutionary processes. The distance function is found to be a metric. We have proposed a three step technique to select a feature vector from the feature space. We have carried out variations of these selected feature vectors for generating multiple hypothesis of these trees and finally we used a consensus based tree merging algorithm to obtain the phylogeny. Experimentations were carried out with 157 species covering four different classes such as, Insecta, Actinopterygii, Aves, and Mammalia. We also introduce a measure of quality of the inferred tree especially when the reference tree is not present. The performance of the output tree can be measured at each clade by considering the presence of each species at the corresponding clade. GRAFree can be applied on any graphical representation of genome to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. We apply our proposed distance function on the selected feature vectors for three naive methods of graphical representation of genome. The inferred tree reflects some accepted evolutionary traits with a high bootstrap support. This concludes that our proposed distance function can be applied to capture the evolutionary relationships of a large number of both close and distance species using graphical methods.",

    "abstract": "Given GDF5 involvement in hip development, and osteoarthritis (OA) and developmental hip dysplasia (DDH) risk, here we sought to assess the role(s) of GDF5 and its regulatory sequence on the development of hip morphology linked to injury risk. The brachypodism (bp) mouse, which harbors a Gdf5 inactivating mutation, was used to survey how Gdf5 loss of function impacts the development of hip morphology. Two transgenic Gdf5 reporter BAC lines were used to assess the spatiotemporal expression of Gdf5 regulatory sequences. Each BAC line was also used to assess the functional roles of upstream and downstream sequence on hip morphology. bp/bp mice had shorter femora with smaller femoral heads and necks as well as larger alpha angles, smaller anterior offsets, and smaller acetabula, compared to bp/+ mice (p<0.04). Regulatory sequences downstream of Gdf5 drove strong prenatal (E17) expression and low postnatal (6 months) expression across regions of femoral head and acetabulum. Conversely, upstream regulatory sequences drove very low expression at E17 and no detectable expression at 6 months. Importantly, downstream, but not upstream Gdf5 regulatory sequences fully restored all the key morphologic features disrupted in bp/bp mice. Hip morphology is profoundly affected by Gdf5 absence, and downstream regulatory sequences mediate its effects by controlling Gdf5 expression during development. This downstream region contains numerous enhancers harboring risk variants related to hip OA, DDH, and dislocation. We posit that subtle alterations to morphology driven by changes in downstream regulatory sequence underlie this locus role in hip injury risk.",

    "abstract": "The Src homology-2 domain containing phosphatase SHP2 is a critical regulator of signal transduction, being implicated in cell growth and differentiation. Activating mutations cause developmental disorders and act as oncogenic drivers in hematologic cancers. SHP2 is activated by phosphopeptide binding to the N-SH2 domain, triggering the release of N-SH2 from the catalytic PTP domain. Based on early crystallographic data, it has been widely accepted that opening of the binding cleft of N-SH2 serves as the key \"allosteric switch\" driving SHP2 activation. To test the putative coupling between binding cleft opening and SHP2 activation as assumed by the \"allosteric switch\" model, we critically reviewed structural data of SHP2 and we used extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and free energy calculations of isolated N-SH2 in solution, SHP2 in solution, and SHP2 in a crystal environment. Our results demonstrate that the binding cleft in N-SH2 is constitutively flexible and open in solution, and that a closed cleft found in certain structures is a consequence of crystal contacts. The degree of opening of the binding cleft has only a negligible effect on the free energy of SHP2 activation. Instead, SHP2 activation is greatly favored by the opening of the central {beta}- sheet of N-SH2. We conclude that opening of the N-SH2 binding cleft is not the key allosteric switch triggering SHP2 activation.\n\nSignificance StatementSHP2 is a multi-domain protein, playing an important role in up-regulating cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and programmed cell death. SHP2 mutations cause developmental disorders and were found in many cancer types, including neuroblastoma, breast cancer, and leukemia. In healthy cells, SHP2 mainly takes an autoinhibited, inactive form, and SHP2 is activated upon binding of phosphopeptides to the N-SH2 domain. For the past two decades, the widening of the binding cleft upon peptide binding has been considered as the key event driving SHP2 activation. Here, by analyzing crystallographic data and molecular simulations, we demonstrate that the binding cleft in N-SH2 is, instead, already open and accessible in solution, and its degree of opening does not influence SHP2 activation.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which epithelia identify and respond to pathogens are manifold, nuanced and complex. Here, using human-colon derived HT29 epithelial cells, mouse and human primary colonoids, and cathelicidin null (Cramp) mice, we report a novel immunoregulatory role for the antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin, that was found to recognize and synergise with Salmonella typhimurium or its derived virulence factor lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to promote epithelial synthesis of the chemokine IL-8/KC for neutrophil recruitment/activation during infectious colitis. Mechanistically, cathelicidin facilitated the internalization of LPS via GM1 lipid rafts and subsequent TLR4 activation to promote IL-8 production. Furthermore, IL-8 output required the integrated activity of two signal transduction pathways: NF-{kappa}B and MEK 1/2 kinase signaling was required for IL-8 mRNA synthesis, while Src-EGFR-p38MAPK (NF-{kappa}B independent) activity underlay IL-8 mRNA stabilization. This immunomodulatory function of cathelicidin was key in colon defense, since Cramp-/- mice infected with a natural murine Gram negative intestinal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, displayed diminished KC secretion, impaired mobilization and reduced clearance of the bacteria. Occurring at concentrations lower than those necessary for anti-microbial activity, cathelicidins capacity to sense pathogens/LPS and enhance neutrophil recruitment reveals a novel function for this peptide in directing innate immunity which may be of pivotal importance in the control of infections colitis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe gut lining has a well regulated immune system that tolerates resident bacteria and does not respond to them. However, when pathogenic bacteria enter, there needs to be a protective response. How the gut lining  switches from passive to protective is of interest. In our study, we determined host defense cathelicidin peptide (either naturally occurring or administered) \\\"instructs\\\" the colon lining to produce a compound (IL-8) that attracts white blood cells in response to a pathogen (Salmonella typhimurium) or lipopolysaccharide, a component of this pathogens cell wall. We discovered a novel mechanism by which cathelicidin facilitates uptake of lipopolysaccharide by the lining of the colon and how it activates receptors to increase synthesis and release of IL-8. In addition, we also detected a synergistic action between cathelicidin and intestinal pathogens in laboratory cultures of colon tissues from mice and humans, as well as in a mouse model of colitis with another pathogenic bacterium. Cathelicidin induced production of IL-8 which attracted and stimulated more white blood cells. Therefore, in addition to potential direct actions to supress harmful bacteria, cathelicidin also acts as a biological sensor in the gut lining, recognizing pathogens or factors they produce and increasing white cell responses.",

    "abstract": "While considered solely an extracellular pathogen, increasing evidence indicates that Pseudomonas aeruginosa encounters intracellular environment in diverse mammalian cell types, including macrophages. In the present study, we have deciphered the intramacrophage fate of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain by live and electron microscopy. P. aeruginosa first resided in phagosomal vacuoles and subsequently could be detected in the cytoplasm, indicating phagosomal escape of the pathogen, a finding also supported by vacuolar rupture assay. The intracellular bacteria could eventually induce cell lysis. Two bacterial factors, MgtC and OprF, recently identified to be important for survival of P. aeruginosa in macrophages, were found to be involved in bacterial escape from the phagosome as well as cell lysis caused by intracellular bacteria. Strikingly, type III secretion system (T3SS) genes of P. aeruginosa were down-regulated within macrophages in both mgtC and oprF mutants. Concordantly, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) level was increased in both mutants, providing a clue for negative regulation of T3SS inside macrophages. Consistent with the phenotypes and gene expression pattern of mgtC and oprF mutants, a T3SS mutant ({Delta}pscN) exhibited defect in phagosomal escape and macrophage lysis driven by internalized bacteria. Importantly, these effects appeared to be largely dependent on the ExoS effector, in contrast with the known T3SS-dependent, but ExoS independent, cytotoxicity caused by extracellular P. aeruginosa towards macrophages. Hence, our work highlights T3SS and ExoS, whose expression is modulated by MgtC and OprF, as key players in the intramacrophage life of P. aeruginosa, allowing internalized bacteria to evade macrophages.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe ability of professional phagocytes to ingest and kill microorganisms is central to host defense and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has developed mechanisms to avoid being killed by phagocytes. While considered an extracellular pathogen, P. aeruginosa has been reported to be engulfed by macrophages in animal models. Here, we visualized the fate of P. aeruginosa within cultured macrophages, revealing macrophage lysis driven by intracellular P. aeruginosa. Two bacterial factors, MgtC and OprF, recently discovered to be involved in the intramacrophage survival of P. aeruginosa, appeared to play role in this cytotoxicity caused by intracellular bacteria. We provided evidence that type III secretion system (T3SS) gene expression is lowered intracellularly in mgtC and oprF mutants. We further showed that intramacrophage P. aeruginosa uses its T3SS, specifically the ExoS effector, to promote phagosomal escape and cell lysis. We thus describe a transient intramacrophage stage of P. aeruginosa that could contribute to bacterial dissemination.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSAccording to current theoretical models of working memory (WM), executive functions (EFs) like updating, inhibition and shifting play an important role in WM functioning. The models state that EFs highly correlate with each other but also have some individual variance which makes them separable processes. Since this theory has mostly been substantiated with behavioral data like reaction time and the ability to execute a task correctly, the aim of this paper is to find evidence for diversity (unique properties) of the EFs updating and inhibition in neural correlates of EEG data by means of using brain-computer interface (BCI) methods as a research tool. To highlight the benefit of this approach we compare this new methodology to classical analysis approaches.\\n\\nMethodsAn existing study has been reinvestigated by applying neurophysiological analysis in combination with support vector machine (SVM) classification on recorded electroenzephalography (EEG) data to determine the separability and variety of the two EFs updating and inhibition on a single trial basis.\\n\\nResultsThe SVM weights reveal a set of distinct features as well as a set of shared features for the two EFs updating and inhibition in the theta and the alpha band power.\\n\\nSignificanceIn this paper we find evidence that correlates for unity and diversity of EFs can be found in neurophysiological data. Machine learning approaches reveal shared but also distinct properties for the EFs.

    "abstract": "Signaling networks are an important tool of modern systems biology and drug development. Here, we present a new methodology to qualitatively model signaling networks by combining experimental data and prior knowledge about protein connectivity. Unlike other methods, our approach does not focus solely on selecting which reactions are involved but also on whether a protein is present. This allows the user to model more complicated experiments and incorporate more knowledge into the model. To demonstrate the capabilities of our method we compared the signaling networks of young and replicative senescent human primary HFL-1 fibroblasts, whose differences are expected to be due mainly to changes in the expression of the proteins rather than the reactions involved. The resulting networks indicate that, compared to young cells, aged cells are not as responsive to insulin stimulation and activate pathways that establish and maintain senescence.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCells have developed a complex network of biochemical reactions to monitor their environment and react to changes. Although multiple pathways, tuned to identify specific stimuli, have been discovered, it is generally understood that the signaling process typically involves multiple pathways and is context depended. Consequently, reconstructing the signaling network utilized by cells at any given moment is not a trivial task. In this article, we report on a novel logic-based method for identifying signaling network by combining experimental data with prior knowledge about the connectivity of the involved proteins. Unlike other methods proposed so far, our method uses data to evaluate the presence or absence of reactions and proteins alike. We reconstructed and compared the signaling network of human primary HFL-1 fibroblasts as they undergo replicative senescence in the presence of 6 different stimuli. The resulting networks indicate that, compared to young cells, senescent cells are not responsive to insulin stimulation and activate pathways that are known to establish and maintain senescence.",

    "abstract": "Homeobox transcription factors (TFs) in the TALE superclass are deeply embedded in the gene regulatory networks that orchestrate embryogenesis. Knotted-like homeobox (KNOX) TFs, homologous to animal MEIS, have been found to drive the haploid-to-diploid transition in both unicellular green algae and land plants via heterodimerization with other TALE superclass TFs, representing remarkable functional conservation of a developmental TF across lineages that diverged one billion years ago. To delineate the ancestry of TALE-TALE heterodimerization, we analyzed TALE endowment in the algal radiations of Archaeplastida, ancestral to land plants. Homeodomain phylogeny and bioinformatics analysis partitioned TALEs into two broad groups, KNOX and non-KNOX. Each group shares previously defined heterodimerization domains, plant KNOX-homology in the KNOX group and animal PBC-homology in the non-KNOX group, indicating their deep ancestry. Protein-protein interaction experiments showed that the TALEs in the two groups all participated in heterodimerization. These results indicate that the TF dyads consisting of KNOX/MEIS and PBC-containing TALEs must have evolved early in eukaryotic evolution, a likely function being to accurately execute the haploid-to-diploid transitions during sexual development.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComplex multicellularity requires elaborate developmental mechanisms, often based on the versatility of heterodimeric transcription factor (TF) interactions. Highly conserved TALE-superclass homeobox TF networks in major eukaryotic lineages suggest deep ancestry of developmental mechanisms. Our results support the hypothesis that in early eukaryotes, the TALE heterodimeric configuration provided transcription-on switches via dimerization-dependent subcellular localization, ensuring execution of the haploid-to-diploid transition only when the gamete fusion is correctly executed between appropriate partner gametes, a system that then diversified in the several lineages that engage in complex multicellular organization.",

    "abstract": "The Anones Lagoon, located in the island municipality of Vieques, Puerto Rico (PR), received extensive bombing during military practices by the US Navy for decades. After military activities ceased in 2003, the bombing range was designated as part of a larger Superfund site by US EPA. Here, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to investigate how microbial communities responded to pollution by heavy metals and explosives at this lagoon. Sediment samples (0-5 cm) from Anones were collected in 2005 and 2014 and compared to samples from two reference lagoons, i.e., Guaniquilla, Cabo Rojo (a natural reserve) and Condado, San Juan (PRs capital city). Consistent with selection under low anthropogenic impacts, Guaniquilla exhibited the highest degree of diversity with lower frequency of genes related to xenobiotics metabolism among the three lagoons. Notably, a clear shift was observed in Anones, with Euryarchaeota becoming enriched (9% of total) and a concomitant increase in community diversity, by about one order of magnitude, after almost 10 years without bombing activities. In contrast, genes associated with explosives biodegradation and heavy metal transformation significantly decreased in abundance in Anones 2014 (by 91.5%). Five unique population genomes were recovered from the Anones 2005 sample that encoded genetic determinants implicated in biodegradation of contaminants. Collectively, these results provided new insights into the natural attenuation of explosive contaminants by the benthic microbial communities of the Anones lagoon and could serve as reference points to enhance bioremediation actions at this site and for assessing other similarly impacted sites.\\n\\nImportanceThis study represents the first assessment of the benthic microbial community in the Anones Lagoon in Vieques, Puerto Rico after the impact of intense pollution by bombs and unconventional weapons during military training exercises. Evaluating the microbial diversity of Anones, represents an opportunity to assess the microbial succession patterns during the active process of natural attenuation of pollutants. The culture-independent techniques employed to study these environmental samples allowed the recovery of almost complete genomes of several abundant species that were likely involved in the biodegradation of pollutants and thus, represented species responding to the strong selection pressure posed by military activities. Further, our results showed that natural attenuation has proceeded to a great extend ten years after the cease of military activities.",

However, due to its relatively recent introduction in research, there are still many biological aspects of the animal that are not known. One of such questions is the influence of the culturing temperature on Macrostomum biology. Here we systematically investigated how different culturing temperatures affect the development time, reproduction rate, regeneration, heat shock response, and gene knockdown efficiency by RNA interference in M. lignano. We used marker transgenic lines of the flatworm to accurately measure the regeneration endpoint and to establish the stress response threshold for temperature shock. We found that compared to the culturing temperature of 20{degrees}C commonly used for M. lignano, elevated temperatures of 25{degrees}C-30{degrees}C substantially speed-up the development and regeneration time and increase reproduction rate without detectable negative consequences for the animal, while temperatures above 30{degrees}C elicit a heat shock response.\\n\\nWe show that altering the temperature conditions can be used to shorten the time required to establish M. lignano cultures, store important lines and optimize the microinjection procedures for transgenesis. Our findings will help to optimize the design of experiments in M. lignano and thus facilitate future research in this model organism.",

Fluorescence applications at cryo-temperature have typically been limited to localization of tagged protein oligomers due to known issues of extended triplet state duration, spectral shifts, and reduced photon capture through cryo-CLEM objectives. Here, we consider fluorophore characteristics and behaviors that could enable more extended applications. We describe how dialkylcarbocanine DiD and its autoquenching by resonant energy transfer can be used to distinguish the fusion state of a lipid bilayer at cryo-temperatures. By adapting an established fusion assay to work under cryo-CLEM conditions, we identified areas of fusion between influenza virus-like particles and fluorescently labeled lipid vesicles on a cryo-EM grid. This result demonstrates that cryo-CLEM can be used to localize functions in addition to tagged proteins, and that fluorescence autoquenching by resonant energy transfer can be incorporated successfully into cryo-CLEM approaches. In the case of membrane fusion applications, this method provides both an orthogonal confirmation of functional state independent of the morphological description from cryo-EM and a way to bridge room-temperature kinetic assays and the cryo-EM images.",

    "abstract": "How DNA sequence variation influences gene expression remains poorly understood. Diploid organisms have two homologous copies of their DNA sequence in the same nucleus, providing a rich source of information about how genetic variation affects a wealth of biochemical processes. However, few computational methods have been developed to discover allele-specific differences in functional genomic data. Existing methods either treat each SNP independently, limiting statistical power, or combine SNPs across gene annotations, preventing the discovery of allele specific differences in unexpected genomic regions. Here we introduce AlleleHMM, a new computational method to identify blocks of neighboring SNPs that share similar allele-specific differences in mark abundance. AlleleHMM uses a hidden Markov model to divide the genome among three hidden states based on allele frequencies in genomic data: a symmetric state (state  S) which shows no difference between alleles, and regions with a higher signal on the maternal (state M) or paternal (state P) allele. AlleleHMM substantially outperformed naive methods using both simulated and real genomic data, particularly when input data had realistic levels of overdispersion. Using PRO-seq data, AlleleHMM identified thousands of allele specific blocks of transcription in both coding and non-coding genomic regions. AlleleHMM is a powerful tool for discovering allele-specific regions in functional genomic datasets.",

Here we show that mice adapt to split-belt walking in a way that is remarkably similar to humans, suggesting that this form of locomotor learning is highly conserved across vertebrates. Like human learning, mouse locomotor adaptation is specific to measures of interlimb coordination, has spatial and temporal components that adapt at different rates, and is highly context-specific. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrate that split-belt adaptation in mice specifically depends on intermediate cerebellum, but is insensitive to large lesions of cerebral cortex. Finally, cell-type specific chemogenetics combined with quantitative behavioral analysis reveal distinct neural circuit mechanisms underlying spatial vs. temporal components of locomotor adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system has been implicated in regulation of many behaviors including pain. While there are numerous studies suggesting KOR-regulation of pain being mediated spinally, there have been reports of pain-like behaviors regulated by central KOR signaling. In particular, oxytocin-induced analgesia appears to be mediated by KOR receptors within the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). The vlPAG is a brain region that has long been known to be involved in the regulation of pain. We recently found that dopamine (DA) neurons within the vlPAG represent a specific population of neurons that can regulate pain-like behaviors. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of KOR signaling on GABAergic inputs to the vlPAG DA neurons, and determine the mechanism of inhibition. We found that activation of KOR significantly reduced GABAergic transmission onto vlPAG DA neurons. In addition, our data suggest this effect is mediated pre-synaptically via the G-protein {beta}{gamma} subunit. These data suggest the possibility that KOR-activation disinhibits vlPAG dopamine neurons, which could lead to altered regulation of pain-related behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic mouse lines are routinely employed to label and manipulate distinct cell types. The transgene generally comprises cell-type specific regulatory elements linked to a cDNA encoding a reporter or other proteins. However, off-target expression seemingly unrelated to the regulatory elements in the transgene is often observed, and sometimes suspected to reflect influences related to the site of transgene integration in the genome. To test this hypothesis, we used a proximity ligation-based method, Targeted Locus Amplification (TLA), to map the insertion sites of three well-characterized transgenes that appeared to exhibit insertion site-dependent expression in retina. The nearest endogenous genes to transgenes HB9-GFP, Mito-P, and TYW3 are Cdh6, Fat4 and Khdrbs2, respectively. For two lines, we demonstrate that expression reflects that of the closest endogenous gene (Fat4 and Cdh6), even though the distance between transgene and endogenous gene is 550 and 680 kb, respectively. In all three lines, the transgenes decrease expression of the neighboring endogenous genes. In each case, the affected endogenous gene was expressed in at least some of the cell types that the transgenic line has been used to mark and study. These results provide insights into the effects of transgenes and endogenous genes on each others expression, demonstrate that mapping insertion site is valuable for interpreting results obtained with transgenic lines, and indicate that TLA is a reliable method for integration site discovery.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the translocation of a subset of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec machinery requires SecA. Although SecA can recognise nascent polypeptides, the mechanism of cotranslational substrate protein recognition is not known. Here, we investigated the role of the C-terminal tail (CTT) of SecA, which consists of a flexible linker (FLD) and a small metal-binding domain (MBD), in its interaction with nascent polypeptides. Phylogenetic analysis and ribosome binding experiments indicated that the MBD interacts with 70S ribosomes. Disruption of the entire CTT or the MBD alone had opposing effects on ribosome binding, substrate-protein binding, ATPase activity and in vivo function. Autophotocrosslinking, mass spectrometry, x-ray crystallography and small-angle x-ray scattering experiments provided insight into the CTT-mediated conformational changes in SecA. Finally, photocrosslinking experiments indicated that binding of SecA to substrate protein affected its interaction with the ribosome. Taken together, our results suggest a mechanism for substrate protein recognition.\\n\\nImpact StatementSecA is an evolutionarily conserved ATPase that is required for the translocation of a subset of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria. We investigated how SecA recognises its substrate proteins at the ribosome as they are still being synthesised (i.e. cotranslationally).",

    "abstract": "xCT is a component of heterodimeric amino acids transporter system Xc- that has been known to work at the cross-roads of maintaining neurological processes and regulating antioxidant defense. xCT is a sodium-independent amino acid antiporter, that imports L- cystine and exports L-glutamate in a 1:1 ratio. The transporter has 12 transmembrane domains with intracellular N- and C-termini, which can undergo various conformational changes while switching the ligand accessibilities from intracellular to extracellular site. In the present study, we generated two homology models of human xCT in two distinct conformations: inward facing occluded state and outward facing open state. We investigated the conformational transitions within these two states by employing series of targeted molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicated the substrate translocation channel composed of transmembrane helices TMs 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10. Further, we analyzed the ligand binding within the intermediate conformations obtained from the transition simulations. We docked anionic L-cystine and L-glutamate within the cavities alone or in combination to assess the two distinct binding scenarios for xCT as antiporter. We also assessed the interactions between the ligand and xCT and observed that ligands bind to similar residues within the channel, and these residues are essential for substrate binding/permeation. In addition, we analyzed the correlations between ligand binding and conformational transition and observed conformations that are representatives for intermediate ligand bound states. The results presented in the study provide insights into the interplay of conformational transition and ligand binding as xCT goes from one probable conformation to another while transporting the ligand. And the data thus adds to the existing evidence of alternating access mechanism pertaining to the functioning of transporters.",

    "abstract": "Seemingly effortless tasks, such as recognizing faces and retrieving names, become significantly harder as people get older. These age-related difficulties may be partially due to the concurrent activation of related competitors. However, it remains unclear whether older adults struggle with detecting an early interference signal or with suppressing irrelevant competitors once competition is detected. To investigate this question, we used the retrieval practice paradigm, shown to elicit interference, while recording electrophysiological activity in young and older adults. In two experiments, young participants showed the typical Retrieval Induced Forgetting (RIF) effect whereas the elderly did not. Neurally, young adults were more capable to detect interference than the older, as evidenced by an increase in mid-frontal theta power (~4-8Hz). This efficient interference detection allowed young adults to recruit inhibitory mechanisms that overcome competition, as traced by a theta power reduction across retrieval cycles. No such reduction was found for the elderly, indicating that the lack of an early interference detection signal renders older adults unable to recruit memory selection mechanisms, eliminating RIF.\\n\\nAUTHORS NOTEThis research was supported by the doctoral research grants AP2009-2215 to C.S.F and BES-2013-066842 to M.J.M.; by grants PSI2012-33625; PSI2015-65502-C2-1-P from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness, and by the Economic Council of the Andalusian Government P08-HUM-03600-Feder and P12-CTS-2369-Feder to T.B.\\n\\nDeclaration of interestThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose",

We previously described global changes in cellular protein levels during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection using transformed CEM-T4 T cells as a model. In this study, we develop an HIV reporter virus displaying a streptavidin-binding affinity tag at the surface of infected cells, allowing facile one-step selection with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. We use this system to obtain pure populations of HIV-infected primary human CD4+ T cells for detailed proteomic analysis, including quantitation of >9,000 proteins across 4 different donors, and temporal profiling during T cell activation. Remarkably, amongst 650 cellular proteins significantly perturbed during HIV infection of primary T cells (q<0.05), almost 50% are regulated directly or indirectly by the viral accessory proteins Vpr, Vif, Nef and Vpu. The remainder have not been previously characterised, but include novel Vif-dependent targets FMR1 and DPH7, and 192 targets not identified and/or regulated in T cell lines, such as AIRD5A and PTPN22. We therefore provide a high-coverage functional proteomic atlas of HIV infection, and a mechanistic account of HIV-dependent changes in its natural target cell.",

    "abstract": "Size control is fundamental in tissue development and homeostasis1,2. While the role of cell proliferation in this process has been widely studied3, the mechanisms of organ size control and how it impacts cell fates remain elusive. Here, we use mouse blastocyst development as a model to unravel a key role of fluid-filled lumen in embryonic size control and cell fate specification. We find that during blastocyst expansion, there is a two-fold increase in the pressure of the lumen that translates into a concomitant increase in the cortical tension of trophectoderm (TE) cells lining the lumen. Increased cortical tension leads to vinculin mechanosensing and maturation of the functional tight junctions, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop to accommodate lumenal growth. However, when the cortical tension reaches a critical threshold, cell-cell adhesion cannot be sustained, and mitotic entry leads to a rupture of TE epithelium, fluid leakage and collapse of the blastocyst cavity. A simple theory of hydraulically-gated oscillations that integrates these feedback interactions recapitulates the evolution of cavity size and predicts the scaling of embryonic size with the tissue volume. Our theory further predicts that reduced cortical tension or disrupted tight junctions, and increased tissue stiffness lead to smaller embryonic size. These predictions are verified experimentally by embryological, pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the embryos. Remarkably, these changes to lumenal size, without a change in the tissue volume, lead to alteration of tissue architecture and cell fate. Overall, our study reveals how lumenal pressure and tissue mechanics control embryonic size at the tissue scale, that in turn couples to cell position and fate at the cellular scale.",

It has been reported that NETs are able to kill bacteria and fungi based upon the observation that smaller number of organisms are obtained in plating assays after they are incubated with NETs than if the DNA is pre-digested with DNase. It is possible that the microbial killing is apparent rather than real, and occurs because the organisms are aggregated on the DNA structure, and that the plating assay results were simply misinterpreted. The present study shows that digestion of DNA after incubation of NETs with the microbes restores their numbers to preincubation levels indicating that the apparent killing is an artefact of the assay.",

    "abstract": "The temporal order of an experience is a fundamental property of episodic memories, yet the mechanism for the consolidation of temporal sequences in long-term memory is still unknown. A potential mechanism for memory consolidation depends on the reactivation of neuronal sequences in the hippocampus. Despite abundant evidence of sequence reactivation in the formation of spatial memory, the reactivation of hippocampal neuronal sequences carrying non-spatial information has been much less explored. In this work, we recorded the activity of time cell sequences while rats performed multiple 15-s treadmill runnings during the intertrial intervals of a spatial alternation memory task. We observed forward and reverse reactivations of time cell sequences often occurring during sharp-wave ripple events following reward consumption. Surprisingly, the reactivation events specifically engaged cells coding temporal information. The reactivation of time cell sequences may thus reflect the organization of temporal order required for episodic memory formation.",

Consistent with previous work and confirmed by our computational hybrid framework, probability-magnitude integration deficits were driven specifically by a failure to represent reward magnitude.

The molecular glioma subtype which we modelled, harbors IDH1R132H, tumor protein 53 (TP53) and alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) loss. The impact of IDH1R132H on genomic stability, DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair in this molecular glioma subtype is unknown. We discovered that IDH1R132H expression in the genetic context of ATRX and TP53 inactivation: (i) increases median survival (MS), (ii) enhances DDR activity via epigenetic upregulation of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling, and (iii) elicits tumor radioresistance. Pharmacological inhibition of ATM or checkpoint kinase 1 and 2 (CHK1/2), two essential kinases in the DDR pathways, restored tumors radiosensitivity. Translation of these findings for mlDH1 glioma patients could significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy, and thus have a major impact on patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity relies on new protein synthesis in dendrites that involves the selective translation of specific mRNAs. This requires a tight control of mRNA levels in dendrites. Consistently, RNA translation and degradation pathways have been recently linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases, suggesting a role for RNA regulation in synaptic plasticity and cognition. Despite being the only RNA regulatory pathway that is associated with multiple mental illnesses, the Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) pathway presents an unexplored regulatory mechanism for synaptic function and plasticity. NMD is a highly conserved and selective RNA degradation pathway that exerts its function in a cell- and spatiotemporally-specific manner. Here, we show that neuron-specific disruption of NMD in adulthood attenuates learning, memory, hippocampal LTP, and potentiates perseverative/repetitive behavior. While it is known that local translation of specific mRNAs in dendrites enables synaptic plasticity, the tightly-controlled mechanisms that regulate local quantity of specific mRNAs remains poorly understood. We report that the NMD pathway operates within dendrites to regulate GluR1 surface levels. Specifically, NMD modulates the internalization of GluR1 and promotes its local synthesis in dendrites. We identified AMPK as a mechanistic substrate for NMD that contributes to the NMD-mediated regulation of GluR1 by limiting total GluR1 levels. These data establish that NMD regulates synaptic plasticity, cognition, and local protein synthesis in dendrites, providing fundamental insight into the neuron-specific function of NMD within the brain.",

    "abstract": "The structural network of the human brain has a rich topology which many have sought to characterise using standard network science measures and concepts. However, this characterisation remains incomplete and the non-obvious features of this topology have largely confounded attempts towards comprehensive constructive modelling. This calls for new perspectives. Hierarchical complexity is an emerging paradigm of complex network topology based on the observation that complex systems are composed of hierarchies within which the roles of hierarchically equivalent nodes display highly variable connectivity patterns. Here we test the hierarchical complexity of the human structural connectomes of a group of seventy-nine healthy adults. Binary connectomes are found to be more hierarchically complex than three benchmark random network models. This provides a new key description of brain structure, revealing a rich diversity of connectivity patterns within hierarchically equivalent nodes. Dividing the connectomes into four tiers based on degree magnitudes indicates that the most complex nodes are neither those with the highest nor lowest degrees but are instead found in the middle tiers. Spatial mapping of the brain regions in each hierarchical tier reveals consistency with the current anatomical, functional and neuropsychological knowledge of the human brain. The most complex tier (Tier 3) involves regions believed to bridge high-order cognitive (Tier 1) and low-order sensorimotor processing (Tier 2). We then show that such diversity of connectivity patterns aligns with the diversity of functional roles played out across the brain, demonstrating that hierarchical complexity can characterise functional diversity strictly from the network topology.",

The heuristic approach was developed by modeling general characteristics of OL ensheathments, while the deep learning neural network employed a UNet architecture with enhanced capacity to associate ensheathed segments with individual OLs. Reliably extracting multiple morphological parameters from individual cells, without heuristic approximations, mimics the high-level decision-making capacity of human researchers and improves the validity of the neural network. Experimental validation demonstrated that the deep learning approach matched the accuracy of expert-human measurements of the length and number of myelin segments per cell.

However, these networks are usually reconstructed independent of the phenotypic properties of the samples and therefore cannot identify regulatory mechanisms that are related to a phenotypic outcome of interest. In this study, we developed a new method called InPheRNo to identify  phenotype-relevant transcriptional regulatory networks. This method is based on a probabilistic graphical model whose conditional probability distributions model the simultaneous effects of multiple transcription factors (TFs) on their target genes as well as the statistical relationship between target gene expression and phenotype. Extensive comparison of InPheRNo with related approaches using primary tumor samples of 18 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that InPheRNo can accurately reconstruct cancer type-relevant TRNs and identify cancer driver TFs. In addition, survival analysis revealed that the activity level of TFs with many target genes could distinguish patients with good prognosis from those with poor prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Alignment of structural RNAs is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Since function is often determined by molecular structure, RNA alignment programs should take into account both sequence and base-pairing information for structural homology identification. A number of successful alignment programs are heuristic versions of Sankoffs optimal algorithm. Most of them require O(n4) run time. This paper describes C++ software, RNAmountAlign, for RNA sequence/structure alignment that runs in O(n3) time and O(n2) space; moreover, our software returns a p-value (transformable to expect value E) based on Karlin-Altschul statistics for local alignment, as well as parameter fitting for local and global alignment. Using incremental mountain height, a representation of structural information computable in cubic time, RNAmountAlign implements quadratic time pairwise local, global and global/semiglobal (query search) alignment using a weighted combination of sequence and structural similarity. RNAmountAlign is capable of performing progressive multiple alignment as well. Benchmarking of RNAmountAlign against LocARNA, LARA, FOLDALIGN, DYNALIGN and STRAL shows that RNAmountAlign has reasonably good accuracy and much faster run time supporting all alignment types.\\n\\nAvailabilityRNAmountAlign is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAmountAlign.",

    "abstract": "Protein recoding by RNA editing is required for normal health and evolutionary adaptation. However, de novo induction of RNA editing in response to environmental factors is an uncommon phenomenon. While APOBEC3A edits many mRNAs in monocytes/macrophages in response to hypoxia and interferons, the physiological significance of such editing is unclear. Here we show that the related APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase induces site-specific C-to-U RNA editing in natural killer (NK), CD8+ T cells and lymphoma cell lines upon cellular crowding and hypoxia. RNASeq analysis of hypoxic NK cells reveals widespread C-to-U recoding mRNA editing that is enriched for genes involved in mRNA translation. APOBEC3G promotes Warburg-like metabolic remodeling and reduces proliferation of HuT78 T cells under similar conditions. Hypoxia-induced RNA editing by APOBEC3G can be mimicked by the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and occurs independently of HIF-1. Thus, APOBEC3G is an endogenous RNA editing enzyme, which is induced by mitochondrial hypoxic stress to promote adaptation in lymphocytes.",

    "abstract": "Most current methods for controlling the rate of formation of a key protein or enzyme in cell factories rely on the manipulation of target genes within the pathway. In this article, we present a novel synthetic system for post-translational regulation of protein levels, FENIX, which provides both independent control of the steady-state protein level and inducible accumulation of targeted proteins. The device is based on the constitutive, proteasome-dependent degradation of the target polypeptide by tagging with a short synthetic, hybrid NIa/SsrA amino acid sequence in the C-terminal domain. The protein degradation process can be reversed by activating the system via addition of an orthogonal inducer (e.g. 3-methylbenzoate) to the culture medium. The system was benchmarked in Escherichia coli by tagging two fluorescent proteins (GFP and mCherry) and further exploited for engineering poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) accumulation completely uncoupled from bacterial growth. By tagging PhaA (3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, first step of the route), a dynamic metabolic switch at the acetyl-coenzyme A node was established in such a way that this metabolic precursor could be effectively directed into PHB formation upon activation of the system. The engineered E. coli strain reached a very high specific rate of PHB accumulation with a polymer content of ca. 72% (w/w) in glucose cultures set in the growth-decoupled mode. Thus, FENIX enables dynamic control of metabolic fluxes in bacterial cell factories by establishing post-translational synthetic switches in the pathway of interest.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/389809_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (34K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9ec08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1722feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa77b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c8624a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Risk-taking behavior affects many aspects of life, including maladaptive behaviors such as illicit substance use, unsafe driving, and risky sexual behavior. Risk-taking has been measured using both self-report measures and behavioral tasks designed for the purpose, but there is little consensus in the associations among measures and our understanding of the latent constructs underlying different forms of risk is limited. In the present study we examined the construct of risk using data from over 1000 young adults who completed measures of risk-taking, including self-reports of perception of risk, propensity to engage in risky behaviors and performance on behavioral tasks designed to measure risk. To examine the latent structure of risk preferences, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA revealed a latent structure of three distinct components of risk-taking behavior: \\\"Lifestyle Risk Sensitivity\\\", \\\"Financial Risk Sensitivity\\\", and \\\"Behavioral Risk Sensitivity\\\", which consisted only of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002). As expected, risk-taking and perception of risk differed in men and women. Yet, the PCA components were similar in men and women. Future work utilizing additional measures of risk-taking behavior in more heterogeneous samples will help to identify the true biobehavioral constructs underlying these behaviors.",

    "abstract": "There are no functional imaging based biomarkers for pharmacological treatment response in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In this study, we investigated whether there is an association between resting state functional brain connectivity (RsFC) and seizure control in TLE. We screened a large database containing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) data from 286 epilepsy patients. Patient medical records were screened for seizure characterization, EEG reports for lateralization and location of seizure foci to establish uniformity of seizure localization within patient groups. Rs-fMRI data from patients with well-controlled left TLE, patients with treatment-resistant left TLE, and healthy controls were analyzed. Healthy controls and cTLE showed similar functional connectivity patterns, whereas trTLE exhibited a significant bilateral decrease in thalamo-hippocampal functional connectivity. This work is the first to demonstrate differences in neural network connectivity between well-controlled and treatment-resistant TLE. These differences are spatially highly focused and suggest sites for the etiology and possibly treatment of TLE. Altered thalamo-hippocampal RsFC thus is a potential new biomarker for TLE treatment resistance.\\n\\nSummaryResting State functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI), previously utilized to predict lateralization of seizure foci in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is utilized to determine potential mechanisms and biomarkers for treatment-resistant and well-controlled unilateral TLE. We found significant differences in thalamo-hippocampal functional connectivity between treatment-resistant and well-controlled TLE patients. Differences in functional connectivity were focused to thalamo-hippocampal connections and more pronounced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to seizure foci. Aberrant functional connectivity patterns as measured by Rs-fMRI could thus serve as biomarkers for treatment response in TLE.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositides (PIs) regulate myriad cellular functions including membrane fusion, as exemplified by the yeast vacuole, which uses various PIs at different stages of fusion. In light of this, the effect of phos-phatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2] on vacuole fusion remains unknown. PI(3,5)P2 is made by the PI3P 5-kinase Fab1/PIKfyve and has been characterized as a regulator of vacuole fission during hyperosmotic shock where it interacts with the TRP family Ca2+ channel Yvc1. Here we demonstrate that exogenously added dioctanoyl (C8) PI(3,5)P2 abolishes homotypic vacuole fusion. This effect was not linked to interactions with Yvc1, as fusion was equally affected using yvc1{Delta} vacuoles. Thus, the effects of C8-PI(3,5)P2 on fusion versus fission operate through distinct mechanisms. Further testing showed that C8-PI(3,5)P2 inhibited vacuole fusion after the formation of trans-SNARE pairs. Although SNARE complex formation was unaffected we found that C8-PI(3,5)P2 strongly inhibited hemifusion. Overproduction of endogenous PI(3,5)P2 by the fab1T2250A hyperactive kinase mutant also inhibited at the hemifusion stage, bolstering the model in which PI(3,5)P2 inhibits fusion when present elevated levels. Taken together, this work identifies a novel function for PI(3,5)P2 as a negative regulator of vacuolar fusion. Moreover, it suggests that this lipid acts as a molecular switch between fission and fusion.",

However, broadly applicable methods for between-sample comparisons are lacking. Here, we introduce SNP-ChIP, a method that leverages small-scale intra-species polymorphisms, mainly SNPs, for quantitative spike-in normalization of ChIP-seq results. Sourcing spike-in material from the same species ensures antibody cross-reactivity and physiological coherence, thereby eliminating two central limitations of traditional spike-in approaches. We show that SNP-ChIP is robust to changes in sequencing depth and spike-in proportions, and reliably identifies changes in overall protein levels, irrespective of changes in binding distribution. Application of SNP-ChIP to test cases from budding yeast meiosis allowed discovery of novel regulators of the chromosomal protein Red1 and quantitative analysis of the DNA-damage associated histone modification{gamma} -H2AX. SNP-ChIP is fully compatible with the intra-species diversity of humans and most model organisms and thus offers a general method for normalizing ChIP-seq results.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other animals need to make decisions under varying degrees of uncertainty. These decisions are strongly influenced by an individuals risk preference, however the neuronal circuitry by which risk preference shapes choice is still unclear [1]. Supplementary eye field (SEF), an oculomotor area within primate medial frontal cortex, is thought to be an essential part of the neuronal circuit underlying oculomotor decision-making, including decisions under risk [2-5]. Consistent with this view, risk-related action value and monitoring signals have been observed in SEF [6-8]. However, such activity has also been observed in other frontal areas, including orbitofrontal [9-11], cingulate [12-14], and dorsal lateral frontal cortex [15]. It is thus unknown whether the activity in SEF causally contributes to risky decisions, or if it is merely a reflection of neural processes in other cortical regions. Here, we tested a causal role of SEF in risky oculomotor choices. We found that SEF inactivation strongly reduced the frequency of risky choices. This reduction was largely due to a reduced attraction to reward uncertainty and high reward gain, but not due to changes in the subjective estimation of reward probability or average expected reward. Moreover, SEF inactivation also led to increased sensitivity to differences between expected and actual reward during free choice. Nevertheless, it did not affect adjustments of decisions based on reward history.",
