    "abstract": "Understanding cascading effects of species loss has become a major challenge for ecologists. Traditionally, the robustness of ecological networks has been evaluated based on simulation studies where primary extinctions occur at random or as a function of species specialization, ignoring other important biological factors. Here, we estimate the robustness of a seed dispersal network from a grassland-forest mosaic in southern Brazil, simulating distinct scenarios of woody plant species extinction, including scenarios where species are eliminated based on their evolutionary and functional distinctiveness. Our results suggest that the network is more robust when species are eliminated based on their evolutionary uniqueness, followed by random extinctions, the extinction of the most specialist species, functional distinctiveness and, at last, when the most generalist species are sequentially eliminated. Our results provide important information for grassland-forest mosaic management, as they indicate that loss of generalist species and functional diversity makes the system more likely to collapse.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores (PGS) are estimated scores representing the genetic tendency of an individual for a disease or trait and have become an indispensible tool in a variety of analyses. Typically they are linear combination of the genotypes of a large number of SNPs, with the weights calculated from an external source, such as summary statistics from large meta-analyses. Recently cohorts with genetic data have become very large, such that it would be a waste if the raw data were not made use of in constructing PGS. Making use of raw data in calculating PGS, however, presents us with problems of overfitting. Here we discuss the essence of overfitting as applied in PGS calculations and highlight the difference between overfitting due to the overlap between the target and the discovery data (OTD), and overfitting due to the overlap between the target the the validation data (OTV). We propose two methods -- cross prediction and split validation -- to overcome OTD and OTV respectively. Using these two methods, PGS can be calculated using raw data without overfitting. We show that PGSs thus calculated have better predictive power than those using summary statistics alone for six phenotypes in the UK Biobank data.",

    "abstract": "Humans typically make near-optimal sensorimotor judgments but show systematic biases when making more cognitive judgments. Here we test the hypothesis that, while humans are sensitive to the noise present during early sensory processing, the \\\"optimality gap\\\" arises because they are blind to noise introduced by later cognitive integration of variable or discordant pieces of information. In six psychophysical experiments, human observers judged the average orientation of an array of contrast gratings. We varied the stimulus contrast (encoding noise) and orientation variability (integration noise) of the array. Participants adapted near-optimally to changes in encoding noise, but, under increased integration noise, displayed a range of suboptimal behaviours: they ignored stimulus base rates, reported excessive confidence in their choices, and refrained from opting out of objectively difficult trials. These overconfident behaviours were captured by a Bayesian model which is blind to integration noise. Our study provides a computationally grounded explanation of suboptimal cognitive inferences.",

    "abstract": "The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) provides a framework to predict how habitat modifications related to the distribution of resources over patches should impact the realized fitness of individuals and their optimal rate of movement (or patch residence times) across the habitat. Most MVT theory has focused on the consequences of changing the shape of the gain functions in some patches, describing for instance patch enrichment. However an alternative form of habitat modification is habitat conversion, whereby patches are converted from one existing type to another (e.g. closed habitat to open habitat). In such a case the set of gain functions existing in the habitat does not change, only their relative frequencies does. This has received comparatively very little attention in the context of the MVT. Here we analyze mathematically the consequences of habitat conversion under the MVT. We study how realized fitness and the average rate of movement should respond to changes in the frequency distribution of patch-types, and how they should covary. We further compare the response of optimal and non-plastic foragers. We find that the initial pattern of patch-exploitation in a habitat, characterized by the regression slope of patch yields over residence times, can help predict the qualitative responses of fitness and movement rate following habitat conversion. We also find that for some habitat conversion patterns, optimal and non-plastic foragers exhibit qualitatively different responses, and that adaptive foragers can have opposite responses in the early and late phases following habitat conversion. We suggest taking into account behavioral responses may help better understand the ecological consequences of habitat conversion.",

    "abstract": "Because biodiversity is multidimensional and scale-dependent, it is challenging to estimate its change. However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analyzed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity--species richness--was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.\\n\\nStatement of AuthorshipJC and BM conceived the study and the overall approach, and all authors participated in multiple working group meetings to develop and refine the approach.

    "abstract": "RNA interference was first described in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Ever since, several new endogenous small RNA pathways have been described and characterized to different degrees. Much like plants, but unlike Drosophila and mammals, worms have RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRPs) that directly synthesize small RNAs using other transcripts as a template. The very prominent secondary small interfering RNAs, also called 22G-RNAs, produced by the RdRPs RRF-1 and EGO-1 in C. elegans, maintain the 5 triphosphate group, stemming from RdRP activity, also after loading into an Argonaute protein. This creates a technical issue, since 5PPP groups decrease cloning efficiency for small RNA sequencing. To increase cloning efficiency of these small RNA species, a common practice in the field is the treatment of RNA samples, prior to library preparation, with Tobacco Acid pyrophosphatase (TAP). Recently, TAP production and supply was discontinued, so an alternative must be devised. We turned to RNA 5 pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH), a commercially available pyrophosphatase isolated from E. coli. Here we directly compare TAP and RppH in their use for small RNA library preparation. We show that RppH-treated samples faithfully recapitulate TAP-treated samples. Specifically, there is enrichment for 22G-RNAs and mapped small RNA reads show no small RNA transcriptome-wide differences between RppH and TAP treatment. We propose that RppH can be used as a small RNA pyrophosphatase to enrich for triphosphorylated small RNA species and show that RppH- and TAP-derived datasets can be used in direct comparison.",

    "abstract": "Signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses involves the activity of ionotropic glutamate receptors, including the AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptor. Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy have brought a slew of full-length structures of AMPA receptors, on their own and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures illustrate a wide range of conformations, indicating that individual domains might undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, resulting in an open, \\\"relaxed\\\" extracellular layer. Here, we used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations found in functional AMPA receptors both in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. Our data indicate that AMPA receptors have considerable conformational freedom and can get trapped in stable, relaxed conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Thus, under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of Stargazin dominate, AMPA receptors are unlikely to adopt very relaxed conformations during gating.",

Additionally, manual scoring often omits information on SWD confidence/intensity which may be important for the investigation of mechanistic-based research questions. Our objective is to develop an automated method for the detection of SWDs in a mouse model of absence epilepsy that is focused on the characteristics of human scoring of pre-selected events to establish a confidence-based, continuous-valued scoring.\\n\\nMethodsWe develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm for the automated detection of SWDs in the {gamma}2R43Q mouse model of absence epilepsy. The algorithm first identifies putative SWD events using frequency- and amplitude-based peak detection. Four humans scored a set of 2500 putative events identified by the algorithm. Then, using predictors calculated from the wavelet transform of each event and the labels from human scoring, we trained a SVM to classify (SWD/nonSWD) and assign confidence scores to each event identified from 60 24-hour EEG records. We provide a detailed assessment of intra- and inter-rater scoring that demonstrates advantages of automated scoring.\\n\\nResultsThe algorithm scored SWDs along a continuum that is highly correlated with human confidence and that allows us to more effectively characterize ambiguous events. We demonstrate that events along our scoring continuum are temporally and proportionately correlated with abrupt changes in spectral power bands relevant to normal behavioral states including sleep.\\n\\nSignificanceWhile there are automated and semi-automated methods for the detection of SWDs in humans and rats, we contribute to the need for continued development of SWD detection in mice.

    "abstract": "In color vision, the quantitative rules for mixing lights to make a target color are well understood. By contrast, the rules for mixing odorants to make a target odor remain elusive. A solution to this problem in vision relied on characterizing receptor responses to different wavelengths of light and subsequently relating these responses to perception. In olfaction, experimentally measuring receptor responses to a representative set of complex mixtures is intractable due to the vast number of possibilities. To meet this challenge, we develop a biophysical model that predicts mammalian receptor responses to complex mixtures using responses to single odorants. The dominant nonlinearity in our model is competitive binding (CB): only one odorant molecule can attach to a receptor binding site at a time. This simple framework predicts receptor responses to mixtures of up to twelve monomolecular odorants to within 15% of experimental observations and provides a powerful method for leveraging limited experimental data. Simple extensions of our model describe phenomena such as synergy, overshadowing, and inhibition. We demonstrate that the presence of such interactions can be identified via systematic deviations from the competitive binding model.",

Here we investigate group size effects in the evolutionary dynamics of games in which individuals choose whether to cooperate or defect and payoffs do not depend directly on the size of the group. We find that increasing the group size decreases the proportion of cooperators at both stable and unstable rest points of the replicator dynamics. This implies that larger group sizes can have negative effects (by reducing the amount of cooperation at stable polymorphisms) and positive effects (by enlarging the basin of attraction of more cooperative outcomes) on the evolution of cooperation. These two effects can be simultaneously present in games whose evolutionary dynamics feature both stable and unstable rest points, such as public goods games with participation thresholds. Our theory recovers and generalizes previous results and is applicable to a broad variety of social interactions that have been studied in the literature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFunctional annotation of livestock genomes is a critical step to decipher the genotype-to-phenotype relationship underlying complex traits. As part of the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) action, the FR-AgENCODE project (http://www.fragencode.org) aimed to profile the landscape of transcription (RNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and conformation (Hi-C) in four livestock species representing ruminants (cattle, goat), monogastrics (pig) and birds (chicken), using three target samples related to metabolism (liver) and immunity (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells).\\n\\nResultsRNA-seq assays considerably extended the available catalog of annotated transcripts and identified differentially expressed genes with unknown function, including new syntenic lncRNAs. ATAC-seq highlighted an enrichment for transcription factor binding sites in differentially accessible regions of the chromatin. Comparative analyses revealed a core set of conserved regulatory regions across species. Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and epigenetic A/B compartments annotated from Hi-C data were consistent with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Multi-species comparisons showed that conserved TAD boundaries had stronger insulation properties than species-specific ones and that the genomic distribution of orthologous genes in A/B compartments was significantly conserved across species.\\n\\nConclusionsWe report the first multi-species and multi-assay genome annotation results obtained by a FAANG project. Beyond the generation of reference annotations and the confirmation of previous findings on model animals, the integrative analysis of data from multiple assays and species sheds a new light on the multi-scale selective pressure shaping genome organization from birds to mammals. Overall, these results emphasize the value of FAANG for research on domesticated animals and reinforces the importance of future meta-analyses of the reference datasets being generated by this community on different species.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria swim in liquid environments by rotating one or several flagella. The long external filament of the flagellum is connected to a membrane-embedded basal-body by a flexible universal joint, the hook, which allows the transmission of motor torque to the filament. The length of the hook is controlled on a nanometer-scale by a sophisticated molecular ruler mechanism. However, why its length is stringently controlled has remained elusive. We engineered and studied a diverse set of hook-length variants of Salmonella enterica. Measurements of plate-assay motility, single-cell swimming speed and directional persistence in quasi 2D and population-averaged swimming speed and body angular velocity in 3D revealed that the motility performance is optimal around the wild type hook-length. We conclude that too short hooks may be too stiff to function as a junction and too long hooks may buckle and create instability in the flagellar bundle. Accordingly, peritrichously flagellated bacteria move most efficiently as the distance travelled per body rotation is maximal and body wobbling is minimized. Thus, our results suggest that the molecular ruler mechanism evolved to control flagellar hook growth to the optimal length consistent with efficient bundle formation. The hook-length control mechanism is therefore a prime example of how bacteria evolved elegant, but robust mechanisms to maximize their fitness under specific environmental constraints.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMany bacteria use flagella for directed movement in liquid environments. The flexible hook connects the membrane-embedded basal-body of the flagellum to the long, external filament. Flagellar function relies on self-assembly processes that define or self-limit the lengths of major parts. The length of the hook is precisely controlled on a nanometer-scale by a molecular ruler mechanism. However, the physiological benefit of tight hook-length control remains unclear. Here, we show that the molecular ruler mechanism evolved to control the optimal length of the flagellar hook, which is consistent with efficient motility performance. These results highlight the evolutionary forces that enable flagellated bacteria to optimize their fitness in diverse environments and might have important implications for the design of swimming micro-robots.",

    "abstract": "TRPV5 is a transient receptor potential channel involved in calcium reabsorption. Here we investigate the interaction of two endogenous modulators with TRPV5. Both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and calmodulin (CaM) have been shown to directly bind to TRPV5 and activate or inactivate the channel, respectively. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined TRPV5 structures in the presence of dioctanoyl PI(4,5)P2 and CaM. The PI(4,5)P2 structure revealed a novel binding site between the N-linker, S4-S5 linker and S6 helix of TRPV5. These interactions with PI(4,5)P2 induce conformational rearrangements in the lower gate, opening the channel. The CaM structure revealed two TRPV5 C-terminal peptides anchoring a single CaM molecule and that calcium inhibition is mediated through a cation-{pi} interaction between Lys116 on the C-lobe of calcium-activated CaM and Trp583 at the intracellular gate of TRPV5. Overall, this investigation provides insight into the endogenous modulation of TRPV5, which has the potential to guide drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging biomarkers show promise for improving precision diagnosis and prognosis after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but none has yet been adopted in routine clinical practice. Biophysical modeling of multishell diffusion MRI, using the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) framework, may improve upon conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in revealing subtle patterns of underlying white matter microstructural pathology, such as diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and neuroinflammation, that are important for detecting mTBI and determining patient outcome. With a cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we assessed structural MRI, DTI and NODDI in 40 mTBI patients at 2 weeks and 6 months after injury and 14 matched control participants with orthopedic trauma but not suffering from mTBI at 2 weeks. Self-reported and performance-based cognitive measures assessing postconcussive symptoms, memory, executive functions and processing speed were investigated in post-acute and chronic phase after injury for the mTBI subjects. Machine learning analysis was used to identify mTBI patients with the best neuropsychological improvement over time and relate this outcome to DTI and NODDI biomarkers. In the cross-sectional comparison with the trauma control group at 2 weeks post-injury, mTBI patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) on DTI mainly in anterior tracts that corresponded to white matter regions of elevated free water fraction (FISO) on NODDI, signifying vasogenic edema. Patients showed decreases from 2 weeks to 6 months in white matter neurite density on NODDI, predominantly in posterior tracts. No significant longitudinal changes in DTI metrics were observed. The machine learning analysis divided the mTBI patients into two groups based on their recovery. Voxel-wise group comparison revealed associations between white matter orientation dispersion index (ODI) and FISO with degree and trajectory of improvement within the mTBI group. In conclusion, white matter FA and MD alterations early after mTBI might reflect vasogenic edema, as shown by elevated free water on NODDI. Longer-term declines in neurite density on NODDI suggest progressive axonal degeneration due to DAI, especially in tracts known to be integral to the structural connectome. Overall, these results show that the NODDI parameters appear to be more sensitive to longitudinal changes than DTI metrics. Thus, NODDI merits further study in larger cohorts for mTBI diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing, spontaneous pain is characteristic of inflammatory joint pain and reduces an individuals quality of life. To understand the neural basis of inflammatory joint pain, we made a unilateral knee injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) in mice, which reduced their natural digging behavior. We hypothesized that sensitization of knee-innervating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons underlies this altered behavior. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophysiological recordings on retrograde labelled knee-innervating primary DRG neuron cultures and measured their responses to a number of electrical and chemical stimuli. We found that 24-hours after CFA-induced knee inflammation, knee neurons show a decreased action potential generation threshold, as well as increased GABA and capsaicin sensitivity, but have unaltered acid sensitivity. The inflammation-induced sensitization of knee neurons persisted for 24-hours in culture, but was not observed after 48-hours in culture. Through immunohistochemistry, we showed that the increased knee neuron capsaicin sensitivity correlated with enhanced expression of the capsaicin receptor, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in knee-innervating neurons of the CFA-injected side. We also observed an increase in the co-expression of TRPV1 with tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), which is the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), suggesting that NGF partially induces the increased TRPV1 expression. Lastly, we found that systemic administration of the TRPV1 antagonist A-425619 reversed the decrease in digging behavior induced by CFA injection, further confirming the role of TRPV1, expressed by knee neurons, in acute inflammatory joint pain.",

We tested this approach by targeting omega-1 ({omega}1) of Schistosoma mansoni as a proof of principle. This secreted ribonuclease is crucial for Th2 priming and granuloma formation, providing informative immuno-pathological readouts for programmed genome editing. Schistosome eggs were either exposed to Cas9 complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) complementary to exon 6 of {omega}1 by electroporation or transduced with pseudotyped lentivirus encoding Cas9 and the sgRNA. Some eggs were also transduced with a single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide donor transgene that encoded six stop codons, flanked by 50 nt-long 5-and 3-microhomology arms matching the predicted Cas9-catalyzed double stranded break (DSB) within {omega}1.

Whereas lysates of wild type eggs polarized Th2 cytokine responses including IL-4 and IL-5 in human macrophage/T cell co-cultures, diminished levels of the cytokines followed the exposure to lysates of {omega}1-mutated schistosome eggs. Following injection of schistosome eggs into the tail vein of mice, the volume of pulmonary granulomas surrounding {omega}1-mutated eggs was 18-fold smaller than wild type eggs. Programmed genome editing was active in schistosomes, Cas9-catalyzed chromosomal breakage was repaired by homology directed repair and/or non-homologous end joining, and mutation of {omega}1 impeded the capacity of schistosome eggs both to drive Th2 polarization and to provoke formation of pulmonary circumoval granulomas. Knock-out of {omega}1 and the impaired immunological phenotype showcase the novel application of programmed gene editing in and functional genomics for schistosomes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe process of manually marking up epileptic spikes for simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) analysis in epilepsy studies is a tedious and subjective task for a human expert. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether automatic EEG spike detection can facilitate EEG-rsfMRI analysis, and to assess its potential as a clinical tool in epilepsy.\\n\\nMethodsWe implemented a fast algorithm for detection of uniform interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in one-hour scalp EEG recordings of 19 refractory focal epilepsy datasets (from 16 patients) who underwent a simultaneous EEG-rsfMRI recording. Our method was based on matched filtering of an IED template (derived from human markup) used to automatically detect other  similar EEG events. We comprehensively compared simultaneous EEG-rsfMRI results between automatic IED detection and standard analysis with human EEG markup only.\\n\\nResultsIn contrast to human markup, automatic IED detection takes a much shorter time to detect IEDs and export an output text file containing spike timings. In 13/19 focal epilepsy cases, statistical EEG-rsfMRI maps based on automatic spike detection method were comparable with human markup, and in 6/19 focal epilepsy cases it revealed additional brain regions not seen with human EEG markup. Additional events detected by our automated method independently revealed similar patterns of activation to a human markup. Overall, automatic IED detection provides greater statistical power in EEG-rsfMRI analysis compared to human markup in a short timeframe.\\n\\nConclusionsAutomatic spike detection is a simple and fast method that can reproduce comparable and, in some cases, even superior results compared to the common practice of manual EEG markup in EEG-rsfMRI analysis of epilepsy.\\n\\nSignificanceOur study shows that IED detection algorithms can be effectively used in epilepsy clinical settings. This work further helps in translating EEG-rsfMRI research into a fast, reliable and easy-to-use clinical tool for epileptologists. Our IED detection approach will be publicly available as a MATLAB package at: https://github.com/omidvarnia/Automatic_focal_spike_detection.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAutomatic spike detection increases the number of detected uniform epileptic interictal discharges and enhances statistical power of EEG-rsfMRI inter-subject variability maps,\\nC_LIO_LIAutomatic spike detection can identify additional activated brain regions with presumed epileptogenic focus not seen in standard analysis based on human markup,\\nC_LIO_LIAutomatic spike detection can shorten the IED identification process.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Short-term depression is a low pass filter of synaptic information that reduces and flattens synaptic information transfer at high presynaptic firing frequencies. This view questions the relevance of spontaneous high firing rates in some networks. In the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, spontaneously active neurons in the globus pallidus (GP) form depressing inhibitory synapses in the basal ganglia output nuclei. Using numerical modeling and whole-cell recordings from single entopeduncular nucleus (EP) neurons in rat brain slices we investigated the contribution of the different firing rates of GP neurons to information transmission in the indirect pathway. Wholecell recordings showed significant variability in steady-state depression which decreased as stimulation frequency increased. Modeling predicted that this variability would translate into different postsynaptic noise levels during constitutive presynaptic activity. Our simulations further predicted that individual GP-EP synapses mediate gain control. However, when we consider integration of multiple inputs, the large range of GP firing rates would enable different modes of information transmission in which the magnitude and temporal features of postsynaptic modulation would change as a function of present and past firing rates of GP neurons. Finally, we predict that changes in dopamine levels can shift the action of GP neurons from rate coding to gain modulation. Our results thus demonstrate how short-term synaptic depression shapes information transmission in the basal ganglia in particular and via GABAergic synapses in general.\\n\\nSignificant statementSynapses displaying short-term depression are low-pass filters of synaptic input. Consequently, when presynaptic firing is high, little information passes to the postsynaptic neuron. However, many neurons fire at relatively high frequencies all the time. Are their synapses constantly silenced by depression? We tested this apparent contradiction in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, where neurons from the globus pallidus (GP) form constitutively active depressing synapses on basal ganglia output. We hypothesized that the different rates of ongoing activity underlie different modes of action for GP neurons. We show that the synaptic and structural properties of the indirect pathway map GP baseline frequencies to different postsynaptic signals, thus demonstrating how short-term synaptic depression shapes information transmission in the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessel formation by angiogenesis is critical for tissue development, homeostasis and repair, and is frequently dysregulated in disease[1-3]. Angiogenesis is triggered by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2/3 (VEGFR) signalling, which induces motile endothelial cell (ECs) tip identity[4,5]. Tip cells lead new branching vessels, but also coordinate collective EC movement by repressing tip identity in adjacent ECs via Delta-Like 4 (DLL4)-Notch-mediated down-regulation of VEGFR activity[6-13]. Hence, angiogenesis is driven by lateral inhibition-mediated competition of ECs for migratory status. Recent work reveals that temporal modulation of this DLL4-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition circuit fundamentally shapes both normal and pathological angiogenesis[14-17]. However, the core regulatory network defining the timing and dynamics of EC decision-making is unclear. Here, by integrating computational modeling with in-vivo experimentation, we uncover a unique ultrasensitive switch that temporally defines EC lateral inhibition and ultimately determines the timing, magnitude and robustness of angiogenic responses. We reveal that positive-feedback to Vegfr via the atypical tetraspanin, tm4sf18, amplifies Vegfr activity and expedites EC decision-making in-vivo. Moreover, this Tm4sf18-mediated positive-feedback confers robustness to angiogenesis against changeable environmental conditions by invoking bistable-like behavior. Consequently, mutation of tm4sf18 in zebrafish delays motile EC selection, generates hypoplastic vessels, sensitizes ECs to fluctuations in pro-angiogenic signal and disrupts angiogenesis. We propose that positive-feedback transforms the normally protracted process of lateral inhibition into a quick, adaptive and robust decision-making mechanism, suggestive of a general framework for temporal modulation of cell fate specification in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus has been highly implicated in depression symptoms. Recent findings suggest that the expression and susceptibility of depression symptoms are related to the enhanced functioning of the hippocampus. We reasoned that hippocampal engrams, which represent ensembles of neurons with increased activity after memory formation, could underlie some contributions of the hippocampus to depression symptoms. Using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model, we examined social defeat-related hippocampal engrams in mice that are either susceptible or resilient to the stressor. TetTag mice were used to label social defeat-related hippocampal ensembles by LacZ. Engram cells correspond to ensembles that were reactivated by the same stressor.\\n\\nCompared to resilient and non-stressed control mice, we found that in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions, susceptible mice exhibited a higher reactivation of social defeat-related LacZ-labeled cells (i.e. engram cells). The density of CA1 engram cells correlated with the level of social avoidance. Using DREADD to reactivate social defeat-related but not neutral contextual stimuli-related CA1 engram cells decreased social interaction. Increased engram cells in susceptible mice were region specific and could not be found in the dentate gyrus. Susceptible mice exhibited more negative stimuli-, but not neutral stimuli-, related CA1 engram cells than resilient mice in the dorsal hippocampus. Finally, chronic, but not a short and subthreshold, social defeat protocol was necessary to increase CA1 engram cell density. Together, our findings reveal that the susceptibility to CSDS is regulated by hippocampal CA1 engrams for negative memory. Hippocampal engrams for negative memory may underlie the vulnerability and expression of cognitive symptoms in depression.\\n\\nSignificance statementWe provided evidence that negative memory hippocampal engrams contribute to the susceptibility to developing depression-related behavior after chronic social defeat stress. The activation of positive memory engrams have been shown to alleviate depression-related behaviors, while our findings reveal the pathological roles of negative memory engrams that could lead to those behaviors. Increased negative memory engrams could be a downstream effect of the reported high hippocampal activity in animal models and patients with depression. Unlike affective symptoms, we know much less about the cellular mechanisms of the cognitive symptoms of depression. Given the crucial roles of hippocampal engrams in memory formation, enhanced reactivation of negative memory engrams could be an important cellular mechanism that underlies the cognitive symptoms of depression.",

    "abstract": "The six C. elegans vulval precursor cells (VPCs) are induced to form the 30-30-20-{Gamma}-20-3{degrees} pattern of cell fates with high fidelity. In response to EGF signal, the LET-60/Ras-LIN-45/Raf-MEK-2/MEK-MPK-1/ERK canonical MAP kinase cascade is necessary to induce 1{degrees} fate and synthesis of DSL ligands. In turn, LIN-12/Notch signal is necessary to induce neighboring cells to become 2{degrees}. We previously showed that, in response to lower dose of EGF signal, the modulatory LET-60/Ras-RGL-1/RalGEF-RAL-1/Ral signal promotes 2{degrees} fate in support of LIN-12. In this study we identify two key differences between RGL-1 and RAL-1 functions. First, deletion of RGL-1 confers no overt developmental defects, while previous studies showed RAL-1 to be essential for viability and fertility. From this observation we hypothesize that the developmentally essential functions of RAL-1 are independent of upstream activation. Second, RGL-1 plays opposing and genetically separable roles in VPC fate patterning. RGL-1 promotes 2{degrees} fate via canonical GEF-dependent activation of RAL-1 and 1{degrees} fate via a non-canonical GEF-independent activity. Our genetic epistasis experiments are consistent with RGL-1 functioning in the modulatory 1{degrees}-promoting AGE-1/PI3-Kinase-PDK-1-AKT-1 cascade. Additionally, animals without RGL-1 experience 15-fold higher rates of VPC patterning errors compared to the wild type. Yet VPC patterning in RGL-1 deletion mutants is not more sensitive to environmental perturbations. We propose that RGL-1 functions as a \\\"Balanced Switch\\\" that orchestrates opposing 1{degrees}- and 2{degrees}-promoting modulatory cascades to decrease inappropriate fate decisions. We speculate that such switches are broadly conserved but mostly masked by paralog redundancy or essential genes.",

    "abstract": "Cephalopod mollusks evolved numerous anatomical innovations, including specialized arms and tentacles, but little is known about the developmental mechanisms underlying the evolution of cephalopod limbs. Here we show that all three axes of cuttlefish limbs are patterned by the same signaling networks that act in vertebrates and arthropods, although they evolved limbs independently. In cuttlefish limb buds, Hedgehog is expressed anteriorly. Posterior transplantation of Hedgehog-expressing cells induced mirror-image limb duplications. Bmp and Wnt signaling, which establishes dorsoventral polarity in vertebrate and arthropod limbs, is similarly polarized in cuttlefish. Inhibition of the dorsal Bmp signal caused ectopic expression of Notum, a ventral sucker field marker, and development of ectopic suckers. Cuttlefish limbs also show proximodistally regionalized expression of Htx, Exd, Dll, Dac, Sp8/9, and Wnt genes, which delineate arm and tentacle sucker fields. These results suggest that cephalopod limbs evolved by parallel activation of an ancient genetic program for appendage development that was present in the bilaterian common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Root systems are branched networks that develop from simple growth properties of their individual roots. Yet a mature maize root system has many thousands of roots that each interact with soil structures, water and nutrient patches, and microbial ecologies in the micro-environments surrounding each root tip. Although the plasticity of root growth to these and other environmental factors is well known, how the many local processes contribute over time to global features of root system architecture is hardly understood. We employ an automated 3D root imaging pipeline to capture the growth of maize roots every four hours throughout seven days of seedling development. We model the contrasting architectures of two maize inbred genotypes and their hybrid to derive key parameters that distinguish complex growth patterns as a function of time. The statistical characteristics of local root growth defined the global system properties despite a large range of trait values. \\\"Computational dissection\\\" of a single root from each root system identified differences in the size of the root branching zone and lateral branching densities, but not radial patterns, that drove the contrasting root architectures from seedling to maturity. X-ray imaging of mature field-grown root crowns showed that seedling growth trajectories persisted throughout development and could predict eventual architectures, suggesting a strong genetic basis. The work connects individual and systemwide scales of root growth dynamics, providing the means for a function-valued approach to understanding the genetic and genetic x environment conditioning of root growth that will enable breeding for enhanced root traits.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen and where roots grow determines their ability to capture short-lived and patchy water and nutrient resources to support the aboveground organs of the plant. Roots have no known long-distance external sensing mechanisms, but form branched networks that blindly explore the soil and respond to encountered local stimuli. How global architectures form from the many thousands of these local responses, and how they are controlled genetically are major open questions. Here we quantify differences in local root growth patterns of two inbred genotypes of maize that control contrasting systemwide properties. Measurements at the seedling stage were highly correlated with the complex architectures of mature root systems, paving the way for the development of crops with greater resource uptake capacity.",

One such group is the Jahai, who commonly used dogs for hunting, but have recently started to move away from traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle, resulting in the dogs to multiply in numbers and roam as strays in the village. The community is now at risk of dog associated zoonotic infections. Studies have shown that health education and promotion can improve knowledge, attitude and practices of dog associated infections. However most of the studies were done among dog owners and in communities with fairly good education levels. A holistic approach using One Health concept was used to instil good knowledge, attitude and practices of the Jahai community concerning dog associated zoonotic infections. This non-experimental pre and post-test intervention study was conducted among Jahai villagers aged 12 years and above living in a village located in the Belum forest in Malaysia. The findings of this study showed the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary team using One Health concept to successfully improve knowledge, attitude and practices related to dog associated zoonotic infections.",

Here we introduce a strategy for precisely measuring the Gibbs free energy of such interactions in living cells. This strategy centers on the measurement and modeling of \\\"allelic manifolds\\\", a multidimensional generalization of the classical genetics concept of allelic series. Allelic manifolds are measured using reporter assays performed on strategically designed cis-regulatory sequences. Quantitative biophysical models are then fit to the resulting data. We used this strategy to study regulation by two Escherichia coli TFs, CRP and {sigma}70 RNA polymerase. Doing so, we consistently obtained energetic measurements precise to ~ 0.1 kcal/mol. We also obtained multiple results that deviate from the prior literature. Our strategy is compatible with massively parallel reporter assays in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and should therefore be highly scalable and broadly applicable.",

The molecular programs that differentiate ipRGCs from other ganglion cells and ipRGC subtypes from one another remain elusive. Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiles of early postnatal and adult mouse ipRGCs purified from two lines of reporter mice marking different sets of ipRGC subtypes. We find dozens of novel genes highly enriched in ipRGCs. We reveal that Rasgrp1 and Tbx20 are selectively expressed in subsets of ipRGCs, though these molecularly defined groups imperfectly match established ipRGC subtypes. We demonstrate that the ipRGCs regulating circadian photoentrainment are unexpectedly diverse at the molecular level. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in gene expression patterns across mammalian ipRGC subtypes.",

Although many computational and neural studies have extended our knowledge of the impact of depression on RL, most focus on habitual control (model-free RL), yielding a relatively poor understanding of goal-directed control (model-based RL) and arbitration control to find a balance between the two. We investigate the effects of depression on goal-directed and habitual control in the prefrontal-striatal circuitry. We find that depression is associated with attenuated state and reward prediction error representation in the insula and caudate, a disruption of arbitration control in the predominantly inferior lateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex, and suboptimal value-action conversion. These findings fully characterize how depression influences different levels of RL, challenging previous conflicting views that depression simply influences either habitual or goal-directed control.

Here, we reassembled Oropetium, and anchored the genome into ten chromosomes using Hi-C based chromatin interactions. A combination of high-resolution RNAseq data and homology-based gene prediction identified thousands of new, conserved gene models that were absent from the V1 assembly. This includes thousands of new genes with high expression across a desiccation timecourse. The sorghum and Oropetium genomes have a surprising degree of chromosome-level collinearity, and several chromosome pairs have near perfect synteny. Other chromosomes are collinear in the gene rich chromosome arms but have experienced pericentric translocations. Together, these resources will be useful for the grass comparative genomic community and further establish Oropetium as a model resurrection plant.",

Direct quantitation of NAD+- and NADH-capped RNA demonstrates remarkably high levels of capping in vivo: up to ~60% NAD+ and NADH capping of yeast mitochondrial transcripts, and up to ~10% NAD+ capping of human mitochondrial transcripts. The capping efficiency is determined by promoter sequence at, and upstream of, the transcription start site and, in yeast and human cells, by intracellular NAD+ and NADH levels.

Plant discovery in China is an immanent part of that journey. To understand the patterns of plant discoveries in China and detect which taxa and areas harbor most numbers of undiscovered species, we analyzed the discovery times of 31093 vascular plant species described in Flora of China. We found that species with larger range size and distributed in northeastern part of China have a higher discovery probability. Species distributed on the coast were discovered earlier than inland species. Trees and shrubs of seed plants have the highest discovery probability and ferns have the lowest discovery probability. Herbs hold the largest number of undiscovered species in China. Most undiscovered species are found in southwest China, where three global biodiversity hotspots locate. Spatial patterns of mean discovery year and inventory completeness are mainly driven by the total number of species and human population density in an area and whether the area is coastal or not. Our results showed that socio-economic factors dictate the discovery patterns of vascular plants in China. Undiscovered species are mostly narrow-ranged, inconspicuous endemic such as herbs, which are prone to extinctions and locate in biodiversity hotspots in southwest China. We suggest that the future effort on plant discovery in China be prioritized in southwest China.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in targeted drugs and immunotherapy, cancer remains \\\"the emperor of all maladies\\\" due to inevitable emergence of resistance. Drug resistance is thought to be driven by mutations and/or dynamic plasticity that deregulate pathway activities and regulatory programs of a highly heterogeneous tumour. In this study, we propose a modelling framework to simulate population dynamics of heterogeneous tumour cells with reversible drug resistance. Drug sensitivity of a tumour cell is determined by its internal states, which are demarcated by coordinated activities of multiple interconnected oncogenic pathways. Transitions between cellular states depend on the effects of targeted drugs and regulatory relations between the pathways. Under this framework, we build a simple model to capture drug resistance characteristics of BRAF-mutant melanoma, where two cell states are described by two mutually inhibitory - main and alternative - pathways. We assume that cells with an activated main pathway are proliferative yet sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor, and cells with an activated alternative pathway are quiescent but resistant to the drug. We describe a dynamical process of tumour growth under various drug regimens using the explicit solution of mean-field equations. Based on these solutions, we compare efficacy of three treatment strategies: static treatments with continuous and constant dosages, periodic treatments with regular intermittent phases and drug holidays, and treatments derived from optimal control theory (OCT). Based on these analysis, periodic treatments outperform static treatments with a considerable margin, while treatments based on OCT outperform the best periodic treatment. Our results provide insights regarding optimal cancer treatment modalities for heterogeneous tumours, and may guide the development of optimal therapeutic strategies to circumvent drug resistance and due to tumour plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Threespine sticklebacks adapted to freshwater environments all over the Northern Hemisphere. This adaptation involved parallel recruitment of freshwater alleles in clusters of closely linked sites, or divergence islands (DIs). However, it is unclear to what extent the DIs involved in adaptation and the alleles within them coincide between populations adapting to similar environments. Here, we examine 10 freshwater populations of similar ages from the White Sea basin, and study the repeatability of patterns of adaptation in them. Overall, the 65 detected DIs tend to reside in regions of low recombination, underlining the role of reduced recombination in their establishment. Moreover, the DIs are clustered in the genome to the extent that is not explainable by the recombination rate alone, consistent with the divergence hitchhiking model. 21 out of the 65 DIs are universal; i.e., the frequency of freshwater alleles in them is increased in all analyzed populations. Universal DIs tend to have longer core region shared between populations, and the divergence between the marine and the freshwater haplotypes in them is higher, implying that they are older, also consistently with divergence hitchhiking. Within most DIs, the same set of sites distinguished the marine and the freshwater haplotypes in all populations; however, in some of the DIs, the genetic architecture of the freshwater haplotype differed between populations, suggesting that they could have been established by soft selective sweeps.",

    "abstract": "There has been keen interest in measuring in vivo GABA. However, GABA signal is low and typically measured using techniques vulnerable to the confounding effects of in-scanner head movement. This issue is particularly problematic for clinical studies since it may lead to Type I or II error in testing for group differences. While solutions to mitigate the effects of movement have been proposed, fundamental and largely unexamined issues are the nature and scale of this effect. We developed a method to quantify and characterize head movement during GABA spectroscopy and found that two parameters of movement, displacement and instantaneous movement, were inversely correlated with and accounted for 12.1% and 20.2% variance of GABA estimates respectively. We conclude that head movement can significantly affect GABA measurements and the application of methods to account for movement may improve of GABA measurement accuracy and the detection of true group differences in clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Covalent and non-covalent nucleoprotein complexes impede replication fork progression and thereby threaten genome integrity. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we previously showed that when a replication fork encounters a covalent DNA-protein cross-link (DPC) on the leading strand template, the DPC is degraded to a short peptide, allowing its bypass by translesion synthesis polymerases. Strikingly, we show here that when DPC proteolysis is blocked, the replicative DNA helicase (CMG), which travels on the leading strand template, still bypasses the intact DPC. The DNA helicase RTEL1 facilitates bypass, apparently by translocating along the lagging strand template and generating single-stranded DNA downstream of the DPC. Remarkably, RTEL1 is required for efficient DPC proteolysis, suggesting that CMG bypass of a DPC normally precedes its proteolysis. RTEL1 also promotes fork progression past non-covalent protein-DNA complexes. Our data suggest a unified model for the replisomes response to nucleoprotein barriers.",

Especially in life sciences, they have become increasingly important to handle the growing datasets collected by the scientific community. Meanwhile, algorithms improve in performance, but also gain complexity, and tend to neglect interpretability and comprehensiveness of the resulting models.\\n\\nResultsGeneralized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) is a supervised, prototype-based machine learning method and provides comprehensive visualization capabilities not present in other classifiers which allow for a fine-grained interpretation of the data. In contrast to commonly used machine learning strategies, GMLVQ is well-suited for imbalanced classification problems which are frequent in life sciences. We present a Weka plug-in implementing GMLVQ. The feasibility of GMLVQ is demonstrated on a dataset of Early Folding Residues (EFR) that have been shown to initiate and guide the protein folding process. Using 27 features, an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 76.6% was achieved which is comparable to other state-of-the-art classifiers.\\n\\nConclusionsThe application on EFR prediction demonstrates how an easy interpretation of classification models can promote the comprehension of biological mechanisms. The results shed light on the special features of EFR which were reported as most influential for the classification: EFR are embedded in ordered secondary structure elements and they participate in networks of hydrophobic residues. Visualization capabilities of GMLVQ are presented as we demonstrate how to interpret the results.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether this aspect could be exploited for targeted therapy.\\n\\nMethodsA genetically engineered model was established expressing either functional or nonfunctional BAP1 and whole-genome siRNA screens were performed assessing impaired survival between the two cell lines. Cytotoxity induced by gemcitabine and hydroxyurea were assessed in a panel of BAP1-WT and BAP1-mut/del cell lines. Functional studies were carried out in BAP1 mut/del cell line reconstituted with BAP1 WT or BAP1 C91A (catalytically dead mutant) and in BAP1 WT cell line upon siRNA-mediated knock-down of BAP1.\\n\\nResultsThe whole-genome siRNA screen unexpectedly revealed 11 hits (FDR<0.05) more cytotoxic for BAP1-proficient cells. Two actionable targets, RRM1 and RRM2, were validated and their inhibition mediated by gemcitabine or hydroxyurea respectively, was more cytotoxic in BAP1-proficient cell lines. Upregulation of RRM2 upon gemcitabine and hydroxyurea was more profound in BAP1 mut/del cell lines. Increased lethality mediated by gemcitabine and hydroxyurea was observed in NCI-H2452 cells reconstituted with BAP1 WT but not with C91A mutant and upregulation of RRM2 in NCI-H2452-BAP1 WT spheroids was modest compared to control or C91A mutant. Finally, the opposite was observed after BAP1 knockdown in BAP1-proficient SPC111 cell line.\\n\\nConclusionWe found that BAP1 is involved in the regulation of RRM2 levels during replication stress.

However, the molecular mechanism by which ATF6 activation reduces the secretion of amyloidogenic proteins remains poorly defined. Here, we establish a quantitative interactomics platform with improved throughput and sensitivity to define how ATF6 activation selectively reduces secretion of a destabilized, amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain (LC) associated with Light Chain Amyloidosis (AL). We show that ATF6 activation increases the targeting of this destabilized LC to a select subset of pro-folding ER proteostasis factors that retains the amyloidogenic LC within the ER, preventing its secretion to downstream secretory environments. Our results define a molecular basis for the selective, ATF6-dependent reduction in destabilized LC secretion and highlight the advantage for targeting this endogenous UPR-associated transcription factor to reduce secretion of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins implicated in AL and related systemic amyloid diseases.",

Of oncogenic Ras effectors, RalGEF-Ral is by far the least well-understood. We use genetic analysis to identify an effector cascade downstream of C. elegans RAL-1/Ral, starting with an established Ral binding partner, Exo84 of the exocyst complex. Additionally, RAL-1 signals through GCK-2, a CNH domain-containing MAP4 kinase, and PMK-1/p38 MAP kinase cascade to promote 2{degrees} fate.

Genetic testing is also more likely informative in individuals with well-characterised variants from extensively studied European-ancestry populations. Inherited cardiomyopathies are relatively common Mendelian diseases that allow empirical calibration and assessment of this framework.\\n\\nResultsWe compared rare variants in large hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cohorts to reference populations to identify variant classes with high prior likelihoods of pathogenicity, as defined by etiological fraction (EF). Analysis of variant distribution identified regions in which variants are significantly enriched in cases and variant location was a better discriminator of pathogenicity than generic computational functional prediction algorithms. Non-truncating variant classes with an EF[&ge;]0.95, and therefore clinically actionable, were identified in 5 established HCM genes. Applying this approach leads to an estimated 14-20% increase in cases with actionable HCM variants.\\n\\nConclusionsWhen found in a patient confirmed to have disease, novel variants in some genes and regions are empirically shown to have a sufficiently high probability of pathogenicity to support a \\\"likely pathogenic\\\" classification, even without additional segregation or functional data. This could increase the yield of high confidence actionable variants, consistent with the framework and recommendations of current guidelines. The techniques outlined offer a consistent, unbiased and equitable approach to variant interpretation for Mendelian disease genetic testing.

    "abstract": "The genome of Bordetella pertussis is complex, with high GC content and many repeats, each longer than 1,000 bp. Short-read DNA sequencing is unable to resolve the structure of the genome; however, long-read sequencing offers the opportunity to produce single-contig B. pertussis assemblies using sequencing reads which are longer than the repetitive sections. We used an R9.4 MinION flow cell and barcoding to sequence five B. pertussis strains in a single sequencing run. We then trialled combinations of the many nanopore-user-community-built long-read analysis tools to establish the current optimal assembly pipeline for B. pertussis genome sequences. Our best long-read-only assemblies were produced by Canu read correction followed by assembly with Flye and polishing with Nanopolish, whilst the best hybrids (using nanopore and Illumina reads together) were produced by Canu correction followed by Unicycler. This pipeline produced closed genome sequences for four strains, revealing inter-strain genomic rearrangement. However, read mapping to the Tohama I reference genome suggests that the remaining strain contains an ultra-long duplicated region (over 100 kbp), which was not resolved by our pipeline. We have therefore demonstrated the ability to resolve the structure of several B. pertussis strains per single barcoded nanopore flow cell, but the genomes with highest complexity (e.g. very large duplicated regions) remain only partially resolved using the standard library preparation and will require an alternative library preparation method. For full strain characterisation, we recommend hybrid assembly of long and short reads together; for comparison of genome arrangement, assembly using long reads alone is sufficient.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYO_LIFinal sequence read files (fastq) for all 5 strains have been deposited in the SRA, BioProject PRJNA478201, accession numbers SAMN09500966, SAMN09500967, SAMN09500968, SAMN09500969, SAMN09500970\\nC_LIO_LIA full list of accession numbers for Illumina sequence reads is available in Table S1\\nC_LIO_LIAssembly tests, basecalled read sets and reference materials are available from figshare: https://figshare.com/projects/Resolving_the_complex_Bordetella_pertussis_genome_using_barcoded_nanopore_sequencing/31313\\nC_LIO_LIGenome sequences for B. pertussis strains UK36, UK38, UK39, UK48 and UK76 have been deposited in GenBank; accession numbers: CP031289, CP031112, CP031113, QRAX00000000, CP031114\\nC_LIO_LISource code and full commands used are available from Github: https://github.com/nataliering/Resolving-the-complex-Bordetella-pertussis-genome-using-barcoded-nanopore-sequencing\\nC_LI\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTOver the past two decades, whole genome sequencing has allowed us to understand microbial pathogenicity and evolution on an unprecedented level. However, repetitive regions, like those found throughout the B. pertussis genome, have confounded our ability to resolve complex genomes using short-read sequencing technologies alone. To produce closed B. pertussis genome sequences it is necessary to use a sequencing technology which can generate reads longer than these problematic genomic regions. Using barcoded nanopore sequencing, we show that multiple B. pertussis genomes can be resolved per flow cell. Use of our assembly pipeline to resolve further B. pertussis genomes will advance understanding of how genome-level differences affect the phenotypes of strains which appear monomorphic at nucleotide-level.\\n\\nThis work expands the recently emergent theme that even the most complex genomes can be resolved with sufficiently long sequencing reads. Additionally, we utilise a more widely accessible alternative sequencing platform to the Pacific Biosciences platform already used by large research centres such as the CDC. Our optimisation process, moreover, shows that the analysis tools favoured by the sequencing community do not necessarily produce the most accurate assemblies for all organisms; pipeline optimisation may therefore be beneficial in studies of unusually complex genomes.",

The magnetoencephalogram (MEG) of 15 healthy participants was recorded at rest and while they were performing a task involving a visual stimulus inducing strong, narrow-band gamma activity. Brain states were inferred from the tasks baseline periods and from resting-state recordings, respectively.\\n\\nOur results show how network states are related to the amplitude of stimulus-induced gamma responses. Across trials, we found an association between the amplitude of gamma responses and the brain state occurring immediately prior to stimulus presentation. Strong gamma responses followed a state characterized by prominent delta/theta oscillations in parieto-occipital regions and comparably weak alpha activity. Across subjects, the overall probability of visiting this state in the baseline period, i.e. the individual preference for this state, correlated positively with the amplitude of the trial-averaged gamma response. Remarkably, this relationship persisted when states were inferred from resting-state recordings rather than the tasks baseline.\\n\\nIn summary, both within- and across-subject variability in stimulus-induced gamma activity can in part be explained by the ongoing dynamics of whole-brain network states.

We provide a set of recommendations for study designs based on treatment, outcome, and instrument parameters, and provide our simulation software as a supplement to the paper.",

    "abstract": "The open probability of large conductance voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium (BK) channels is regulated allosterically by changes in the transmembrane voltage and intracellular concentration of divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+). The divalent cation sensors reside within the gating ring formed by eight Regulator of Conductance of Potassium (RCK) domains, two from each of the four channel subunits. Overall, the gating ring contains 12 sites that can bind Ca2+ with different affinities. Using patch-clamp fluorometry, we have shown robust changes in FRET signals within the gating ring in response to divalent ions and voltage, which do not directly track open probability. Only the conformational changes triggered through the RCK1 binding site are voltage-dependent in presence of Ca2+. Because the gating ring is outside the electric field, it must gain voltage sensitivity from coupling to the voltage-dependent channel opening, the voltage sensor or both. Here we demonstrate that alterations of voltage sensor dynamics known to shift gating currents produce a cognate shift in the gating ring voltage dependence, whereas changing BK channels relative probability of opening had little effect. These results strongly suggest that the conformational changes of the RCK1 domain of the gating ring are tightly coupled to the voltage sensor function, and this interaction is central to the allosteric modulation of BK channels.",

This diminishing of PGRMC1 concentration at kinetochore fibers may lead to mitotic errors and pro - liferation arrest.\\nC_LI\\n\\nABSTRACTMembrane-associated progesterone receptors are restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum and are shown to regulate the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes which are involved in steroidogenesis or drug detoxification. PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 belong to this group of microsomal receptors and are of interest due to their suspected role during cell cycle. PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 are thought to bind to each other thereby suppressing entry into mitosis. We could previously report that PGRMC2 interacts with the nucleoporin ALADIN which when mutated results in the autosomal recessive disorder triple A syndrome. ALADIN is a novel regulator of mitotic controller Aurora kinase A and depletion of this nucleoporin leads to microtubule instability. In the current study, we present that proliferation is decreased when ALADIN, PGRMC1 or PGRMC2 are over-expressed. Furthermore, we find that depletion of ALADIN results in mis-localization of Aurora kinase A and PGRMC1 in metaphase cells. Additionally, PGRMC2 is over-expressed in triple A patient fibroblasts. Our results emphasize the possibility that loss of the regulatory interaction between ALADIN and PGRMC2 gives rise to a depletion of PGRMC1 at kinetochore fibers and to mitotic errors. This observation may explain part of the symptoms seen in triple A syndrome patients.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes have different evolutionary properties as compared to the autosomes due to their hemizygous nature. In particular, recessive mutations are more readily exposed to selection, which can lead to faster rates of molecular evolution. Here, we report patterns of gene expression and molecular evolution in the sex chromosomes of a group of tropical butterflies. We first improved the completeness of the Heliconius melpomene reference annotation, a neotropical butterfly with a ZW sex determination system. Then we sequenced RNA from male and female whole abdomens and female ovary and gut tissue to identify sex and tissue specific gene expression profiles in H. melpomene. Using these expression profiles we compare sequence divergence and polymorphism, the strength of positive and negative selection and rates of adaptive evolution for Z and autosomal genes between two species of Heliconius butterflies, H. melpomene and H. erato.\\n\\nWe show that the rate of adaptive substitutions is higher for Z as compared to autosomal genes, but contrary to expectation it is also higher for male as compared to female biased genes. There is therefore mixed evidence that hemizygosity influences the rate of adaptive substitutions. Additionally, we find no significant increase in the rate of adaptive evolution or purifying selection on genes expressed in ovary tissue, a heterogametic specific tissue. Together our results provide limited support for fast-Z evolution. This contributes to a growing body of literature from other ZW systems that also provide mixed evidence for a fast-Z effect.",

However, when and why dopamine activity transitions between these modes is not understood. We hypothesize that the transition between ramping and phasic patterns reflects resource allocation which addresses the task dimensionality problem during reinforcement learning (RL). By parsimoniously modifying a standard temporal difference (TD) learning model to accommodate a mixed presentation of both experimental and environmental stimuli, we simulated dopamine transitions and compared it with experimental data from four different studies. The results suggested that dopamine transitions from ramping to phasic patterns as the agent narrows down candidate stimuli for the task; the opposite occurs when the agent needs to re-learn candidate stimuli due to a value change. These results lend insight into how dopamine deals with the tradeoff between cognitive resource and task dimensionality during RL.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between drugs and cell metabolism is a key factor in determining both compound potency and toxicity. In particular, how and to what extent transmembrane transporters affect drug uptake and disposition is currently only partially understood. Most transporter proteins belong to two protein families: the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter family, whose members are often involved in xenobiotic efflux and drug resistance, and the large and heterogeneous family of Solute carriers (SLCs). We recently argued that SLCs are collectively a rather neglected gene group, with most of its members still poorly characterized, and thus likely to include many yet-to-be-discovered associations with drugs. We searched publicly available resources and literature to define the currently known set of drugs transported by ABCs or SLCs, which involved ~500 drugs and more than 100 transporters. In order to extend this set, we then mined the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics dataset, which involves approximately 1000 molecularly annotated cancer cell lines and their response to 265 chemical compounds, and used regularized linear regression models (Elastic Net, LASSO) to predict drug responses based on SLC and ABC data (expression levels, SNVs, CNVs). The most predictive models included both known and previously unidentified associations between drugs and transporters. To our knowledge, this represents the first application of regularized linear regression to this set of genes, providing an extensive prioritization of potentially pharmacologically interesting interactions.",

After smoking for 4 weeks, which is when slight pathological changes were observed, 7 differential proteins were identified: 3 of them were reported to be associated with COPD, while 1 protein had been reported to be a marker of COPD.

Whole genome sequences and paired antimicrobial susceptibility data are available for Salmonella strains because of surveillance efforts from public health agencies. In this study, a collection of 5,278 nontyphoidal Salmonella genomes, collected over 15 years in the United States, were used to generate XGBoost-based machine learning models for predicting minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 15 antibiotics. The MIC prediction models have average accuracies between 95-96% within {+/-} 1 two-fold dilution factor and can predict MICs with no a priori information about the underlying gene content or resistance phenotypes of the strains. By selecting diverse genomes for training sets, we show that highly accurate MIC prediction models can be generated with fewer than 500 genomes. We also show that our approach for predicting MICs is stable over time despite annual fluctuations in antimicrobial resistance gene content in the sampled genomes. Finally, using feature selection, we explore the important genomic regions identified by the models for predicting MICs. To date, this is one of the largest MIC modeling studies to be published. Our strategy for developing whole genome sequence-based models for surveillance and clinical diagnostics can be readily applied to other important human pathogens.",

In a paradigmatic example, stimulated-emission depletion (STED) fluorescence microscopy fundamentally  breaks the diffraction limit by using a structured optical pattern to saturate depletion on a previously excited sample area. Two-dimensional (2D) STED, the canonical low-noise STED mode, structures the STED beam by using a vortex phase mask, achieving a significant lateral resolution improvement over confocal fluorescence microscopy. However, axial resolution and optical sectioning remain bound to diffraction. Here we use a tunable coherent-hybrid (CH) beam to improve optical sectioning, markedly reducing background fluorescence. CH-STED, which inherits the 2D-STED immunity to spherical aberration, diversifies the depletion strategy, allowing an optimal balance between two key metrics (lateral resolution and background suppression) to be found. CH-STED is used to perform high-contrast imaging of complex biological structures, such as the mitotic spindle and the neuron cell body.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a heterogeneous and dynamic population that stands at the top of tumor cellular hierarchy and is responsible for maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. As methods of CSC isolation and functional interrogation advance, there is a need for a reliable and accessible quantitative approach to assess heterogeneity and state transition dynamics in CSCs. We developed a High-throughput Automated Single Cell Imaging Analysis (HASCIA) approach for quantitative assessment of protein expression with single cell resolution and applied the method to investigate spatiotemporal factors that influence CSC state transition using glioblastoma (GBM) CSC as a model system. We were able to validate the quantitative nature of this approach through comparison of the protein expression levels determined by HASCIA to those determined by immunoblotting. A virtue of HASCIA was exemplified by detection of a subpopulation of SOX2-low cells, which expanded in fraction size during state transition. HASCIA also revealed that CSCs were committed to loose stem cell state at an earlier time point than the average SOX2 level decreased. Functional assessment of stem cell frequency in combination with quantification of SOX2 expression by HASCIA defined a stable cut-off of SOX2 expression level for stem cell state. We also developed an approach to assess local cell density and found that denser monolayer areas possess higher average levels of SOX2, higher cell diversity and a presence of a sub-population of slowly proliferating SOX2-low CSCs. HASCIA is an open source software that facilitates understanding the dynamics of heterogeneous cell population such as that of CSCs and their progeny.

    "abstract": "Perturbations in mitochondrial function and homeostasis are pervasive in lysosomal storage diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report a transcriptional program that represses mitochondrial biogenesis and function in lysosomal storage diseases Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASM), in patient cells and mouse tissues. This mechanism is mediated by the transcription factors KLF2 and ETV1, which are both induced in NPC and ASM patient cells. Mitochondrial biogenesis and function defects in these cells are rescued by the silencing of KLF2 or ETV1. Increased ETV1 expression is regulated by KLF2, while the increase of KLF2 protein levels in NPC and ASM stems from impaired signaling downstream sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), which normally represses KLF2. In patient cells, S1PR1 is undetectable at the plasma membrane and thus unable to repress KLF2. This manuscript provides a mechanistic pathway for the prevalent mitochondrial defects in lysosomal storage diseases.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes are formed when mother centrioles recruit pericentriolar material (PCM) around themselves. The PCM expands dramatically as cells prepare to enter mitosis (a process termed centrosome maturation), but it is unclear how this expansion is achieved. In flies, Spd-2 and Cnn form an extensive scaffold around the mother centriole that recruits other components of the mitotic PCM, and the Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Cnn at the centrosome is crucial for scaffold assembly. Here we show that, like Cnn, Spd-2 is specifically phosphorylated at centrosomes. This phosphorylation appears to create multiple phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs that allow Spd-2 to recruit Polo to the expanding scaffold. If Spd-2 cannot recruit Polo to the expanding scaffold, the scaffold is initially assembled around the mother centriole, but it cannot expand outwards, and centrosome maturation fails. We conclude that Spd-2, Polo and Cnn cooperate to form a positive feedback loop that drives the dramatic expansion of the mitotic centrosome in flies.",

    "abstract": "The stability of extracellular matrices is in general ensured by cross-linking of its components. Previously, we had shown that the integrity of the layered Drosophila cuticle relies on the presence of a covalent cuticular dityrosine network. Production and composition of this structure remained unstudied. In this work, we present our analyses of the schlaff (slf) gene coding for a C-type lectin that is needed for the adhesion between the horizontal cuticle layers. The Slf protein mainly localizes between the two layers called epicuticle and procuticle that separate from each other when the function of Slf is reduced or eliminated paralleling the phenotype of a cuticle with reduced extracellular dityrosine. Localisation of the dityrosinylated protein Resilin to the epicuticle-procuticle interface suggests that the dityrosine network mediates the adhesion of the epicuticle to the procuticle. Ultimately, compromised Slf function is associated with massive water loss. In summary, we propose that Slf is implied in the stabilisation of a dityrosine layer especially between the epicuticle and the procuticle that in turn constitutes an outward barrier against uncontrolled water flow.\\n\\nSummary statementExtracellular matrices adopt a stereotypic organisation for function during development. The lectin Schlaff assists adhesion reactions to ensure compactness of the epidermal cuticle in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Ifosfamide and other oxazaphosphorines can result in hemorrhagic cystitis, a constellation of complications caused by acrolein metabolites. We previously showed that a single dose of IPSE, a schistosome-derived host modulatory protein, can ameliorate ifosfamide-related cystitis; however, the exact mechanisms underlying this urotoxic effect and its prevention are not fully understood. To provide insights into IPSEs protective mechanism, we undertook transcriptional profiling of bladders from ifosfamide-treated mice, with or without IPSE pretreatment. Following ifosfamide challenge, there was upregulation of a range of pro-inflammatory genes. The pro-inflammatory pathway involving the IL-1{beta}, TNF and IL-6 triad via NF{kappa}B and STAT3 signaling pathways was identified as the key driver of inflammation. The NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway, which regulates both Hmox1-mediated heme homoeostasis and expression of antioxidant enzymes, was highly activated. Anti-inflammatory and cellular proliferation cascades implicated in tissue repair, namely Wnt, Hedgehog and PPAR pathways, were downregulated. IPSE administration before ifosfamide injection resulted in significant downregulation of major proinflammatory pathways including the triad of IL-1{beta}, TNF and IL-6 pathways, the interferon signaling pathway, and less apparent reduction in oxidative stress responses. Taken together, we have identified signatures of acute phase inflammation and oxidative stress responses in the ifosfamide-injured bladder, which are reversed by pretreatment with IPSE, a parasite derived anti-inflammatory molecule. In addition to providing new insights into the underlying mechanism of IPSEs therapeutic effects, this work has revealed several pathways that could be therapeutically targeted to prevent and treat ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.",

    "abstract": "Auxin phytohormones control most aspects of plant development through a complex and interconnected signaling network. In the presence of auxin, AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) transcriptional repressors are targeted for degradation by the SKP1-CULLIN1-F-BOX (SCF) ubiquitin-protein ligases containing TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB). CULLIN1-neddylation is required for SCFTIR1/AFB functionality as exemplified by mutants deficient in the NEDD8-activating enzyme subunit AUXIN-RESISTANT 1 (AXR1). Here, we report a chemical biology screen that identifies small molecules requiring AXR1 to modulate plant development. We selected four molecules of interest, RubNeddin1 to 4 (RN1 to 4), among which RN3 and RN4 trigger selective auxin responses at transcriptional, biochemical and morphological levels. This selective activity is explained by their ability to promote the interaction between TIR1 and a specific subset of AUX/IAA proteins, stimulating the degradation of particular AUX/IAA combinations. Finally, via a genetic screen using RN4, we revealed that the chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA is implicated in auxin-mediated apical hook development. These results demonstrate the power of selective auxin agonists to dissect auxin perception for plant developmental functions.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful tool for public health infectious disease investigations owing to its higher resolution, greater efficiency, and cost-effectiveness over traditional genotyping methods. Implementation of WGS in routine public health microbiology laboratories is impeded by a lack of user-friendly automated and semi-automated pipelines, restrictive jurisdictional data sharing policies, and the proliferation of non-interoperable analytical and reporting systems. To address these issues, we developed the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) platform (irida.ca), a user-friendly, decentralized, open-source bioinformatics and analytical web platform to support real-time infectious disease outbreak investigations using WGS data. Instances can be independently installed on local high-performance computing infrastructure, enabling private and secure data management and analyses according to organizational policies and governance. IRIDAs data management capabilities enable secure upload, storage and sharing of all WGS data and metadata. The core platform currently includes pipelines for quality control, assembly, annotation, variant detection, phylogenetic analysis, in silico serotyping, multi-locus sequence typing, and genome distance calculation. Analysis pipeline results can be visualized within the platform through dynamic line lists and integrated phylogenomic clustering for research and discovery, and for enhancing decision-making support and hypothesis generation in epidemiological investigations. Communication and data exchange between instances are provided through customizable access controls. IRIDA complements centralized systems, empowering local analytics and visualizations for genomics-based microbial pathogen investigations. IRIDA is currently transforming the Canadian public health ecosystem and is freely available at https://github.com/phac-nml/irida and www.irida.ca.\\n\\nImpact StatementWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is revolutionizing infectious disease analysis and surveillance due to its cost effectiveness, utility, and improved analytical power. To date, no \\\"one-size-fits-all\\\" genomics platform has been universally adopted, owing to differences in national (and regional) health information systems, data sharing policies, computational infrastructures, lack of interoperability and prohibitive costs. The Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) platform is a user-friendly, decentralized, open-source bioinformatics and analytical web platform developed to support real-time infectious disease outbreak investigations using WGS data. IRIDA empowers public health, regulatory and clinical microbiology laboratory personnel to better incorporate WGS technology into routine operations by shielding them from the computational and analytical complexities of big data genomics. IRIDA is now routinely used as part of a validated suite of tools to support outbreak investigations in Canada. While IRIDA was designed to serve the needs of the Canadian public health system, it is generally applicable to any public health and multi-jurisdictional environment. IRIDA enables localized analyses but provides mechanisms and standard outputs to enable data sharing. This approach can help overcome pervasive challenges in real-time global infectious disease surveillance, investigation and control, resulting in faster responses, and ultimately, better public health outcomes.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYO_LIData used to generate some of the figures in this manuscript can be found in the NCBI BioProject PRJNA305824.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recombinations omnipresence in nature is one of the most intriguing problems in evolutionary biology. The question of why recombination exhibits certain general features is no less interesting than that of why it exists at all. One such feature is recombinations fitness dependence (FD). The so far developed population-genetics models have focused on the evolution of FD recombination mainly in haploids, although the empirical evidence for this phenomenon comes mostly from diploids. Using numerical analysis of modifier models for infinite panmictic populations, we show here that FD recombination can be evolutionarily advantageous in diploids subjected to purifying selection. This advantage is associated with benefits from the differential rate of disruption of lower- vs higher-fitness genotypes, that can be manifested in systems with at least three selected loci. We also show that in systems with linked modifier, an additional contribution to the evolutionary advantage of FD recombination may come from fitness-dependence of the intensity of modifier linkage to the selected system, although the contribution of the last effect vanishes with tighter linkage within the selected system. We also show that in systems with three selected loci, FD recombination may give rise to negative crossover interference, which may be beneficial by itself. Yet, the role of such FD-induced crossover interference in the evolutionary advantage of FD recombination is minor. Remarkably, FD recombination was often favored in situations where any constant non-zero recombination was rejected, implying a relaxation of the rather strict constraints on major parameters (e.g., selection intensity and epistasis) required for the evolutionary advantage of non-zero recombination formulated by classical models.",

We studied as an example Lavandula angustifolia, a perennial sub-shrub plant native from the Mediterranean region and whose essential oil have numerous applications in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and alternative medicines.\\n\\nWe first built a  Maillette reference Unigene, compound of coding sequences, thanks to de novo RNA-seq assembly. Then, we reconstructed the complete genes sequences (with exons and introns) using a transcriptome-guided DNA-seq assembly approach in order to maximize the possibilities of finding polymorphism between genetically close individuals. Finally, we used these resources for SNP mining within a collection of 16 lavender clones and tested the SNP within the scope of a phylogeny analysis. We obtained a cleaned reference of 8, 030 functionally annotated  genes (in silico annotation). We found up to 400K polymorphic sites, depending on the genotype analyzed, and observed a high SNP frequency (mean of 1 SNP per 90 bp) and a high level of heterozygosity (more than 60% of heterozygous SNP per genotype). We found similar genetic distances between pairs of clones, related to the out-crossing nature of the species, the restricted area of cultivation and the clonal propagation of the varieties.\\n\\nThe method propose is transferable to other orphan species, requires little bioinformatics resources and can be realized within a year. This is the first reported large-scale SNP development on Lavandula angustifolia. All this data provides a rich pool of molecular resource to explore and exploit biodiversity in breeding programs.",

Four factors were evaluated: glucose, initial pH, MgSO4 and KH2PO4, these were analyzed in a fractional factorial design to verify which were important to cell density yield. The best treatment assayed showed a yield of 1.09 OD600 and analysis of variance (ANOVA) selected glucose, inital pH and KH2PO4 as the significant factors.

Rudhira/Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 3 (BCAS3) is a cytoskeletal protein essential for EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis during mouse development and implicated in metastatic disease.

Rudhira binds to both microtubules and Vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) and stabilizes microtubules. Rudhira depletion impairs cytoskeletal crosstalk, microtubule stability and hence focal adhesion disassembly. The BCAS3 domain of Rudhira is necessary and sufficient for microtubule-IF crosslinking and cell migration. Pharmacologically restoring microtubule stability rescues gross cytoskeleton organization and angiogenic sprouting in Rudhira depleted cells. Our study identifies the novel and essential role of Rudhira in cytoskeletal crosstalk and assigns function to the conserved BCAS3 domain.

    "abstract": "The human prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been associated more with meta-perceptual as opposed to meta-memory decisions from correlational neuroimaging investigations. Recently, metacognitive abilities have also been shown to be causally dependent upon anterior and dorsal PFC in non-human primate lesion studies. Two studies, utilizing post-decision wagering paradigms and reversible inactivation, challenged this meta-perceptual versus meta-memory notion and showed that dorsal and anterior prefrontal areas are associated with metamemory for experienced objects and awareness of ignorance respectively. Causal investigations are important but scarce; nothing is known, for example, about the causal contributions of prefrontal sub-regions to spatial metamemory. Here, we investigated the effects of dorsal versus ventral PFC lesions on two-alternative forced choice spatial discrimination tasks in male macaque monkeys. Importantly, we were rigorous in approach and applied three independent but complementary indices used to quantify individual animals metacognitive ability (\"type II sensitivity\") namely meta-d', d' measures, and Phi coefficient ({Phi}). Our results were consistent across indices: while neither lesions to superior dorsolateral PFC (sdlPFC) nor orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) impaired spatial recognition performance, only monkeys with sdlPFC lesions were impaired in meta-accuracy. Together with the observation that the same OFC lesioned monkeys were impaired in updating rule-value in a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analog, we therefore document a functional double-dissociation between these two PFC regions. Out study presents important causal evidence that other dimensions, namely domain-specific processing (e.g., spatial versus non-spatial metamemory), also need considerations in understanding the functional specialization in the neural underpinnings of introspection.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study demonstrates macaque monkeys meta-cognitive capability of introspecting its own memory success is causally dependent on intact superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (PFC) but not the orbitofrontal cortices. Combining neurosurgical techniques on monkeys and state-of-the-art measures of metacognition, we affirm a critical role of the PFC in supporting spatial meta-recognition memory and delineate functional specificity within PFC for distinct elements of metacognition.",

The nervous system is affected by alcohol in diverse ways, though the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not clearly understood. Using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we developed a neural cell culture model to identify the mechanisms of alcohols effects. iPSCs were generated from fibroblasts and differentiated into forebrain neural cells cultures that were treated with 50 mM alcohol or sham conditions (same media lacking alcohol) for 7 days. We analyzed gene expression using total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for 34 samples derived from 11 subjects and for 10 samples from 5 subjects in an independent experiment that had intermittent exposure to the same dose of alcohol. We also analyzed genetic effects on gene expression and conducted a weighted correlation network analysis. We found that differentiated neural cell cultures have the capacity to recapitulate gene regulatory effects previously observed in specific primary neural tissues and identified 226 genes that were differentially expressed (FDR< 0.1) after alcohol treatment. The effects on expression included decreases in INSIG1 and LDLR, two genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. We also identified a module of 58 co-expressed genes that were uniformly decreased following alcohol exposure. The majority of these effects were supported in the independent alcohol exposure experiment. Enrichment analysis linked the alcohol responsive genes to cell cycle, notch signaling, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways, which are disrupted in several neurological disorders. Our findings suggest that there is convergence between these disorders and the effects of alcohol exposure.",

    "abstract": "Biological measurements often contain systematic errors, also known as \\\"batch effects\\\", which may invalidate downstream analysis when not handled correctly. The problem of removing batch effects is of major importance in the biological community. Despite recent advances in this direction via deep learning techniques, most current methods may not fully preserve the true biological patterns the data contains. In this work we propose a deep learning approach for batch effect removal. The crux of our approach is learning a batch-free encoding of the data, representing its intrinsic biological properties, but not batch effects. In addition, we also encode the systematic factors through a decoding mechanism and require accurate reconstruction of the data. Altogether, this allows us to fully preserve the true biological patterns represented in the data. Experimental results are reported on data obtained from two high throughput technologies, mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq. Beyond good performance on training data, we also observe that our system performs well on test data obtained from new patients, which was not available at training time.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCorrect quantification of transcript expression is essential to understand the functional products of the genome in different physiological conditions and developmental stages. Recently, the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows the researchers to perform transcriptome analysis for the organisms without the reference genome and transcriptome. For such projects, de novo transcriptome assembly must be carried out prior to quantification. However, a large number of erroneous contigs produced by the assemblers might result in unreliable estimation on the abundance of transcripts. In this regard, this study comprehensively investigates how assembly quality affects the performance of quantification for RNA-Seq analysis based on de novo transcriptome assembly.\\n\\nResultsSeveral important factors that might seriously affect the accuracy of the RNA-Seq analysis were thoroughly discussed. First, we found that the assemblers perform comparatively well for the transcriptomes with lower biological complexity. Second, we examined the over-extended and incomplete contigs, and then demonstrated that assembly completeness has a strong impact on the estimation of contig abundance. Lastly, we investigated the behavior of the quantifiers with respect to sequence ambiguity which might be originally present in the transcriptome or accidentally produced by assemblers. The results suggest that the quantifiers often over-estimate the expression of family-collapse contigs and under-estimate the expression of duplicated contigs. For organisms without reference transcriptome, it remained challenging to detect the inaccurate abundance estimation on family-collapse contigs. On the contrary, we observed that the situation of under-estimation on duplicated contigs can be warned through analyzing the read distribution of the duplicated contigs.\\n\\nConclusionsIn summary, we explicated the behavior of quantifiers when erroneous contigs are present and we outlined the potential problems that the assemblers might cause for the downstream analysis of RNA-Seq. We anticipate the analytic results conducted in this study provides valuable insights for future development of transcriptome assembly and quantification.\\n\\nAvailabilitywe proposed an open-source Python based package QuantEval that builds connected components for the assembled contigs based on sequence similarity and evaluates the quantification results for each connected component.

    "abstract": "In recent years, multiple studies including ours have reported on the mechanism of resistance towards p97 inhibitors. While all these studies outline target alteration via mutations in p97 as the primary mechanism of resistance, discrepancies persist in the current literature due to the occurrence of both heterozygous and homozygous mutations when using HCT116 cells. Here, we report a pre-existing heterozygous frameshift mutation at codon 616 (N616fs*) in one of the p97 alleles in HCT116 cells and show that this mutant allele is subjected to nonsense-mediated decay. Furthermore, we independently generated p97 inhibitor (CB-5083) resistant HCT116 cells, and we observed a single heterozygous mutation at codon 526 (L526S) in genomic DNA sequencing but a homozygous L526S mutation in complementary DNA sequencing, indicating that the missense mutation (L526S) occurs in the allele that does not harbor the frameshift N616fs* mutation. Our results underscore the importance of performing simultaneous genomic and complementary DNA sequencing when confirming mutations in p97.",

    "abstract": "During cytokinesis, fission yeast coordinates actomyosin ring constriction with septum ingression, resulting in concentric furrow formation. Mechanisms coordinating septum ingression with the actomyosin ring remain unclear. We report that cells lacking the Cdc42 activator Gef1, combined with an activated allele of the formin, Cdc12, display non-concentric furrowing. Although cells that furrow non-concentrically display normal actomyosin rings, the scaffold Cdc15 is unevenly distributed along the ring. This suggests that after ring assembly, uniform Cdc15 distribution along the ring drives proper furrow formation. We find that Cdc15 levels at the ring are reduced in the activated cdc12 mutant, or upon disruption of Arp2/3 complex-dependent endocytic patches. Furthermore, Cdc15 levels in endocytic patches increase in gef1 mutants. We hypothesize that assembled rings recruit Cdc15 from endocytic patches. Patches with higher Cdc15 levels and slower ring-association rate lead to uneven Cdc15 distribution. Based on this hypothesis we developed a mathematical model that captures experimentally observed Cdc15 distributions along the ring. We propose that, at the ring, Gef1 and endocytic events promote uniform Cdc15 distribution to enable proper septum ingression and concentric furrow formation.\\n\\nSummary StatementGef1 and endocytic events at the assembled actomyosin ring facilitate uniform Cdc15 distribution along the ring thus enabling concentric furrow formation.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are a pervasive, but understudied source of genetic variation and evolutionary potential. Long-term evolution experiments in chemostats provide an ideal system for studying the molecular processes underlying CNV formation and the temporal dynamics of de novo CNVs. Here, we developed a fluorescent reporter to monitor gene amplifications and deletions at a specific locus with single-cell resolution. Using a CNV reporter in nitrogen-limited chemostats, we find that GAP1 CNVs are repeatedly generated and selected during the early stages of adaptive evolution resulting in predictable dynamics of CNV selection. However, subsequent diversification of populations defines a second phase of evolutionary dynamics that cannot be predicted. Using whole genome sequencing, we identified a variety of GAP1 CNVs that vary in size and copy number. Despite GAP1s proximity to tandem repeats that facilitate intrachromosomal recombination, we find that non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between flanking tandem repeats occurs infrequently. Rather, breakpoint characterization revealed that for at least 50% of GAP1 CNVs, origin-dependent inverted-repeat amplification (ODIRA), a DNA replication mediated process, is the likely mechanism. We also find evidence that ODIRA generates DUR3 CNVs, indicating that it may be a common mechanism of gene amplification. We combined the CNV reporter with barcode lineage tracking and found that 103-104 independent CNV-containing lineages initially compete within populations, which results in extreme clonal interference. Our study introduces a novel means of studying CNVs in heterogeneous cell populations and provides insight into the underlying dynamics of CNVs in evolution.",

However till now, bioactivity of this fruit has not been documented for plant protection against phytopathogenes, Hence in this regard, we investigated antimicrobial activity of P. murex fruit extracts (isolated from the different agro climatic zones of India) were tested against twelve microbial phytopathogens. From 29 fruit extracts, only 13 were found to be active against three pathogens viz. Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Among the nine TLC fractions only one showed presence of a single peak, thus presence of a single compound in the crude extract. Based on lower IC50 value (328 g/ml) the crude fruit extract collected from Indore region was further characterized. Evaluation against screened phytopathogens indicates its activity. Further, structural characterization of this compound using FTIR and NMR revealed it to be a novel compound i.e. 5-{beta}-Hydroxyl tridecanyl benzoate. Our study paves a way to investigate effective dose of P. murex fruit extracts to utilize in plant protection programs. In future, a better method is required to scale up the process of bioactive molecule (5-{beta}-Hydroxyl tridecayl benzoate) extraction from P. murex or for its chemical synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The Lewis rat is the only known warm-blooded animal that has sterile immunity to Toxoplasma. Upon invasion of Lewis rat macrophages Toxoplasma rapidly activates the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome resulting in interleukin (IL)-1{beta} secretion and a form of cell death known as pyroptosis, which prevents Toxoplasma replication. Using a chemical mutagenesis screen we identified Toxoplasma mutants that no longer induced pyroptosis. Whole genome sequencing led to the identification of three Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuole-localized dense granule proteins, GRA35, GRA42 and GRA43 that are individually required for inflammasome activation in Lewis rat macrophages. Macrophage infection with {Delta}gra35, {Delta}gra42, and {Delta}gra43 parasites leads to greatly reduced cell death and reduced IL-1{beta} secretion. Lewis rat macrophage infected with parasites containing single, double or triple deletion of these GRAs showed similar levels of cell viability suggesting the three GRAs function in the same pathway that activates the inflammasome. Deletion of GRA42 and GRA43 resulted in GRA35, and other GRAs, being retained inside the parasitophorous vacuole instead of being localized to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Toxoplasma deficient in GRA35, GRA42 or GRA43 do not establish chronic infection in Lewis rats, but have reduced cyst number in parasite-susceptible F344 rats, in which Toxoplasma does not activate the NLRP1 inflammasome, revealing these GRAs determine parasite in vivo fitness independent of their role in inflammasome activation. Overall, our data suggest that Toxoplasma dense granule proteins that localize to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane are novel mediators of host NLRP1 inflammasome activation.\\n\\nImportanceInflammasomes are a major component of the innate immune system and responsible for detecting various microbial and environmental danger signals. The Lewis rat has sterile immunity to Toxoplasma because upon invasion of Lewis rat macrophages the parasite rapidly activates the NLRP1 inflammasome resulting in cell death and parasite elimination. The work reported here identified that Toxoplasma GRA35, GRA42 and GRA43 are required for activation of the Lewis rat NLRP1 inflammasome. GRA42 and GRA43 mediate the correct localization of other GRAs, including GRA35, to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. In addition to their role in inflammasome activation, these three GRAs are also important for parasite in vivo fitness in a Toxoplasma-susceptible rat strain. Thus, these results give new insight into NLRP1 inflammasome activation by Toxoplasma effectors and identified three GRAs that are required for pathogenesis of the parasite.",

    "abstract": "The use of chemical pesticides is limited by several public health concerns regarding their toxicity levels and indiscriminate use. Nevertheless, they are still vital components of agricultural industry since no other competitive equivalents to chemical pesticides still exist in terms of efficiency. This study describes the preparation and biological assessment of an insecticide releasing plastic film for agricultural covering purposes. The formulation was prepared by incorporation of deltamethrin loaded, nano-sized halloysite nanotubes into polymeric films. Thermal, morphological, and mechanical properties of films were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Universal Testing Machine UTM. Sustained release profiles of the films were evaluated by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Results reveal that deltamethrin was successfully loaded into halloysite nanotubes and nanotube incorporation enhances the elastic modulus of linear-low density polyethylene (LLDPE) films. In addition, films exhibit controlled release function of the active agent for 32 days. Bioassays of the nanocomposite films with varying deltamethrin doses tested on grasshoppers showed that the LD50 values of the films are 1.85x10-5 g/cm2. Insecticidal activities of films were tested in greenhouse on Medicago Sativa plants contaminated with thrips and aphid. Nanocomposites are observed to repel mature aphids and kill young aphids and thrips.",

    "abstract": "The pit is the necessary bioreactor for brewing process of Chinese strong-flavor liquor. Pit mud in pits contains a large number of microorganisms and is a complex ecosystem. The analysis of bacterial flora in pit mud is of great significance to understand liquor fermentation mechanisms. To overcome taxonomic limitations of short reads in 16S rRNA variable region sequencing, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing of near full-length 16S rRNA gene to analyze microbial compositions of different types of pit mud that produce different qualities of strong-flavor liquor. The results showed that the main species in pit mud were Pseudomonas extremaustralis 14-3, Pseudomonas veronii, Serratia marcescens WW4, and Clostridium leptum in Ruminiclostridium. The microbial diversity of pit mud with different quality was significantly different. From poor to good quality of pit mud (thus the quality of liquor), the relative abundances of Ruminiclostridium and Syntrophomonas in Firmicutes was increased, and the relative abundance of Olsenella in Actinobacteria also increased, but the relative abundances of Pseudomonas and Serratia in Proteobacteria were decreased. The surprising findings of this study include that the diversity of intermediate level quality of N pit mud was the lowest, and the diversity levels of high quality pit mud G and poor quality pit mud B were similar. Correlation analysis showed that there were high positive correlations (r > 0.8) among different microbial groups in the flora. Based on the analysis of the microbial structures of pit mud in different quality, the good quality pit mud has a higher microbial diversity, but how this higher diversity and differential microbial compositions contribute to better quality of liquor fermentation remains obscure.",

We identified widespread changes in the expression of individual transcript features and their splice variants, gene networks, and global patterns of transcription. We next demonstrated that co-culturing human NPCs with rodent astrocytes resulted in mutually synergistic maturation, and that cell type-specific expression data can be extracted using only sequencing read alignments without potentially disruptive cell sorting.

This process uses HMW DNA isolated from intact cells, custom designed Cas9-guide RNA complexes to generate 0.1 - 0.2 Mb DNA targets, electrophoretic isolation of the DNA targets and sequencing with barcode linked reads. We used alignment methods as well as local assembly of the target regions to identify haplotypes and structural variants (SVs) across multi-Megabase genomic regions. To demonstrate the performance of this approach, we designed three assays that covered a 0.2 Mb region surrounding the BRCA1 gene, a set of 40 overlapping 0.2 Mb targets covering the entire 4-Mb MHC locus, and 18 well-characterized structural variants. Using the highly characterized NA12878 genome, we achieved on-target coverage of more than 50X, while overall whole genome coverage was approximately 4X. We generated haplotypes that completely covered each targeted locus, with a maximum size of 4 Mb (for the MHC region). This method detected structural variants such as deletions and inversions with determination of the exact breakpoints and genotypes. Even breakpoints inside highly homologous segmental duplications are precisely determined with our high-quality assemblies. Overall, this is a new method to sequence large DNA segments.",

This information is critical to designing properly powered longitudinal studies. Here we comprehensively quantified and compared the test-retest reliability and reproducibility performance of 8 commonly applied fMRI tasks, 6 rs-fMRI metrics and CBF in 30 healthy volunteers. We find large variability in test-retest reliability performance across the different tb-fMRI paradigms and rs-fMRI metrics, ranging from poor to excellent. A larger extent of activation in tb-fMRI is linked to higher between-subject reliability of the respective task suggesting that differences in the amount of activation may be used as a first reliability estimate of novel tb-fMRI paradigms. For rs-fMRI, a good reliability of local activity estimates is paralleled by poor performance of global connectivity metrics. Evaluated CBF measures provide in general a good to excellent test-reliability matching or surpassing the best performing tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI metrics. This comprehensive effort allows for direct comparisons of test-retest reliability between the evaluated MRI domains and measures to aid the design of future tb-fMRI, rs-fMRI and CBF studies.",

    "abstract": "Proteins of the Actin Depolymerizing Factor (ADF)/cofilin family are the central regulators of actin filament disassembly. A key function of ADF/cofilin is to sever actin filaments. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations by using single molecule, single filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on either cofilin binding or severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We find that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque does not hinder ADF/cofilin binding, but dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism, which we verify experimentally, is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than non-connected filaments. We propose that this mechano-chemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilins ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.",

    "abstract": "The peopling of the Andean highlands above 2500m in elevation was a complex process that included cultural, biological and genetic adaptations. Here we present a time series of ancient whole genomes from the Andes of Peru, dating back to 7,000 calendar years before present (BP), and compare them to 64 new genome-wide genetic variation datasets from both high and lowland populations. We infer three significant features: a split between low and high elevation populations that occurred between 9200-8200 BP; a population collapse after European contact that is significantly more severe in South American lowlanders than in highland populations; and evidence for positive selection at genetic loci related to starch digestion and plausibly pathogen resistance after European contact. Importantly, we do not find selective sweep signals related to known components of the human hypoxia response, which may suggest more complex modes of genetic adaptation to high altitude.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAncient DNA from the Andes reveals a complex picture of human adaptation from early settlement to the colonial period.",

    "abstract": "By studying different sources of temporal variability in central pattern generator circuits, in this paper we unveil distinct aspects of the instantaneous balance between flexibility and robustness in sequential dynamics -a property that characterizes many systems that display neural rhythms. The level of irregularity and coordination was characterized using intrinsic time references and intervals in long recordings of the pyloric central pattern generator. The analysis demonstrated strong robustness of transient dynamics in keeping not only the activation sequences but also specific cycle-by-cycle temporal relationships in the form of dynamical invariants. The rich dynamics of neurons and connections balance flexibility and coordination to readily negotiate the interactions between neurons and produce the resultant rhythm. In particular, two dynamical invariants were identified between time intervals that build the sequence, existing even outside steady states. We suggest that invariant temporal sequence relationships could be present in other networks, including those related to brain rhythms, and underlie rhythm programming and functionality.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes play multiple functions in the central nervous system, from control of blood flow through to modulation of synaptic activity. Transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ are thought to control these activities. The prevailing concept is that these Ca2+ transients are triggered by distinct pathways, with little mechanistic and functional overlap. Here we demonstrate that astrocytes in visual cortex of mice encode local visual signals in conjunction with arousal state, functioning as multi-modal integrators. Such activity adds an additional layer of complexity to astrocyte function and may enable astrocytes to specifically and subtly regulate local network activity and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Protein-coding genetic variants that strongly affect disease risk can provide important clues into disease pathogenesis. Here we report an exome sequence analysis of 20,791 type 2 diabetes (T2D) cases and 24,440 controls from five ancestries. We identify rare (minor allele frequency<0.5%) variant gene-level associations in (a) three genes at exome-wide significance, including a T2D-protective series of >30 SLC30A8 alleles, and (b) within 12 gene sets, including those corresponding to T2D drug targets (p=6.1x10-3) and candidate genes from knockout mice (p=5.2x10-3). Within our study, the strongest T2D rare variant gene-level signals explain at most 25% of the heritability of the strongest common single-variant signals, and the rare variant gene-level effect sizes we observe in established T2D drug targets will require 110K-180K sequenced cases to exceed exome-wide significance. To help prioritize genes using associations from current smaller sample sizes, we present a Bayesian framework to recalibrate association p-values as posterior probabilities of association, estimating that reaching p<0.05 (p<0.005) in our study increases the odds of causal T2D association for a nonsynonymous variant by a factor of 1.8 (5.3).
