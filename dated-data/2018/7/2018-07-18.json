    "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations in the human CaV2.1 gene CACNA1A cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). To characterize cellular problems potentially triggered by CaV2.1 gains of function, we engineered mutations encoding FHM1 amino-acid substitutions S218L (SL) and R192Q (RQ) into transgenes of Drosophila melanogaster CaV2/cacophony. We expressed the transgenes pan-neuronally. Phenotypes were mild for RQ-expressing animals. By contrast, single mutant SL- and complex allele RQ,SL-expressing animals showed overt phenotypes, including sharply decreased viability. By electrophysiology, SL- and RQ,SL-expressing neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) exhibited enhanced evoked discharges, supernumerary discharges, and an increase in the amplitudes and frequencies of spontaneous events. Some spontaneous events were gigantic (10-40 mV), multi-quantal events. Gigantic spontaneous events were eliminated by application of TTX - or by lowered or chelated Ca2+ - suggesting that gigantic events were elicited by spontaneous nerve firing. A follow-up genetic approach revealed that some neuronal hyperexcitability phenotypes were reversed after knockdown or mutation of Drosophila homologs of phospholipase C{beta} (PLC{beta}), IP3 receptor, or ryanodine receptor (RyR) - all factors known to mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological inhibitors of intracellular Ca2+ store release produced similar effects. Interestingly, however, the decreased viability phenotype was not reversed by genetic impairment of intracellular Ca2+ release factors. On a cellular level, our data suggest inhibition of signaling that triggers intracellular Ca2+ release could counteract hyperexcitability induced by gains of CaV2.1 function.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPrior research has demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations in a gene important for neurotransmission (CACNA1A) are known to cause migraine in humans. We attempted to mimic some of those gain-of-function mutations in a simple genetic model organism and to examine neurotransmission by electrophysiology. Our findings yield potential clues as to how particular migraine-causing mutations may impact neurophysiology on a cellular level. We used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and its model synapse, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to perform our studies. We document three main advances: 1) characterization of fruit fly models harboring gain-of-function calcium channel alterations known to cause human familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1); 2) characterization of hyperactive neurotransmission caused by one of these alterations; and 3) an ability to quell hyperactive neurotransmission by impairing intracellular Ca2+ store release, through both genetic and pharmacological means. Our work contributes to a broader understanding of how pathological mutations could impact cellular physiology. More generally, the utilization of genetic model organisms promises to uncover potential ways to reverse those impacts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearch over the last 10 years highlights the increasing importance of hybridization between species as a major force structuring the evolution of genomes and potentially providing raw material for adaptation by natural and/or sexual selection. Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity dxy and Pattersons D. The resulting statistic, the Basic distance fraction (Bdf), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published fd and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on CRAN. The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework.\\n\\nConclusionWe present a new distance based statistic Bdf that avoids the pitfalls of Pattersons D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "1Although vaccines against seasonal influenza are designed to protect against circulating strains, by affecting the emergence and transmission of antigenically divergent strains, they might also change the rate of antigenic evolution. Vaccination might slow antigenic evolution by increasing immunity, reducing the chance that even antigenically diverged strains can survive. Vaccination also reduces prevalence, decreasing the supply of potentially beneficial mutations and increasing the probability of stochastic extinction. But vaccination might accelerate antigenic evolution by increasing the transmission advantage of more antigenically diverged strains relative to less diverged strains (i.e., by positive selection). Such evolutionary effects could affect vaccinations direct benefits to individuals and indirect benefits to the host population (i.e., the private and social benefits). To investigate these potential impacts, we simulated the dynamics of an influenza-like pathogen with seasonal vaccination. On average, more vaccination decreased the rate of viral antigenic evolution and the incidence of disease. Notably, this decrease was driven partly by a vaccine-induced decline in the rate of antigenic evolution. To understand how the evolutionary effects of vaccines might affect their social and private benefits, we fitted linear panel models to simulated data. By slowing evolution, vaccination increased the social benefit and decreased the private benefit. Thus, in the long term, vaccinations potential social and private benefits may differ from current theory, which omits evolutionary effects. These results suggest that conventional seasonal vaccines against influenza, if protective against transmission and given to the appropriate populations, could further reduce disease burden by slowing antigenic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is perhaps the most widely used brain-imaging technique for paediatric populations. However, EEG signals are prone to distortion by motion. Compared to adults, infants motion is both more frequent and less stereotypical yet motion effects on the infant EEG signal are largely undocumented. Here, we present a systematic assessment of naturalistic motion effects on the infant and adult EEG signal. In Study 1, we documented the prevalence of 27 naturally occurring facial and body motions by video-coding five mother-infant pairs during naturalistic play. In Study 2, we elicited a subset of the most common facial, limb and postural motions from one adult and one infant actor while their EEG was recorded. In Study 3, we recorded EEG signals from a larger group of 12 infants whilst they produced the same motions spontaneously. Our findings from Study 2 suggested that adult movements mainly generated increases in spectral power relative to resting state, primarily at peripheral sites and in delta and high-beta frequency bands. In infants, both elicited motions (N=1, Study 2) and spontaneously-occurring motions (N=12, Study 3) produced decreases in theta, alpha and beta power over central regions and increased beta/delta power at peripheral sites. We also observed that infants jaw and upper limb movements generated more pronounced EEG artifacts than lower limb movements. It is intended that this work will inform future development of methods for addressing EEG motion-related artifacts and support wider use of naturalistic paradigms in social and developmental neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Stomata control gas exchanges between the plant and the atmosphere. How natural variation in stomata size and density contributes to resolve trade-offs between carbon uptake and water-loss in response to local climatic variation is not yet understood. We developed an automated confocal microscopy approach to characterize natural genetic variation in stomatal patterning in 330 fully-sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana accessions collected throughout the European range of the species. We compared this to variation in water-use efficiency, measured as carbon isotope discrimination ({delta}13C). We detect substantial genetic variation for stomata size and density segregating within Arabidopsis thaliana. A positive correlation between stomata size and {delta}13C further suggests that this variation has consequences on water-use efficiency. Genome-wide association analyses indicate a complex genetic architecture underlying not only variation in stomata patterning but also to its co-variation with carbon uptake parameters. Yet, we report two novel QTL affecting {delta}13C independently of stomata patterning. This suggests that, in A. thaliana, both morphological and physiological variants contribute to genetic variance in water-use efficiency. Patterns of regional differentiation and co-variation with climatic parameters indicate that natural selection has contributed to shape some of this variation, especially in Southern Sweden, where water availability is more limited in spring relative to summer. These conditions are expected to favor the evolution of drought avoidance mechanisms over drought escape strategies.",

    "abstract": "Plant cell walls are comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, collectively known as lignocellulose. Microorganisms degrade these components to liberate sugars to meet metabolic demands. Using a metagenomic sequencing approach, we previously demonstrated that the microbiome of the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is replete with novel lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Here, we report the identification, synthesis and partial characterization of four genes from the porcupine microbiome encoding putative novel lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, including a {beta}-xylanase, endoxylanase, {beta}-glucosidase, and an -L-arabinofuranosidase. These genes were identified via conserved catalytic domains associated with cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. We cloned the putative {beta}-xylanase into the pET26b(+) plasmid, enabling inducible gene expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and periplasmic localization. We demonstrated IPTG-inducible accumulation of {beta}-xylanase protein but failed to detect xylobiose degrading activity in a reporter assay. Alternative assays may be required to measure activity of this putative {beta}-xylanase. In this report, we describe how a synthetic metagenomic pipeline can be used to identify novel microbial lignocellulose-degrading enzymes and take initial steps to introduce a hemicellulose-degradation pathway into E. coli to enable biofuel production from wood pulp feedstock.",

    "abstract": "Prion disorders are the root cause of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE), a group of lethal diseases portrayed by progressive neurodegeneration and spongiosis. In recent years, researchers have come to understand that it is not the endogenous presence of Prions itself that causes neurodegeneration, but the amount of prion proteins that accumulates in the nervous tissue, leading them to exert neurotoxicity. More specifically, the cause of these disorders is mapped to several mutations that can bring the prion protein structure to a disordered permanent misfolded state. Our research is focused on Sporadic Fatal Insomnia (sFI), a rare TSE characterized by severe and chronic insomnia, leading to a life expectancy estimation of about two and a half years, from the onset of the first symptoms. The goal of this work was to analyze through computational studies the structure of the native human Prion Protein (PrPnat) and compare it with the toxic form (FI-Prion) which causes disease. Our findings show that the structure of the human mutant FI-Prion, responsible for Sporadic Fatal Insomnia is more flexible than the native human form PrPnat. Specific regions of the mutant seem to fluctuate more freely than the corresponding loops in the native form. We also identified amino acids Tyr128 and Met129 to be the key residues playing a major role in the manifestation of the disease. Therefore, weve learnt that the FI-Prion is more flexible than PrPnat. In addition, we also confirmed that sporadic fatal insomnia is undoubtedly an infectious disease.",

Here, we analyzed how clathrin plaques interact with the cytoskeleton and how they respond to mechanical cues in skeletal muscle myotubes. We show that branched actin networks surrounding clathrin plaques are directly regulated by dynamin 2, anchor intermediate filaments and sequester YAP at the plasma membrane. Dynamin 2, clathrin and desmin intermediate filaments are all required for basal YAP nucleocytoplasmic distribution and efficient nuclear translocation in response to mechanical stimuli. Dynamin 2 mutations that are responsible for centronuclear myopathy in humans disorganize the desmin network and deregulate YAP signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, clathrin plaques and associated dynamin 2 are defined here as a new sensor conveying mechanical cues and integrate cell signaling with cytoskeletal regulation.",

We developed a novel Bayesian mapping approach which combines observation-a subjects retinotopic measurements from small amounts of fMRI time-with a prior-a learned retinotopic atlas. This process automatically draws areal boundaries, corrects discontinuities in the measured maps, and predicts validation data more accurately than an atlas alone or independent datasets alone. This new method can be used to improve the accuracy of retinotopic mapping, to analyze large fMRI datasets automatically, and to quantify differences in map properties as a function of health, development and natural variation between individuals.",

Here, utilizing the Ebf2-EGFP transgenic mouse in which EGFP initially labels the preplate neurons then persists in CR cells, we reveal the dynamic transcriptome profiles of early neurogenesis and CR cell differentiation. At E15.5 when Ebf2-EGFP+ cells are mostly CR neurons, single-cell sequencing analysis of purified Ebf2-EGFP+ cells uncovers molecular heterogeneity in CR neurons, but without apparent clustering of cells with distinct regional origins. Along a pseudotemporal trajectory these cells are classified into three different developing states, revealing genetic cascades from early generic neuronal differentiation to late fate specification during the establishment of CR neuron identity and function. Further genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses at multiple early neurogenic stages have revealed the temporal gene expression dynamics of early neurogenesis and distinct histone modification patterns in early differentiating neurons. We have also identified a new set of coding genes and lncRNAs involved in early neuronal differentiation and validated with functional assays In Vitro and In Vivo. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms governing the early differentiation steps during cortical development, especially CR neuron biology, and help understand the developmental basis for cortical function and diseases.",

    "abstract": "To circumvent host immune response, some hymenopteran endo-parasitoids produce virus-like structures in their reproductive apparatus that are injected into the host together with the eggs. These viral-like structures are absolutely necessary for the reproduction of these wasps. The viral evolutionary origin of these viral-like particles has been demonstrated in only a few cases of wasp species all belonging to the Ichneumonoidea superfamily. In addition, the nature of the initial virus-wasp association remains unknown for all. This is either because no closely related descendant infects the wasps, because it has not been sampled yet, or because the virus lineage went extinct. In this paper, we show that the virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by endoparasitoids of Drosophila belonging to the Leptopilina genus (superfamily Cynipoidea) do have a viral origin, solving the debate on their origin. Furthermore, the ancestral donor virus still has close relatives infecting one of the wasp species, thus giving us insights on the ecological interaction that possibly allowed the domestication process. Intriguingly, this contemporary virus is both vertically and horizontally transmitted and has the particularity to manipulate the superparasitism behavior of the wasp. This raises the possibility that behavior manipulation has been instrumental in the birth of such association between wasps and viruses.",

For this, fast replays of previously experienced activities during sleep or after reward experiences are believed to be crucial. But how such replays are generated is still completely unclear.

Our solution builds on well-known concepts, one-shot learning and synfire chains, enhancing them by additional mechanisms using global inhibition and disinhibition. For replays our approach relies on dendritic spikes and cholinergic modulation, as supported by experimental data. We also hypothesize a functional role of disinhibition as a pacemaker during behavioral time.",

In addition, predictions of folded state stability and net charge are displayed as a heatmap for a range of pH and ionic strength conditions. Tools are evaluated in the context of antibodies, their fragments and interactions. Surprisingly, antibody-antigen interfaces are, on average, at least as polar as Fab surfaces. This benchmarking process provides the user with thresholds with which to assess non-polar surface patches, and possible solubility implications, in proteins of interest. Stability heatmaps compare favourably with experimental data for CH2 and CH3 domains. Display and quantification of surface polarity and pH / ionic strength dependence will be useful generally for investigation of protein biophysics.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian X and Y chromosomes share a common evolutionary origin and retain regions of high sequence similarity. This sequence homology can cause the mismapping of short sequencing reads derived from the sex chromosomes and affect variant calling and other downstream analyses. Understanding and correcting this problem is critical for medical genomics and population genomic inference. Here, we characterize how sequence homology can affect analyses on the sex chromosomes and present XYalign, a new tool that: (1) facilitates the inference of sex chromosome complement from next-generation sequencing data; (2) corrects erroneous read mapping on the sex chromosomes; and (3) tabulates and visualizes important metrics for quality control such as mapping quality, sequencing depth, and allele balance. We show how these metrics can be used to identify XX and XY individuals across diverse sequencing experiments, including low and high coverage whole genome sequencing, and exome sequencing. We also show that XYalign corrects mismapped reads on the sex chromosomes, resulting in more accurate variant calling. Finally, we discuss how the flexibility of the XYalign framework can be leveraged for other use cases including the identification of aneuploidy on the autosomes.

    "abstract": "We present a vertex-based model for Drosophila dorsal closure that predicts the mechanics of cell oscillation and contraction from the dynamics of the PAR proteins. Based on experimental observations of how aPKC, Par-6 and Bazooka migrate from the circumference of the apical surface to the medial domain, and how they interact with each other and ultimately regulate the apicomedial actomyosin, we formulate a system of differential equations that capture the key features of the process. The oscillation in cell area in the early phase of dorsal closure results from an intracellular negative feedback loop that involves myosin, an actomyosin regulator, aPKC and Bazooka. In the slow phase, gradual sequestration of apicomedial aPKC into Bazooka clusters causes incomplete disassembly of the myosin network over each cycle of oscillation, thus producing the so-called ratchet. The fast phase of rapid cell and tissue contraction arises when medial myosin, no longer hindered by aPKC, builds up in time and produces sustained contraction. Thus, a minimal set of rules governing the dynamics of the PAR proteins, extracted from experimental observations, can account for all major mechanical outcomes of dorsal closure, including the transitions between its three distinct phases.\\n\\nInsert Received for publication Date and in final form Date",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) are involved in uric acid excretion in humans and mice. Despite evidence suggesting that chicken renal proximal tubular epithelial cells participate in uric acid secretion, the roles of BCRP and MRP4 in chickens remain unclear. This study evaluated the relationship between chicken BCRP and MRP4 expression and renal function in the liver, kidneys, and intestines. Sixty 20-day-old Isa brown laying hens were randomly divided into four groups: a control group (NC) and groups provided with sulfonamide-treated drinking water (SD), a diet supplemented with fishmeal (FM), and an intraperitoneal injection of uric acid (IU). Serum uric acid, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were significantly higher in the SD and IU groups than in the NC group. BCRP and MRP4 levels in the SD and IU groups were significantly increased in the kidneys and ileum and decreased in the liver. In the FM group, BCRP and MRP4 were significantly increased in the kidneys and slightly increased in the ileum. These results demonstrate that chicken BCRP and MRP4 are involved in renal and intestinal uric acid excretion. When renal function is impaired, serum uric acid increased and BCRP and MRP4 in the liver, kidneys, and ileum exhibit compensatory increases; when renal function is normal, serum uric acid changes have no effect on ileum BCRP and MRP4 expression. Therefore, this study may provide the references to the uric acid regulation in human.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is frequent during early mouse embryonic development. Specific histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) have been shown to regulate exon splicing by either directly recruiting splice machinery or indirectly modulating transcriptional elongation. In this study, we hypothesized that hPTMs regulate expression of alternatively spliced genes for specific processes during differentiation. To address this notion, we applied an innovative machine learning approach to relate global hPTM enrichment to AS regulation during mammalian tissue development. We found that specific histone modifications, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1, play a dominant role in skipped exon selection among all the tissues and developmental time points examined. In addition, we used iterative random forest model to identify interactions of several hPTMs that associated with skipped exon selection during tissue development. Collectively, our data demonstrated a link between hPTMs and alternative splicing which will drive further experimental studies on the functional relevance of these modifications to alternative splicing.",

In this study, we present a comparative analysis of the different stages of anther development in naturally occuring hermaphrodite and male sterile populations of G. fragrantissima found in Meghalaya, India. While hermaphrodite flowers had well developed anther lobes, the male sterile flowers formed a white unorganized mass of tissues with a tuft of hairy outgrowth at the tip of the stamens. Histological analyses of progressive anther development in both the lines indicate an abnormal development of the sporogenous tissue in the developing anthers in the male steril line. While anther development in the hermaphrodite line was of the dicotyledonous type, the anthers of male sterile line showed progressive degradation of the sporogenous tissues and wall layers. Pollen development was also disrupted in male sterile line resulting in distorted pollen due to the irregular projection of exine wall. Our results suggest that premature degradation of the sporogenous tissues during anther development determines male sterility in G. fragrantissima.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective ion channel composed of species-and tissue-specific structural and regulatory subunits. However, the contribution of each component to uniporter-mediated activity still remains unclear. Here, we employ an evolutionary and synthetic biology approach to investigate the functional inter-dependence between the pore-forming subunit MCU and the EF-hand protein MICU1. Using phylogenetic profiling and genetic complementation analyses, we show that MCU and MICU1 constitute the minimal eukaryotic unit of the uniporter, pointing towards a strong selective pressure behind their co-occurrence. Heterologous reconstitution of MCU-mediated and MICU1-gated mitochondrial calcium entry in vivo in yeast cells demonstrates that MICU1 per se is essential to protect yeast from MCU-dependent manganese cytotoxicity. Accordingly, MICU1 deletion significantly sensitizes human HEK-293 cells to manganese-induced stress. Our study identifies a critical role of MICU1 in the regulation of MCU ion selectivity, with potential implications for patients with MICU1 deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 20 years, the application of structure-based (G[o]-like) models has ranged from protein folding with coarse-grained models to all-atom representations of large-scale molecular assemblies. While there are many variants that may be employed, the common feature of these models is that some (or all) of the stabilizing energetic interactions are defined based on knowledge of a particular experimentally-obtained conformation. With the generality of this approach, there was a need for a versatile computational platform for designing and implementing this class of models. To this end, the SMOG 2 software package provides an easy-to-use interface, where the user has full control of the model parameters. This software allows the user to edit XML-formatted files in order to provide definitions of new structure-based models. SMOG 2 reads these \\\"template\\\" files and maps the interactions onto specific structures, which are provided in PDB format. The force field files produced by SMOG 2 may then be used to perform simulations with a variety of popular molecular dynamics suites. In this chapter, we describe some of the key features of the SMOG 2 package, while providing examples and strategies for applying these techniques to complex (often large-scale) molecular assemblies, such as the ribosome.",

    "abstract": "Transformation in chromatin organization is one of the most universal markers of carcinogenesis. Microscale chromatin alterations have been a staple of histopathological diagnosis of neoplasia, and nanoscale alterations have emerged as a promising marker for cancer prognostication and the detection of predysplastic changes. While numerous methods have been developed to detect these alterations, most methods for sample preparation remain largely validated via conventional microscopy, and have not been examined with nanoscale sensitive imaging techniques. For these nanoscale sensitive techniques to become standard of care screening tools, new histological protocols must be developed that preserve nanoscale information. Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy has recently emerged as a novel imaging technique sensitive to length scales ranging between 20 and 200 nanometers. As a label-free, high-throughput, and non-invasive imaging technique, PWS microscopy offers many advantages for risk stratification of early cancer, and is an ideal tool to quantify structural information during sample preparation. Therefore, in this work we applied PWS microscopy to systematically evaluate the effects of cytological preparation on the nanoscales changes of chromatin using two cell line models: Hela cells differentially treated with daunorubicin and TP53 differentially mutated ovarian carcinoma cells. Notably, we show that existing cytological preparation can be modified in order to maintain clinically relevant nanoscopic differences, paving the way for the emerging field of nanopathology.",

One of the affected factors, U2AF1, is involved in splice site selection, and the most common change, S34F, alters a conserved nucleic acid binding domain, recognition of the 3-splice site, and alternative splicing of many mRNAs. However, the role that this mutation plays in oncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we have uncovered a non-canonical function of U2AF1, showing that it binds mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and negatively regulates mRNA translation. This splicing-independent role of U2AF1 is altered by the S34F mutation, and polysomal profiling indicates the mutation affects translation of hundreds of mRNA. One functional consequence is increased synthesis of the secreted chemokine interleukin 8 which contributes to metastasis, inflammation, and cancer progression in mice and humans.",

Recent studies in a diverse range of cellular and animal models have shown that SFN is involved in multiple intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell death, cell cycle progression, and cell invasion. In order to better understand the mechanisms of action behind SFN-induced cell death, we undertook an unbiased genome wide screen with the yeast knockout (YKO) library to identify SFN sensitive (SFNS) mutants. Our mutants were enriched with knockouts in genes linked to vacuolar function suggesting a link between this organelle and SFNs mechanism of action in yeast. Our subsequent work revealed that SFN increases the vacuolar pH of yeast cells and that varying the vacuolar pH can alter the sensitivity of yeast cells to the drug. In fact, several mutations that lower the vacuolar pH in yeast actually made the cells resistant to SFN (SFNR). Finally, we show that human lung cancer cells with more acidic compartments are also SFNR suggesting that SFNs mechanism of action identified in yeast may carry over to higher eukaryotic cells.",

    "abstract": "Organismal fitness is relevant in many contexts in biology. The most meaningful experimental measure of fitness is competitive fitness, when two or more entities (e.g., genotypes) are allowed to compete directly. In theory, competitive fitness is simple to measure: an experimental population is initiated with the different types in known proportions and allowed to evolve under experimental conditions to a predefined endpoint. In practice, there are several obstacles to obtaining robust estimates of competitive fitness in multicellular organisms, the most pervasive of which is simply the time it takes to count many individuals of different types from many replicate populations. Methods by which counting can be automated in high throughput are desirable, but for automated methods to be useful, the bias and technical variance associated with the method must be (a) known, and (b) sufficiently small relative to other sources of bias and variance to make the effort worthwhile.\\n\\nThe nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model organism, and the fitness effects of genotype and environmental conditions are often of interest. We report a comparison of three experimental methods of quantifying competitive fitness, in which wild-type strains are competed against GFP-marked competitors under standard laboratory conditions. Population samples were split into three replicates and counted (1) \\\"by eye\\\" from a saved image, (2) from the same image using CellProfiler image analysis software, and (3) with a large particle flow cytometer (a \\\"worm sorter\\\"). From 720 replicate samples, neither the frequency of wild-type worms nor the among-sample variance differed significantly between the three methods. CellProfiler and the worm sorter provide at least a tenfold increase in sample handling speed with little (if any) bias or increase in variance.",

In addition, 25HOCh enhanced methyl-betacyclodextrin-sensitive (Cholesterol-dependent) CRP1-7 anti-viral effects in a fine-tunned isoform-dependent manner. In silico and structural studies suggested that the crosstalk between the anti-viral enhancements of both 25HOCh and CRP1-7 were dependent on protein monomers rather than oligomers but differred among isoforms. The presence of oxidized cholesterols in human atherosclerotic plaques amplifies the importance that similar interactions may have for vascular and/or neurodegenerative diseases during viral infections. In this context, the zebrafish model offers a genetic tool to further investigate how the expression and functions of different CRP isoforms and/or transcript variants may be controlled.",

    "abstract": "Plant species in the family Solanaceae are the usual hosts of potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli ([S]ulc) (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Triozidae). However, the psyllid has also been shown to develop on some species of Convolvulaceae (bindweeds and morning glories). Developmental success on Convolvulaceae is surprising given the rarity of psyllid species worldwide associated with this plant family. We assayed 14 species of Convolvulaceae across four genera (Convolvulus, Calystegia, Ipomoea, Turbina) to identify species that allow development of potato psyllid. Two populations of psyllids were assayed (Texas, Washington). The Texas population overlaps extensively with native Convolvulaceae, whereas Washington State is noticeably lacking in Convolvulaceae. Results of assays were overlain on a phylogenetic analysis of plant species to examine whether Convolvulaceae distantly related to the typical host (potato) were less likely to allow development than species of Convolvulaceae more closely related. Survival was independent of psyllid population and location of the plant species on our phylogenetic tree. We then examined whether presence of a fungal symbiont of Convolvulaceae (Periglandula spp.) affected psyllid survival. These fungi associate with Convolvulaceae and produce a class of mycotoxins (ergot alkaloids) that may confer protection against plant-feeding arthropods. Periglandula was found in 11 of our 14 species, including in two genera (Convolvulus, Calystegia) not previously known to host the symbiont. Of these 11 species, leaf tissues from five contained large quantities of two classes of ergot alkaloids (clavines, amides of lysergic acid) when evaluated by LC-MS/MS. All five species also harbored Periglandula. No ergot alkaloids were detected in species free of the fungal symbiont. Potato psyllid rapidly died on species found to harbor Periglandula and fungus-produced alkaloids, but survived on species in which the mutualism was absent. These results support the hypothesis that a plant-fungus symbiotic relationship affects the suitability of certain Convolvulaceae to potato psyllid.",

    "abstract": "Chemical compounds in the saliva most likely to be associated with obesity are identified in a metabolomic analysis of paired whole saliva and plasma samples from 68 children (10-year old) who have also been evaluated for their gingival redness.\\n\\nResultsThrough metabolomic analysis119 compounds were found only in saliva, 210 only in plasma and 126 in both. The most common plasma metabolites were lipids. The most common saliva metabolites were peptides. Amino acids and their metabolites were common in both samples.\\n\\nSurrogate indicators were identified by computing correlations between saliva and plasma. 29 of the 126 found in both saliva and plasma had significant positive correlation and only 4 of those (urate, creatinine, pipecolate and hydroxyproline) were associated with obesity as potential surrogate biomarkers. The uremic toxin N1-Methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) was also elevated in the saliva of obese children. 21 biochemicals were elevated in both obesity and gingivitis suggesting that some biochemical pathways for gingivitis and obesity are shared.\\n\\nOf the metabolites found only in saliva, 35 were associated with obesity (p<0.01). The most significant was phosphate. Saliva had 53 dipeptides, seven of which were associated with obesity. Two volatile amines (putrescine and cadaverine) and their amino acid precursors (ornithine and lysine) were also associated with obesity.\\n\\nOf the metabolites found only in plasma, 64 were associated with obesity (p<0.01). Significant increases in branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, significant reductions in serotonin, serine, and glycine and increased androgen metabolism are changes observed in 10-year old obese children that have also been reported with adult patients having type II diabetes.\\n\\nConclusionsSalivary urate may be a valuable measure of metabolic disease particularly in association with fructose consumption. Elevated salivary creatinine levels and presence of 2PY suggests a possible association of obesity with developing kidney disease in obese children. Though not a surrogate variable, salivary phosphate, (AUROC= 0.8) could also be an important indicator of obesity. Cadaverine, putrescine and dipeptides are also likely oral bacterial products that could help define the metabolic pathways responsible for obesity. The results of this study indicate that salivary metabolites can be important indicators of developing metabolic disease in children and provide a biochemical signature in the pathways that lead to obesity.",

    "abstract": "The vasodilator effect of apigenin (API) was demonstrated in a number of vascular beds. We aimed to characterize the vasospasmolytic and electrophysiological effects of apigenin (API) in intrarenal arteries (IRAs). The vascular tone of male rat isolated IRAs was recorded with a myograph. Transmembrane Cl- currents through Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCCs), K+ currents through voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels and inwardly rectifier K+ (Kir) channels were recorded with patch clamp in the freshly isolated arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Preincubation with API (10-100 M) concentration-dependently depressed the contractions induced by KCl, 9,11-dideoxy-9,11-methanoepoxy prostaglandin F2 (U46619), phenylephrine and vasopressin without significant preference and the IC50 values were 13.27-26.26 M. Acute application of API elicited instant relaxations in the IRAs precontracted with these vasoconstrictors and the RC50 values were 5.80-24.33 M. API relaxation was attenuated by chloride deprivation, CaCC blockers, Kv blocker and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, but not by Kir blocker and cyclooxygenase inhibitor. At 10-100 M, API depressed CaCC currents and Kir currents while enhanced Kv currents of IRA ASMCs. The present results demonstrate that API counteracts various vasoconstrictors noncompetitively and nonspecifically and suggest that modulation of CaCCs, Kv and Kir channels of IRA ASMCs is involved in its vasospasmolytic effects.",

    "abstract": "UVR8 is a plant photoreceptor protein that regulates photomorphogenic and protective responses to UV light. The inactive, homodimeric state absorbs UV-B light resulting in dissociation into monomers, which are considered to be the active state and comprise a {beta}-propeller core domain and intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal tails. The C-terminus is required for functional binding to signalling partner COP1. To date, however, structural studies have only been conducted with the core domain where the terminal tails have been truncated. Here, we report structural investigations of full-length UVR8 using native ion mobility mass spectrometry adapted for photo-activation. We show that, whilst truncated UVR8 photo-converts from a single conformation of dimers to a single monomer conformation, the full-length protein exist in numerous conformational families. The full-length dimer adopts both a compact state and an extended state where the C-terminus is primed for activation. In the monomer the extended C-terminus destabilises the core domain to produce highly extended yet stable conformations, which we propose are the fully active states that bind COP1. Our results reveal the conformational diversity of full-length UVR8. We also demonstrate the potential power of native mass spectrometry to probe functionally important structural dynamics of photoreceptor proteins throughout nature.\\n\\nTOC Graphic\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/371658_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (60K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177c6f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a845c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17db14forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103d4f8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons induces widespread cellular and transcriptional reconfiguration. In this study, we characterized global epigenomic changes during direct reprogramming using whole-genome base-resolution DNA methylome (mC) sequencing. We found that the pioneer transcription factor Ascl1 alone is sufficient for inducing the uniquely neuronal feature of non-CG methylation (mCH), but co-expression of Brn2 and Mytl1 was required to establish a global mCH pattern reminiscent of mature cortical neurons. Ascl1 alone induced strong promoter CG methylation (mCG) of fibroblast specific genes, while BAM overexpression additionally targets a competing myogenic program and directs a more faithful conversion to neuronal cells. Ascl1 induces local demethylation at its binding sites. Surprisingly, co-expression with Brn2 and Mytl1 inhibited the ability of Ascl1 to induce demethylation, suggesting a contextual regulation of transcription factor - epigenome interaction. Finally, we found that de novo methylation by DNMT3A is required for efficient neuronal reprogramming.",

This allows us to assess environment-dependent plant physiology and performance as a function of resource allocation patterns.\\n- To achieve maximal CO2 fixation rates under growth conditions differing from those experienced during their evolution, C4 species need to re-allocate significantly more nitrogen between photosynthetic components than their C3 relatives. As this is linked to a limited phenotypic plasticity, observed resource distributions in C4 plants still reflect optimality in ancestral environments, allowing their quantitative inference.\\n- Our work allows us to quantify environmental effects on resource allocation and performance of photosynthetic organisms.

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional mechanisms, including alternative splicing (AS) and alternative translation initiation (ATI), have been used to explain the protein diversity involved in plant developmental processes and stress responses. Rice germination under hypoxia conditions is a classical model system for the study of low oxygen stress. It is known that there is transcriptional regulation during rice hypoxic germination, but the potential roles of AS and ATI in this process are not well understood. In this study, a proteogenomic approach was used to integrate the data from RNA sequencing, qualitative and quantitative proteomics to discover new players or pathways in the response to hypoxia stress. The improved analytical pipeline of proteogenomics led to the identification of 10,253 intron-containing genes, 1,729 of which were not present in the current annotation. Approximately 1,741 differentially expressed AS (DAS) events from 811 genes were identified in hypoxia-treated seeds in comparison to controls. Over 95% of these were not present in the list of differentially expressed genes (DEG). In particular, regulatory pathways such as spliceosome, ribosome, ER protein processing and export, proteasome, phagosome, oxidative phosphorylation and mRNA surveillance showed substantial AS changes under hypoxia, suggesting that AS responses are largely independent of traditional transcriptional regulation. Massive AS changes were identified, including the preference usage of certain non-conventional splice sites and enrichment of splicing factors in the DAS datasets. In addition, using self-constructed protein libraries by 6-frame translation, thousands of novel proteins/peptides contributed by ATI were identified. In summary, these results provide deeper insights towards understanding the underlying mechanisms of AS and ATI during rice hypoxic germination.",

However, as with any inducible phenomenon, responding to volatile cues may incur physiological and ecological costs that limit plant productivity. In a common garden experiment, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to a single HIPV would decrease herbivore damage at the cost of reduced plant growth and reproduction. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and pepper (Capsicum annuum) plants were exposed to a persistent, low-dose ([~]10ng/hour) of the green leaf volatile cis-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC), which is an HIPV and damage-associated volatile. z3HAC-treated pepper plants were shorter, had less aboveground and belowground biomass, and produced fewer flowers and fruits relative to controls while z3HAC-treated lima bean plants were taller and produced more leaves and flowers than did controls. Natural herbivory was reduced in z3HAC-exposed lima bean plants, but not in pepper. Cyanogenic potential, a putative direct defense mechanism in lima bean, was lower in young z3HAC-exposed leaves, suggesting a growth-defense tradeoff from z3HAC exposure alone. Plant species-specific responses to an identical volatile cue have important implications for agronomic costs and benefits of volatile-mediated inter-plant communication under field conditions.",

    "abstract": "HighlightAlthough large differences in metabolism exist between C3 and CAM species, we find that many CAM genes have shared expression patterns regardless of photosynthetic pathway, suggesting ancestral propensity for CAM.\\n\\nAbstractCrassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a carbon-concentrating mechanism that has evolved numerous times across flowering plants and is thought to be an adaptation to water limited environments. CAM has been investigated from physiological and biochemical perspectives, but little is known about how plants evolve from C3 to CAM at the genetic or metabolic level. Here we take a comparative approach in analyzing time-course data of C3, CAM, and C3+CAM intermediate Yucca (Asparagaceae) species. RNA samples were collected over a 24-hour period from both well-watered and drought-stressed plants and were clustered based on time-dependent expression patterns. Metabolomic data reveals differences in carbohydrate metabolism and antioxidant response between the CAM and C3 species, suggesting changes to metabolic pathways are important for CAM evolution and function. However, all three species share expression profiles of canonical CAM pathway genes, regardless of photosynthetic pathway. Despite differences in transcript and metabolite profiles between the C3 and CAM species, shared time-structured expression of CAM genes in both CAM and C3 Yucca species suggests ancestral expression patterns required for CAM may have predated its origin in Yucca.",

We show that these bacteria eject their flagella at the base of the flagellar hook when nutrients are depleted, leaving a relic of a former flagellar motor in the outer membrane. Subtomogram averages of the full motor and relic reveal that this is an active process, as a plug protein appears in the relic, likely to prevent leakage across their outer membrane.

At the molecular level, Bcl6 acts through both generic and pathway-specific mechanisms. Our data identify a molecular logic by which a single cell-intrinsic factor ensures robustness of neural cell fate transition by decreasing responsiveness to the extrinsic pathways that favor self-renewal.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is an emerging approach in cancer treatment that activates the host immune system to destroy cancer cells that express unique peptide signatures (neoepitopes). Administrations of cancer-specific neoepitopes in the form of synthetic peptide vaccine have been proven effective in both mouse models and human patients. Because only a tiny fraction of cancer-specific neoepitopes actually elicit immune response, selection of potent, immunogenic neoepitopes remains a challenging step in cancer vaccine development. A basic approach for immunogenicity prediction is based on the premise that effective neoepitope should bind with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with high affinity. In this study, we developed MHCSeqNet, an open-source deep learning model, which not only competes favorably with state-of-the-art predictors but also exhibits promising generalization to new MHC class I and class II alleles. MHCSeqNet employed neural network architectures developed for natural language processing to model amino acid sequence representations of MHC allele and epitope peptide as sentences with amino acids as individual words. This consideration allows MHCSeqNet to accept new MHC alleles as well as peptides of any length. The flexibility offered by MHCSeqNet should make it a valuable tool for screening effective neoepitopes in cancer vaccine development.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationhttps://github.com/cmbcu/MHCSeqNet",

    "abstract": "Organisms are classified into three domains, Prokaryota, Archaea, and Eukaryota, and their evolutionary divergence has been characterized based on morphological and molecular features using rationale based on Darwins theory of natural selection. However, universal rules that govern genome evolution have not been identified. Here, a simple, innovative approach has been developed to evaluate biological evolution initiating the origin of life: whole genomes were divided into several fragments, and then differences in normalized nucleotide content between nucleotide pairs were compared. Based on nucleotide content structures, Monosiga brevicollis mitochondria may be the most primitive extant ancestor of the species examined here. The two normalized nucleotide contents are universally expressed by a linear regression line, (X - Y)/(X + Y) = a (X - Y) + b, where X and Y are nucleotide contents and (a) and (b) are constants. The value of (G + C), (G + A), (G + T), (C + A), (C + T) and (A + T) was ~0.5. Plotting (X - Y)/(X + Y) against X/Y showed a logarithmic function (X - Y)/(X + Y) = a ln X/Y + b, where (a) and (b) are constant. Nucleotide content changes are expressed by a definitive equation, (X - Y) {approx} 0.25 ln(X/Y).",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a recently emerged flaviviral pathogen, has been linked to microcephaly in neonates1. Yet, it is not understood why some fetuses develop severe microcephaly due to maternal ZIKV infection while others do not. The risk for ZIKV-induced microcephaly is greatest during the first trimester of pregnancy in humans2,3, yet this alone cannot account for the varied presentation of microcephaly observed. Given the antigenic similarity between ZIKV and closely related dengue virus (DENV)4, combined with the substantial immunity to DENV in ZIKV target populations in recent outbreaks, we hypothesized that maternal antibodies against DENV could promote ZIKV-induced microcephaly. Here, using immune-competent mice, we show that maternal to fetal transmission of ZIKV occurs, leading to fetal infection and disproportionate microcephaly. DENV-specific antibodies in pregnant female mice enhance vertical transmission of infection and result in a severe microcephaly like-syndrome during ZIKV infection. Furthermore, fetal infection was promoted by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN). Our results identify a novel immune-mediated mechanism of vertical transmission of viral infection and raise caution since ZIKV epidemic regions are also endemic to DENV.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo understand how a metazoan cell makes the decision to differentiate, we assessed the role of stochastic gene expression (SGE) during the erythroid differentiation process. Our hypothesis is that stochastic gene expression has a role in single-cell decision-making. In agreement with this hypothesis, we and others recently showed that SGE significantly increased during differentiation. However, evidence for the causative role of SGE is still lacking. Such demonstration would require being able to experimentally manipulate SGE levels and analyze the resulting impact of these variations on cell differentiation.\\n\\nResultWe identified three drugs that modulate SGE in primary erythroid progenitor cells. Artemisinin and Indomethacin simultaneously decreased SGE and reduced the amount of differentiated cells. Inversely, -methylene-{gamma}-butyrolactone-3 (MB-3) simultaneously increased the level of SGE and the amount of differentiated cells. We then used a dynamical modelling approach which confirmed that differentiation rates were indeed affected by the drug treatment.\\n\\nConclusionUsing single-cell analysis and modeling tools, we provide experimental evidence that in a physiologically relevant cellular system, control of SGE can directly modify differentiation, supporting a causal link between the two.",

    "abstract": "While buffer cocktails remain the gold-standard for photostabilization and photoswitching of fluorescent markers, intramolecular triplet-state quenchers emerge as an alternative strategy to impart fluorophores with  self-healing or even functional properties such as photoswitching. In this contribution, we evaluated various combinations of both approaches and show that inter- and intramolecular triplet-state quenching processes compete with each other rather than being additive or even synergistic. Often intramolecular processes dominate the photophysical situation for combinations of covalently-linked and solution-based photostabilizers and photoswitching agents. In this context we identified a new function of intramolecular photostabilizers, i.e., protection of fluorophores from reversible off-switching events caused by solution-additives, which were previously misinterpreted as photobleaching. Our studies also provide practical guidance for usage of photostabilizer-dye conjugates for STORM-type super-resolution microscopy permitting the exploitation of their improved photophysics for increased spatio-temporal resolution. Finally, we provide evidence that the biochemical environment, e.g., proximity of aromatic amino-acids such as tryptophan, reduces the photostabilization efficiency of commonly used buffer cocktails. Not only have our results important implications for a deeper mechanistic understanding of self-healing dyes, but they will provide a general framework to select label positions for optimal and reproducible photostability or photoswitching kinetics.",

    "abstract": "Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is an essential technique for quantifying various characteristics of cellular processes,i.e. cell survival, migration, and differentiation. To perform high-throughput quantification of cellular processes, nuclei segmentation and tracking should be performed in an automated manner. Nevertheless, nuclei segmentation and tracking are challenging tasks due to embedded noise, intensity inhomogeneity, shape variation as well as a weak boundary of nuclei. Although several nuclei segmentation approaches have been reported in the literature, dealing with embedded noise remains the most challenging part of any segmentation algorithm. We propose a novel denoising algorithms, based on sparse coding, that can both enhance very faint and noisy nuclei but simultaneously detect nuclei position accurately. Furthermore our method is based on a limited number of parameters,with only one being critical, which is the approximate size of the objects of interest. We also show that our denoising method coupled with classical segmentation method works properly in the context of the most challenging cases. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we tested our method on two datasets from the cell tracking challenge. Across all datasets, the proposed method achieved satisfactory results with 96.96% recall for C.elegans dataset. Besides, in Drosophila dataset, our method achieved very high recall (99.3%).",

    "abstract": "When organisms coevolve, any change in one species can induce phenotypic changes in traits and ecology of the other species. The role such interactions play in ecosystems is central, but their mechanistic bases remain underexplored. Upper trophic level species have to synchronize their life-cycle to both abiotic conditions and to lower trophic level species phenology and phenotypic variations. We tested the effect of host seasonal strategy on parasitoid diapause induction by using a holocyclic clone of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum producing asexual and sexual morphs that are viviparous females (i.e. laying embryos) and oviparous females (laying eggs), respectively, the latter being only present at the end of the growing season. Aphidius ervi parasitoids from populations of contrasted climatic origin (harsh vs. mild winter areas) were allowed to parasitize each morph in a split-brood design and developing parasitoids were next reared under either fall-like or summer-like temperature-photoperiod conditions. We next examined aspects of the host physiological state by comparing the relative proportion of forty-seven metabolites and lipid reserves in both morphs produced under the same conditions. We found that oviparous morphs are cues per se for diapause induction; parasitoids entered diapause at higher levels when developing in oviparous hosts (19.4 {+/-} 3.0%) than in viviparous ones (3.6 {+/-} 1.3%), under summer-like conditions (i.e., when oviparous aphids appear in the fields). This pattern was only observed in parasitoids from the harsh winter area since low diapause levels were observed in the other population, suggesting local adaptations to overwintering cues. Metabolomics analyses show parasitoids response to be mainly influenced by the hosts physiology, with higher proportion of polyols and sugars, and more fat reserves being found in oviparous morphs. Host quality thus varies across the seasons and represents one of the multiple environmental parameters affecting parasitoid diapause. Our results underline strong coevolutionary processes between hosts and parasitoids in their area of origin, likely leading to phenological synchronization, and we point out the importance of such bottom-up effects for trait expression, and for the provision of ecosystem services such as biological control in the context of climate change.",

Clinical detection of mixoploidy is important for diagnosis.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a method to detect mixoploidy from clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) data through the identification of excess of variant calls centered on unusual B-allele frequencies.

    "abstract": "We discovered a virus infecting Entomophthora muscae, a behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen of dipterans. The virus, which we name Entomophthovirus, is a capsid-forming, positive-strand RNA virus in the viral family iflaviridae, whose known members almost exclusively infect insects. We show that the virus RNA is expressed at high levels in fungal cells in vitro and during in vivo infections of Drosophila melanogaster, and that virus particles are present in E. muscae. Two close relatives of the virus had been previously described as insect viruses based on the presence of viral genomes in transcriptomes assembled from RNA extracted from wild dipterans. By analyzing sequencing data from these earlier reports, we show that both dipteran samples were co-infected with E. muscae. We also find the virus in RNA sequencing data from samples of two other species of dipterans, Musca domestica and Delia radicum, known to be infected with E. muscae. These data establish that Entomophthovirus is widely, and seemingly obligately, associated with E. muscae. As other members of the iflaviridae cause behavioral changes in insects, we speculate on the possibility that Entomophthovirus plays a role in E. muscae involved host manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is assumed to consist of a process that sustains memory representations in an active state (maintenance) and a process that operates on these activated representations (manipulation). Prior fMRI studies have examined maintenance and manipulation in separate task conditions, whereas in real life these processes operate simultaneously. In the current study, the neural mechanisms of maintenance and manipulation were disentangled during the same task by parametrically varying these processes. During fMRI, participants maintained consonant letters in WM while sorting them in alphabetical order. Maintenance was investigated by varying the number of letters held in WM and manipulation by varying the number of moves required to sort the list alphabetically. The study yielded three main findings. First, the degree of both maintenance and manipulation demand had significant effects on behavior that were associated with different cortical regions: maintenance was associated with bilateral prefrontal and left parietal cortex, and manipulation with right parietal activity, a link that is consistent with the role of parietal cortex in symbolic computations. Second, univariate fMRI and tractography based on diffusion-weighted imaging showed that maintenance and manipulation regions are supported by two dissociable structural networks. Finally, maintenance and manipulation functional networks became increasingly segregated with increasing demand, possibly reflecting the protection of information held in WM from interference generated by manipulation operations. These results represent a novel approach to study the brain as an adaptive system that coordinates multiple ongoing cognitive processes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDespite the importance of working memory (WM) in everyday life, little is known about how the brain is able to simultaneously maintain and manipulate information stored in short-term memory buffers. We examined evidence for two distinct, concurrent cognitive functions supporting maintenance and manipulation abilities by testing brain activity as participants performed a WM alphabetization task. We found behavioral and neural evidence in support of dissociable cognitive functions associated with these two operations. Furthermore, we found that connectivity between these networks was increasingly segregated as difficulty increased, and that this effect was positively related to individual WM ability. These results provide evidence that network segregation may act as a protective mechanism to enable successful performance under increasing WM demand.",

    "abstract": "Most experiments using EEG recordings take place in highly isolated and restricted environments, limiting their applicability to real-life scenarios. New technologies for mobile EEG are changing this by allowing EEG recording to take place outside of the laboratory. However, before results from experiments performed outside the laboratory can be fully understood, the effects of ecological stimuli on brain activity during cognitive tasks must be examined. In this experiment, participants performed an auditory oddball task while also listening to concurrent background noises of silence, white noise and outdoor ecological sounds, as well as a condition in which the tones themselves were at a low volume. We found a significantly increased N1 and decreased P2 when participants performed the task with outdoor sounds and white noise in the background, with the largest differences in the outdoor sound condition. This modulation in the N1 and P2 replicates what we have previously found outside while people ride bicycles (Scanlon et al., 2017). No behavioural differences were found in response to the target tones. We interpret these modulations in early ERPs as indicative of sensory filtering of background sounds, and that ecologically valid sounds require more filtering than synthetic sounds. Our results reveal that much of what we understand about the brain will need to be updated as we step outside the lab.",

Biosynthesis is initiated by the N-acylation of the amino acid and this is followed by subsequent O-acylation of the acylated molecule resulting in the production of the mature diacylated amino acid lipid. In this study we use both genetics and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to characterize the biosynthesis and function of novel diacylated glycine lipid (GL) species in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. We, and others, have previously reported the identification of a gene, named glsB in this study, that encodes a N-acyltransferase activity responsible for the production of a monoacylated glycine called N-acyl-3-hydroxy-palmitoyl glycine (or commendamide). In all of the Bacteroidales genomes so far sequenced the glsB gene is located immediately downstream from a gene, named glsA, also predicted to encode a protein with acyltransferase activity. We use LC-MS to show that co-expression of glsB and glsA results in the production of GL in Escherichia coli. We constructed a deletion mutant of the glsB gene in B. thetaiotaomicron and we confirm that glsB is required for the production of GL in B. thetaiotaomicron. Moreover, we show that glsB is important for the ability of B. thetaiotaomicron to adapt to stress and colonize the mammalian gut. Therefore, this report is the first to describe the genetic requirements for the biosynthesis of GL, a novel diacylated amino acids species that contributes to fitness in the human gut bacterium, B. thetaiotaomicron.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian models of behavior suggest that organisms represent uncertainty associated with sensory variables. However, the neural code of uncertainty remains elusive. A central hypothesis is that uncertainty is encoded in the population activity of cortical neurons in the form of likelihood functions. We studied the neural code of uncertainty by simultaneously recording population activity from the primate visual cortex during a visual categorization task in which trial-to-trial uncertainty about stimulus orientation was relevant for the decision. We decoded the likelihood function from the trial-to-trial population activity and found that it predicted decisions better than a point estimate of orientation. This remained true when we conditioned on the true orientation, suggesting that internal fluctuations in neural activity drive behaviorally meaningful variations in the likelihood function. Our results establish the role of population-encoded likelihood functions in mediating behavior, and provide a neural underpinning for Bayesian models of perception.",

    "abstract": "Behaviors such as territorial interactions among individuals can modulate vertebrate physiology and vice versa. Testosterone has been pointed out as a key hormone that can be rapidly affected by aggressive interactions. However, experimental evidence for such a link is mixed. In addition, behaviors can elicit changes in multiple hormones, which in turn have the potential to synergistically feedback to behavior. For example testosterone and progesterone can act interdependently in modulating male behavior. However, if aggression can affect progesterone levels in males remain unknown and - to the best of our knowledge - no one has yet tackled if and how aggressive behavior simultaneously affects testosterone and progesterone in free-living animals. We addressed these questions by performing simulated territorial intrusion experiments measuring both hormones and their ratio in male rufous horneros (Aves, Furnarius rufus) during the mating and parental care periods. Aggression affected testosterone and progesterone differentially depending on the period of testing: challenged birds had higher levels of progesterone during the mating period and lower levels of testosterone during parental care compared to controls. Challenged individuals had similar progesterone to testosterone ratios during both periods and these ratios were higher than those of control birds. In summary, territorial aggression triggered hormonal pathways differentially depending on the stage of the breeding cycle, but equally altered their ratio independent of it. Our results indicate that multiple related hormones could be playing a role rather than each hormone alone in response to social interactions.",

Carrier domains shuttle substrates and intermediates as covalently attached cargo within the enzyme complex between active sites.

Alternating interactions of substrate-loaded carrier domains with different catalytic domains modulate the chemical environment. In this study, we aim at assessing the impact of domain-domain interactions (DDIs) on the reaction progress of a multienzyme type I fatty acid synthase (FAS) in quantitative terms. We modulate DDIs by single interface mutations, and read out the impact on substrate shuttling by recording fatty acid (FA) chain length product spectra and FAS activities. Our data show that even single interface point mutations can severely affect FA synthesis. With molecular dynamics simulations and modeling, we relate the mutation effects to specific alterations in the molecular interaction networks and domain-domain binding energetics. Some of the presented mutations induce the synthesis of short-chain FAs. These compounds are important commodity products and potent precursors for microbial biofuel production.",

In this note, I explain why this interpretation is problematic. I also introduce a new measure of the mean age at reproduction and show that it can be very different from the mean age of parents of offspring of a cohort. In particular, the mean age of parents of offspring of a cohort systematically overestimates the mean age at reproduction, and can even be greater than the expected lifespan of parents.",

    "abstract": "Difficulties in identifying causal variants and genes underlying genetic associations have limited the translational potential of genetic studies of body fat distribution, an important, partly-heritable risk factor for cardio-metabolic disease. Rare variant associations facilitate fine-mapping of causal alleles, but their contribution to fat distribution is understudied. We performed a genome-wide scan of rare nonsynonymous variants for body mass index-adjusted waist-to-hip-ratio (BMI-adjusted WHR; a widely-used measure of fat distribution) in 450,562 European ancestry individuals, followed by systematic Bayesian fine-mapping at six genome-wide (p<5x10-08; main-analysis) and two subthreshold signals (significant at a Bonferroni-corrected p<1.3x10-06). We found strong statistical evidence of causal association for nonsynonymous alleles in CALCRL (p.L87P, pconditional=5.9x10-12; posterior-probability of association [PPA]=52%), PLIN1 (p.L90P, pconditional=5.5x10-13; PPA>99%), PDE3B (p.R783X, pconditional=6.2x10-15; PPA>99%), ACVR1C (p.I195T; pconditional=5.4x10-12; PPA>99%), and FGF1 (p.G21E, pconditional=1.6x10-07; PPA=98%). Alleles at the four likely-causal main-analysis genes affected fat distribution primarily via larger hip-rather than smaller waist-circumference and six of nine conditionally-independent WHR-lowering index-variants were associated with protection from cardiovascular or metabolic disease. All four genes are expressed in adipose tissue and have been linked with the regulation of intracellular lipolysis, which controls fat retention in mature cells. Targeted follow-up analyses of key intracellular-lipolysis genes revealed associations for a variant in the initiator of intracellular lipolysis PNPLA2 (p.N252K) with higher BMI-adjusted-WHR and higher cardio-metabolic risk. This study provides human genetic evidence of a link between intracellular lipolysis, fat-distribution and its cardio-metabolic complications in the general population.",

A significant percentage of reads, however, frequently remain unmapped despite improvements in the methods and hardware, which have enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of alignments. Usually unmapped reads are discarded from the analysis process, but significant biological information and insights can be uncovered from this data. We explored the unmapped DNA (normal and bisulfite treated) and RNA sequence reads of the great tit (Parus major) reference genome individual. From the unmapped reads we generated de novo assemblies. The generated sequence contigs were then aligned to the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database using BLAST, identifying the closest known matching sequence.\\n\\nResultsMany of the aligned contigs showed sequence similarity to sequences from different bird species and genes that were absent in the great tit reference assembly. Furthermore, there were also contigs that represented known P. major pathogenic species. Most interesting were several species of blood parasites such as Plasmodium and Trypanosoma.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analyses revealed that meaningful biological information can be found when further exploring unmapped reads. It is possible to discover sequences that are either absent or misassembled in the reference genome and sequences that indicate infection or sample contamination. In this study we also propose strategies to aid the capture and interpretation of this information from unmapped reads.",

This pathway allows homologous chromosomes to find each other and the formation of crossing overs, the products of reciprocal exchanges, which are required for proper chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division. Meiotic DSBs are catalyzed by Spo11 that forms a complex with a second subunit, TopoVIBL, and mediates a DNA type II topoisomerase-like cleavage. Several other proteins are essential for meiotic DSB formation, including three evolutionarily conserved proteins first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Mer2, Mei4 and Rec114). These three S. cerevisiae proteins and their mouse orthologs (IHO1, MEI4 and REC114) co-localize on the axes of meiotic chromosomes, and mouse IHO1 and MEI4 are essential for meiotic DSB formation.

We then demonstrated in vitro the formation of a stable complex between REC114 C-terminal domain and MEI4 N-terminal domain. We further determine the structure of REC114 N-terminal domain that revealed similarity with Pleckstrin Homology domains and its property to dimerize.

    "abstract": "Thyroid dyshormonogenesis is a leading cause of congenital hypothyroidism, a highly prevalent but treatable condition. Thyroid hormone synthesis is dependent on the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In humans, the primary sources for ROS production during thyroid hormone synthesis are the NADPH oxidase, DUOX1 and DUOX2. Indeed mutations in DUOX1 and DUOX2 have been linked with congenital hypothyroidism. Unlike humans, zebrafish has a single orthologue for DUOX1 and DUOX2. In this study, we investigated the phenotypes associated with two nonsense mutant alleles of the single duox gene in zebrafish, sa9892 and sa13017. Both alleles gave rise to readily observable phenotypes reminiscent of congenital hypothyroidism, from the larval stages through to adulthood. By using various methods to examine the external and internal phenotypes, we discovered a strong correlation between TH synthesis and duox function, beginning from the early larval stage, when T4 levels are already noticeably absent in the mutants. Loss of T4 production resulted in growth retardation, pigmentation defects, ragged fins, thyroid hyperplasia / external goiter, and infertility. Remarkably all of these defects associated with chronic congenital hypothyroidism could be rescued with T4 treatment, even when initiated when the fish had already reached adulthood. Our work suggests that these zebrafish duox mutants may provide a powerful model to understand the aetiology of untreated and treated congenital hypothyroidism even in advance stages of development.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe leaf economics spectrum (LES) is based on a suite of leaf traits related to plant functioning and ranges from resource-conservative to resource-acquisitive strategies. However, the relationships with root traits, and the associated belowground plant functioning such as N uptake, including nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+), is still poorly known. Additionally, environmental variations occurring both in time and in space could uncouple LES from root traits. We explored, in subalpine grasslands, the relationships between leaf and root morphological traits for 3 dominant perennial grass species, and to what extent they contribute to the whole-plant economics spectrum. We also investigated the link between this spectrum and NO3- and NH4+ uptake rates, as well as the variations of uptake across four grasslands differing by the land-use history at peak biomass and in autumn. Although poorly correlated with leaf traits, root traits contributed to an economic spectrum at the whole plant level. Higher NH4+ and NO3- uptake abilities were associated with the resource-acquisitive strategy.\n\nNonetheless, NH4+ and NO3- uptake within species varied between land-uses and with sampling time, suggesting that LES and plant traits are good, but still incomplete, descriptors of plant functioning. Although the NH4+: NO3- uptake ratio was different between plant species in our study, they all showed a preference for NH4+, and particularly the most conservative species. Soil environmental variations between grasslands and sampling times may also drive to some extent the NH4+ and NO3- uptake ability of species. Our results support the current efforts to build a more general framework including above- and below-ground processes when studying plant community functioning.",

    "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that pervasive gene tree conflict underlies several important phylogenetic relationships where different species tree methods produce conflicting results. Here, we present a means of dissecting the phylogenetic signal for alternative resolutions within a dataset in order to resolve recalcitrant relationships and, importantly, identify what the dataset is unable to resolve. These procedures extend upon methods for isolating conflict and concordance involving specific candidate relationships and can be used to identify systematic error and disambiguate sources of conflict among species tree inference methods. We demonstrate these on a large phylogenomic plant dataset. Our results support the placement of Amborella as sister to the remaining extant angiosperms, Gnetales as sister to pines, and the monophyly of extant gymnosperms. Several other contentious relationships, including the resolution of relationships within the bryophytes and the eudicots, remain uncertain given the low number of supporting gene trees. To address whether concatenation of filtered genes amplified phylogenetic signal for relationships, we implemented a combinatorial heuristic to test combinability of genes. We found that nested conflicts limited the ability of data filtering methods to fully ameliorate conflicting signal amongst gene trees. These analyses confirmed that the underlying conflicting signal does not support broad concatenation of genes. Our approach provides a means of dissecting a specific dataset to address deep phylogenetic relationships while also identifying the inferential boundaries of the dataset.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome duplication (WGD) has been recognized as a significant evolutionary force in the origin and diversification of vertebrates, plants, and other organisms. Acropora, one of the most speciose reef-building coral genera, responsible for creating spectacular but increasingly threatened marine ecosystems, is suspected to have originated by polyploidy, yet there is no genetic evidence to support this hypothesis. Using comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative genomic approaches, we analyzed five Acropora genomes and an Astreopora genome (Scleractinia: Acroporidae) to show that a WGD event likely occurred between 27.9 and 35.7 Million years ago (Mya) in the most recent common ancestor of Acropora, concurrent with a massive worldwide coral extinction. We found that duplicated genes became highly enriched in gene regulation functions, some of which are involved in stress responses. The different functional clusters of duplicated genes are related to the divergence of gene expression patterns during development. Some gene duplications of proteinaceous toxins were generated by WGD in Acropora compared with other Cnidarian species. Collectively, this study provides evidence for an ancient WGD event in corals and it helps to explain the origin and diversification of Acropora.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) proteins are an important family of chromosomal proteins conserved among all major eukaryotic lineages. While HP1 proteins are best known for their role in heterochromatin, many HP1 proteins function in euchromatin as well. As a group, HP1 proteins carry out diverse functions, playing roles in the regulation of gene expression, genome stability, chromatin structure, and DNA repair. While the heterochromatic HP1 proteins are well studied, our knowledge of HP1 proteins with euchromatic distribution is lagging behind. We have created the first mutations in HP1B, a Drosophila HP1 protein with euchromatic function, and the Drosophila homolog most closely related to mammalian HP1, HP1{beta}, and HP1{gamma}. We find that HP1B is a non-essential protein in Drosophila, with mutations affecting fertility and animal activity levels. In addition, animals lacking HP1B show altered food intake and higher body fat levels. Gene expression analysis of animals lacking HP1B demonstrates that genes with functions in various metabolic processes are affected primarily by HP1B loss. Our findings suggest that there is a link between the chromatin protein HP1B and the regulation of metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Grey wolves (Canis lupus) are one of the few large terrestrial carnivores that maintained a wide geographic distribution across the Northern Hemisphere throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene. Recent genetic studies have suggested that, despite this continuous presence, major demographic changes occurred in wolf populations between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, and that extant wolves trace their ancestry to a single late Pleistocene population. Both the geographic origin of this ancestral population and how it became widespread remain a mystery. Here we analyzed a large dataset of novel modern and ancient mitochondrial wolf genomes, spanning the last 50,000 years, using a spatially and temporally explicit modeling framework to show that contemporary wolf populations across the globe trace their ancestry to an expansion from Beringia at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum - a process most likely driven by the significant ecological changes that occurred across the Northern Hemisphere during this period. This study provides direct ancient genetic evidence that long-range migration has played an important role in the population history of a large carnivore and provides an insight into how wolves survived the wave of megafaunal extinctions at the end of the last glaciation. Moreover, because late Pleistocene grey wolves were the likely source from which all modern dogs trace their origins, the demographic history described in this study has fundamental implications for understanding the geographical origin of the dog.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is now widely recognized as a dynamic ecosystem that plays an important role in health and disease1. While current sequencing technologies make it possible to estimate relative abundances of host-associated bacteria over time2, 3, the biological processes governing their dynamics remain poorly understood. Therefore, as in other ecological systems4, 5, it is important to identify quantitative relationships describing global aspects of gut microbiota dynamics. Here we use multiple high-resolution time series data obtained from humans and mice6-8 to demonstrate that despite their inherent complexity, gut microbiota dynamics can be characterized by several robust scaling relationships. Interestingly, these patterns are highly similar to those previously observed across diverse ecological communities and economic systems, including the temporal fluctuations of animal and plant populations9-12 and the performance of publicly traded companies13. Specifically, we find power law relationships describing short- and long-term changes in gut microbiota abundances, species residence and return times, and the connection between the mean and variance of species abundances. The observed scaling relationships are altered in mice receiving different diets and affected by context-specific perturbations in humans. We use these macroecological relationships to reveal specific bacterial taxa whose dynamics are significantly affected by dietary and environmental changes. Overall, our results suggest that a quantitative macroecological framework will be important for characterizing and understanding complex dynamics of microbial communities.",

Tauopathy correlates with significant neuronal death, but the links between tau aggregation, propagation, neuronal dysfunction and death remain poorly understood, and the direct functional consequences for the neuron containing the tau aggregates are unclear. Here, by monitoring individual neurons within a minimal circuit, we demonstrate that misfolded tau efficiently spreads from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons. Within postsynaptic cells, tau aggregates initially in distal axons, while proximal axons remain free of tau pathology. In the presence of tau aggregates neurons display axonal transport deficits, but remain viable and electrically competent. This shows that misfolded tau species are not immediately toxic to neurons, and suggests that propagation of misfolded tau is an early event in disease, occurring prior to neuronal dysfunction and cell death.",

The lifetime number of spontaneous abortions was estimated for a \\\"canonical\\\" woman (constrained to have average age at marriage, first birth, inter-birth intervals, and family size) in two populations: one with and the other without effective birth control (including free access to elective abortions).

Envelope membrane proteins integrate the chloroplast with the cell, but the biogenesis of the envelope membrane remains elusive. We show that the maize defective kernel5 (dek5) locus is critical for plastid membrane biogenesis. Amyloplasts and chloroplasts are larger and reduced in number in dek5 with multiple ultrastructural defects. We show that dek5 encodes a protein homologous to rice SUBSTANDARD STARCH GRAIN4 (SSG4) and E.coli tamB. TamB functions in bacterial outer membrane biogenesis. The DEK5 protein is localized to the chloroplast envelope with a topology analogous to TamB. Increased levels of soluble sugars in dek5 developing endosperm and elevated osmotic pressure in mutant leaf cells suggest defective intracellular solute transport. Both proteomics and antibody-based analyses show that dek5 chloroplasts have reduced levels of chloroplast envelope transporters. Moreover, dek5 chloroplasts reduce inorganic phosphate uptake with at least an 80% reduction relative to normal chloroplasts. These data suggest that DEK5 functions in plastid envelope biogenesis to enable metabolite transport.",

In the axons of mammalian neurons, mitochondria have been shown to respond to glucose levels by halting active transport preferentially in high glucose regions. Here, we employ quantitative modeling to explore the physical limits on spatial organization of organelles through such regulated stopping of processive motion, as well as the consequences to cellular metabolism. We delineate the role of key parameters, including cellular glucose uptake and consumption rates, that are expected to modulate mitochondrial distribution and metabolic response in spatially varying glucose conditions. Our quantitative estimates indicate that physiological brain glucose levels fall within the limited range necessary for metabolic enhancement, making this a plausible regulatory mechanism for neuronal metabolic flexibility in the presence of spatially heterogeneous glucose. These findings highlight the role of spatial organization in the regulation of neuronal metabolism, while providing a quantitative framework for the establishment of such organization by control of organelle trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a specialized monolayer of pigmented cells within the eye that is critical for maintaining visual system function. Diseases affecting the RPE have dire consequences for vision, and the most prevalent of these is atrophic (dry) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is thought to result from RPE dysfunction and degeneration. An intriguing possibility for treating RPE degenerative diseases like atrophic AMD is the stimulation of endogenous RPE regeneration; however, very little is known about the mechanisms driving successful RPE regeneration in vivo. Here, we developed a zebrafish transgenic model (rpe65a:nfsB-GFP) that enabled ablation of large swathes of mature RPE. RPE ablation resulted in rapid RPE degeneration, as well as degeneration of Bruchs membrane and underlying photoreceptors. Using this model, we demonstrate for the first time that larval and adult zebrafish are capable of regenerating a functional RPE monolayer after RPE ablation. Regenerated RPE cells first appear at the periphery of the RPE, and regeneration proceeds in a peripheral-to-central fashion. RPE ablation elicits a robust proliferative response in the remaining RPE. Subsequently, proliferative cells move into the injury site and differentiate into RPE. BrdU pulse-chase analyses demonstrate that the regenerated RPE is likely derived from remaining peripheral RPE cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling significantly reduces cell proliferation in the RPE and delays overall RPE recovery. These data demonstrate that the zebrafish RPE possesses a robust capacity for regeneration and highlight a potential mechanism through which endogenous RPE regenerate in vivo.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDiseases resulting in RPE degeneration are among the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and no therapy exists that can replace RPE or restore lost vision. One intriguing possibility is the development of therapies focused on stimulating endogenous RPE regeneration. For this to be possible, we must first gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying RPE regeneration. Here, we ablate mature RPE in zebrafish and demonstrate that zebrafish regenerate RPE after widespread injury. Injury-adjacent RPE proliferate and regenerate RPE, suggesting that they are the source of regenerated tissue. Finally, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling is required for RPE regeneration. These findings establish an in vivo model through which the molecular and cellular underpinnings of RPE regeneration can be further characterized.",

Using Kenya as a case study we assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuing PCV use.\\n\\nMethodsWe fitted a dynamic compartmental model of pneumococcal carriage to annual carriage prevalence surveys and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in Kilifi, Kenya, and predicted disease incidence and related mortality for either continuing PCV use beyond 2022, the start of Kenyas transition from Gavi support, or its discontinuation. We calculated the costs per disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) averted and associated prediction intervals (PI).\\n\\nResultsWe predicted that overall IPD incidence will increase by 93% (PI: 72% - 114%) from 8.5 in 2022 to 16.2 per 100,000 per year in 2032, if PCV use is discontinued. Continuing vaccination would prevent 15,355 (PI: 10,196-21,125) deaths and 112,050 (PI: 79,620- 130,981) disease cases during that time.

The incremental cost per DALY averted of continuing PCV was predicted at $142 (PI: 85 - 252) in 2032.\\n\\nConclusionContinuing PCV use is essential to sustain its health gains. Based on the Kenyan GDP per capita of $1445, and in comparison to other vaccines, continued PCV use at full costs is cost-effective. These arguments support an expansion of the vaccine budget, however, affordability may be a concern.\\n\\nFundingFunded by the Wellcome Trust.",

We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine eras, adjusted for confounding, and reported percent reduction in IPD as 1-IRR. Annual cross-sectional surveys of nasopharyngeal carriage were conducted from 2009-2016.\\n\\nFindingsSurveillance identified 667 IPD cases in 3,211,403 person-years of observation. IPD incidence in children <5 years fell sharply in 2011 following PCV10 introduction, and remained low (PCV10-type IPD: 60{middle dot}8 vs 3{middle dot}2/100,000 [92% reduction; 95%CI: 78, 97]; overall IPD: 81{middle dot}6 vs 15{middle dot}3/100,000 [68% reduction; 95%CI: 40, 83]; 1999-2010 vs 2012-2016).

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo identify migraineurs and headache-free individuals with an online questionnaire and automated analysis algorithm.\\n\\nMethodsWe created a branching-logic, web-based questionnaire--the Penn Online Evaluation of Migraine (POEM)--to obtain standardized headache history from a previously studied cohort. Responses were analyzed with an automated algorithm to assign subjects to one of several categories based on ICHD-3 (beta) criteria. Following a pre-registered protocol, this result was compared to prior diagnostic classification by a neurologist following a direct interview.\\n\\nResultsOf 118 subjects contacted, 90 (76%) completed the questionnaire; of these 31 were headache-free, 29 migraine without aura (MwoA), and 30 migraine with aura (MwA). Mean age was 41 {+/-} 6 years and 76% were female. There were no significant demographic differences between groups. The median time to complete the questionnaire was 2.5 minutes. Sensitivity of the POEM tool was 42%, 59%, and 70%, and specificity was 100%, 84%, and 94% for headache-free, MwoA, and MwA, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of the POEM tool for migraine overall (with or without aura), was 83% and 90%, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsThe POEM web-based questionnaire, and associated analysis routines, identifies headache-free and migraine subjects with good specificity. It may be useful for classifying subjects for large-scale research studies.\\n\\nTrial Registration: https://osf.io/sq9ef",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrug resistance and HIV co-infection are challenges for the global control of tuberculosis.\\n\\nMethodsWe collected Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from adult patients in Cote dIvoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Peru, and Thailand, stratified by HIV status and tuberculosis drug resistance. Molecular or phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was done locally and at the Swiss tuberculosis reference laboratory. We examined mortality during treatment according to DST results and treatment adequacy in logistic regression models adjusting for sex, age, sputum microscopy and HIV status.\\n\\nFindings634 tuberculosis patients were included; median age was 33.2 years, 239 (37.7%) were female, 272 (42.9%) HIV-positive and 69 (10.9%) patients died. Based on the reference laboratory DST, 394 (62.2%) strains were pan-susceptible, 45 (7.1%) mono-resistant, 163 (25.7%) multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB), and 30 (4.7%) had pre-extensive or extensive drug resistance (pre-XDR/XDR-TB). Results of reference and local laboratories were discordant in 121 (19.1%) cases, corresponding to a sensitivity of 84.3% and a specificity of 90.8%. In patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis, discordant results were associated with increased mortality (risk ratio 1.81; 95% CI 1.07-3.07). In logistic regression, compared to adequately treated patients with pan-susceptible strains, the adjusted odds ratio for death was 4.23 (95% CI 2.16-8.29) for adequately treated patients with drug-resistant strains and 21.54 (95% CI 3.36-138.1) for inadequately treated patients with drug-resistant strains. HIV status was not associated with mortality.\\n\\nInterpretationUsing a reference laboratory standard, inaccurate DST leading to inappropriate treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, but not HIV infection, contributed to mortality.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) are highly protective against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes but the burden of pneumococcal disease in developing countries is dominated by pneumonia, most of which is non-bacteraemic. We examined the impact of PCV on pneumonia incidence.\\n\\nMethodsWe linked prospective hospital surveillance for clinically-defined WHO severe or very-severe pneumonia at Kilifi County Hospital from 2002-2015 to population surveillance at Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, comprising 45,000 children aged <5 years. Chest radiographs were read according to a WHO standard. A 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced in Kenya in January 2011. In Kilifi, there was a catch-up campaign for children aged <5 years. We estimated the impact of PCV10 on pneumonia incidence through interrupted time series analysis accounting for seasonal and temporal trends.\\n\\nFindingsThe incidence of admission with clinically-defined pneumonia in 2002/3 was 21{middle dot}7/1000/year in children aged 2-59 months. This declined progressively over 13 years. By the end of March 2011, 61{middle dot}1% of children aged 2-11 months received [&ge;]2 doses and 62{middle dot}3% of children aged 12-59 months received [&ge;]1 dose of PCV10. Adjusted incidence rate ratios for admissions with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, clinically-defined pneumonia, and diarrhoea (control condition), associated with PCV10 introduction, were 0{middle dot}52 (95% CI 0{middle dot}32-0{middle dot}86), 0{middle dot}73 (95% CI 0{middle dot}54-0{middle dot}97) and 0{middle dot}63, (95% CI 0{middle dot}31-1{middle dot}26), respectively. The annual incidence of clinically-defined pneumonia in December 2010 was 12{middle dot}2/1000; this was reduced by 3{middle dot}3/1000 with PCV10 introduction.\\n\\nInterpretationOver 13 years, hospitalisations for clinically-defined pneumonia declined progressively at Kilifi County Hospital but fell abruptly by 27% in association with PCV10 introduction. The incidence of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia fell by 48%. The burden of childhood pneumonia in Kilifi, Kenya, has been reduced substantially by PCV10.\\n\\nFundingGavi, Wellcome Trust",
