    "abstract": "As the cost of DNA sequencing continues to fall, an increasing amount of information on human genetic variation is being produced that could help progress precision medicine. However, information about such mutations is typically first made available in the scientific literature, and is then later manually curated into more standardized genomic databases. This curation process is expensive, time-consuming and many variants do not end up being fully curated, if at all. Detecting mutations in the literature is the first key step towards automating this process. However, most of the current methods have focused on identifying mutations that follow existing nomenclatures. In this work, we show that there is a large number of mutations that are missed by using this standard approach. Furthermore, we implement the first mutation annotator to cover an extended mutation landscape, and we show that its F1 performance is the same performance as human annotation (F1 78.29 for manual annotation vs F1 79.56 for automatic annotation).",

    "abstract": "In animals that communicate for pair formation, generally one sex invests more effort in mate searching. Although searching by males is prevalent in most animals, in orthopteran insects and some other taxa females physically move to localise signalling males who are predominantly sedentary. Although the two sexes thus share mate searching effort in orthopterans, their behavioural strategies are different and sexual selection theory predicts that signalling males may be following the riskier strategy and incurring higher costs. However, relative levels of risk posed by the two mate searching strategies remain largely unexplored. Hence, we estimated the relative predation risk experienced in natural populations by signalling males and responding females. We did this by quantifying predation risk as a probability of mortality in the context of acoustic communication in a tree cricket, Oecanthus henryi from its ecologically relevant predator, a lynx spider, Peucetia viridans. Spiders may perceive calling in males and movement in females by their ability to detect both airborne acoustic cues and substrate-borne vibratory cues. Probability of mortality was quantified by partitioning it into three spatial components at which crickets and spiders interact, using a combination of extensive field observations and manipulative experiments in a semi-natural setup. We found no differences in predation risk faced by calling males and responding females, suggesting that direct benefits offered by males to females upon pair formation may better explain shared mate searching effort between the sexes in orthopterans.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic and evolutionary impacts of fish stocking on wild populations has long been of interest as negative consequences such as reduced fitness and loss of genetic resources are commonly reported. Nearly five decades of extensive stocking of over a million Muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) in the Lower St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) was implemented by managers in an attempt to sustain a fishery. We investigated the effect of stocking on this native species genetic structure and allelic diversity in the St. Lawrence river and its tributaries as well as several stocked inland lakes. Using Genotype-By-Sequencing (GBS), we genotyped 643 individuals representing 22 sampling sites and combined this information with forward simulations to investigate the genetic consequences of stocking. Individuals native to the St. Lawrence watershed were genetically divergent from the sources used for stocking and both the St. Lawrence tributaries and inland lakes were also naturally divergent from the main stem. Empirical data and simulations revealed weak effects of stocking on admixture patterns within the St. Lawrence despite intense stocking in the past, whereas footprints of admixture were higher in the smaller stocked populations from tributaries and lakes. Altogether, our data suggests that selection against introgression has been relatively efficient within the large St. Lawrence River. In contrast, the smaller populations from adjacent tributaries and lakes still displayed stocking related admixture which apparently resulted in higher genetic diversity, suggesting that, while stocking stopped at the same time, its impact remained higher in these populations. Finally, the origin of populations from inland lakes that were established by stocking confirmed their close affinity with these source populations. This study illustrates the benefit of combining extensive genomic data with forward simulations for improved inferences regarding outcomes of population enhancement by stocking, as well as its relevance for fishery management decision making.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluated the power of metagenome measures taken at three time points over the growth test period (weaning, 15 and 22 weeks) to foretell growth and carcass traits in 1039 individuals of a line of crossbred pigs. We measured prediction accuracy as the correlation between actual and predicted phenotypes in a five-fold cross-validation setting. Phenotypic traits measured included live weight measures and carcass composition obtained during the trial as well as at slaughter. We employed a null model excluding microbiome information as a baseline to assess the increase in prediction accuracy stemming from the inclusion of operational taxonomic units (OTU) as predictors. We further contrasted performance of models from the Bayesian alphabet (Bayesian Lasso) as well machine learning approaches (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and semi-parametric kernel models (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space). In most cases, prediction accuracy increased significantly with the inclusion of microbiome data. Accuracy was more substantial with the inclusion of metagenomic information taken at week 15 and 22, with values ranging from approximately 0.30 for loin traits to more than 0.50 for back-fat. Conversely, microbiome composition at weaning resulted in most cases in marginal gains of prediction accuracy, suggesting that later measures might be more useful to include in predictive models. Model choice affected predictions marginally with no clear winner for any model/trait/time point. We, therefore, suggest average prediction across models as a robust strategy in fitting metagenomic information. In conclusion, microbiome composition can effectively be used as a predictor of growth and composition traits, particularly for fatness traits. The inclusion of OTU predictors could potentially be used to promote fast growth of individuals while limiting fat accumulation. Early microbiome measures might not be good predictors of growth and OTU information might be best collected at later life stages. Future research should focus on the inclusion of both microbiome as well as host genome information in predictions, as well as the interaction between the two. Furthermore, the influence of microbiome on feed efficiency as well as carcass and meat quality should be investigated.",

Here, we investigated the effects of radiofrequency (RF) fields emitted by new-generation mobile technologies, specifically, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE), on intrinsic scalp EEG activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) and cognitive performance in the Stroop test. The study involved 60 healthy, young-adult university students (34 for UMTS and 26 for LTE) with double-blind administration of Real and Sham exposure in separate sessions. EEG was recorded before, during and after RF exposure, and Stroop performance was assessed before and after EEG recording. Both RF exposure types caused a notable decrease in the alpha power over the whole scalp that persisted even after the cessation of the exposure, whereas no effects were found on any aspects of performance in the Stroop test. The results imply that the brain networks underlying global alpha oscillations might require minor reconfiguration to adapt to the local biophysical changes caused by focal RF exposure mimicking MP use.",

Significant progress has recently been made in automated neuron reconstruction, as well as automated detection of synapses. However, methods for automating the morphological analysis of nanometer-resolution reconstructions are less established, despite their diverse application possibilities. Here, we introduce cellular morphology neural networks (CMNs), based on multi-view projections sampled from automatically reconstructed cellular fragments of arbitrary size and shape. Using unsupervised training we inferred morphology embeddings (\\\"Neuron2vec\\\") of neuron reconstructions and trained CMNs to identify glia cells in a supervised classification paradigm which was then used to resolve neuron reconstruction errors.

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of integral membrane proteins and a major class of drug targets. Membranes are known to have modulatory effects on GPCRs via specific lipid interactions. However, the mechanisms of such modulations in cell membranes and how they influence GPCR functions remain unclear. Here we report coarse-grained MD simulations on the Adenosine A2a receptor embedded in an in vivo mimetic membrane model comprised of 10 different lipid species. Three conformational states of the receptor, i.e. the inactive state, the active state, and the active state with a mini-GS protein bound were simulated to study the impact of protein-lipid interactions on the receptor activation. The simulations revealed three specific lipids (GM3, cholesterol and PIP2) that form stable and preferential interactions with the receptor, differentiating these from bulk lipids such as PS, PE and PC. In total, nine specific lipid-binding sites were revealed. The strength of lipid interaction with these sites depends on the conformational state of the receptor, suggesting that these lipids may regulate the conformational dynamics of the receptor. In particular, we revealed a dual role of PIP2 in promoting A2aR activation, which involves stabilization of both the characteristic outward tilt of helix TM6 within receptor and also the association of A2aR and mini-Gs when the activated complex forms. Structural comparisons suggested that PIP2 may facilitate G activation. Our results reveal likely allosteric effects of bound lipids in regulating the functional behaviour of GPCRs, providing a springboard for design of allosteric modulators of these biomedically important receptors.",

However, the putative roles of microRNA-184 (miR-184) in keratinocyte migration have not been examined. Here, we show that miR-184 expression was elevated following wounding of human keratinocyte monolayers. The induction of miR-184 was dependent on store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) as it was abolished by pharmacologic SOCE blockers. The long non-coding RNA urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1), which is thought to acts as a sponge or competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) against miR-184 was also induced in scratched monolayers. Induction of UCA1 was impaired, but not abolished, by SOCE inhibition. Transfection of keratinocytes with a miR-184 mimic stimulated migration in scratch assays, whereas inhibition of miR-184 dampened the ability of keratinocytes to migrate. Together, our data suggest, for the first time, that SOCE promotes miR-184 induction in wounded monolayers to support keratinocyte migration while also increasing lncRNA UCA1 expression, which may in turn regulate miR-184 activity in keratinocytes.",

However, ecologists still argue about how fragmentation of habitat (independent of habitat loss) affects species richness. The recently proposed habitat amount hypothesis posits that species richness only depends on the total amount of habitat in a local landscape. On the other hand, different empirical studies report contrasting patterns: some find positive and others negative effects of fragmentation per se on species richness.\\n\\nTo explain this apparent disparity, we devise a stochastic, spatially-explicit model of competitive species communities in heterogeneous habitats. The model shows that habitat loss and fragmentation have a non-monotone and non-linear effect on the species diversity in competitive communities. When the total amount of habitat is large, fragmentation per se tends to increase species diversity, but if the total amount of habitat is small, the situation is reversed: fragmentation per se decreases species diversity.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the early dynamics of the HIV-1 pandemic can provide crucial insights into the socioeconomic drivers of emerging infectious diseases in human populations, including the roles of urbanization and transportation networks. Current evidence indicates that the global pandemic comprising almost entirely of HIV-1/M originated around the 1920s in central Africa. However, these estimates are based on molecular clock estimates that are assumed to apply uniformly across the virus genome. There is growing evidence that recombination has played a significant role in the early history of the HIV-1 pandemic, such that different regions of the HIV-1 genome have different evolutionary histories. In this study, we have conducted a dated-tip analysis of all near full-length HIV-1/M genome sequences that were published in the GenBank database. We used a sliding window approach similar to the  bootscanning method for detecting breakpoints in intersubtype recombinant sequences. We found evidence of substantial variation in estimated root dates among windows, with an estimated mean time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 1922. Estimates were significantly autocorrelated, which was more consistent with an early recombination event than with stochastic error variation in phylogenetic reconstruction and dating analyses. A piecewise regression analysis supported the existence of at least one recombination breakpoint in the HIV-1/M genome with interval-specific means around 1929 and 1913, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that a sliding window approach can accommodate early recombination events outside the established nomenclature of HIV-1/M subtypes, although it is difficult to incorporate the earliest available samples due to their limited genome coverage.",

    "abstract": "O2 concentrations often fluctuate over diel timescales within wetlands, driven by temperature, sunlight, photosynthesis, and respiration. These daily fluxes have been shown to impact biogeochemical transformations (e.g. denitrification), which are mediated by the residing microbial community. However, little is known about how resident microbial communities respond to diel dramatic physical and chemical fluxes in freshwater wetland ecosystems. In this study, total microbial (bacterial and archaeal) community structure was significantly related to diel time points in just one out of four distinct freshwater wetlands sampled. This suggests that daily environmental shifts may influence wetlands differentially based upon the resident microbial community and specific physical and chemical conditions of a freshwater wetland. However, when exploring at finer resolutions of the microbial communities within each wetland, subcommunities within two wetlands were found to correspond to fluctuating O2 levels. Microbial taxa that were found to be susceptible to fluctuating O2 levels within these subnetworks may have intimate ties to metabolism and/or diel redox cycles. This study highlights that freshwater wetland microbial communities are often stable in community structure when confronted with short-term O2 fluxes, however, specialist taxa may be sensitive to these same fluxes.",

    "abstract": "It is well accepted that dysbiosis of microbiota is associated with disease; however, the biological mechanisms that promote susceptibility or resilience to disease remain elusive. One of the major limitations of previous microbiome studies has been the lack of complementary metatranscriptomic (functional) data to complement the interpretation of metagenomics (bacterial abundance). The purpose of the study was twofold, first to evaluate the bacterial diversity and differential gene expression of gut microbiota using complementary shotgun metagenomics (MG) and metatranscriptomics (MT) from same fecal sample. Second, to compare sequence data using different Illumina platforms and with different sequencing parameters as new sequencers are introduced and determine if the data are comparable on different platforms. In this study, we perform ultra-deep metatranscriptomic shotgun sequencing for a sample that we previously analyzed with metagenomics shotgun sequencing. We validated the sequencing and analysis methods using different Illumina platform, and with different sequencing and analysis parameters. Our results suggest that use of different Illumina platform did not lead to detectable bias in the sequencing data. The analysis of the sample using MG and MT approach shows that some species genes are more highly represented in the MT than in the MG, indicating that some species are highly metabolically active. Our analysis also shows that ~52% of the genes in the metagenome are in the metatranscriptome, and therefore are robustly expressed. The functions of the low and rare abundance bacterial species remain poorly understood. Our observations indicate that among the low abundant species analyzed in this study some were found to be more metabolically active compared to others and can contribute distinct profiles of biological functions that may modulate the host-microbiota and bacteria-bacteria interactions.",

    "abstract": "The biological clock is generated in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which synchronizes peripheral oscillators to coordinate physiological and behavioral activities throughout the body. Disturbance of circadian phase coherence between the central and peripheral could disrupt rhythms and thus cause diseases and aging. Here, we identified hepatic Sirt7 as an early element responsive to light, which ensures the phase coherence in mouse liver. Loss of Sirt7 leads to advanced liver circadian phase; restricted feeding in daytime entrains hepatic clock more rapidly in Sirt7-/- mice compared to wild-types. Molecularly, a light-driven body temperature (BT) oscillation induces rhythmic expression of Hsp70, which binds to and promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Sirt7. Sirt7 rhythmically deacetylates Cry1 on K565/579 and promotes Fbxl3-mediated degradation, thus coupling hepatic clock to the central pacemaker. Together, our data identify a novel BT/Hsp70-Sirt7-Cry1 axis, which transmits biological timing cues from the central to the peripheral and ensures circadian phase coherence in livers.",

    "abstract": "Geographically widespread species that occupy many thermal environments provide testable models for understanding the evolution of life-history responses to latitude, yet studies that draw range-wide conclusions using descriptive data from populations in the core of a species distribution can overlook meaningful inter-population variation. The phrynosomatid lizard Phrynosoma cornutum spans an extensive latitudinal distribution in North America and has been well-studied in connection with life-history evolution, yet populations occupying the most northern and coldest areas within its range were absent from previous examinations. We tested genus-wide models and challenged species-specific findings on the evolution of the life-history strategy for P. cornutum using populations at the northern edge of its geographic range and comparative material from farther south. Multivariate analyses revealed that egg dimensions decreased with clutch size, suggestive of a previously unrecognized tradeoff between egg size and egg number in this species. Interestingly, reproductive traits of females with shelled eggs did not covary with latitude, yet we found that populations at the highest latitudes typified several traits of the genus and for the species, including a model for Phrynosoma of large clutches and delayed reproduction. A significant deviation from earlier findings is that we detected latitudinal variation in clutch size. This finding, although novel, is unsurprising given the smaller body sizes from northern populations and the positive relationship between clutch size and body size. Intriguing, however, was that the significant reduction in clutch size persisted when female body size was held constant, indicating a reproductive disadvantage to living at higher latitudes. We discuss the possible selective pressures that may have resulted in the diminishing returns on reproductive output at higher latitudes. Our findings highlight the type of insights in the study of life-history evolution that can be gained across Phrynosomatidae from the inclusion of populations representing latitudinal endpoints.",

    "abstract": "Fermentation by microorganisms is a key step in the production of traditional food products such as bread, cheese, beer and wine. In these fermentative ecosystems, microorganisms interact in various ways, namely competition, predation, commensalism and mutualism. Traditional wine fermentation is a complex microbial process performed by Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces (NS) yeast species. To better understand the different interactions occurring within wine fermentation, isolated yeast cultures were compared with mixed co-cultures of one reference strain of S. cerevisiae with one strain of four NS yeast species (Metschnikowia pulcherrima, M. fructicola, Hanseniaspora opuntiae and H. uvarum). In each case, we studied population dynamics, resource consumed and metabolites produced from central carbon metabolism. This phenotyping of competition kinetics allowed us to confirm the main mechanisms of interaction between strains of four NS species. S. cerevisiae competed with H. uvarum and H. opuntiae for resources although both Hanseniaspora species were characterized by a strong mortality either in isolated or mixed fermentations. M. pulcherrima and M. fructicola displayed a negative interaction with the S. cerevisiae strain tested, with a decrease in viability in co-culture, probably due to iron depletion via the production of pulcherriminic acid. Overall, this work highlights the importance of measuring specific cell populations in mixed cultures and their metabolite kinetics to understand yeast-yeast interactions. These results are a first step towards ecological engineering and the rational design of optimal multi-species starter consortia using modeling tools. In particular the originality of this paper is for the first times to highlight the joint-effect of different species population dynamics on glycerol production and also to discuss on the putative role of lipid uptake on the limitation of some non-conventional species growth although interaction processes.",

    "abstract": "Research in many fields has become increasingly reliant on large and complex datasets. \\\"Big Data\\\" holds untold promise to rapidly advance science by tackling new questions that cannot be answered with smaller datasets. While powerful, research with Big Data poses unique challenges, as many standard lab protocols rely on experts examining each one of the samples. This is not feasible for large-scale datasets because manual approaches are time-consuming and hence difficult to scale. Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of examination by highly trained scientists and this may introduce major errors, sources of noise, and unforeseen biases into these large and complex datasets. Our proposed solution is to 1) start with a small, expertly labelled dataset, 2) amplify labels through web-based tools that engage citizen scientists, and 3) train machine learning on amplified labels to emulate expert decision making. As a proof of concept, we developed a system to quality control a large dataset of three-dimensional magnetic resonance images (MRI) of human brains. An initial dataset of 200 brain images labeled by experts were amplified by citizen scientists to label 722 brains, with over 80,000 ratings done through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on a combination of the citizen scientist labels that accounts for differences in the quality of classification by different citizen scientists. In an ROC analysis (on left out test data), the deep learning network performed as well as a state-of-the-art, specialized algorithm (MRIQC) for quality control of T1-weighted images, each with an area under the curve of 0.99. Finally, as a specific practical application of the method, we explore how brain image quality relates to the replicability of a well established relationship between brain volume and age over development. Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in emerging disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not already exist.",
