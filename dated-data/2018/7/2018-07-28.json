    "abstract": "Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related apicomplexan pathogens contain a non-photosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast. Derived from an unusual secondary eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, the apicoplast is a fascinating organelle whose function and biogenesis rely on a complex amalgamation of bacterial and algal pathways. Because these pathways are distinct from the human host, the apicoplast is an excellent source of novel antimalarial targets. Despite its biomedical importance and evolutionary significance, the absence of a reliable apicoplast proteome has limited most studies to the handful of pathways identified by homology to bacteria or primary chloroplasts, precluding our ability to study the most novel apicoplast pathways. Here we combine proximity biotinylation-based proteomics (BioID) and a new machine learning algorithm to generate a high-confidence apicoplast proteome consisting of 346 proteins. Critically, the high accuracy of this proteome significantly outperforms previous prediction-based methods and extends beyond other BioID studies of unique parasite compartments. Half of identified proteins have unknown function, and 77% are predicted to be important for normal blood-stage growth. We validate the apicoplast localization of a subset of novel proteins and show that an ATP-binding cassette protein ABCF1 is essential for blood-stage survival and plays a previously unknown role in apicoplast biogenesis. These findings indicate critical organellar functions for newly discovered apicoplast proteins. The apicoplast proteome will be an important resource for elucidating unique pathways derived from secondary endosymbiosis and prioritizing antimalarial drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Birth-death-movement processes, modulated by interactions between individuals, are fundamental to many cell biology processes. A key feature of the movement of cells within in vivo environments are the interactions between motile cells and stationary obstacles. Here we propose a multi-species model of individual-level motility, proliferation and death. This model is a spatial birth-death-movement stochastic process, a class of individual-based model (IBM) that is amenable to mathematical analysis. We present the IBM in a general multi-species framework, and then focus on the case of a population of motile, proliferative agents in an environment populated by stationary, non-proliferative obstacles. To analyse the IBM, we derive a system of spatial moment equations governing the evolution of the density of agents and the density of pairs of agents. This approach avoids making the usual mean-field assumption so that our models can be used to study the formation of spatial structure, such as clustering and aggregation, and to understand how spatial structure influences population-level outcomes. Overall the spatial moment model provides a reasonably accurate prediction of the system dynamics, including important effects such as how varying the properties of the obstacles leads to different spatial patterns in the population of agents.",

    "abstract": "Time series data provide a crucial window into infectious disease dynamics, yet their utility is often limited by the spatially aggregated form in which they are presented. When working with time series data, violating the implicit assumption of homogeneous dynamics below the scale of spatial aggregation could bias inferences about underlying processes. We tested this assumption in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia, where time series of weekly case reports were available at national, departmental, and municipal scales. First, we performed a descriptive analysis, which showed that the timing of departmental-level epidemic peaks varied by three months and that departmental-level estimates of the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), showed patterns that were distinct from a national-level estimate. Second, we applied a classification algorithm to six features of proportional cumulative incidence curves, which showed that variability in epidemic duration, the length of the epidemic tail, and consistency with a cumulative normal density curve made the greatest contributions to distinguishing groups. Third, we applied this classification algorithm to data simulated with a stochastic transmission model, which showed that group assignments were consistent with simulated differences in the basic reproduction number, R0. This result, along with associations between spatial drivers of transmission and group assignments based on observed data, suggests that the classification algorithm is capable of detecting differences in temporal patterns that are associated with differences in underlying drivers of incidence patterns. Overall, this diversity of temporal patterns at local scales underscores the value of spatially disaggregated time series data.",

    "abstract": "How cells track their position during the segmentation of the vertebrate body remains elusive. For decades, this process has been interpreted according to the clock-and-wavefront model, where molecular oscillators set the frequency of somite formation while the positional information is encoded in signaling gradients. Recent experiments using ex vivo explants challenge this interpretation, suggesting that positional information is encoded in the properties of the oscillators. Here, we propose that positional information is encoded in the differential levels of neighboring oscillators. The differences gradually increase because both the oscillator amplitude and the period increase with time. When this difference exceeds a certain threshold, the segmentation program starts. Using this framework, we quantitatively fit experimental data from in vivo and ex vivo mouse segmentation, and propose mechanisms of somite scaling. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of spatial pattern formation based on the local interactions between dynamic molecular oscillators.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg) is a clinically-important serovar linked to food-borne illness, and commonly isolated from poultry. Investigations of a large, multistate outbreak in the USA in 2013 identified poultry litter (PL) as an important extra-intestinal environment that may have selected for specific S. Heidelberg strains. Poultry litter is a mixture of bedding materials and chicken excreta that contains chicken gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria, undigested feed, feathers, and other materials of chicken origin. In this study, we performed a series of controlled laboratory experiments which assessed the microevolution of two S. Heidelberg strains (SH-2813 and SH-116) in PL previously used to raise 3 flocks of broiler chickens. The strains are closely related at the chromosome level, differing from the reference genome by 109 and 89 single nucleotide polymorphisms/InDels, respectively. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 86 isolates recovered after 0, 1, 7 and 14 days of microevolution in PL. Only strains carrying an IncX1 (37kb), 2 ColE1 (4 and 6kb) and 1 ColpVC (2kb) plasmids survived more than 7 days in PL. Competition experiments showed that carriage of these plasmids was associated with increased fitness. This increased fitness was associated with an increased copy number of IncX1 and ColE1 plasmids. Further, all Col plasmid-bearing strains had hotspot mutations in 37 loci on the chromosome and in 3 loci on the IncX1 plasmid. Additionally, we observed a decrease in susceptibility to tobramycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, neomycin and fosfomycin for Col plasmid-bearing strains. Our study demonstrates how positive selection from poultry litter can change the evolutionary path of S. Heidelberg.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAlthough natural language processing (NLP) tools have been available in English for quite some time, this is not the case for many other languages, particularly for texts from specific contexts such as clinical texts. This poses a challenge for tasks such as classifying text in languages other than English. In the absence of basic NLP tools, the development of statistical models that include manually designed variables that capture the semantic information of the documents is a potential solution. However, this process is expensive and slow. Deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been proposed as \\\"end-to-end\\\" models that learn both variables and parameters jointly, thus avoiding manual feature engineering and saving development time.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared the performance of two strategies for labeling clinical notes of an electronic medical record in Spanish according to the patients smoking status (current smoker, current non-smoker, text without information on tobacco): 1. A traditional approach using two classifiers (a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a support vector machine (SVM)) together with a  bag-of-words text representation that involves intensive manual development of features and, 2. an end-to-end model which uses a Short-Long-Term Memory bidirectional deep RNN with GloVe word embeddings. The classifiers were trained in the training set (n = 11775 clinical texts) and were evaluated in the test set (n = 2943) by means of macro-averaged recall, precision and F1 score.\\n\\nResultsThe RNN scored high values of all three metrics in the test set (sensitivity [95% CI]: 0.965 [0.96, 0.97], PPV: 0.963 [0.96, 0.97], F1 score: 0.964 [0.96, 0.97]). It also showed to be slightly superior to the MLP (difference in recall: 0.009 [95% CI: -0.0007, 0.017], precision: 0.007 [95% CI: -0.0015, 0.019] and F1 score: 0.009 [95% CI: 0.0018, 0.016]); comparing the RNN with the SVM, the latter has a better performance in general (recall difference [95% CI]: -0.007 [-0.016, 0.0018], precision: -0.009 [-0.018, 0.00015] and score F1: -0.008 [-0.014, -0.0017]). In both cases only the confidence interval for the F1 score difference excludes zero. In turn, the RNN consumed 80% less overall development time.\\n\\nConclusionIn our work, the deep bidirectional RNN as end-to-end model, reached similar levels of performance in the classification of clinical texts in Spanish that models with a great manual engineering of variables, although in less than 20% of the development time. This makes them an important tool to streamline text processing in languages where the development of NLP tools has not progressed as much as in English. Areas such as research or public health management could clearly benefit from end-to-end models that facilitate the exploitation of already available data sources, such as electronic clinical records.",

During singing, vBG neurons heterogeneously encoded song timing, auditory error, predicted error, and the difference between the two (prediction error). Viral tracing revealed inputs to vBG from auditory and vocal motor thalamus, auditory and vocal motor cortex, and VTA.

In some cases, a particle may contain different regions that each display a range of distinct conformations.

The strategies are based on masking the region of interest using either a 2-D mask applied to reference projections and particle images, or a 3-D mask applied to the 3-D volume. We show that focused classification approaches can be used to study structural allostery, a concept that is likely to gain more importance as datasets grow in size, allowing the distinction of more structural states and smaller differences between states.

    "abstract": "Molecular bistables are strong candidates for long-term information storage, for example, in synaptic plasticity. CaMKII is a highly expressed synaptic protein which has been proposed to form a molecular bistable switch capable of maintaining its state for years despite protein turnover and stochastic noise. It has recently been shown that CaMKII holoenzymes exchange subunits among themselves. Here we used computational methods to analyze the effect of subunit exchange on the CaMKII pathway in the presence of diffusion in two different microenvironments, the Post Synaptic Density (PSD) and spine cytosol. We show that in the PSD, subunit exchange leads to coordinated switching and prolongs state stability of the fraction of CaMKII that is present in clusters; and underlies spreading of activation among the remaining CaMKII that is uniformly distributed. Subunit exchange increases the robustness of the CaMKII switch measured as range of bistability both with respect to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) levels and protein turnover rates. In the phosphatase-rich spine cytosol, subunit exchange leads to slower decay of activity following calcium stimuli. We find that subunit exchange can explain two time-courses of CaMKII activity decay observed in recent experiments monitoring endogenous activity of CaMKII in the spine. Overall, CaMKII exhibits multiple timescales of activity in the synapse and subunit exchange enhances the information retention ability of CaMKII by improving the stability of its switching in the PSD, and by slowing the decay of its activity in the spine cytosol. The existence of diverse timescales in the synapse has important theoretical implications for memory storage in networks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDespite everyday forgetfulness, we can recall some memories years after they were formed. How are we able to protect some memories for so long? Previous work has shown that the abundant brain protein Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) can form a very stable binary switch which can store information for years. Building on this work, we analyzed the implications of a recently discovered phenomenon of subunit exchange on the state switching properties of CaMKII. In subunit exchange fragments of one CaMKII molecule detatch and exchange with another. We discovered that this improves the information retention ability of CaMKII both in the context where it stores information for long times, and also where it integrates information over the timescale of minutes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how organisms adapt to environmental variation is a key challenge of biology. Central to this are bet-hedging strategies that maximize geometric mean fitness across generations, either by being conservative or diversifying phenotypes. Theoretical models of bet-hedging and the multiplicative fitness effects of environmental variation across generations have traditionally assumed that environmental conditions are constant within lifetimes. However, behavioral ecology has revealed adaptive responses to additive fitness effects of environmental variation within lifetimes, either through insurance or risk-sensitive strategies. Here we explore whether the effects of adaptive insurance interact with the evolution of bet-hedging by varying the position and skew of fitness functions within and between lifetimes. When insurance causes the optimal phenotype to shift from the peak to down the less steeply decreasing side of the fitness function, then conservative bet-hedging does not generally evolve on top of this, even if diversifying bet-hedging can. Canalization to reduce phenotypic variation within a lifetime is almost always favored, except when the tails of the fitness function are steeply convex and produce a novel risk-sensitive increase in phenotypic variance akin to diversifying bet-hedging. Importantly, using skewed fitness functions, we provide the first example of how conservative and diversifying bet-hedging strategies might coexist.",

    "abstract": "Marine ecosystems are characterized by an intricate set of interactions among their representatives. One of the most important occurs through the exchange of dissolved organic matter (DOM) provided by phototrophs and used by heterotrophic bacteria as their main carbon and energy source. This metabolic interaction represents the foundation of the entire ocean food-web.\\n\\nHere we have assembled a synthetic ecosystem to assist the systems-level investigation of this biological association. This was achieved building an integrated, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction using two model organisms (a diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and an heterotrophic bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis) to explore and predict their metabolic interdependencies. The model was initially analysed using a constraint-based approach (Flux Balance Analysis, FBA) and then turned into a dynamic (dFBA) model to simulate a diatom-bacteria co-culture and to study the effect of changes in growth parameters on such a system. Finally, we developed a simpler dynamic ODEs system that, fed with dFBA results, was able to qualitatively describe this synthetic ecosystem and allowed performing stochastic simulations to assess the effect of noise on the overall balance of this co-culture.\\n\\nWe show that our model recapitulates known metabolic cross-talks of a phototroph-heterotroph system, including mutualism and competition for inorganic ions (i.e. phosphate and sulphate). Further, the dynamic simulation predicts realistic growth rate for both the diatom and the bacterium and a steady state balance between diatom and bacterial cell concentration that matches those determined in experimental co-cultures. This steady state, however, is reached following an oscillatory trend, a behaviour that is typically observed in the presence of metabolic co-dependencies. Finally, we show that, at high diatom/bacteria cell concentration ratio, stochastic fluctuations can lead to the extinction of bacteria from the co-culture, causing the explosion of diatom population. We anticipate that the developed synthetic ecosystem will serve in the future as a basis for the generation of testable hypotheses and as a scaffold for integrating and interpreting-omics data from experimental co-cultures.",

We recently developed an innovative analysis procedure for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles and found that even relatively hydrophobic IDPs remain nearly as expanded as the chemically denatured ensemble, rendering them significantly more expanded than generally inferred using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. We show here that fluorophores typical of those employed in FRET can contribute to this discrepancy. Specifically, we find that addition of Alexa488 to a normally expanded IDP causes contraction of its ensemble. In parallel, we also tested the recent suggestion that FRET and SAXS results can be reconciled if, in contrast to homopolymers, the radius of gyration (Rg) of an unfolded protein chain can vary independently from its end-to-end distance (Ree). To do so, we developed an analysis procedure that can accurately extract both Rg and Ree from SAXS profiles even if they are decoupled. Using this procedure, we find that Rg and Ree remain tightly coupled even for heteropolymeric IDPs. We thus conclude that, when combined with improved analysis procedures for both SAXS and FRET, fluorophore-driven interactions are sufficient to explain the preponderance of existing data regarding the nature of polypeptide chains unfolded in the absence of denaturant.",

    "abstract": "Progression of benign tumors to invasive, metastatic cancer requires loss of the cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin. Although intensive efforts have focused on gene repression and silencing mutations, much less is known about posttranslational control of E-cadherin expression in cancer. SPCA2 is a secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase that is down-regulated in metastatic breast cancer. We show that SPCA2 is tightly co-expressed with epithelial signature genes and required for E-cadherin biogenesis and cell surface expression. Unexpectedly, this function is uncoupled from Ca2+ pumping and mediated by binding to E-cadherin. Loss of SPCA2 is sufficient to disrupt cell-cell adhesion in tumorspheres and elicit mesenchymal gene expression through Hippo-YAP signaling. These findings point to a causal link between low SPCA2 levels and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition required for breast cancer metastasis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISPCA2 is an epithelial marker transcriptionally linked to E-cadherin expression\\nC_LIO_LILoss of SPCA2 impairs E-cadherin biogenesis independent of Ca2+ pump activity\\nC_LIO_LISPCA2 is required for tumorsphere formation and Hippo-YAP signaling to antagonize epithelial-mesenchymal transition\\nC_LIO_LIDown-regulation of SPCA2 in metastatic cancers may contribute to malignancy\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=168 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/379586_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b1e14org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@83edbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16cbc5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c2752a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer deaths and yet compared to other common cancers, we know relatively little about the molecular composition of this tumour type. To further our understanding of this cancer we have used open chromatin profiling to decipher the transcriptional regulatory networks that are operational in OAC. We have uncovered a transcription factor network that is usually found in primitive intestinal cells during embryonic development, centred on HNF4A and GATA6. These transcription factors work together to control the OAC transcriptome. Importantly, we show that this network is activated in Barretts oesophagus, the putative precursor state to OAC thereby providing novel molecular evidence in support of stepwise malignant transition. Furthermore, we show that HNF4A alone, is sufficient to drive chromatin opening and activation of a Barretts-like chromatin signature when expressed in normal human epithelial cells. Collectively, these data provide a new way to categorise OAC at a genome scale and implicate HNF4A activation as a potential pivotal event in regulating its malignant transition from healthy cells.",

Analysis may be performed over each ontology separately, but, recently, there has been a move to combine multiple ontologies to provide more powerful analytical possibilities. However, it is often not clear how to combine ontologies or how to assess or evaluate the potential design patterns available. Here we use a large and well-characterized dataset of anatomic pathology descriptions from a major study of aging mice. We show how different design patterns based on the MPATH and MA ontologies provide orthogonal axes of analysis, and perform differently in over-representation and semantic similarity applications.

    "abstract": "The abundance of new computational methods for processing and interpreting transcriptomes at a single cell level raises the need for in-silico platforms for evaluation and validation. Simulated datasets which resemble the properties of real datasets can aid in method development and prioritization as well as in questions in experimental design by providing an objective ground truth. Here, we present SymSim, a simulator software that explicitly models the processes that give rise to data observed in single cell RNA-Seq experiments. The components of the SymSim pipeline pertain to the three primary sources of variation in single cell RNA-Seq data: noise intrinsic to the process of transcription, extrinsic variation that is indicative of different cell states (both discrete and continuous), and technical variation due to low sensitivity and measurement noise and bias. Unlike other simulators, the parameters that govern the simulation process directly represent meaningful properties such as mRNA capture rate, the number of PCR cycles, sequencing depth, or the use of unique molecular identifiers. We demonstrate how SymSim can be used for benchmarking methods for clustering and differential expression and for examining the effects of various parameters on their performance. We also show how SymSim can be used to evaluate the number of cells required to detect a rare population and how this number deviates from the theoretical lower bound as the quality of the data decreases. SymSim is publicly available as an R package and allows users to simulate datasets with desired properties or matched with experimental data.",

ICD and EPD have mainly been reported in copepods, and whether they occur in other arthropods is not known. If they did, then rearing studies could be simplified because the durations of later developmental stages could be predicted based on those of earlier ones. The goal of this study was to test whether different taxa have ICD, EPD, or an alternative development type in which stage-specific proportions depend on temperature, termed  variable proportional development (VPD), and also how well each development type allowed later-stage durations to be predicted from earlier ones. Data for 71 arthropods (arachnids, copepod and decapod crustaceans, and insects) were tested, and most (85.9 %) species were concluded to have VPD, meaning that ICD and EPD do not occur generally. However, EPD predicted later-stage durations comparably well to VPD (within 19-23 %), and thus may still be useful. Interestingly, some species showed a  mixed form of development, where some stages developmental proportions varied with temperature while those of others did not, which should be further investigated.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWhether arthropod development is generally isochronal or equiproportional was tested\\nC_LIO_LIDevelopmental proportions of most species stages varied with temperature\\nC_LIO_LIMany species had  mixed development between variable and equiproportional types\\nC_LIO_LIThe general occurrence of isochronal and equiproportional development was rejected\\nC_LIO_LIEquiproportional development did make reasonable predictions of stage durations\\nC_LI",

We have investigated this question in proteins by estimating the rate of adaptive evolution between all pairs of amino acids separated by one mutational step using a McDonald-Kreitman type approach and genome-wide data from several Drosophila species. We find that the rate of adaptive evolution is higher amongst amino acids that are more similar. This is partly due to the fact that the proportion of mutations that are adaptive is higher amongst more similar amino acids. We also find that the rate of neutral evolution between amino acids is higher amongst similar amino acids. Overall our results suggest that both the adaptive and non-adaptive evolution of proteins is dominated by substitutions between amino acids that are more similar.",

Promising candidates are imbalance of excitation and inhibition in the brain, and maturation abnormalities. Here, we characterized different disease conditions by mapping changes in the expression patterns of maturation-related genes whose expression was altered by experimental neural hyperexcitation in published studies. This revealed two gene expression patterns: decreases in maturity markers and increases in immaturity markers. These two groups of genes were characterized by the overrepresentation of genes related to synaptic function and chromosomal modification, respectively. We used these two groups in a transdiagnostic analysis of 80 disease datasets for eight neuropsychiatric disorders and 12 datasets from corresponding animal models, and found that transcriptomic pseudoimmaturity inducible by neural hyperexcitation is shared by multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer disorders, and ALS. Our results indicate that this endophenotype serve as a basis for transdiagnostic characterization of these disorders.",

Untethered micron-scale mobile robots can realize this by navigating and performing in hard-to-reach, confined and delicate inner body sites. However, such a complex task requires an integrated design and engineering strategy, where powering, control, environmental sensing, medical functionality and biodegradability need to be considered altogether. The present study reports a hydrogel-based, biodegradable microrobotic swimmer, which is responsive to the changes in its microenvironment for theranostic cargo delivery and release tasks. We design a double-helical magnetic microswimmer of 20 m length, which is 3D-printed with complex geometrical and compositional features. At normal physiological concentrations, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enzyme can entirely degrade the microswimmer body in 118 h to solubilized non-toxic products. The microswimmer can respond to the pathological concentrations of MMP-2 by swelling and thereby accelerating the release kinetics of the drug payload. Anti-ErbB 2 antibody-tagged magnetic nanoparticles released from the degraded microswimmers serve for targeted labeling of SKBR3 breast cancer cells to realize the potential of medical imaging of local tissue sites following the therapeutic intervention. These results represent a leap forward toward clinical medical microrobots that are capable of sensing, responding to the local pathological information, and performing specific therapeutic and diagnostic tasks as orderly executed operations using their smart composite material architectures.",

Here, we present the junction coverage compatibility (JCC) score, which provides a way to evaluate the reliability of transcript-level abundance estimates as well as the accuracy of transcript annotation catalogs. It works by comparing the observed number of reads spanning each annotated splice junction in a genomic region to the predicted number of junction-spanning reads, inferred from the estimated transcript abundances and the genomic coordinates of the corresponding annotated transcripts. We show that while most genes show good agreement between the observed and predicted junction coverages, there is a small set of genes that do not. Genes with poor agreement are found regardless of the method used to estimate transcript abundances, and the corresponding transcript abundances should be treated with care in any downstream analyses.",

    "abstract": "The advent of text mining and natural text reading artificial intelligence has opened new research opportunities on the large collections of research publications available through journal and other resources. These systems have begun to identify novel connections or hypotheses due to an ability to read and extract information from more literature than a single individual could in their lifetime. Most research publications contain figures where data is represented in a graph. Modern publication guidelines are strongly encouraging publication of graphs where all data is displayed as apposed to summary figures such as bar charts. Figures are often encoded in a graphing language that is interpreted and displayed as a graphics. Conversion figures in publications to the underlying code should enable text-based mining to extract the underlying raw data of the graph. Here I show that data from publications greater than 15 years old that contain time series data on human patients is extractable from the original publication and can be reassessed using modern tools. This could benefit cases where data sets are not available due to file loss or corruption. This may also create and issue for the publication of human data as sharing of human data often requires research ethics approval.\\n\\nAuthor summaryFigures embedded in published research manuscripts are a minable resource similar to text mining.

    "abstract": "Natural bacterial populations are subject to constant predation pressure by phages. Bacteria use a variety of well-studied molecular mechanisms to defend themselves from phage predation. However, since phage are non-motile, perhaps the simplest defense against phage would be for bacteria to outrun their predators. In particular, chemotaxis, the active migration of bacteria up attractant gradients, may help the bacteria escape slowly diffusing phages. Here we study phage infection dynamics in migrating bacterial populations driven by chemotaxis through low viscosity agar plates. We find that expanding phage-bacteria populations support two migrating fronts, an outermost \\\"bacterial\\\" front driven by nutrient uptake and chemotaxis and an inner \\\"phage\\\" front at which bacterial population collapses due to phage predation. We show that with increasing adsorption rate and initial phage population, the rate of migration of the phage front increases, eventually overtaking the bacterial front and driving the system across a \\\"phage transition\\\" from a regime where bacteria outrun a phage infection to one where they must evolve phage resistance to survive. We confirm experimentally that this process requires phages to \\\"surf\\\" the bacterial front by repeatedly reinfecting the fastest moving bacteria. A deterministic model recapitulates the transition. Macroscopic fluctuations in bacterial densities at the phage front suggest that a feedback mechanism, possibly due to growth rate dependent phage infection rates, drives millimeter scale spatial structure in phage-bacteria populations. Our work opens a new, spatiotemporal, line of investigation into the eco-evolutionary struggle between bacteria and their phage predators.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe infection of bacteria by phage requires physical contact. This fact means that motile bacteria may avoid non-motile phage by simply running away. By this mechanism bacterial chemotaxis may help bacteria to escape phages. Here we show that when phage infect bacteria moving in soft agar plates, high phage populations or infectivity rates result in phages stopping and killing all bacteria. Conversely, when initial phage numbers or infectivity rates are low, bacteria are able to migrate away from phage successfully, despite phage ability to \\\"surf\\\" bacterial fronts for more than 24 hours. Between these regimes we document a \\\"phage transition\\\" where bacterial physiology and contingency in phage infection manifest through large-scale fluctuations in spatio-temporal dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBy modelling species-environment relationships of pest species, it is possible to understand potential limits to their distributions when they invade new regions, and their likely continued spread. The European earwig, Forficula auricularia, is a non-native invasive species in Australia that has been in the country for over 170 years. However, in the last few decades it has invaded new areas. Unlike in other countries, F. auricularia is a pest species of grains production in Australia. In this study we detail the Australian distribution of this species, adding new samples focussed around grain growing regions. Using this information we build global species distribution models for F. auricularia to better understand species-environment relationships.\\n\\nRESULTSOur models indicated that the distribution of F. auricularia is strongly associated with temperate through to semi-arid environments, a high winter rainfall and pronounced temperature seasonality. We identified regions that hold suitable, but as yet vacant, niche space for Australian populations, suggesting further potential for range expansion. Beyond climate, an index describing human influence on the landscape was important to understand the distribution limits of this pest. We identified regions where there was suitable climate space, but which F. auricularia has not occupied likely due to low levels of human impact.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONModelling the global distribution of a non-native pest species aided understanding of the regional distribution limits within Australia and highlighted the usefulness of human impact measures for modelling globally invasive insect species.",

    "abstract": "A median, segmented, annelid nerve cord has repeatedly been compared to the arthropod and vertebrate nerve cords and became the most used textbook representation of the annelid nervous system. Recent phylogenomic analyses, however, challenge the hypothesis that a subepidermal rope-ladder-like ventral nerve cord (VNC) composed of a paired serial chain of ganglia and somata-free connectives represents neither a plesiomorphic nor a typical condition in annelids.\\n\\nUsing a comparative approach by combining phylogenomic analyses with morphological methods (immunohistochemistry and CLSM, histology and TEM), we compiled a comprehensive dataset to reconstruct the evolution of the annelid VNC. Our phylogenomic analyses generally support previous topologies. However, the so far hard-to-place Apistobranchidae and Psammodrilidae are now incorporated among the basally branching annelids with high support. Based on this topology we reconstruct an intraepidermal VNC as ancestral state in Annelida. Thus, a subepidermal ladder-like nerve cord clearly represents a derived condition.\\n\\nBased on the presented data, a ladder-like appearance of the ventral nerve cord evolved repeatedly, and independently of the transition from an intraepidermal to a subepidermal cord during annelid evolution. Our investigations thereby question a common origin of the bilaterian median ganglionated VNC and propose an alternative set of neuroanatomical characteristics of the last common ancestor of Annelida or perhaps even Spiralia.",

    "abstract": "As we get older, perception in cluttered environments becomes increasingly difficult as a result of changes in peripheral and central neural processes. Given the aging society it is important to understand the neural mechanisms constraining perception in the elderly. In young participants, the state of rhythmic brain activity prior to a stimulus has been shown to modulate the neural encoding and perceptual impact of this stimulus - yet it remains unclear whether, and if so, how, the perceptual relevance of pre-stimulus activity changes with age. Using the auditory system as a model, we recorded EEG activity during a frequency discrimination task from younger and older human listeners. By combining single-trial EEG decoding with linear modelling we demonstrate consistent statistical relations between pre-stimulus power and the encoding of sensory evidence in short-latency EEG components, and more variable relations between prestimulus phase and subjects decisions in fronto-parietal EEG components. At the same time, we observed a significant slowing of auditory evoked responses and a flattening of the overall EEG frequency spectrum in the older listeners. Our results point to mechanistically consistent relations between rhythmic brain activity and sensory encoding that emerge in large despite changes in neural response latencies and the relative amplitude of rhythmic brain activity with age.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium that differentiates between two distinct functional and morphological forms during its developmental cycle: elementary bodies (EBs) and reticulate bodies (RBs). EBs are non-dividing, small electron dense forms that infect host cells. RBs are larger, non-infectious replicative forms that develop within a membrane-bound vesicle, termed an inclusion. Given the unique properties of each developmental form of this bacterium, we hypothesized that the Clp protease system plays an integral role in proteomic turnover by degrading specific proteins from one developmental form or the other. Chlamydia has five uncharacterized clp genes: clpX, clpC, two clpP paralogs, and clpB. In other bacteria, ClpC and ClpX are ATPases that unfold and feed proteins into the ClpP protease to be degraded, and ClpB is a deaggregase. Here, we focused on characterizing the ClpP paralogs. Transcriptional analyses and immunoblotting determined these genes are expressed mid-cycle. Bioinformatic analyses of these proteins identified key residues important for activity. Over-expression of inactive clpP mutants in Chlamydia suggested independent function of each ClpP paralog. To further probe these differences, we determined interactions between the ClpP proteins using bacterial two-hybrid assays and native gel analysis of recombinant proteins. Homotypic interactions of the ClpP proteins, but not heterotypic interactions between the ClpP paralogs, were detected. Interestingly, ClpP2, but not ClpP1, protease activity was detected in vitro. This activity was stimulated by antibiotics known to activate ClpP, which also blocked chlamydial growth. Our data suggest the chlamydial ClpP paralogs likely serve distinct and critical roles in this important pathogen.\\n\\nImportanceChlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of preventable infectious blindness and of bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Chlamydiae are developmentally regulated, obligate intracellular pathogens that alternate between two functional and morphologic forms with distinct repertoires of proteins. We hypothesize that protein degradation is a critical aspect to the developmental cycle. A key system involved in protein turnover in bacteria is the Clp protease system. Here, we characterized the two chlamydial ClpP paralogs by examining their expression in Chlamydia, their ability to oligomerize, and their proteolytic activity. This work will help understand the evolutionarily diverse Clp proteases in the context of intracellular organisms, which may aid in the study of other clinically relevant intracellular bacteria.",

To address how both flexible and stereotyped visual object response behaviors potentially share neural circuit components, we investigated models of asymmetric motion responses. Such models have predicted that object fixation without explicit neural encoding of position is possible. Here we investigated what neural circuits and behaviors are consistent with such models. In behavioral experiments on tethered flying flies, we found close correspondence between T4/T5-neuron dependent turning responses to objects and model output for high frequency perturbations. Furthermore, we found that the model predicts key results from several published accounts of stereotyped object tracking.
