    "abstract": "The metabolic modelling community has established the gold standard for bottom-up systems biology with reconstruction, validation and simulation of mechanistic genome-scale models. Similar methods have not been established for signal transduction networks, where the representation of internal states leads to scalability issues in both model formulation and execution. While rule- and agent-based methods allow efficient model definition and execution, respectively, model parametrisation introduces an additional layer of uncertainty due to the sparsity of reliably measured parameters. Here, we present a scalable method for parameter-free simulation of mechanistic signal transduction networks. It is based on rxncon and uses a bipartite Boolean logic with separate update rules for reactions and states. Using two generic update rules, we enable translation of any rxncon model into a unique Boolean model, which can be used for network validation and simulation - allowing the prediction of system level function directly from molecular mechanistic data. Through scalable model definition and simulation, and the independence of quantitative parameters, it opens up for simulation and validation of mechanistic genome-scale models of signal transduction networks.",

    "abstract": "Model-free learning creates stimulus-response associations. But what constitutes a stimulus? Are there limits to types of stimuli a model-free or habitual system can operate over? Most experiments on reward learning in humans and animals have used discrete sensory stimuli, but there is no algorithmic reason that model-free learning should be restricted to external stimuli, and recent theories have suggested that model-free processes may operate over highly abstract concepts and goals. Our study aimed to determine whether model-free learning processes can operate over environmental states defined by information held in working memory. Specifically, we tested whether or not humans can learn explicit temporal patterns of individually uninformative cues in a model-free manner. We compared the data from human participants in a reward learning paradigm using (1) a simultaneous symbol presentation condition or (2) a sequential symbol presentation condition, wherein the same visual stimuli were presented simultaneously or as a temporal sequence that required working memory. We found a significant effect of reward on human behavior in the sequential presentation condition, indicating that model-free learning can operate on information stored in working memory. Further analyses, however, revealed that the behavior of the participants contradicts the basic assumptions of our hypotheses, and it is possible that the observed effect of reward was generated by model-based rather than model-free learning. Thus it is not possible to draw any conclusions from out study regarding model-free learning of temporal sequences held in working memory. We conclude instead that careful thought should be given about how to best explain two-stage tasks to participants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.If protein sequences are recoded with a binary alphabet derived from a division of the 20 amino acids into two subsets, a protein can be identified from its subsequences by searching through a recoded sequence database. A binary-coded primary sequence can be obtained for an unbroken protein molecule from current blockades in a nanopore. Only two (instead of 20) blockade levels need to be recognized to identify a residues subset; a hard or soft detector can do this with two current thresholds. Computations were done on the complete proteome of Helicobacter pylori (http://www.uniprot.org; database id UP000000210, 1553 sequences) using a binary alphabet based on published data for residue volumes in the range [~]0.06 nm3 to [~]0.225 nm3. Assuming normally distributed volumes, more than 93% of binary subsequences of length 20 from the primary sequences of H. pylori are correct with a confidence level of 90-95%; they can uniquely identify over 98% of the proteins. Recently published work shows that a 0.7 nm diameter nanopore can measure residue volume with a resolution of [~]0.07 nm3; this makes the procedure described here both feasible and practical. This is a non-destructive single-molecule method without the vagaries of proteolysis.",

    "abstract": "EEG can be used to characterise functional networks using a variety of connectivity (FC) metrics. Unlike EEG source reconstruction, scalp analysis does not allow to make inferences about interacting regions, yet this latter approach has not been abandoned. Although the two approaches use different assumptions, conclusions drawn regarding the topology of the underlying networks should, ideally, not depend on the approach. The aim of the present work was to find an answer to the following questions: does scalp analysis provide a correct estimate of the network topology? how big are the distortions when using various pipelines in different experimental conditions? EEG recordings were analysed with amplitude- and phase-based metrics, founding a strong correlation for the global connectivity between scalp- and source-level. In contrast, network topology was only weakly correlated. The strongest correlations were obtained for MST leaf fraction, but only for FC metrics that limit the effects of volume conduction/signal leakage. These findings suggest that these effects alter the estimated EEG network organization, limiting the interpretation of results of scalp analysis. Finally, this study also suggests that the use of metrics that address the problem of zero lag correlations may give more reliable estimates of the underlying network topology.",

    "abstract": "About half of all cancers have somatic integrations of retrotransposons. To characterize their role in oncogenesis, we analyzed the patterns and mechanisms of somatic retrotransposition in 2,954 cancer genomes from 37 histological cancer subtypes. We identified 19,166 somatically acquired retrotransposition events, affecting 35% of samples, and spanning a range of event types. L1 insertions emerged as the first most frequent type of somatic structural variation in esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the second most frequent in head-and-neck and colorectal cancers. Aberrant L1 integrations can delete megabase-scale regions of a chromosome, sometimes removing tumour suppressor genes, as well as inducing complex translocations and large-scale duplications. Somatic retrotranspositions can also initiate breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, leading to high-level amplification of oncogenes. These observations illuminate a relevant role of L1 retrotransposition in remodeling the cancer genome, with potential implications in the development of human tumours.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of feedback into a persons body schema is well established. The crossmodal congruency effect (CCE) task is used to objectively quantify incorporation without being susceptible to experimenter biases. This visual-tactile interference task is used to calculate the CCE score as a difference in response time for incongruent and congruent trials. Here we show that this metric is susceptible to a learning effect that causes attenuation of the CCE score due to repeated task exposure sessions. We demonstrate that this learning effect is persistent, even after a 6 month hiatus in testing. Two mitigation strategies are proposed: 1. Only use CCE scores that are taken after learning has stabilized, or 2. Use a modified CCE protocol that decreases the task exposure time. We show that the modified and shortened CCE protocol, which may be required to meet time or logistical constraints in laboratory or clinical settings, reduced the impact of the learning effect on CCE results. Importantly, the CCE scores from the modified protocol were not significantly more variable than results obtained with the original protocol. This study highlights the importance of considering exposure time to the CCE task when designing experiments and suggests two mitigation strategies to improve the utility of this psychophysical assessment.",

However, detecting the response to the optical stimulation requires electrophysiology with physical contact or fluorescent imaging at target locations, which is often limited by photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this paper, we show that phase imaging can report the intracellular transport induced by optogenetic stimulation. We developed a multimodal instrument that can both stimulate cells with subcellular spatial resolution and detect optical pathlength changes with nanometer scale sensitivity. We found that optical pathlength fluctuations following stimulation are consistent with active organelle transport. Furthermore, the results indicate a broadening in the transport velocity distribution, which is significantly higher in stimulated cells compared to optogenetically inactive cells. It is likely that this label-free, contactless measurement of optogenetic response will provide an enabling approach to neuroscience.\\n\\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY Quantitative phase imaging enables label-free detection of enhanced intracellular activities induced by optogenetic stimulation.\\n\\nC_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic epigenetic machinery is targeted by bacteria to reprogram the response of eukaryotes during their interaction with microorganisms. In line, we discovered that the bacterium Streptomyces rapamycinicus triggered increased chromatin acetylation and thus activation of the silent secondary metabolism ors gene cluster leading to the production of orsellinic acid in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Using this model we aim at understanding molecular mechanisms of communication between bacteria and eukaryotic microorganisms based on bacteria-triggered chromatin modification. By genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis of acetylated histone H3 (H3K9ac, H3K14ac) we uncovered the unique chromatin landscape in A. nidulans upon co-cultivation with S. rapamycinicus. Genome-wide acetylation of H3K9 correlated with increased gene expression, whereas H3K14 appears to function in transcriptional initiation by providing a docking side for regulatory proteins. In total, histones belonging to six secondary metabolism gene clusters showed higher acetylation during co-cultivation including the ors, aspercryptin, cichorine, sterigmatocystin, anthrone and 2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl-6-(2-oxopropyl)benzaldehyde gene cluster with the emericellamide cluster being the only one with reduced acetylation and expression. Differentially acetylated histones were also detected in genes involved in amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, signaling, and genes encoding transcription factors. In conjunction with LC-MS/MS and MALDI-MS imaging, molecular analyses revealed the cross-pathway control and Myb-like transcription factor BasR as regulatory nodes for transduction of the bacterial signal in the fungus. The presence of basR in other fungal species allowed forecasting the inducibility of ors-like gene clusters by S. rapamycinicus in these fungi, and thus their effective interaction with activation of otherwise silent gene clusters.",

    "abstract": "Methionine (Met) is prone to oxidation and can be converted to Met sulfoxide (MetO), which exists as R- and S-diastereomers. MetO can be reduced back to Met by the ubiquitous methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) enzymes. Canonical MsrA and MsrB were shown as absolutely stereospecific for the reduction of S- and R-diastereomer, respectively. Recently, the molybdenum-containing protein MsrP, conserved in all gram-negative bacteria, was shown to be able to reduce MetO of periplasmic proteins without apparent stereospecificity in Escherichia coli. Here, we describe the substrate specificity of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides MsrP. Proteomics analysis coupled to enzymology approaches indicate that it reduces a broad spectrum of periplasmic oxidized proteins. Moreover, using model proteins, we demonstrated that RsMsrP preferentially reduces unfolded oxidized proteins and we confirmed that this enzyme, like its E. coli homolog, can reduce both R- and S-diastereomers of MetO with similar efficiency.",

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the STM evidence base is weak. We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of the field. Using metrics to quantify variation between discovery articles and follow-up studies, we found that seven genes were both highly replicated, and highly reproducible. However, ~80% of STM genes have never been replicated. While only a few studies investigated interactions, the reviewed genes could account for >1000% memory. This large summed effect size could indicate irreproducibility, many shared pathways, or that current assay protocols lack the specificity needed to identify core plasticity genes. Mechanistic theories of memory will require the convergence of evidence from system, circuit, cellular, molecular, and genetic experiments; systematic data synthesis is an essential tool for integrated neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Recent exploration into the interactions and relationship between hosts and their microbiota has revealed a connection between many aspects of the hosts biology, health and associated microorganisms. Whereas amplicon sequencing has traditionally been used to characterise the microbiome, the increasing number of published population genomics datasets offer an underexploited opportunity to study microbial profiles from the host shotgun sequencing data. Here, we use sequence data originally generated from killer whale Orcinus orca skin biopsies for population genomics, to characterise the skin microbiome and investigate how host social and geographic factors influence the microbial community composition. Having identified 845 microbial taxa from 2.4 million reads that did not map to the killer whale reference genome, we found that both ecotypic and geographic factors influence community composition of killer whale skin microbiomes. Furthermore, we uncovered key taxa that drive the microbiome community composition and showed that they are embedded in unique networks, one of which is tentatively linked to diatom presence and poor skin condition. Community composition differed between Antarctic killer whales with and without diatom coverage, suggesting that the previously reported episodic migrations of Antarctic killer whales to warmer waters associated with skin turnover may control the effects of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of microbiome studies from host shotgun sequencing data and highlights the importance of metagenomics in understanding the relationship between host and microbial ecology.",

When considering changes in vaccination strategies (e.g., removing doses), it is critical to understand which groups of children contribute most to transmission. We used data from Israel to evaluate how the build-up of vaccine-associated immunity in children was associated with declines in IPD due to vaccine-targeted serotypes in unimmunized adults. Data on vaccine uptake and prevalence of colonization with PCV-targeted serotypes were obtained from a unique study conducted among children visiting an emergency department in southern Israel and from surveys of colonization from central Israel. Data on invasive pneumococcal disease in adults were obtained from a nationwide surveillance study. We compared the trajectory of decline of IPD due to PCV-targeted serotypes in adults with the trajectory of decline of colonization prevalence and trajectory of increase in vaccine-derived protection against pneumococcal carriage among different age groupings of children. The declines in IPD in adults were most closely associated with the declines in colonization and increased vaccination coverage in children in the range of 36-59 months of age. This suggests that preschool-aged children, rather than infants, are responsible for maintaining the indirect benefits of PCVs.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors bind complex regulatory DNA sequence patterns in a combinatorial manner to modulate gene expression. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn these cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order, epistatic feature interactions encoded by the models. We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality environments presented on smart-phone and tablet devices have potential to aid the early diagnosis of conditions such as Alzheimers dementia by quantifying impairments in navigation performance. However, it is unclear whether performance on mobile devices can predict navigation errors in the real-world. In a preliminary study we tested 30 participants (15 female, 18-30 years old) on their wayfinding ability in our mobile app  Sea Hero Quest and on novel real-world wayfinding task in London (UK). We find a significant correlation between virtual and real-world navigation performance and a male advantage on both tasks, although smaller in the real-world environment. These results are consistent with prior studies which have reported navigation in the virtual environments are predictive of real-world navigation performance and a consistent male advantage. Future research will need to test a larger sample size and older participants.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) was proposed 20 years ago for study of task modulated connectivity on functional MRI (fMRI) data. A few modifications have since been made, but there remain misunderstandings on the method, as well as on its relations to a similar method named beta series correlation (BSC). Here, we explain what PPI measures and its relations to BSC. We first clarify that the interpretation of a regressor in a general linear model depends on not only itself but also on how other effects are modeled. In terms of PPI, it always reflects differences in connectivity between conditions, when the physiological variable is included as a covariate. Secondly, when there are multiple conditions, we explain how PPI models calculated from direct contrast between conditions could generate identical results as contrasting separate PPIs of each condition (a.k.a. \"generalized\" PPI). Thirdly, we explicit the deconvolution process that is used for PPI calculation, and how is it related to the trial-by-trial modeling for BSC, and illustrate the relations between PPI and those based upon BSC. In particular, when context sensitive changes in effective connectivity are present, they manifest as changes in correlations of observed trial-by-trial activations or functional connectivity. Therefore, BSC and PPI can detect similar connectivity differences. Lastly, we report empirical analyses using PPI and BSC on fMRI data of an event-related stop signal task to illustrate our points.",

This optimization involves coordinated adaptation of multiple traits, obscuring evolutionary trends and complicating infection management.

Using statistical modeling, we map evolutionary trajectories and identify trait correlations accounting for patient-specific influences. By integrating previous genetic analyses of 474 isolates, we provide a window into early adaptation to the host, finding: 1) a 2-3 year timeline of rapid adaptation after colonization, 2) variant \\\"naive\\\" and \\\"adapted\\\" states reflecting discordance between phenotypic and genetic adaptation, 3) adaptive trajectories leading to persistent infection via 3 distinct evolutionary modes, and 4) new associations between phenotypes and pathoadaptive mutations. Ultimately, we effectively deconvolute complex trait adaptation, offering a framework for evolutionary studies and precision medicine in clinical microbiology.",

The precise developmental brain changes that account for this emergent psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalising on a unique longitudinal dataset, that includes in-vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI, we show this transition period is characterised by brain-wide growth in MT, within both gray matter and adjacent juxta-cortical white matter. We show that an expression of common developmental psychiatric risk symptomatology in this otherwise healthy population, specifically compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to regionally specific aberrant unfolding of these MT trajectories. This is most marked in frontal midline structures for compulsivity, and in lateral frontal areas for impulsivity. The findings highlight a brain developmental linkage for emergent psychiatric risk features, evident in regionally specific perturbations in the expansion of MT-related myelination.",

LOTS-IM is unique compared to similar other methods because it yields irregularity map (IM) which represents WMH as irregularity values, not probability values, and retains the original MRIs texture information. We tested and compared the usage of IM for WMH segmentation on T2-FLAIR MRI with various methods, including the well established unsupervised WMH segmentation Lesion Growth Algorithm from the public toolbox Lesion Segmentation Toolbox (LST-LGA), conventional supervised machine learning schemes and state-of-the-art supervised deep neural networks. In our experiments, LOTS-IM outperformed unsupervised method LST-LGA, both in performance and processing speed, thanks to the limited one-time sampling scheme and its implementation on GPU. Our method also outperformed supervised conventional machine learning algorithms (i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and deep neural networks algorithms (i.e., deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) and convolutional encoder network (CEN)), while yielding comparable results to the convolutional neural network schemes that rank top of the algorithms developed up to date for this purpose (i.e., UResNet and UNet). The high sensitivity of IM on depicting signal change deems suitable for assessing MS progression, although care must be taken with signal changes not reflective of a true pathology.",

We have generated mice that carry Cre-dependent \\\"knock-in\\\" alleles of U2af1(S34F), the murine version of the most common mutant allele of U2AF1 encountered in human cancers. Cre-mediated recombination in murine hematopoietic lineages caused changes in RNA splicing, as well as multilineage cytopenia, macrocytic anemia, decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, low-grade dysplasias, and impaired transplantability, but without lifespan shortening or leukemia development. In an attempt to identify U2af1(S34F)-cooperating changes that promote leukemogenesis, we combined U2af1(S34F) with Runx1 deficiency in mice and further treated the mice with a mutagen, N-Ethyl-N-Nitrosourea (ENU). Overall, three of sixteen ENU-treated compound transgenic mice developed AML. However, AML did not arise in mice with other genotypes or without ENU treatment. Sequencing DNA from the three AMLs revealed somatic mutations homologous to those considered to be drivers of human AML, including predicted loss-or gain-of-function mutations in Tet2, Gata2, Idh1, and Ikzfl. However, the engineered U2af1(S34F) missense mutation reverted to wild type (WT) in two of the three AML cases, implying that U2af1(S34F) is dispensable, or even selected against, once leukemia is established.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSomatic mutations in four splicing factor genes (U2AF1, SRSF2, SF3B1, and ZRSR2) are found in MDS and MDS-related AML, blood cancers with few effective treatment options. However, the pathophysiological effects of these mutations remain poorly characterized, in part due to the paucity of disease-relevant models. Here, we report the establishment of mouse models to study the most common U2AF1 mutation, U2af1(S34F). Production of the mutant protein specifically in the murine hematopoietic compartment disrupts hematopoiesis in ways resembling human MDS. We further identified deletion of the Runx1 gene and other known oncogenic mutations as changes that might collaborate with U2af1(S34F) to give rise to frank AML in mice.",

During early life, most sensory systems are still largely immature. As a notable exception, the olfactory system reaches full maturity during intrauterine life, controlling mother-offspring interactions and neonatal survival. Here, we elucidate the structural and functional principles underlying the communication between olfactory bulb (OB) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) - the gatekeeper of limbic circuitry - during neonatal mouse development. Combining optogenetics, pharmacology, and electrophysiology in vivo with axonal tracing, we show that mitral cell-dependent discontinuous theta bursts in OB drive network oscillations and time the firing in LEC via axonal projections confined to upper cortical layers. Pharmacological silencing of OB activity diminishes entorhinal oscillations. Moreover, odor exposure boosts OB-entorhinal coupling at fast frequencies. Thus, early OB activity shapes the maturation of entorhinal circuits.",

PfNCR1 protein knockdown results in severely attenuated growth and confers hypersensitivity to the compounds.

    "abstract": "Functional gene disruption is a central tenet of cancer research, where novel drug targets are often identified and validated through cell-growth based knockdown studies or screens. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated mRNA knockdown is widely used in both academic and pharmaceutical settings. However, off-target effects of shRNAs as well as interference with endogenous small RNA processing have been reported. We show here that lentiviral delivery of both gene-specific and non-targeting control shRNAs impair in vitro cell growth in a sequence independent manner. In addition, exogenous shRNAs induce a depressed cell-cycle-gene expression signature that is also shRNA-sequence independent and present across several studies. Further, we observe an shRNA mediated general repression of microRNAs belonging to polycistronic genetic clusters, including microRNAs from established oncogenic microRNA clusters. The collective impact of these observations is particularly relevant for cancer research, given the widespread historical use of shRNAs and the common goal of interrogating genes that regulate proliferation. We therefore recommend that when employing shRNA for target validation, care be taken to titrate shRNA dose, use hairpin-expressing controls, perform gene-of-interest rescue experiments and/or corroborate shRNA-derived results by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knockout. Minimizing these deleterious sequence independent effects will improve research fidelity and help address reported challenges in experimental reproducibility.",

AvrPphB induces defense responses in other plant species, but the genes and mechanisms mediating AvrPphB recognition in those species have not been defined. Here, we show that AvrPphB induces defense responses in diverse barley cultivars. We show also that barley contains two PBS1 orthologs, that their products are cleaved by AvrPphB, and that the barley AvrPphB response maps to a single locus containing a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene, which we termed AvrPphB Resistance 1 (Pbr1). Transient co-expression of PBR1 with wild-type AvrPphB, but not a protease inactive mutant, triggered defense responses, indicating that PBR1 detects AvrPphB protease activity. Additionally, PBR1 co-immunoprecipitated with barley and N. benthamiana PBS1 proteins, suggesting mechanistic similarity to detection by RPS5. Lastly, we determined that wheat cultivars also recognize AvrPphB protease activity and contain a Pbr1 ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses showed however that Pbr1 is not orthologous to RPS5. Our results indicate that the ability to recognize AvrPphB evolved convergently, and imply that selection to guard PBS1-like proteins is ancient. Also, the results suggest that PBS1-based decoys may be used to engineer protease effector recognition-based resistance in barley and wheat.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection has long been hypothesised to shape ageing patterns, but whether and how ageing contributes to life-history evolution remains elusive. The complexity of various ageing-associated molecular mechanisms and their inherent stochasticity hinder reductionist approaches to the understanding of functional senescence, i.e. reduced fecundity and increased mortality. Recent bio-demographic work demonstrated that high-precision statistics of life-history traits such as mortality rates could be used phenomenologically to understand the ageing process. We adopted this approach to study cellular senescence in growth-arrested E. coli cells, where damages to functional macromolecules are no longer diluted by fast de novo biosynthesis. We acquired high-quality longitudinal physiological and life history data of large environmentally controlled clonal E. coli populations at single-cell resolution, using custom-designed microfluidic devices coupled to time-lapse microscopy. We show that E. coli lifespan distributions follow the Gompertz law of mortality, a century-old actuarial observation of human populations, despite developmental, cellular and genetic differences between bacteria and metazoan organisms. Measuring the shape of the hazard functions allowed us to disentangle quantitatively the demographic effects of ageing, which accumulate with time, from age-independent genetic longevity-modulating interventions. A pathway controlling cellular maintenance, the general stress response, not only promotes longevity but also temporally scales the whole distribution by reducing ageing rate. We further show that E. coli, constrained by the amount of total biosynthesis, adapt to their natural feast-or-famine lifestyle by modulating the amount of maintenance investment, rendering ageing rate a highly evolvable life-history trait.",

    "abstract": "We investigated frictional effects on the folding rates of a human Telomerase hairpin (hTR HP) and H-type pseudoknot from the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV PK) using simulations of the Three Interaction Site (TIS) model for RNA. The heat capacity from TIS model simulations, calculated using temperature replica exchange simulations, reproduces nearly quantitatively the available experimental data for the hTR HP. The corresponding results for BWYV PK serve as predictions. We calculated the folding rates (kFs) from more than 100 folding trajectories for each value of the solvent viscosity ({eta}) at a fixed salt concentration of 200 mM. Using the theoretical estimate ([Formula] where N is number of nucleotides) for folding free energy barrier, kF data for both the RNAs are quantitatively fit using one dimensional Kramers theory with two parameters specifying the curvatures in the unfolded basin and the barrier top. In the high-friction regime ({eta} {gtrsim} 10-5 Pa{middle dot}s), for both HP and PK, kFs decrease as 1/{eta} whereas in the low friction regime kFs increase as{eta} increases, leading to a maximum folding rate at a moderate viscosity (~ 10-6 Pa{middle dot}s), which is the Kramers turnover. From the fits, we find that the speed limit to RNA folding at water viscosity is between (1 - 4)s, which is in accord with our previous theoretical prediction as well as results from several single molecule experiments. Both the RNA constructs fold by parallel pathways. Surprisingly, we find that the flux through the pathways could be altered by changing solvent viscosity, a prediction that is more easily testable in RNA than proteins.",

In contrast to previous studies suggesting stable, cooperative binding, we show that both factors interact with DNA with surprisingly high off-rates. We find that both factors form dynamic subnuclear hubs, and that Bicoid binding is enriched within Zelda hubs. Remarkably, these hubs are both short lived and interact only transiently with sites of active Bicoid dependent transcription. Based on our observations we hypothesize that, beyond simply forming bridges between DNA and the transcription machinery, transcription factors can organize other proteins into hubs that transiently drive multiple activities at their gene targets.",

    "abstract": "Describing the dynamics and conformational landscapes of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) is of paramount importance to understanding their functions. Markov State Models (MSMs) are often used to characterize the dynamics of more structured proteins, but models of IDPs built using conventional MSM modelling protocols can be difficult to interpret due to the inherent nature of IDPs, which exhibit fast transitions between disordered microstates. We propose a new method of determining MSM states from all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of IDPs by using per-residue secondary structure assignments as input features in a MSM model. Because such secondary structure algorithms use a select set of features for assignment (dihedral angles, contact distances, etc.), they represent a knowledge-based refinement of feature sets used for model-building. This method adds interpretability to IDP conformational landscapes, which are increasingly viewed as composed of transient secondary structure, and allows us to readily use MSM analysis tools in this paradigm. We demonstrate the use of our method with the transcription factor p53 c-terminal domain (p53-CTD), a commonly-studied IDP. We are able to characterize the full secondary structure phase space observed for p53-CTD, and describe characteristics of p53-CTD as a network of transient helical and beta-hairpin structures with different network behaviors in different domains of secondary structure. This analysis provides a novel example of how IDPs can be studied and how researchers might better understand a disordered protein conformational landscape.",

    "abstract": "During early embryonic development, migrating neural crest cells expressing the NOTCH ligand Delta1 (DLL1) trigger the activation of NOTCH1 signaling in selected epithelial cells within newly formed somites. A key event in this process is a dramatic inhibition of GSK3{beta} activity, initiated by the activation of NOTCH1 and that takes place independent of its transcriptional function. Here, we investigated the mechanism whereby NOTCH1 exerts its non-canonical function in somites. Using the activation of myogenesis as a read-out of the ability of NOTCH receptors to trigger transcription-independent responses in somites, we found that all NOTCH receptors (1-4) activate MYF5 expression and we showed that the RAM (RBPJ-Associated Molecule) domain of the NOTCH Intracellular Domain (NICD) is necessary and sufficient in this process. We then demonstrated that the NOTCH1 Intracellular Domain (NICD1) physically interacts in the cytosol with GSK3{beta} and with the serine threonine protein kinase AKT. Activating AKT triggers myogenesis, likely via the inhibition of GSK3{beta}. We found that AKT, in a dose-dependent manner, decreases the transcriptional activity of NOTCH, suggesting a role in the balance between the canonical and non-canonical functions of NOTCH. Altogether these data strongly support the hypothesis that transcription-independent function of NICD is a central mechanism driving myogenesis in early somites and suggests that, in this tissue, AKT, NOTCH and GSK3{beta} interact in the cytoplasm to trigger a signaling cascade that leads to the formation of the early myotome in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest membrane protein family in humans and can respond to a wide variety of ligands and stimuli. Like other multi-pass membrane proteins, the biochemical properties of GPCRs are notoriously difficult to study because they must be embedded in lipid bilayers to maintain their native conformation and function. To enable an unbiased, high-throughput platform to profile biochemical activities of GPCRs in native conformation, we individually displayed 315 human non-odorant GPCRs (>85% coverage) in the envelope of human herpes simplex virus-1 and immobilized on glass to form a high-content Virion Display (VirD) array. Using this array, we found that 50% of the tested commercial anti-GPCR antibodies (mAbs) is ultra-specific, and that the vast majority of those VirD-GPCRs, which failed to be recognized by the commercial mAbs, could bind to their canonical ligands, indicating that they were folded correctly. Next, we used the VirD-GPCR arrays to examine binding specificity of two known peptide ligands and recovered expected interactions, as well as new off-target interactions, three of which were confirmed with real-time kinetics measurements. Finally, we explored the possibility of discovering novel pathogen targets by probing VirD-GPCR arrays with live group B Streptococcus (GBS), a common Gram-positive bacterium causing neonatal meningitis. Using cell invasion assays and a mouse model of hematogenous meningitis, we showed that inhibition of one of the five newly identified GPCRs, CysLTR1, greatly reduced GBS penetration in brain-derived endothelial cells and in mouse brains. Therefore, our work demonstrated that the VirD-GPCR array holds great potential for high-throughput, unbiased screening for small molecule drugs, affinity reagents, and deorphanization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAvailability of essential medicines is necessary to maintain health of the community. In Ethiopia, availability of medicines was low (65%), with high expiry rate (8.24%), low patient knowledge on correct dosage (50.5%) and satisfaction on pharmacy services (74.5%). To avert these problems, the government had endorsed legislation on a system called \\\"Auditable Pharmaceutical Transactions and Services (APTS)\\\". However, the outcomes and challenges in implementation of this system were not assessed.\\n\\nObjectiveTo assess the implementation status of APTS and its challenges at public hospitals in Gamo Gofa Zone Southern Ethiopia, April 2017.\\n\\nMethodsFacility based Cross sectional study was conducted in two APTS implementing hospitals in Gamo Gofa zone. Semi structured Self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all pharmacy staffs in selected hospitals. APTS reports of 12 months (with different characteristics) were reviewed. Four hundred patients were interviewed by data collectors about patient knowledge and satisfaction using WHO questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed using Statistical package for social science students/SPSS version 20. T-test and linear regression was used to evaluate significant differences between two hospitals with level of significance pre-set at p-value [&le;]0.05.\\n\\nResultsAll dispensing units in primary hospital had six (75%) out of the eight essential equipment for dispensing practice. it was found that respondents in general hospital stated higher scores in general setting of outpatient pharmacy (4.58 Versus 4.25; P <0.001), but lower scores for availability and cost of medicines (4.24 vs 4.43; P<0.05) when compared with those in primary level hospital. There was no significant difference in instruction of medicine provided by dispenser (2.58 vs 2.59; P>0.05), dispenser client interaction (3.09 vs 4.08; P>0.05) and total satisfaction score (2.09 vs 2.02; P>0.05).\\n\\nConclusion and recommendationsIn our study Quality of Auditable Pharmaceutical Transactions and Service was low, especially regarding patient knowledge about medicines, unaffordability of medicines, less availability of prescribed drugs, poor transparency of pharmaceutical transactions, insufficient counseling practice and limited facilities for dispensing such as, key medicines, formularies and standard guidelines. We therefore recommend the following measures responsible bodies to improve these gaps y taking administrative actions and providing continued education and training for dispensers.",

    "abstract": "Impulsivity has been linked to academic performance in the context of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, though its influence on a wider spectrum of students remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of STEM learning (i.e. science, technology, engineering, and math). STEM learning was hypothesized to be more challenging for impulsive students, since it requires the practice and repetition of tasks as well as concerted attention to task performance. Impulsivity was assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 2,476 students in grades 6-12. Results show impulsivity affects a larger population of students, not limited to students with learning disabilities. Impulsivity was associated with lower sources of science self-efficacy (SSSE) scores, interest in all STEM domains (particularly math), and self-reported STEM skills. The large negative effect observed for impulsivity was opposed by \\\"growth\\\" mindset, which describes a students belief in the importance of effort when learning is difficult. Mindset had a large positive effect, which was associated with greater SSSE, STEM interest, and STEM skills. When modeled together, results suggest that mindset interventions may benefit impulsive students who struggle with STEM. Together, these data suggest important interconnected roles for impulsivity and mindset that can influence secondary students STEM trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Specific protein-protein interactions are crucial in most cellular processes. They enable multiprotein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have been developed to identify which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. This stands in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multiprotein complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins.\\n\\nAuthor summarySpecific protein-protein interactions are at the heart of most intra-cellular processes. Mapping these interactions is thus crucial to a systems-level understanding of cells, and has broad applications to areas such as drug targeting. Systematic experimental identification of protein interaction partners is still challenging. However, a large and rapidly growing amount of sequence data is now available. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to identify which proteins interact from their sequences alone, thanks to the co-variation of the sequences of interacting proteins. These algorithms build upon inference methods that have been used with success to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins and multi-protein complexes, and their focus is on the amino-acid residues that are in direct contact. Here, we propose a simpler method to identify which proteins interact among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from their sequences alone. Our method relies on an approximate maximization of mutual information between the sequences of the two families, without specifically emphasizing the contacting residue pairs. We demonstrate that this method slightly outperforms the earlier one. This result highlights that partner prediction does not only rely on the identities and interactions of directly contacting amino-acids.",

    "abstract": "The plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) has recently been shown to regulate Ca2+-dependent N-methyl-O_SCPLOWDC_SCPLOW-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) desensitization, suggesting tight interaction of NCXs and NMDARs in lipid nanoclaster or \\\"rafts\\\". To evaluate possible role of this interaction we studied effects of Li+ on NMDA-elicited whole-cell currents and Ca2+ responses of rat cortical neurons in vitro before and after cholesterol extraction by methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (M{beta}CD). Substitution Li+ for Na+ in the external solution caused a concentration-dependent decrease of steady-state NMDAR currents from 440 {+/-} 71 pA to 111 {+/-} 29 pA in 140 mM Na+ and 140 mM Li+, respectively. Li+ inhibition of NMDAR currents disappeared in the absence of Ca2+ in the external solution (Ca2+-free), suggesting that Li+ enhanced Ca2+-dependent NMDAR desensitization. Whereas the cholesterol extraction with M{beta}CD induced NMDAR current decrease to 136 {+/-} 32 pA in 140 mM Na+ and 46 {+/-} 15 pA in 140 mM Li+, the IC50 values for the Li+ inhibition were similar (about 44 mM Li+) before and after this procedure. In Ca2+-free Na+ solution steady-state NMDAR currents after the cholesterol extraction were 47 {+/-} 6 % of control currents. Apparently this amplitude decrease was not Ca2+-dependent. In 1 mM Ca2+ Na+ solution the Ca2+-dependent NMDAR desensitization was greater when cholesterol was extracted. Obviously, this procedure promoted its development. In agreement, Li+ and KB-R7943, an inhibitor of NCX, both considerably reduced NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ responses. The cholesterol extraction itself caused a decrease of NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ responses and, in addition, abolished the effects of Li+ and KB-R7943. Taken together our data suggest that NCXs downregulate the Ca2+-dependent NMDAR desensitization. Most likely, this is determined by co-localization and tight functional interaction of NCX and NMDAR molecules in membrane lipid rafts. Their destruction is accompanied by an enhancement of NMDAR desensitization and a loss of NCX-selective agent effects on NMDARs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLeprosy is a chronic infectious disease of public health importance and one of the leading causes of permanent physical disability. The integration of leprosy service to the general health system in Ethiopia made leprosy patients to be seen by non-leprosy specialists which could lead to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. In addition to the multi-drug treatment, patient self - care practice is crucial for the successful treatment of the disease. This study was aimed to assess the knowledge and self-care practices of leprosy patients and associated factors at ALERT leprosy referral Hospital in Ethiopia.\\n\\nMethodA cross-sectional study was conducted ALERT leprosy referral Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 424 leprosy patients were interviewed using pre-tested structured questionnaires. The questionnaires included core points such as socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of leprosy and self-care practices. Blooms cut off point was used to describe the knowledge and self-care practice of the respondents and statistical significance was assessed at 95% confidence interval with 5% of level of significance.\\n\\nResultThe knowledge score of the respondents was poor for 276 (65.1%) and good for 148 (34.9%). The level of knowledge was significantly varied within age groups (P= 000), sex (P=000), marital status (p=0.003), educational status (p=000) and income (p-000). More than three-fourth (77.4%) of interviewed patients had poor self-care practice and only less than a quarter (22.6%) of patients had good self-care practice score (P=000). Age (p=0.002), Previous disability due to leprosy (P=000), Knowledge of leprosy (p=0.038) and income (P=0.028) significantly associated with poor self-care practice. On the other hand, educational status, sex, marital status and health education did not associated with leprosy self-care practice.\\n\\nConclusionAlthough, leprosy treatment, disability prevention and rehabilitation program run in the country under general public health care service for decades, poor leprosy self-care practice and poor leprosy knowledge had been confirmed in this study. Therefore, the leprosy service program should re-visit its strategy and mode of delivery to improve the leprosy knowledge and leprosy self-care practices of patients.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLeprosy is an infectious bacterial disease. It is a curable disease if treated early before disability occurs with the correct regimen. However, treatment cannot reverse disability once occurred. in addition to chemotherapeutic treatment, lack of social and psychological treatment may expose patients to disability as they may not adhere to treatment. To prevent disability it is vital to empower leprosy patients through promoting self-confidence, providing knowledge and self-care skills. In the present study, we investigated the knowledge and self-care practice of 424 leprosy patients at ALERT hospital through face-to face guided interview. It was found that majority of patients had poor knowledge about leprosy. Some factors such as sex, income status, age and educational status of the patient significantly affected the level of leprosy knowledge. Similarly, it was found that 77% of patients had poor self-care practice which significantly varied with income status, knowledge of leprosy, age and having previous disability. Therefore, it is very important to improve the leprosy knowledge and self-care skills of patients. This can be achieved through dealing with issues such as the physical, emotional, intellectual and social aspects of the patients in addition to the chemotherapeutic treatment.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of drug resistance in avian influenza virus (AIV) is a serious concern for public health. Neuraminidase (NA) isolated from a fatal case of avian-origin H10N8 influenza virus infection was found to carry a drug-resistant mutation, NA-Arg292Lys (291 in N8 numbering). In order to understand the full potential of H10N8 drug resistance, the virus was first passaged in the presence of the most commonly used neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), oseltamivir and zanamivir. As expected, the Arg292Lys substitution was detected after oseltamivir treatment, however a novel Val116Asp substitution (114 in N8 numbering) was selected by zanamivir treatment. Next generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed that the mutations arose early (after passages 1-3) and became dominant in the presence of the NAI inhibitors. Extensive crystallographic studies revealed that N8-Arg292Lys resistance results mainly from loss of interactions with the inhibitor carboxylate, while rotation of Glu276 was not impaired as observed in the N9-Arg292Lys, a group 2 NA structure. In the case of Val116Asp, the binding mode between oseltamivir and zanamivir is different. Asp151 forms stabilized hydrogen bond to guanidine group of zanamivir, which may compensate the resistance caused by Val116Asp. By contrast, the amino group of oseltamivir is too short to maintain this hydrogen bond, which result in resistant. Moreover, the oseltamivir-zanamivir hybrid inhibitor MS-257 displays higher effectiveness to Val116Asp than oseltamivir, which support this notion.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAside from vaccination, NAIs are currently the only alternative for the clinical treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to guide in drug development. In this study, two drug-resistant NA substitutions, Val116Asp and Arg292Lys, were discovered from oseltamivir and zanamivir treatment of H10N8 virus. Crystal structural analyses revealed two distinct mechanisms of these two resistant mutations and provide the explanation for the difference in susceptibility of different NAIs. Zanamivir and laninamivir were more effective against the resistant variants than oseltamivir, and Arg292Lys results in more serious oseltamivir resistance in N9 than N8 subtype. This study is well-correlated to influenza pandemic/epidemic pre-warning, as the discovery of inhibitor resistant viruses will help for new drug preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia are adhesive cellular protrusions specialised in the detection of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived cues. While ECM engagement at focal adhesions is known to trigger the recruitment of hundreds of proteins (\\\"adhesome\\\") to fine-tune cellular behaviour, the components of the filopodia adhesions remain undefined. Here, we performed a structured illumination microscopy-based screen to map the localisation of 80 target proteins, linked to cell adhesion and migration, within filopodia. We demonstrate preferential enrichment of several adhesion proteins to either filopodia tips, filopodia shafts, or shaft subdomains suggesting divergent, spatially restricted functions for these proteins. Moreover, proteins with phospho-inositide (PI) binding sites are particularly enriched in filopodia. This, together with the strong localisation of PI(3,4)P2 in filopodia tips, predicts critical roles for PIs in regulating filopodia ultra-structure and function. Our mapping further reveals that filopodia adhesions consist of a unique set of proteins, the filopodome, that are distinct from classical nascent adhesions, focal adhesions and fibrillar adhesions. Using live imaging, we observe that filopodia adhesions can give rise to nascent adhesions, which, in turn, form focal adhesions. Finally, we demonstrate that p130Cas (BCAR1) is recruited to filopodia tips via its CCHD domain and acts as a mechanosensitive regulator of filopodia stability.",

    "abstract": "During longer-lasting future space missions, water renewal by ground-loaded supplies will become increasingly expensive and unmanageable for months. Space exploration by self-sufficient space-crafts is thus demanding the development of culture-independent microbiological methods for in-flight water monitoring to counteract possible contamination risks. In this study, we aimed at evaluating microbial load data assessed by selected techniques with current or promising perspectives in space applications (i.e., HPC, ATP-metry, qPCR, flow cytometry), through the analysis of water sources with constitutively different contamination levels (i.e., chlorinated and unchlorinated tap waters, groundwaters, river waters, wastewaters). Using a data-driven double-threshold identification procedure, we identified and presented new alternative standards of water quality based on the assessment of the total microbial load. Our approach is suitable to provide an immediate alert of microbial load peaks, thus enhancing the crew responsiveness in case of unexpected events due to water contamination and treatment failure. Finally, the backbone dataset could help in managing water quality and monitoring issues for both space and Earth-based applications.",

RNA2.7 is a viral long non-coding RNA accounting for more than 20% of total viral transcripts at early time of infection.

    "abstract": "Reduced polysialylation of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in schizophrenia has been suggested to contribute to abnormal neuroplasticity and neurodevelopmental features of this illness. The posttranslational addition of sialic acid is mediated by sialyltransferases, and polysialylation (the addition of [&ge;] 8  -2,8-linked sialic acid residues) is catalyzed by three enzymes: ST8SIA2 (also called STX), ST8SIA4 (also called PST), and/or ST8SIA3. ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4 are the primary mediators of NCAM polysialylation. The gene encoding ST8SIA2 maps to schizophrenia risk locus 15q26, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNP haplotypes of the ST8SIA2 gene have been associated with schizophrenia in multiple populations. The current study in elderly schizophrenia (N = 16) and comparison (N = 14) subjects measured the protein expression of NCAM, polysialylated-NCAM (PSANCAM), and three poly--2,8-sialyltransferases (ST8SIA2, ST8SIA3, and ST8SIA4) in postmortem superior temporal gyrus. Although expression of NCAM, PSA-NCAM, ST8SIA3, and ST8SIA4 were not different in schizophrenia, increased protein levels of ST8SIA2 were identified. It has been reported that ST8SIA2 mutations associated with increased schizophrenia risk impair PSA-NCAM synthesis, suggesting that increased protein expression of ST8SIA2 may represent a compensatory mechanism in the face of impaired enzyme function. This interpretation is further supported by our finding that the relationship between ST8SIA2 enzyme expression and PSA-NCAM levels are different between schizophrenia and comparison subjects. Together these findings suggest a possible neurodevelopmentally-regulated mechanism which could contribute to abnormal synaptic plasticity evident in schizophrenia.",

In locusts, intra- as well as inter-phase reproductive interactions among gregarious and solitarious locust populations have a major impact on the locust population dynamics. However, practically all previous work on locust sexual behavior has been limited to the gregarious phase. Here we provide a first detailed description of pre-copulatory behavior of solitarious desert locusts. We compare our findings with those of previous reports of pre-copulatory behavior of gregarious locusts, focusing on the behavioral elements that serve in inter-sex signaling and communication. We also studied inter-phase (mixed pairs) reproductive interactions. Solitarious males were found to invest more in pre-copulatory courtship and signaling compared to their gregarious counterparts; and the solitarious females played a comparatively more dominant role in the inter-sex communication. The solitarious females were also less prone to demonstrate the typical rejection-related behavioral patterns displayed by the gregarious females. As a consequence of the particular characteristic behavior of each phase, the most successful among intra- and inter-phase pairs were gregarious males with solitary females. Least successful were solitary males encountered with gregarious females, indicating a strong asymmetry in inter-phase reproductive interactions. We discuss these results in the context of non-random or assortative mating in locust mixed or sympatric solitarious-gregarious populations.",

    "abstract": "Several imaging modalities, including T1-weighted structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI can show chronological age related changes. Employing machine learning algorithms, an individuals imaging data can predict their age with reasonable accuracy. While details vary according to modality, the general strategy is to: 1) extract image-related features, 2) build a model on a training set that uses those features to predict an individuals age, 3) validate the model on a test dataset, producing a predicted age for each individual, 4) define the \\\"Brain Age Gap Estimate\\\" (BrainAGE) as the difference between an individuals predicted age and his/her chronological age, and 5) estimate the relationship between BrainAGE and other variables of interest, and 6) make inferences about those variables and accelerated or delayed brain aging. For example, a group of individuals with overall positive BrainAGE may show signs of accelerated aging in other variables as well. There is inevitably an overestimation of the age of younger individuals and an underestimation of the age of older individuals due to  regression to the mean. The correlation between chronological age and BrainAGE may significantly impact the relationship between BrainAGE and other variables of interest when they are also related to age. In this study, we examine the detectability of variable effects under different assumptions. We use empirical results from two separate datasets [training=475 healthy volunteers, aged 18 - 60 years (259 female); testing=489 participants including people with mood/anxiety, substance use, eating disorders and healthy controls, aged 18 - 56 years (312 female)] to inform simulation parameter selection. Outcomes in simulated and empirical data strongly support the proposal that models incorporating BrainAGE should include chronological age as a covariate. We propose either including age as a covariate in step 5 of the above framework, or employing a multistep procedure where age is regressed on BrainAGE prior to step 5, producing BrainAGE Residualized (BrainAGER) scores.",

The tendency of some proteins or protein regions to exist in a disordered state usually precludes their structural characterisation and renders them especially difficult for experimental handling after recombinant expression.\\n\\nResultsA new intuitive, publicly-available computational resource, called BASILIScan, is presented here. It provides a BLAST-based search for close homologues of the protein of interest, integrated with a simultaneous prediction of intrinsic disorder together with a robust data viewer and interpreter. This allows for a quick, high-throughput screening, scoring and selection of closely-related yet highly structured homologues of the protein of interest. Comparative parallel analysis of the conservation of extended regions of disorder in multiple sequences is also offered. The use of BASILIScan and its capacity for yielding biologically applicable predictions is demonstrated. Using a high-throughput BASILIScan screen it is also shown that a large proportion of the human proteome displays homologous sequences of superior intrinsic structural order in many related species.\\n\\nConclusionThrough the swift identification of intrinsically stable homologues and poorly conserved disordered regions by the BASILIScan software, the chances of successful recombinant expression and compatibility with downstream applications such as crystallisation can be greatly increased.",

    "abstract": "Studying carbon dynamics in the coral holobiont provides essential knowledge of nutritional strategies and is thus central to understanding coral ecophysiology. In this study, the first aim was to investigate the effect of daily feeding and thermal stress on oxygen (O2) rates measured at polyp-scale with microsensors and at whole fragment scale using incubation methods. The second aim was to assess the carbon budget of the symbiotic association using H13CO3, under the different conditions. Micro- and macro-scale measurements revealed enhanced O2 evolution rates for fed compared to unfed corals. However, gross O2 production in fed corals was increased at high temperature on a macroscale but not on a microscale basis, likely due to a heterogeneous distribution of photosynthesis over the coral surface. Starved corals always exhibited reduced photosynthetic activity at high temperature, which suggests that the nutritional status of the coral host is a key limiting factor for coral productivity under thermal stress. Quantification of photosynthate translocation and carbon budgets showed very low incorporation rates, for both symbionts and host (0.03 - 0.6 g C cm-2 h-1) equivalent to only 0.008 - 0.6 %, of the photosynthetically fixed carbon for P. damicornis, in all treatments. Carbon loss (via respiration and/or mucus release) was about 41 - 47 % and 52 - 76% of the fixed carbon for starved and fed corals, respectively. Such high loss of translocated carbon suggests that P. damicornis is nitrogen and/or phosphorus limited. Heterotrophy might thus cover a larger portion of the nutritional demand for P. damicornis than previously assumed. Our results suggest that active feeding plays a fundamental role in metabolic dynamics and bleaching susceptibility of corals.",

    "abstract": "The genomics era has brought useful tools to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. We propose a reaction norm model (RNM) to tackle genotype-environment correlation and interaction problems in the context of genome-wide association analyses of complex traits. In our approach, an environmental risk factor affecting the trait of interest can be modeled as dependent on a continuous covariate that is itself regulated by genetic as well as environmental factors. Our multivariate RNM approach allows the joint modelling of the relation between the genotype (G) and the covariate (C), so that both their correlation (association) and interaction (effect modification) can be estimated. Hence we jointly estimate genotype-covariate correlation and interaction (GCCI). We demonstrate using simulation that the proposed multivariate RNM performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods that ignore G-C correlation. We apply the method to data from the UK Biobank (N= 66,281) in analysis of body mass index using smoking quantity as a covariate. We find a highly significant G-C correlation, but a negligible G-C interaction. In contrast, when a conventional G-C interaction analysis is applied (i.e., G-C correlation is not included in the model), highly significant G-C interaction estimates are found. It is also notable that we find a significant heterogeneity in the estimated residual variances across different covariate levels probably due to residual-covariate interaction. Using simulation we also show that the residual variances estimated by genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) or linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) can be inflated in the presence of interactions, implying that the currently reported SNP-heritability estimates from these methods should be interpreted with caution. We conclude that it is essential to correctly account for both interaction and correlation in complex trait analyses and that the failure to do so may lead to substantial biases in inferences relating to genetic architecture of complex traits, including estimated SNP-heritability.",

    "abstract": "Selective pressures between hosts and their parasites can result in reciprocal evolution or adaptation of specific life history traits. Local adaptation of resident hosts and parasites should lead to host-parasite systems performing better in sympatry when compared to allopatry. Between-population variations in parasite infectivity/virulence and host defence/resistance, referred to as compatibility phenotype, were often the proxy used to analyse sympatric or allopatric adaptation. Nevertheless, some reported cases exist where allopatric host-parasite systems demonstrate compatibility phenotypes similar or greater than the one observed in sympatry. In these cases, the role of local adaptation is worth considering. Here, we study the interaction between Schistosoma and its vector snail Biomphalaria in which such a discrepancy in local versus foreign compatibility phenotype has been observed. Herein, we developed an integrative approach to investigate sympatric and allopatric interaction processes and link the underlying molecular mechanisms to the resulting phenotypes. Using comparative \\\"omics\\\" approaches joined to analysis of life history traits (immune cellular response, mortality, prevalence and compatibility) we tried to bridge the gap of knowledge that exists for connecting local adaptation observations to molecular phenotypes in Schistosoma/Biomphalaria interactions.\\n\\nWe found that despite displaying similar prevalence phenotypes, parasite infection triggered an immune suppression in snails living in sympatry, while it activated an immune response for those living in allopatry. Dual-comparative molecular analyses revealed that parasite infection causes immune suppression in sympatry. miRNAs were used to hijack the hosts immune response, allowing sympatric parasites to initiate their developmental program earlier and more efficiently.\\n\\nWe show that despite having similar prevalence phenotypes, sympatric and allopatric snail-Schistosoma interactions displayed a strongly different immunobiological molecular dialogue. The ability of allopatric pathogens to adapt rapidly and efficiently to new hosts could have critical consequences on disease emergence and risk of schistosomiasis outbreaks.

    "abstract": "Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are spherical structures derived from the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteroides spp. are prominent components of the human gut microbiota, and OMV produced with these species are proposed to play key roles in gut homeostasis. OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides is a poorly understood process. Here, we revisited the protein composition of B. theta OMVs by mass spectrometry. We confirmed that OMVs produced by this organism contain large quantities of glycosidases and proteases, with most of them being lipoproteins. We found that most of these OMV-enriched lipoproteins are encoded by polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), such as the sus operon. We examined the subcellular localization of the components of the Sus system, and found that the alpha-amylase SusG is highly enriched in OMVs while the oligosaccharide importer SusC remains mostly in the OM. We show that all OMV-enriched lipoproteins possess a lipoprotein export sequence (LES) that mediates translocation of SusG from the periplasmic face of the OM towards the extracellular milieu and is required for SusG to localize preferentially to OMVs. We also show that surface-exposed SusG in OMVs is active and can rescue growth of bacterial cells incapable of growing on starch as only carbon source. Our results support the role of OMVs as \\\"public goods\\\" that can be utilized by other organisms with different metabolic capabilities.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESpecies from the Bacteroides genus are predominant members of the human gut microbiota. OMVs in Bacteroides have been shown to be important for the homeostasis of complex host-commensal relationships, mainly involving immune tolerance and protection from disease. OMVs carry many enzymatic activities involved in the cleavage of complex polysaccharides and have been proposed as public goods that can provide growth to other bacterial species by release of polysaccharide breakdown products into the gut lumen. Nevertheless, the mechanistic nature of OMV biogenesis is unclear for Bacteroides spp. This works shows the presence of a negatively-charged rich amino acid dual motif that is required for efficient packing of the surface-exposed alpha-amylase SusG into OMVs. Discovery of this motif (LES) is the first step in the generation of tailor made probiotic interventions that can exploit LES-related sequences to generate Bacteroides strains displaying proteins of interest in OMVs.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is associated with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition and neuroinflammation, possibly driven by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) hamper the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome; we analyzed whether stavudine (D4T), a prototypical NRTI, modulates A{beta}-mediated inflammasome activation; because neuroinflammation impairs A{beta} clearance by phagocytes, phagocytosis and autophagy were examined as well. THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with A{beta}42 alone or after LPS priming with/without D4T. NLRP3 and TREM2 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR, phagocytosis and ASC-Speck by AmnisFlowSight, NLRP3-produced cytokines by ELISA, authophagy by P-ELISA evaluation of P-ERK and P-AKT. Results showed that IL1{beta}, IL18 and caspase-1 were increased whereas A{beta}-phagocytosis and TREM2 were reduced in LPS+A{beta}42-stimulated cells. D4T reduced NLRP3 assembly as well as IL18 and caspase-1 production, but not IL1{beta}, phagocytosis, and TREM2. P-AKT expression was augmented and P-ERK was reduced by D4T, suggesting a stimulatory effect on autophagy. D4T reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammation, possibly restoring autophagy, in an in vitro model of AD; it will be interesting to verify its possibly beneficial effects in the clinical scenario.",

    "abstract": "Much of what is known about the timing of visual processing in the brain is inferred from intracranial studies in monkeys, with human data limited to mainly non-invasive methods with lower spatial resolution. Here, we estimated visual onset latencies from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in a patient who was implanted with 112 sub-dural electrodes, distributed across the posterior cortex of the right hemisphere, for pre-surgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy. Functional MRI prior to surgery was used to determine boundaries of visual areas. The patient was presented with images of objects from several categories. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) were calculated across all categories excluding targets, and statistically reliable onset latencies were determined using a bootstrapping procedure over the single trial baseline activity in individual electrodes. The distribution of onset latencies broadly reflected the known hierarchy of visual areas, with the earliest cortical responses in primary visual cortex, and higher areas showing later responses. A clear exception to this pattern was robust, statistically reliable and spatially localized, very early responses on the bank of the posterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS). The response in the IPS started nearly simultaneously with responses detected in peristriate visual areas, around 60 milliseconds post-stimulus onset. Our results support the notion of early visual processing in the posterior parietal lobe, not respecting traditional hierarchies, and give direct evidence for the upper limit of onset times of visual responses across the human cortex.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing speech in noisy environments is a challenging task that involves both auditory and language mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated noise-robust neural tracking of the speech envelope, i.e., fluctuations in sound intensity, in human auditory cortex, which provides a plausible neural basis for noise-robust speech recognition. The current study aims at teasing apart auditory and language contributions to noise-robust envelope tracking by comparing 2 groups of listeners, i.e., native listeners of the testing language and foreign listeners who do not understand the testing language. In the experiment, speech is mixed with spectrally matched stationary noise at 4 intensity levels and the neural responses are recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). When the noise intensity increases, an increase in neural response gain is observed for both groups of listeners, demonstrating auditory gain control mechanisms. Language comprehension creates no overall boost in the response gain or the envelope-tracking precision but instead modulates the spatial and temporal profiles of envelope-tracking activity. Based on the spatio-temporal dynamics of envelope-tracking activity, the 2 groups of listeners and the 4 levels of noise intensity can be jointly decoded by a linear classifier. All together, the results show that without feedback from language processing, auditory mechanisms such as gain control can lead to a noise-robust speech representation. High-level language processing, however, further modulates the spatial-temporal profiles of the neural representation of the speech envelope.",

To further advance its utility, a novel CRISPR-based technology termed \\\"precision guided SIT\\\" (pgSIT) is described. PgSIT mechanistically relies on a dominant genetic technology that enables simultaneous sexing and sterilization, facilitating the release of eggs into the environment ensuring only sterile adult males emerge. Importantly, for field applications, the release of eggs will eliminate burdens of manually sexing and sterilizing males, thereby reducing overall effort and increasing scalability. To demonstrate efficacy, we systematically engineer multiple pgSIT systems in Drosophila which consistently give rise to 100% sterile males. Importantly, we demonstrate that pgSIT-generated males are fit and competitive. Using mathematical models, we predict pgSIT will induce substantially greater population suppression than can be achieved by currently-available self-limiting suppression technologies. Taken together, pgSIT offers to transform our ability to control insect agricultural pests and disease vectors.",

    "abstract": "The majority of insect species have a clearly defined larval stage during development. Larval nutrition is crucial for individuals growth and development, and larval foraging success often depends on both resource availability and competition for those resources. To date, however, little is known about how these factors interact to shape larval development and behaviour. Here we manipulated the density of larvae of the polyphagous fruit fly pest Bactrocera tryoni ( Queensland fruit fly), and the diet concentration of patches in a foraging arena to address this gap. Using advanced statistical methods of machine learning and linear regression models, we showed that high larval density results in increased larval aggregation across all diets except in extreme diet dilutions. Larval aggregation was positively associated with larval body mass across all diet concentrations except in extreme diet dilutions where this relationship was reversed. Larvae in low-density arenas also tended to aggregate while those in high-density arenas tended to disperse, an effect that was observed for all diet concentrations. Furthermore, larvae in high-density arenas displayed significant avoidance of low concentration diets - a behaviour that was not observed amongst larvae in low-density arenas. Thus, aggregation can help, rather than hinder, larval growth in high-density environments, and larvae may be better able to explore available nutrition when at high-density than when at low density.",

At normal temperature (25{degrees}C), the percentage of absorbed light energy used for photosynthesis was higher for fed (~5-6% under low light exposure) compared to unfed corals (4%). Corals from both feeding treatments responded equally to stress from high light exposure (2400 mol photons m-2 s-1), exhibiting a decrease in photosynthetic energy efficiency down to 0.5-0.6%. Fed corals showed increased resilience against thermal bleaching compared to unfed corals, as fed corals were able to uphold their high photosynthetic energy efficiency for 5 days longer during thermal stress, as compared to unfed corals, which decreased their photosynthetic energy efficiency almost immediately when exposed to thermal stress. We conclude that active feeding is beneficial to corals by prolonging coral health and resilience during thermal stress as a result of an overall healthier symbiont population.",

In this study, we conducted a whole genome-wide QTL mapping of grain size related traits in einkorn wheat by constructing a high-density genetic map, and explored the candidate genes underlying QTL through homologous analysis and RNA sequencing. The high-density genetic map spanned 1873 cM and contained 9937 SNP markers assigned to 1551 bins in seven chromosomes. Strong collinearity and high genome coverage of this map were revealed with the physical maps of wheat and barley. Six grain size related traits were surveyed in five agro-climatic environments with 80% or more broad-sense heritability. In total, 42 QTL were identified and assigned to 17 genomic regions on six chromosomes and accounted for 52.3-66.7% of the phenotypic variations. Thirty homologous genes involved in grain development were located in 12 regions. RNA sequencing provided 4959 genes differentially expressed between the two parents. Twenty differentially expressed genes involved in grain size development and starch biosynthesis were mapped to nine regions that contained 26 QTL, indicating that the starch biosynthesis pathway played a vital role on grain development in einkorn wheat. This study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of grain size in einkorn wheat, the underlying genes enables the understanding of grain development and wheat genetic improvement, and the map facilitates the mapping of quantitative traits, map-based cloning, genome assembling and comparative genomics in wheat taxa.",

    "abstract": "The enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family includes a large number of important human pathogens such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus-A71, and rhinoviruses. Like all other positive-strand RNA viruses, genome replication of enteroviruses occurs on rearranged membranous structures called replication organelles (ROs). Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III{beta} (PI4KB) is required by all enteroviruses for RO formation. The enteroviral 3A protein recruits PI4KB to ROs, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) in PI4KB recruitment upon enterovirus replication using ACBD3-knockout (ACBD3KO) cells. ACBD3 knockout impaired replication of representative viruses from four enterovirus and two rhinovirus species. PI4KB recruitment was not observed in the absence of ACBD3. The lack of ACBD3 also affected the localization of individually expressed 3A, causing 3A to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the Golgi. Reconstitution of wt ACBD3 restored PI4KB recruitment and 3A localization, while an ACBD3 mutant that cannot bind to PI4KB restored 3A localization, but not virus replication. Consistently, reconstitution of a PI4KB mutant that cannot bind ACBD3 failed to restore virus replication in PI4KBKO cells. Finally, by reconstituting ACBD3 mutants lacking specific domains in ACBD3KO cells, we show that Acyl-coenzyme A binding (ACB) and charged amino acids region (CAR) domains are dispensable for 3A-mediated PI4KB recruitment and efficient enterovirus replication. Altogether, our data provide new insight into the central role of ACBD3 in recruiting PI4KB by enterovirus 3A and reveal the minimal domains of ACBD3 involved in recruiting PI4KB and supporting enterovirus replication.\\n\\nImportanceAs all other RNA viruses, enteroviruses reorganize host cellular membranes for efficient genome replication. A host lipid kinase, PI4KB, plays an important role on this membrane rearrangement. The exact mechanism of how enteroviruses recruit PI4KB was unclear. Here, we revealed a role of a Golgi-residing protein, ACBD3, as a mediator of PI4KB recruitment upon enterovirus replication. ACBD3 is responsible for proper localization of enteroviral 3A proteins in host cells which is important for 3A to recruit PI4KB. By testing ACBD3 and PI4KB mutants that abrogate the ACBD3-PI4KB interaction, we showed that this interaction is crucial for enterovirus replication. The importance of specific domains of ACBD3 was evaluated for the first time, and the essential domains for enterovirus replication were identified. Our findings open up a possibility for targeting ACBD3 or its interaction with virus as a novel strategy for a broad-spectrum antiviral drug.",

In this work a set of plants belonging to different genera of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns and lycophytes was investigated by monitoring their photosynthetic parameters in different seasons, looking for common trends and differences. In all plants analysed photosynthetic electron transport rate was found to be modulated by growth light intensity, ensuring a balance between available energy and photochemical capacity. Growth light also influenced the threshold where heat dissipation of excitation energy, also called Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ), was activated. On the contrary NPQ amplitude did not correlate with light intensity experienced by the plants but was a species-specific feature.\\n\\nNPQ zeaxanthin-dependent component, qZ, was found to be the most variable between different plants, modulating the intensity of the response but also the kinetic properties of its activation and relaxation. The slower NPQ component, qI, was instead found to be uncorrelated with photoinhibition eventually suffered by plants.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell transplantation holds great promise as a repair strategy following spinal cord injury. Embryonic stem cell (ESC) transplantation therapies have elicited encouraging though limited improvement in motor and sensory function with the use of heterogeneous mixtures of spinal cord neural progenitors and ESCs. Recently, transgenic lines of ESCs have been developed to allow for purification of specific candidate populations prior to transplantation, but the functional network connectivity of these populations and its relationship to recovery is difficult to examine with current technological limitations. In this study, we combine an ESC differentiation protocol, multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), and previously developed neuronal connectivity detection algorithms to develop an in vitro high-throughput assay of network connectivity in ESC-derived populations of neurons. Neuronal aggregation results in more consistent detection of individual neuronal activity than dissociated cultures. Both aggregated and dissociated culture types exhibited synchronized bursting behaviors at days 17 and 18 on MEAs, and thousands of statistically significance functional connections were detected in both culture types. Aggregate cultures, however, demonstrate a tight linear relationship between the inter-neuron distance of neuronal pairs and the time delay of the neuronal pair functional connections, whereas dissociated cultures do not. These results suggest that ESC-derived aggregated cultures may reflect some of the spatiotemporal connectivity characteristics of in vivo tissue and prove to be useful models of investigating potentially therapeutic populations of ESC-derived neurons in vitro.\\n\\nNOVELTY AND SIGNIFICANCEPrevious investigations of stem cell-derived network connectivity on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) have been limited to characterizations of bursting activity or broad averages of overall temporal network correlations, both of which overlook neuronal level interactions. The use of spike-sorting and short-time cross-correlation histograms along with statistical techniques developed specifically for MEAs allows for the characterization of functional connections between individual stem cell-derived neurons. This high-throughput connectivity assay will open doors for future examinations of the differences in functional network formation between various candidate stem cell-derived populations for spinal cord injury transplantation therapies--a critical inquiry into their therapeutic viability.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and peptides play a critical role in the human immune system. Accurate computational prediction of HLA-binding peptides can be used for peptide drug discovery. Currently, the best prediction algorithms are neural network based pan-specific models, which take advantage of the large amount of data across HLA alleles. However, current pan-specific models are all based on the pseudo sequence encoding for modeling the binding context and depend on the available HLA protein-peptide bound structures. In this work, we proposed a novel deep convolutional neural network model (DCNN) for HLA-peptide binding prediction, in which the encoding of the HLA sequence and the binding context are both learned by the network itself without requiring the HLA-peptide bound structure information. Our DCNN model is also characterized by its binding context extraction layer and dual outputs with both binding affinity output and binding probability outputs. Evaluation on public benchmark datasets shows that our DeepSeqPan model without HLA structural information in training achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large number of HLA alleles with good generalization capability. Since our model only needs raw sequences from the HLA-peptide binding pairs, it can be applied to binding predictions of HLAs without structure information and can also be applied to other protein binding problems such as protein-DNA and protein-RNA bindings.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in light-sheet microscopy enable imaging of cell morphology and signaling with unprecedented detail. However, the analytical tools to systematically measure and visualize the intricate relations between cell morphodynamics, intracellular signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics have been largely missing. Here, we introduce a set of computer vision and graphics methods to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying 3D cell morphogenesis and to test whether morphogenesis itself affects intracellular signaling. We demonstrate a machine learning based generic morphological motif detector that automatically finds lamellipodia, filopodia, and blebs on various cell types. Combining motif detection with molecular localization, we measure the differential association of PIP2 and KrasV12 with blebs. Both signals associate with bleb edges, as expected for membrane-localized proteins, but only PIP2 is enhanced on blebs. This suggests that local morphological cues differentially organize and activate sub-cellular signaling processes. Overall, our computational workflow enables the objective, automated analysis of the 3D coupling of morphodynamics with cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how organisms adapt to environmental variation is a key challenge of biology. Central to this are bet-hedging strategies that maximize geometric mean fitness across generations, either by being conservative or diversifying phenotypes. Theoretical models of bet-hedging and the multiplicative fitness effects of environmental variation across generations have traditionally assumed that environmental conditions are constant within lifetimes. However, behavioral ecology has revealed adaptive responses to additive fitness effects of environmental variation within lifetimes, either through insurance or risk-sensitive strategies. Here we explore whether the effects of adaptive insurance interact with the evolution of bet-hedging by varying the position and skew of fitness functions within and between lifetimes. When insurance causes the optimal phenotype to shift from the peak to down the less steeply decreasing side of the fitness function, then conservative bet-hedging does not generally evolve on top of this, even if diversifying bet-hedging can. Canalization to reduce phenotypic variation within a lifetime is almost always favored, except when the tails of the fitness function are steeply convex and produce a novel risk-sensitive increase in phenotypic variance akin to diversifying bet-hedging. Importantly, using skewed fitness functions, we provide the first example of how conservative and diversifying bet-hedging strategies might coexist.",

    "abstract": "1Epistasis is an important contributor to genetic variance, even in inbred populations where it is present as additive by additive interactions. Testing for epistasis presents a multiple testing problem as the search space for modest numbers of markers is large. Additionally, single markers do not necessarily track functional units of interacting chromatin as well as haplotype based methods do. To harness the power of multiple markers while drastically minimizing the number of tests conducted, we present a low resolution test for epistatic interactions across whole chromosome arms. Two additive genetic covariance matrices are constructed from markers on two different chromosome arms. The Hadamard product of these additive covariance matrices is then used to produce the additive by additive epistasis covariance matrix between the two chromosome arms. The covariance matrices are subsequently used to estimate an epistatic interaction variance parameter in a mixed model framework, while correcting for background additive and epistatic effects. We find significant epistatic interactions for 2% of interactions tested for four agronomic traits in a population of winter wheat. Interactions across homeologous chromosome arms were identified, but were less abundant than other interaction chromosome arm pairs. Of these, homeologous chromosome arm pair 4BL and 4DL showed a strong relationship between the product of their additive effects and the interaction effect that may be indicative of functional redundancy. Several chromosome arms were involved in many interactions across the genome, suggesting that they may contain important large effect regulatory factors. The differential patterns of epistasis across different traits suggests that detection of epistatic interactions is robust when correcting for background additive and epistatic effects in the population. The low resolution epistasis mapping method presented here identifies important epistatic interactions with a limited number of statistical tests at the cost of relatively lower precision.",

However, few studies focus on microbial compositions in different esophageal segments, especially after Lugols iodine staining (LIS) in the endoscopic examination for the screening of esophageal cancer. To investigate the composition of the bacterial microbiome in upper, middle and lower esophagus and if LIS would affect the detection of bacteria, 141 fasting samples including the upper, middle and lower esophagus from 27 participants were collected by brushing the mucosal surface of the esophagus before (Eso) and after (Lug) LIS. Bacterial V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced by Illuminas sequencing platform and analyzed using LEfSe system to identify specific microbiota. The top six abundant bacterial phyla taxa among three locations from both Eso and Lug groups were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and TM7. In terms of genera, the bacterium in three locations from two groups was all characterized by a highest relative abundance of Streptococcus. Bacteria diversity and the relative abundance between Eso and Lug were comparable (P > 0.05). Bacteria diversity was consistent in different esophageal locations for an individual, but it was significantly distinguishing in different subjects (P < 0.05). In Conclusion, the bacterial microbiome in healthy esophagus are highly diverse and consistent even among three physiological stenosis at all clades. Lugols iodine staining would not change local microenvironment in term of microbial composition. These finding provide an essential baseline for future studies investigating local and systemic bacterial microbiome and esophageal diseases.",

Multiple activating and inhibitory allosteric ligands regulate PKM2 activity by controlling the equilibrium between high activity tetramers and low activity dimers and monomers. However, it remains elusive how allosteric inputs upon simultaneous binding of different ligands are integrated to regulate PKM2 activity. Here, we show that, in the presence of the allosteric inhibitor L-phenylalanine (Phe), the activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) can induce PKM2 tetramerisation, but fails to maximally increase enzymatic activity. Guided by a new computational framework we developed to identify residues that mediate FBP-induced allostery, we generated two PKM2 mutants, A327S and C358A, in which activation by FBP remains intact but cannot be attenuated by Phe. Our findings demonstrate a role for residues involved in FBP-induced allostery in enabling the integration of allosteric input from Phe and reveal a mechanism that underlies the co-ordinate regulation of PKM2 activity by multiple allosteric ligands.",

Association with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DQB1*06:02/DQA1*01:02 (98% vs 25%) heterodimer (DQ0602), T cell receptor (TCR) and other immune loci suggest autoimmunity but autoantigen(s) are unknown. Onset is seasonal and associated with influenza A, notably pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1). An extensive unbiased DQ0602 binding peptide screen was performed encompassing peptides derived from Pandemrix(R) X-179-A pH1N1 influenza-A vaccine, a known T1N trigger, other H1N1 strains, and potential human autoantigens HCRT and RFX4, identifying 109 binders. The presence of cognate tetramer-peptide specific CD4+ T cells was studied in 35 narcolepsy cases and 22 DQ0602 controls after expansion of antigen-specific cells in Peripheral Blood Monocytes Cell (PBMC) cultures. Higher reactivity to influenza epitopes pHA273-287 (pH1N1 specific) and PR8 (H1N1 pre 2009)-specific NP17-31 were observed in T1N. Extensive reactivity to C-amidated but not native version of HCRT54-66 and HCRT86-97, which are two highly homologous peptides (HCRTNH2) was observed with higher frequencies of specific T cells in T1N. TCR/{beta} CDR3 sequences found in pHA273-287, NP17-31 and HCRTNH2 tetramer positive CD4+ cells were also retrieved in single INF{gamma}-secreting CD4+ sorted cells stimulated with Pandemrix(R), confirming immunodominance and functional significance in DQ0602-mediated responses and molecular mimicry. TCR/{beta} CDR3 motifs of HCRT54-66 and HCRT86-97 tetramers were extensively shared. Particularly notable was sharing across subjects of an CDR3, CAVETDSWGKLQF (in association with various CDR3{beta} that used TRAJ24, a chain modulated by Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) rs1154155 and rs1483979 associated with T1N.

    "abstract": "In proteomics, peptide information within mass spectrometry data from a specific organism sample is routinely challenged against a protein sequence database that best represent such organism. However, if the species/strain in the sample is unknown or poorly genetically characterized, it becomes challenging to determine a database which can represent such sample. Building customized protein sequence databases merging multiple strains for a given species has become a strategy to overcome such restrictions. However, as more genetic information is publicly available and interesting genetic features such as the existence of pan- and core genes within a species are revealed, we questioned how efficient such merging strategies are to report relevant information. To test this assumption, we constructed databases containing conserved and unique sequences for ten different species. Features that are relevant for probabilistic-based protein identification by proteomics were then monitored. As expected, increase in database complexity correlates with pangenomic complexity. However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Bortedella pertusis generated very complex databases even having low pangenomic complexity or no pangenome at all. This suggests that discrepancies in gene annotation is higher than average between strains of those species. We further tested database performance by using mass spectrometry data from eight clinical strains from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and from two published datasets from Staphylococcus aureus. We show that by using an approach where database size is controlled by removing repeated identical tryptic sequences across strains/species, computational time can be reduced drastically as database complexity increases.",

In contrast, PLA2 neurotoxins (taipoxin and paradoxin) were abundant in the venoms of other mammal-eating taipan species - Oxyuranus scutellatus and O. microlepidotus. Variation in neurotoxic PLA2 expression was also recorded in mammal-eating brown snakes, some species having high venom levels of textilotoxin or related homologues, for example Pseudonaja textilis and P. nuchalis, and others, such as P. ingrami, lacking them. Venom prothrombinase proteins (fX and fV) were expressed in most mammalivorous lineages, being particularly abundant in some Pseudonaja species. Notably, Oxyuranus temporalis venom was deficient in venom prothrombinase despite a mammal-based diet. Expression of an -neurotoxin that is lethal to rodents (pseudonajatoxin b) was profoundly down-regulated in Pseudonaja textilis venom sample from Queensland and highly up-regulated in the sample from South Australia despite a report that the snake feeds on rodents in both regions.\\n\\nConclusionRelated species of taipans and brown snakes that feed on small mammals express different sets of venom proteins toxic to this vertebrate group.

    "abstract": "Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS) affects Crassostrea gigas oysters worldwide and caused important economic losses. Disease dynamics was recently deciphered and revealed a multiple and progressive infection caused by the Ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 {micro}Var, triggering an immunosuppression followed by microbiota destabilization and bacteraemia by opportunistic bacterial pathogens. However, it remains unknown if microbiota might participate to oyster protection to POMS, and if microbiota characteristics might be predictive of oyster mortalities. To tackle this issue, we transferred full-sib progenies of resistant and susceptible oyster families from hatchery to the field during a period in favour of POMS. After five days of transplantation, oysters from each family were either sampled for individual microbiota analyses using 16S rRNA gene-metabarcoding or transferred into facilities to record their survival using controlled condition. As expected, all oysters from susceptible families died, and all oysters from the resistant family survived. Quantification of OsHV-1 and bacteria showed that five days of transplantation was long enough to contaminate oysters by POMS, but not for entering the pathogenesis process. Thus, it was possible to compare microbiota characteristics between resistant and susceptible oyster families at the early steps of infection.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is growing interest in the use of rapid blood culture identification (BCID) panels in antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP). While many studies have looked at its clinical and economic utility, its comparative utility in gram-positive and gram-negative blood stream infections (BSI) have not been as well characterized.\\n\\nMethodsThe study was a quasi-experimental retrospective study at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. All adult patients with positive blood cultures before BCID implementation (June 2015 to December 2015) and after BCID implementation (June 2016 to December 2016) were included. The outcomes of interest included: time to first appropriate antibiotic escalation, time to first appropriate antibiotic de-escalation, time to organism identification, LOS, infectious disease consultation, discharge disposition, and in-hospital mortality.\\n\\nResultsIn total, 203 patients were included in this study. There was a significant difference in the time to organism identification between pre- and post-BCID cohorts (27.1h vs. 3.3h, p<0.0001). BCID did not significantly reduce the time to first appropriate antimicrobial escalation or de-escalation for either GP-BSIs or GN-BSIs. Providers were more likely to escalate antimicrobial therapy in GP-BSIs after gram stain and more likely to de-escalate therapy in GN-BSIs after susceptibilities. While there were no significant differences in changes in antimicrobial therapy after organism identification by BCID, over a quarter of providers (28.1%) made changes after organism identification.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile BCID significantly reduced the time to identification for both GP-BSIs and GN-BSIs, BCID did not reduce the time to first appropriate antimicrobial escalation and de-escalation.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe hereditary disease, affecting 1 boy out of 3500, mainly results from the deletion of one or more exons leading to a reading frame shift of the DMD gene that abrogates dystrophin protein synthesis. We used the Cas9 of Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) to edit the human DMD gene. Pairs of sgRNAs were meticulously chosen to induce a genomic deletion to not only restore the reading frame but also produced a dystrophin protein with normally phased spectrin-like repeats. The formation of a dystrophin protein with spectrin-like repeats normally phased is not usually obtained by skipping or by deletion of complete exons. This can however be obtained in rare instances where the exon/intron borders of the beginning and the end of the complete deletion (patient deletion plus CRISPR-induced deletion are at similar positions in the spectrin-like repeat. We used pairs of sgRNAs, targeting exons 47 and 58 and a normal reading frame was restored in 67 to 86% of the resulting hybrid exons in myoblasts derived from muscle biopsies of 4 DMD patients with different exon deletions. The restoration of the DMD reading frame and restoration of the dystrophin expression was also obtained in vivo in the heart of the del52hDMD/mx. Our results provide a proof-of-principle that SaCas9 could be used to edit the human DMD gene and could be considered for the further development of a therapy for DMD.",

Despite the widespread importance of zinc and proton modulation of NMDARs, the molecular mechanism by which these ions modulate receptor activity has proven elusive. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structure of the GluN1/GluN2A NMDAR in a large ensemble of conformations under a range of physiologically relevant zinc and proton concentrations.

We found that Tbx1 is autonomously required for the endoderm to form a temporary multilayered epithelium while invaginating. E-cadherin for adherens junctions remains expressed and cells in the apical boundary express ZO-1. Foxi3 is required autonomously to modulate proliferation and promote later restoration of the endoderm to a monolayer once the epithelia meet after invagination. Completion of this process cooccurs with expression of Alcam needed to stabilize adherens junctions and extracellular, Fibronectin. These processes are required in the third pharyngeal pouch to form the thymus and parathyroid glands, disrupted in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome patients.",

    "abstract": "In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the conserved LIN-41 RNA-binding protein is a translational repressor that coordinately controls oocyte growth and meiotic maturation. LIN-41 exerts these effects, at least in part, by preventing the premature activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK-1. Here we investigate the mechanism by which LIN-41 is rapidly eliminated upon the onset of meiotic maturation. Elimination of LIN-41 requires the activities of CDK-1 and multiple SCF-type ubiquitin ligase subunits, including the conserved substrate adaptor protein SEL-10/Fbw7/Cdc4, suggesting that LIN-41 is a target of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Within the LIN-41 protein, two non-overlapping regions, Deg-A and Deg-B, are individually necessary for LIN-41 degradation; both contain several potential phosphodegron sequences, and at least one of these sites is required for LIN-41 degradation. Finally, Deg-A and Deg-B are sufficient, in combination, to mediate SEL-10-dependent degradation when transplanted into a different oocyte protein. Although LIN-41 is a potent inhibitor of protein translation and M-phase entry, the failure to eliminate LIN-41 from early embryos does not result in the continued translational repression of LIN-41 oocyte mRNA targets. Based on these observations, we propose a molecular model for the elimination of LIN-41 by SCFSEL-10 and suggest that LIN-41 is inactivated before it is degraded. Furthermore, we provide evidence that another RNA-binding protein, the GLD-1 tumor suppressor, is regulated similarly. Redundant mechanisms to extinguish translational repression by RNA-binding proteins may both control and provide robustness to irreversible developmental transitions, including meiotic maturation and the oocyte-to-embryo transition.",

    "abstract": "Increased production of cytokines in the in the brain during illness or injury modulates physiological processes, behavior, and cognitive function. It is likely that the pattern of cytokines, rather than the activation of any individual cytokine, determines the functional outcome of neuroimmune signaling. Cytokine networks may thus be particularly useful for understanding sex differences in immune and neuroimmune activation and outcomes. In this project, we aimed to determine the activation and resolution of hippocampal cytokine networks in both male and female mice. We measured 32 cytokines in the hippocampus and periphery of male and female mice at rest, 2, 6, 24, 48, and 168 hours after an acute systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 250g/kg). We hypothesized that males and females would exhibit both differences in individual cytokine levels and differences in network dynamics of hippocampal cytokines. Cytokines with sex-specific activation by LPS included male-specific elevations of IFN{gamma}, CSF1, CSF2, and IL-10; and female-specific activation of the IL-2 family and IL-4. We also observed differences in time course, where females showed more rapid elevations, and faster resolution of cytokine activity compared with males. Network analysis using ARACNE and Cytoscape demonstrated markedly different hippocampal cytokine networks across sex even at baseline, and sex differences in cytokine network activation states in response to LPS. Analysis of global shifts in cytokine concentrations further identified a period of cytokine and chemokine downregulation at 48 hours that was more pronounced in females compared with males. Together, these findings demonstrate that sex differences in neuroimmune responses include both differences in intensity of the cytokine response, and importantly differences in cytokine networks activated. Such sex differences in cytokine networks in the brain are likely critical for short and long-term functional outcomes associated with neuroimmune activation.",

    "abstract": "Taste circuits are genetically determined to elicit an innate appetitive or aversive response, ensuring that animals consume nutritious foods and avoid the ingestion of toxins. We have examined the response of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to acetic acid, a tastant that can be a metabolic resource but can also be toxic to the fly. Our data reveal that flies accommodate these conflicting attributes of acetic acid by virtue of a hunger-dependent switch in their behavioral response to this stimulus. Fed flies show taste aversion to acetic acid, likely a response to its potential toxicity, whereas starved flies show a robust appetitive response that may reflect their overriding need for calories. These opposing responses are mediated by two different classes of taste neurons. Acetic acid activates both the sugar and bitter pathways, which have opposing effects on feeding behavior. Hunger shifts the response from aversion to attraction by enhancing the appetitive sugar pathway as well as suppressing the aversive bitter pathway. Thus a single tastant can drive opposing behaviors by activating distinct taste pathways modulated by internal state.",

    "abstract": "To verify the possible morphological and ultrastructural differences in the Jatropha curcas leaves, in response to high-intensity salt stress, three genotypes were evaluated (CNPAE183, JCAL171 and CNPAE218). In all the genotypes, 750mM NaCl, added to the nutrient solution, was applied to test its salt tolerance. For the analysis, the leaves were collected at three time points: (i) before stress (time 0 hour); (ii) during stress time (time 50 hours); and (iii) in the recovery period (time 914 hours) when the stressed plants recovered and demonstrated measurements of net photosynthetic with values similar to those demonstrated by the control plants. We showed that regardless of the genotype, saline shock caused an increase in the thickness of the mesophyll, and after the removal of NaCl, the thicker mesophyll remained in the JCAL171 and CNPAE218 genotypes, while the values observed in the CNPAE183 genotype were similar to those before stress. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the stomata of CNPAE183 are smaller and have a stomatal index higher than the values demonstrated in JCAL171 and CNPAE218. Therefore, among the genotypes analysed, CNPAE183 demonstrates that it could be considered a promising genotype for future studies of genetic improvement that seek elite genotypes tolerant to salinity.\\n\\nHighlightsThis manuscript present the following highlights:\\n\\nThe mesophyll thickness contributes to provide a smaller path for the CO2 to Rubisco J. curcas may reduce mesophyll air spaces as a strategy to mitigate low gas exchange Leaves modulate the expansion of stomata differently than other epidermal cells Smaller stomata with greater pore aperture are more abundant on the abaxial surface CNPAE183 is a candidate for studies in search of elite genotypes tolerant to salinity",

    "abstract": "Disruptions in connections between the nuclear lamina and nuclear matrix occur in myopathic disorders. However, the biological significance of nuclear lamina - nuclear matrix coupling still remains largely undetermined. Previously it has been demonstrated that the nuclear matrix protein, matrin-3, binds to lamin A/C and this interaction is disrupted in laminopathies resulting in enhanced separation between the lamina and matrix. Matrin-3 has recently been identified as a core regulator of alternative splicing, whereas the involvement of lamin A/C in splicing still remains controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that lamin A/C is not only required for maintaining the nuclear organization of matrin-3, but also of other splicing activators and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) components. Interestingly, mis-localization of these splicing components did not appear to significantly disrupt alternative splicing events of cassette exons regulated by matrin-3. Thus, the lamin A/C-matrin3 interaction is unlikely to be involved in controlling alternative splicing but could be important in coordinating other nuclear activities. Interestingly, matrin-3 knock-down results in misshapen nuclei suggesting its interaction with lamin A/C maybe important in maintaining nuclear structural integrity.",

However, it is unknown if these two GSC populations are sufficient to generate the spectrum of cellular heterogeneity observed in GBM. The lineage relationships and niche interactions of GSCs have not been fully elucidated. We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and matched exome sequencing of human GBMs (12 patients; >37,000 cells) to identify recurrent hierarchies of GSCs and their progeny. We map sequenced cells to tumor-anatomical structures and identify microenvironment interactions using reference atlases and quantitative immunohistochemistry. We find that all GSCs can be described by a single axis of variation, ranging from proneural to mesenchymal. Increasing mesenchymal GSC (mGSC) content, but not proneural GSC (pGSC) content, correlates with significantly inferior survival. All clonal expressed mutations are found in the GSC populations, with a greater representation of mutations found in mGSCs. While pGSCs upregulate markers of cell-cycle progression, mGSCs are largely quiescent and overexpress cytokines mediating the chemotaxis of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We find mGSCs enriched in hypoxic regions while pGSCs are enriched in the tumors invasive edge. We show that varying proportions of mGSCs, pGSCs, their progeny and stromal/immune cells are sufficient to explain the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity observed in GBM. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding the lineage relationships between GSCs and other glioma cell types.",
