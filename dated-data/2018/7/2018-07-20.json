    "abstract": "Older adults often experience difficulties in understanding speech, partly because of age-related hearing loss. In young adults, activity of the left articulatory motor cortex is enhanced and it interacts with the auditory cortex via the left-hemispheric dorsal stream during speech processing. Little is known about the effect of ageing and age-related hearing loss on this auditory-motor interaction and speech processing in the articulatory motor cortex. It has been proposed that up-regulation of the motor system during speech processing could compensate for hearing loss and auditory processing deficits in older adults. Alternatively, age-related auditory deficits could reduce and distort the input from the auditory cortex to the articulatory motor cortex, suppressing recruitment of the motor system during listening to speech. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ageing and age-related hearing loss on the excitability of the tongue motor cortex during listening to spoken sentences using transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography. Our results show that the excitability of the tongue motor cortex was facilitated during listening to speech in young and older adults with normal hearing. This facilitation was significantly reduced in older adults with hearing loss. These findings suggest a decline of auditory-motor processing of speech in adults with age-related hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Many siRNAs and shRNAs are toxic to cancer cells through a 6mer seed sequence (position 2-7 of the guide strand). A siRNA screen with all 4096 possible 6mer seed sequences in a neutral RNA backbone revealed a preference for guanine in positions 1-3 and a GC content of >80% of the 6mer seed in the most toxic siRNAs. These 6mer seed containing siRNAs exert their toxicity by targeting survival genes which contain GC-rich 3UTRs. The master tumor suppressor miRNA miR-34a was found to be toxic through such a G-rich 6mer seed suggesting that certain tumor suppressive miRNAs use a toxic 6mer seed to kill cancer cells. An analysis of all mature miRNAs suggests that most miRNAs evolved to avoid guanine at the 5' end of the 6mer seed sequence of the predominantly expressed arm. In contrast, for many tumor suppressive miRNAs the predominant arm contains a G-rich toxic 6mer seed, presumably to eliminate cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "The temporal coordination of slow oscillations and sleep spindles is believed to underlie processes of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and reorganization. Accumulating evidence of the predominantly local expression of these individual oscillatory rhythms suggests that their interaction may have a similar local component. However, it is unclear whether local coupling holds uniformly across the cortex, and whether and how these dynamics differ between fast and slow spindles, and sleep stages. Moreover, substantial individual variability in the expression of both spindles and slow oscillations raise the possibility that their cross-frequency interactions show similar individual differences. Using two nights of multi-channel electroencephalography recordings from 24 healthy individuals, we characterized the topography of slow oscillation-spindle coupling. We found that locally coupled oscillations occur over widespread cortical areas, but that their dynamics vary with spindle class, sleep stage, and location. Moreover, the phase of the slow oscillation cycle at which spindles were expressed differed markedly across individuals but was stable across nights. However, individual variability of coupling phase was not correlated with overnight memory change. These findings both add an important spatial aspect to our understanding of the temporal coupling of sleep oscillations and demonstrate the heterogeneity of coupling dynamics, which must be taken into account when formulating mechanistic accounts of sleep-related memory processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "Variability is a fundamental feature of human brain activity that is particularly pronounced during development. However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporate estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences relate to spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8-17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to cognitive reappraisal. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as implying neural specialization. These results suggest that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open up a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.",

    "abstract": "In embryonic development, cell shape changes are essential for building functional organs, but in many cases the mechanisms that precisely regulate these changes remain unknown. We propose that fluid-like drag forces generated by the motion of an organ through surrounding tissue could generate changes to its structure that are important for its function. To test this hypothesis, we study the zebrafish left-right organizer, Kupffers vesicle (KV), using experiments and mathematical modeling. During development, monociliated cells that comprise the KV undergo region-specific shape changes along the anterior-posterior axis that are critical for KV function: anterior cells become long and thin, while posterior cells become short and squat. Here, we develop a mathematical vertex-like model for cell shapes, which incorporates both tissue rheology and cell motility, and constrain the model parameters using previously published rheological data for the zebrafish tailbud [Serwane et al.] as well as our own measurements of the KV speed. We find that drag forces due to dynamics of cells surrounding the KV could be sufficient to drive KV cell shape changes during KV development. More broadly, these results suggest that cell shape changes could be driven by dynamic forces not typically considered in models or experiments.",

The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria that are present in honey commonly found in Bangladesh, which can tolerate the antimicrobial conditions of honey and survive in it. Fortunately, such bacteria could be detected, isolated and characterized by morphological and biochemical tests. The predominant type of bacteria commonly found in both raw and commercial honeys of Bangladesh are gram positive cocci such as streptococci, staphylococci, micrococci, bacilli and lactobacilli. Few gram negative bacteria were also isolated like Escherichia coli (8%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (8%) and some gram negative/gram variable Micrococcus luteus (75%). Hopefully, such knowledge would benefit people in the future as they will know more about the microorganisms present in honey and about the safety and quality of the honey they are about to buy or consume.",

Here, we use an Il-1{beta} fluorescent transgenic line to show that there is an early innate immune pro-inflammatory response to well-established zebrafish models of inflammation and Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) infection. We demonstrate that host-derived hypoxia signalling, mediated by the Hif-1 transcription factor, can prime macrophages with increased levels of Il-1{beta} in the absence of infection, upregulating neutrophil antimicrobial nitric oxide production, leading to greater protection against infection. Our data link Hif-1 to proinflammatory macrophage Il-1{beta} transcription in vivo during early mycobacterial infection and importantly highlight a host protective mechanism, via antimicrobial nitric oxide, that decreases disease outcomes and that could be targeted therapeutically to stimulate the innate immune response to better deal with infections.",

    "abstract": "One Sentence SummaryUpon microbial infection in Drosophila, the E3-ubiquitin ligase Hyd ubiquitinylates the NF-{kappa}B co-factor Akirin for its efficient binding to the NF-{kappa}B factor Relish and subsequent activation of immune effectors genes.\\n\\nABSTRACTThe Drosophila IMD pathway is activated upon microbial challenge with Gramnegative bacteria to trigger the innate immune response. In order to decipher this NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway, we undertook an ex-vivo RNAi screen targeting specifically E3 ubiquitin ligases and identified the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase Hyperplastic Discs \\\"Hyd\\\" as a new actor of the IMD pathway. We showed that Hyd targets the NF-{kappa}B cofactor of Akirin. The K63-polyubiquitination chains deposited by Hyd decorate Akirin for its efficient binding to the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor Relish. We showed that this Hyd-mediated interaction is critical to activate immune-induced genes that depend on both Relish and Akirin, but is dispensable for those that depend solely on Relish. Therefore Hyd is key in operating a NF-{kappa}B transcriptional selectivity downstream of the IMD pathway. Drosophila depleted for Hyd or Akirin failed to express the full set of immune-induced anti-microbial peptide coding genes and succumbed to immune challenges. We showed further that Ubr5, the mammalian homolog of Hyd, is also required downstream of the NF-{kappa}B pathway for the IL1{beta}-mediated IL6 activation. This study links the action of a E3-ubiquitin ligase to the activation of immune effector genes, deepening our understanding of the involvement of ubiquitination in inflammation and identifying a potential target for the control of inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "How do we make choices for others with different preferences from our own? Although neuroimaging studies implicate similar circuits in representing preferences for oneself and others, some models propose that additional corrective mechanisms come online when choices for others diverge from ones own preferences. Here we used event-related potentials (ERP) in humans, in combination with computational modeling, to examine how social information is integrated in the time leading up to choices for oneself and others. Hungry male and female participants with unrestricted diets selected foods for themselves, a similar unrestricted eater, and a dissimilar, self-identified healthy eater. Across choices for both oneself and others, ERP value signals emerged within the same time window but differentially reflected taste and health attributes based on the recipients preferences. Choices for the dissimilar recipient were associated with earlier activity localized to brain regions implicated in social cognition including temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Finally, response-locked analysis revealed a late ERP component specific to choices for the similar recipient, localized to the parietal lobe, that appeared to reflect differences in the response threshold based on uncertainty. A multi-attribute computational model supported the link between specific ERP components and distinct model parameters, and was not significantly improved by adding time-dependent dual processes. Model simulations suggested that longer response times (RTs) previously associated with effortful correction may alternatively arise from higher choice uncertainty. Together these results provide a parsimonious neurocomputational mechanism for social decision-making, additionally explaining divergent patterns of choice and RT data in decisions for oneself and others.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHow do we choose for others, particularly when they have different preferences? Whereas some studies suggest that similar neural circuits underlie decision-making for oneself and others, others argue for additional, slower perspective-taking mechanisms. Combining event-related potentials with computational modeling, we found that integration of others preferences occurs over the same timescale as for oneself, while differentially tracking recipient-relevant attributes. Although choosing for others took longer and produced differences in late-emerging neural responses, computational modeling attributed these patterns to greater response caution rather than egocentric bias correction. Computational simulations also correctly predicted when and why choosing differently for others takes longer, suggesting that a model incorporating value integration and evidence accumulation can parsimoniously account for complex patterns in social decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of transcription factor activity dynamically changes across cellular conditions and disease subtypes. The identification of biological modulators contributing to context-specific gene regulation is one of the challenging tasks in systems biology, which is necessary to understand and control cellular responses across different genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. Previous approaches for identifying biological modulators from gene expression data were restricted to the capturing of a particular type of a three-way dependency among a regulator, its target gene, and a modulator; these methods cannot describe the complex regulation structure, such as when multiple regulators, their target genes, and modulators are functionally related. Here, we propose a statistical method for identifying biological modulators by capturing multivariate local dependencies, based on energy statistics, which is a class of statistics based on distances. Subsequently, our method assigns a measure of statistical significance to each candidate modulator through a permutation test. We compared our approach with that of a leading competitor for identifying modulators, and illustrated its performance through both simulations and real data analysis. Our method, entitled genome-wide identification of modulators using local energy statistical test (GIMLET), is implemented with R ([&ge;] 3.2.2) and is available from github (https://github.com/tshimam/GIMLET).",

Vibrio parahaemolyticus is found in warm coastal waters and causes gastroenteritis in humans and economically significant disease in shrimps.\\n\\nResultsBased on data from 1,103 genomes, we show that V. parahaemolyticus is divided into four diverse populations, VppUS1, VppUS2, VppX and VppAsia. The first two are largely restricted to the US and Northern Europe, while the others are found worldwide, with VppAsia making up the great majority of isolates in the seas around Asia. Patterns of diversity within and between the populations are consistent with them having arisen by progressive divergence via genetic drift during geographical isolation. However, we find that there is substantial overlap in their current distribution. These observations can be reconciled without requiring genetic barriers to exchange between populations if dispersal between oceans has increased dramatically in the recent past. We found that VppAsia isolates from the US have an average of 1.01% more shared ancestry with VppUS1 and VppUS2 isolates than VppAsia isolates from Asia itself. Based on time calibrated trees of divergence within epidemic lineages, we estimate that recombination affects about 0.017% of the genome per year, implying that the genetic mixture has taken place within the last few decades.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that human activity, such as shipping and aquatic products trade, are responsible for the change of distribution pattern of this marine species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe chemically-rich seaweed Galaxaura is not only highly competitive with corals, but also provides substrate for other macroalgae. Its ecology and associated epiphytes remain largely unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we herein undertook an ecological assessment to explore the spatial variation, temporal dynamics, and epiphytic macroalgae of G. divaricata on patch reefs in the lagoon of Dongsha Atoll, a shallow coral reef ecosystem in the northern South China Sea, repeatedly impacted by mass coral bleaching events.\\n\\nMethodsTwelve spatially independent patch reefs in the Dongsha lagoon were first surveyed to assess the benthic composition in April 2016, and then revisited to determine G. divaricata percent cover in September 2017, with one additional Galaxaura-dominated reef (site 9). Four surveys over a period of 17 months were carried out on a degraded patch reef (site 7) to assess the temporal variation in G. divaricata cover. Epiphytic macroalgae associated with G. divaricata were quantified and identified through the aid of DNA barcoding.\\n\\nResultsPatch reefs in the Dongsha lagoon were degraded, exhibiting relatively low live coral cover (5-43%), but high proportions of macroalgae (13-58%) and other substrates (rubble and dead corals; 23-69%). The distribution of G. divaricata was heterogeneous across the lagoon, with highest abundance (16-41%) in the southeast area. Temporal surveys from site 7 and photo-evidence from site 9 suggested that an overgrowth by G. divaricata was still present to a similar extend after 17 months and 3.5 years. Yet, G. divaricata provides a suitable substrate some allelopathic macroalgae (e.g., Lobophora sp.).\\n\\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates that an allelopathic seaweed, such as G. divaricata, can overgrow degraded coral reefs for extended periods of time. By providing habitat for harmful macroalgae, a prolonged Galaxaura overgrowth could strengthen negative feedback loops on degraded coral reefs, further decreasing their recovery potential.",

RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) driven transcription of tDNA genes for production of tRNAs is a key element in efficient protein biosynthesis. Here we present an analysis of the effects of altered RNAP III activity on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome and metabolism under glucose rich conditions. We show for the first time that RNAP III is tightly coupled to the glycolytic system at the molecular systems level. Decreased RNAP III activity or the absence of the RNAP III negative regulator, Maf1 elicit broad changes in the abundance profiles of enzymes engaged in fundamental metabolism in S. cerevisiae. In a mutant compromised in RNAP III activity there is a repartitioning towards amino acids synthesis de novo at the expense of glycolytic throughput. Conversely, cells lacking Maf1 protein have greater potential for glycolytic flux.",

Studies in mutant animal models demonstrated that ER and ER{beta} are required for normal ovary development and function. However, the degree to which GPER signaling contributes to ovary development and function is less well understood. Previous studies using cultured fish oocytes found that estradiol inhibits oocyte maturation in a GPER-dependent manner, but whether GPER regulates oocyte maturation in vivo is not known. To test the hypothesis that GPER regulates oocyte maturation in vivo, we assayed ovary development and function in gper mutant zebrafish. We found that homozygous mutant gper embryos developed into male and female adults with normal sex ratios and fertility. Adult mutant fish exhibited normal secondary sex characteristics and fertility. Additionally, mutant ovaries were histologically normal. We observed no differences in the number of immature versus mature oocytes in mutant versus wild-type ovaries from both young and aged adults. Furthermore, expression of genes associated with sex determination and ovary function were normal in gper mutant ovaries compared to wild type. Our findings suggest that GPER is not required for sex determination, ovary development or fertility in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic molecular clusters are assembled through weak multivalent interactions and are platforms for cellular functions, especially receptor-mediated signaling. Clustering is also a prerequisite for liquid-liquid phase separation. But it is not well understood how molecular structure and cellular organization control clustering. Using coarse-grain kinetic Langevin dynamics, we performed computational experiments on a prototypical ternary system modeled after membrane-bound nephrin, the adaptor Nck1 and the actin nucleation promoting factor NWASP. Steady state cluster size distributions favored stoichiometries that optimized binding (stoichiometry matching), but still were quite broad. At high concentrations, the system can be driven beyond the saturation boundary such that cluster size is limited only by the number of available molecules. This behavior would be predictive of phase separation. Domains close to binding sites sterically inhibited clustering much less than terminal domains because the latter effectively restrict access to the cluster interior. Increased flexibility of interacting molecules diminished clustering by shielding binding sites within compact conformations. Membrane association of nephrin increased the cluster size distribution in a density-dependent manner. These properties provide insights into how molecular ensembles function to localize and amplify cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "The robust detection of structural variants in mammalian genomes remains a challenge. It is particularly difficult in the case of genetically unstable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines with only draft genome assemblies available. We explore the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the targeted capture of genomic loci containing integrated vectors in CHO-K1-based cell lines, and compare it to popular target-enrichment methods and to whole genome sequencing (WGS). The CRISPR/Cas9-based techniques allow for amplification-free capture of genomic regions, which reduces the possibility of sequencing artifacts. Other advantages of these methods are the ease of bioinformatics analysis, potential for multiplexing, and the production of longer sequencing templates for real-time sequencing. The utility of these protocols has been proven by identification of transgene integration sites and flanking sequences in a number of CHO cell lines. However, data produced by these and other targeted capture methods are not always sufficient to analyze complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) or unexpected sequences introduced into genome by vector integration events. In contrast, WGS provides complete information about vector integration sites, vector copy number, CGRs, and foreign DNA-but despite these benefits, WGS is not easily implemented due to the cost and complexity of the analysis.",

    "abstract": "Within the complex aggregation process of A{beta}-peptides into fibrils, oligomeric species, play a central role and reveal fundamental properties of the underlying mechanism of aggregation. In particular, low molecular weight aggregates have attracted increasing interest because of their role in cytotoxicity and neuronal apoptosis, typical of aggregation related diseases. One of the main techniques used to characterize such early stages of aggregation is fluorescence spectroscopy. To this end, A{beta}-peptide chains are functionalized with fluorescent tags, often covalently bound to the disordered N-terminus region of the peptide, with the assumption that functionalization and presence of the fluorophore will not modify the process of self-assembly nor the final fibrillar structure. Up to date, experimental findings reveal size distributions of thermodynamically stable oligomers ranging from very narrow distributions of dimers to octamers, to very broad distributions up to 50-mers. In the present investigation we systematically study the effects of five of the most commonly used fluorophores on the aggregation of A{beta}(1-40)-peptides. Time-resolved and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy have been chosen to monitor the oligomer populations at different fibrillation times, TEM, AFM and X-ray diffraction to investigate the structure of mature fibrils. While the structures of the mature fibrils were only slightly affected by the fluorescent tags, the sizes of the detected oligomeric species varied significantly depending on the chosen fluorophore. In particular, we relate the presence of high molecular weight oligomers (as found for the fluorophores HiLyte 647, Atto 647N and Atto 655) to net-attractive, hydrophobic fluorophore-peptide interactions, which are weak in the case of HiLyte 488, and Atto 488. The latter form low molecular weight oligomers only. Our findings reveal the potentially high impact of the properties of fluorophores on transient aggregates which needs to be included in the interpretation of experimental data of oligomers of fluorescently labeled peptides.",

    "abstract": "The association between GRE scores and academic success in graduate programs is currently of national interest. GRE scores are often assumed to be predictive of student success in graduate school. However, we found no such association in admission data from Vanderbilts Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity (IMSD), which recruited historically underrepresented students for graduate study in the biomedical sciences at Vanderbilt University spanning a wide range of GRE scores. This study avoids the typical biases of most GRE investigations of performance where only high-achievers on the GRE were admitted. GRE scores, while collected at admission, were not used or consulted for admission decisions and comprise the full range of percentiles, from 1% to 91%. We report on the 29 students recruited to the Vanderbilt IMSD from 2007-2011 who have completed the program at this date. While the data set is not large, the predictive trends between GRE and long-term graduate outcomes (publications, first author publications, time to degree, predoctoral fellowship awards, and faculty evaluations) are remarkably null and there is sufficient precision to rule out even mild relationships between GRE and these outcomes. Career outcomes are encouraging; many students are in postdocs, and the rest are in stage-appropriate career environments for such a cohort, including tenure track faculty, biotech and entrepreneurship careers.",

    "abstract": "Hox genes encode a family of transcription factors that, despite having similar in vitro DNA binding preferences, regulate distinct genetic programs along the metazoan anterior-posterior axis. To better define mechanisms of Hox specificity, we compared and contrasted the ability of abdominal Hox factors to regulate two cis-regulatory elements within the Drosophila embryo. Both the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Abdominal-A (Abd-A) Hox factors form cooperative complexes with the Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth) transcription factors to repress the distal-less leg selector gene via the DCRE, whereas only Abd-A interacts with Exd and Hth on the RhoA element to activate a rhomboid serine protease gene that stimulates Epidermal Growth Factor secretion. By swapping binding sites between these elements, we found that the RhoA Exd/Hth/Hox site configuration that mediates Abd-A specific activation can also convey transcriptional repression by both Ubx and Abd-A when placed into the DCRE, but only in one orientation. We further show that the orientation and spacing of Hox sites relative to additional transcription factor binding sites within the RhoA and DCRE elements is critical to mediate appropriate cell- and segment-specific output. These results indicate that the interaction between Hox, Exd, and Hth neither determines activation vs repression specificity nor defines Ubx vs Abd-A specificity. Instead the precise integration of Hox sites with additional TF inputs is required for accurate transcriptional output. Taken together, these studies provide new insight into the mechanisms of Hox target and regulatory specificity as well as the constraints placed on regulatory elements to convey appropriate outputs.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Hox genes encode a family of transcription factors that give cells within each region along the developing body plan a unique identity in animals from worms to mammals. Surprisingly, however, most of the Hox factors bind the same or highly similar DNA sequences. These findings raise a paradox: How can proteins that have highly similar DNA binding properties perform different functions in the animal by regulating different sets of target genes? In this study, we address this question by studying how two Hox factors regulate the expression of target genes that specify leg development and the making of liver-like cells in the developing fly. By comparing and contrasting how Hox target genes are activated and/or repressed, we found that the same Hox binding sites can mediate either activation or repression in a manner that depends upon context. In addition, we found that a Hox binding site that is normally regulated by only one Hox factor, can also be used by more than one Hox factor swapped into another target gene. These findings indicate that the specificity of a Hox factor to regulate target genes does not rely solely upon DNA binding specificity but also requires regulatory specificity.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of genes responsible for many diseases and other common traits in humans have been detected by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in the last decade. However, candidate causal variants found so far usually explain only a small fraction of the heritability estimated by family data, the rest remaining  missing. The most common explanation for this observation is that the missing heritability corresponds to variants, either rare or common, with very small effect, which pass undetected due to a lack of statistical power. We carried out a meta-analysis using data from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog in order to explore the distribution of gene effects for a set of 59 complex traits, to investigate the factors related to new gene discovery and to quantify their contributions to heritability. With the data obtained we were able to predict the expected distribution of gene effects for 16 traits and diseases including cancer and immune disorders, the missing number of genes yet to be discovered, and the additive contribution of common variants to heritability. Our results indicate that, for most traits, the additive contribution of hundreds or thousands of genes is able to explain the familiar heritability. However, for some traits, the predicted heritability is lower than the familiar one, so that part of the missing heritability cannot be explained by the contribution of common variants with additive effects, and other phenomena (e.g. dominance or epistasis) should be invoked.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe heritability of biological traits refers to the fraction of the phenotypic (i.e. visible or diagnosable) variability that is explained by the underlying genetic variability. Despite the efforts made to find the genes responsible for complex traits and diseases, most of the heritability explained by the variants found explains only a small fraction of that measured by population and family studies. The remaining  missing heritability is usually assumed to be due to the additive effect of undetected variants. Here we carried out a meta-analysis using records from a publicly available database of genome-wide studies on humans. With these data, we were able to investigate and make inferences on the nature of heritability and the factors associated to new gene discovery. Our results indicate that increasing population sample size, as well as its diversity, enhances the discovery of new genes, but these have lower and lower effects, contributing little to heritability. We were also able to predict the distribution of gene effects for many traits and the number of variants needed to fully explain the heritability. For some traits, the additive effects of single variants yet to be discovered cannot explain the heritability, suggesting that other sources of variation are involved.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making is a complex task and requires adaptive mechanisms that facilitate efficient behaviour. Here, we consider a neural circuit that guides the behaviour of an animal in ongoing binary choice tasks. We adopt an inhibition motif from neural network theory and propose a dynamical system characterized by nonlinear feedback, which links mechanism (the implementation of the neural circuit) and function (increasing reproductive value). A central inhibitory unit influences evidence-integrating excitatory units, which in our terms correspond to motivations competing for selection. We determine the parameter regime where the animal exhibits improved decision-making behaviour, and explain different behavioural outcomes by making the link between bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear neural circuit model and decision-making performance. We find that the animal performs best if it tunes internal parameters of the neural circuit in accordance with the underlying bifurcation structure. In particular, variation of inhibition strength and excitation-over-inhibition ratio have a crucial effect on the decision outcome, by allowing the animal to break decision deadlock and to enter an oscillatory phase that describes its internal motivational state. Our findings indicate that this oscillatory phase may improve the overall performance of the animal in an ongoing foraging task. Our results underpin the importance of an integrated functional and mechanistic study of animal activity selection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOrganisms frequently select activities, which relate to economic, social and perceptual decision-making problems. The choices made may have substantial impact on their lives. In foraging decisions, for example, animals aim at reaching a target intake of nutrients; it is generally believed that a balanced diet improves reproductive success, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms that integrate nutritional needs within the brain. In our study, we address this coupling between physiological states and a decision-making circuit in the context of foraging decisions. We consider a model animal that has the drive to eat or drink. The motivation to select and perform one of these activities (i.e. eating or drinking), is processed in artificial neuronal units that have access to information on how hungry and thirsty the animal is at the point it makes the decision. We show that inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms in the neural circuit shape ongoing binary decisions, and we reveal under which conditions oscillating motivations may improve the overall performance of the animal. Our results indicate that inefficient or pathological decision-making may originate from suboptimal modulation of excitation and inhibition in the neurobiological network.",

Correcting for genetic relatedness, genome wide association study identified QTLs for biomass production in early drought stress conditions and for stay-green trait. In particular, genes involved in the sirohaem and wax biosynthesis pathways were found to co-locate with association loci.

    "abstract": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are spontaneous depolarizations during the repolarization phase of an action potential in cardiac myocytes. It is widely known that EADs are promoted by increasing inward currents and/or decreasing outward currents, a condition called reduced repolarization reserve. Recent studies based on bifurcation theories show that EADs are caused by a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation, bringing in further mechanistic insights into the genesis and dynamics of EADs. In this study, we investigated the EAD properties, such as the EAD amplitude, the inter-EAD interval, and the latency of the first EAD, and their major determinants. We first made predictions based on the bifurcation theory and then validated them in physiologically more detailed action potential models. These properties were investigated by varying one parameter at a time or using parameter sets randomly drawn from assigned intervals. The theoretical and simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Our major findings are that the EAD amplitude and takeoff potential exhibit a negative linear correlation; the inter-EAD interval is insensitive to the maximum ionic current conductance but mainly determined by the kinetics of ICa,L and the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation; and both inter-EAD interval and latency vary largely from model to model. Most of the model results generally agree with experimental observations in isolated ventricular myocytes. However, a major discrepancy between modeling results and experimental observations is that the inter-EAD intervals observed in experiments are mainly between 200 and 500 ms, irrespective of species, while those of the mathematical models exhibit a much wider range with some models exhibiting inter-EAD intervals less than 100 ms. Our simulations show that the cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the difference in ICa,L recovery properties in different mathematical models, which needs to be addressed in future action potential model development.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEarly afterdepolarizations (EADs) are abnormal depolarizations during the plateau phase of action potential in cardiac myocytes, arising from a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation. The same bifurcations are also responsible for certain types of bursting behaviors in other cell types, such as beta cells and neuronal cells. EADs are known to play important role in the genesis of lethal arrhythmias and have been widely studied in both experiments and computer models. However, a detailed comparison between the properties of EADs observed in experiments and those from mathematical models have not been carried out. In this study, we performed theoretical analyses and computer simulations of different ventricular action potential models as well as different species to investigate the properties of EADs and compared these properties to those observed in experiments. While the EAD properties in the action potential models capture many of the EAD properties seen in experiments, the inter-EAD intervals in the computer models differ a lot from model to model, and some of them show very large discrepancy with those observed in experiments. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in future cardiac action potential model development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the first major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsAll Kenyan genomes contained two mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this Ae. aegypti adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the first large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained to India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in Ae. aegypti-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high Ae. aegypti prevalence, carry these two mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strains global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strains ability to cause major outbreaks.\\n\\nAuthor summaryChikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes a debilitating infection with high fever, intense muscle and bone pain, rash, nausea, vomiting and headaches, and persistent and/or recurrent joint pains for months or years after contracting the virus. CHIKV is spread by two mosquito vectors, Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti, with increased presence around the globe. In this study, we report global spread of a CHIKV strain that carries two mutations that have been suggested to increase this virus ability to infect the Aedes aegypti mosquito, as well as to increase CHIKVs ability to be transmitted by this vector. We show that this strain appeared sometime between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India, and has now spread to Africa, Asia, and Australia. We show that this strain is capable of driving large outbreaks of CHIKV in the human population, causing recent major outbreaks in Kenya, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. Thus, our results stress the importance of monitoring this strains global spread, as well as the need of improved vector control strategies in the areas of Aedes aegypti prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Leprosy is a chronic infection where the skin and peripheral nervous system is invaded by Mycobacterium leprae. The infection mechanism remains unknown in part because culture methods have not been established yet for M.leprae.\\n\\nMce1A protein (442 aa) is coded by mce1A (1326 bp) of M.leprae. The mce1A homolog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is known to be associated with M.tuberculosis epithelial cell entry, and survival and multiplication within macrophages. Studies using recombinant proteins have indicated that mce1A of M.leprae is also associated with epithelial cell entry. This study is aimed at identifying particular sequences within mce1A associated with M.leprae epithelial cell entry.\\n\\nRecombinant proteins having N-terminus and C-terminus truncations of the mce1A region of M.leprae were created in Eschericia coli. Entry activity of latex beads, coated with these truncated proteins (r-lep37kDa and r-lep27kDa), into HeLa cells was observed by electron microscopy. The entry activity was preserved even when 315 bp (105 aa) and 922 bp (308 aa) was truncated from the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. This 316 - 921 bp region was divided into three sub-regions: 316 - 531 bp (InvX), 532 - 753 bp (InvY), and 754 - 921 bp (InvZ). Each sub-region was cloned into an AIDA vector and expressed on the surface of E.coli. Entry of these E.coli into monolayer-cultured HeLa and RPMI2650 cells was observed by electron microscopy. Only E.coli harboring the InvX sub-region exhibited cell entry. InvX was further divided into 4 domains, InvXa - InvXd, containing sequences 1 - 24 aa, 25 - 46 aa, 47 - 57 aa, and 58 - 72 aa, respectively.\\n\\nRecombinant E.coli, expressing each of InvXa - InvXd on the surface, were treated with antibodies against these domains, then added to monolayer cultured RPMI cells. The effectiveness of these antibodies in preventing cell entry was studied by colony counting. Entry activity was suppressed by antibodies against InvXa, InvXb, and InvXd. This suggests that these three InvX domains of mce1A are important for M.leprae invasion into nasal epithelial cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMce1A protein is encoded by the mce1A region of mce1 locus of M.tuberculosis and M.leprae, and is involved in the bacterias invasion into epithelial cells. The present study revealed that the active sequence of M.leprae involved in the invasion into nasal mucosa epithelial cells is present in the 316-531 bp region of mce1A.\\n\\nThe most important region of mce1A protein involved in the invasion of M.tuberculosis into human epithelial cells is called the InvIII region, which is located between amino acids at position 130 to 152. The InvIII region of M.tuberculosis corresponds to InvXb of M.leprae. The sequences of these regions are identical between amino acids at positions 10 to position 22 as counted from the N terminus, except that amino acids at positions 1 to 3, 5, 8, 9, 13 are different between M.leprae and M.tuberculosis. Suppression test results also indicated that the most important region of mce1A protein of M.leprae involved in the invasion into human epithelial cells is different from that M.tuberculosis. While M.tuberculosis has 3,959 protein-encoding genes and only 6 pseudogenes, M.leprae has only 1,604 protein-encoding genes but has 1,116 pseudogenes indicating that in M.leprae, far more proteins are inactivated as compared to M.tuberculosis. The present study also revealed that, as in M.tuberculosis, the mce1A protein is expressed on the surface of bacteria as a native protein. In light of these data, the mce1A protein is considered to be one of the most important proteins involved in the invasion of M.leprae into nasal mucosa epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Genetic signal detection in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is enhanced by pooling small signals from multiple Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), e.g. across genes and pathways. Because genes are believed to influence traits via gene expression, it is of interest to combine information from expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) in a gene or genes in the same pathway. Such methods, widely referred as transcriptomic wide association analysis (TWAS), already exist for gene analysis. Due to the possibility of eliminating most of the confounding effect of linkage disequilibrium (LD) from TWAS gene statistics, pathway TWAS methods would be very useful in uncovering the true molecular bases of psychiatric disorders. However, such methods are not yet available for arbitrarily large pathways/gene sets. This is possibly due to it quadratic (in the number of SNPs) computational burden for computing LD across large regions. To overcome this obstacle, we propose JEPEGMIX2-P, a novel TWAS pathway method that i) has a linear computational burden, ii) uses a large and diverse reference panel (33K subjects), iii) is competitive (adjusts for background enrichment in gene TWAS statistics) and iv) is applicable as-is to ethnically mixed cohorts. To underline its potential for increasing the power to uncover genetic signals over the state-of-the-art and commonly used non-transcriptomics methods, e.g. MAGMA, we applied JEPEGMIX2-P to summary statistics of most large meta-analyses from Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC). While our work is just the very first step toward clinical translation of psychiatric disorders, PGC anorexia results suggest a possible avenue for treatment.",

    "abstract": "Functional gene disruption is a central tenet of cancer research, where novel drug targets are often identified and validated through cell-growth based knockdown studies or screens. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated mRNA knockdown is widely used in both academic and pharmaceutical settings. However, off-target effects of shRNAs as well as interference with endogenous small RNA processing have been reported. We show here that lentiviral delivery of both gene-specific and non-targeting control shRNAs impair in vitro cell growth in a sequence independent manner. In addition, exogenous shRNAs induce a depressed cell-cycle-gene expression signature that is also shRNA-sequence independent and present across several studies. Further, we observe an shRNA mediated general repression of microRNAs belonging to polycistronic genetic clusters, including microRNAs from established oncogenic microRNA clusters. The collective impact of these observations is particularly relevant for cancer research, given the widespread historical use of shRNAs and the common goal of interrogating genes that regulate proliferation. We therefore recommend that when employing shRNA for target validation, care be taken to titrate shRNA dose, use hairpin-expressing controls, perform gene-of-interest rescue experiments and/or corroborate shRNA-derived results by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knockout. Minimizing these deleterious sequence independent effects will improve research fidelity and help address reported challenges in experimental reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Pattern formation is fundamental for embryonic development. Although synthetic biologists have created several patterns, a synthetic mammalian reaction-diffusion pattern has yet to be realized. TGF-{beta} family proteins Nodal and Lefty have been proposed to meet the conditions for reaction-diffusion patterning: Nodal is a short-range activator that enhances the expression of Nodal and Lefty whereas Lefty acts as a long-range inhibitor against Nodal. However, the pattern forming possibility of the Nodal-Lefty signaling has never been directly tested, and the underlying mechanisms of differential diffusivity of Nodal and Lefty remain unclear. Here, through a combination of synthetic biology and theoretical modeling, we show that a reconstituted minimal network of the Nodal-Lefty signaling spontaneously gives rise to a pattern in mammalian cell culture. Surprisingly, extracellular Nodal was confined underneath the cells as small clusters, resulting in a narrow distribution range compared with Lefty. We further found that the finger 1 domain of the Nodal protein is responsible for its short-range distribution. By transplanting the finger 1 domain of Nodal into Lefty, we converted the originally long-range distribution of Lefty to a short-range one, successfully preventing the pattern formation. These results indicate that the differences in the localization and domain structures between Nodal and Lefty, combined with the activator-inhibitor topology, are sufficient for reaction-diffusion pattern formation in mammalian cells.",

We examined how the formulation of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) impacts the labelling efficiency, magnetic characteristics and fate of the particles by comparing individual SPIONs with polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules containing SPIONs. At low labelling concentration, encapsulated SPIONs served as an efficient labelling agent for stem cells. The bio-distribution after intra-cardiac injection of labelled cells was monitored longitudinally by MRI and as an endpoint by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry.

Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ guide RNAs that recognize complementary RNA molecules to trigger the degradation of both the target transcript and its template DNA. These systems can broadly eliminate foreign targets with multiple mutations, but still effectively curb immunity against the host. The molecular basis for these unique features remains unknown. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the interaction between a type III-A ribonucleoprotein complex and various RNA substrates. We find that Cas10--the DNase effector of the complex--displays rapid conformational fluctuations on foreign RNA targets, but is locked in a static configuration on self RNA. Single-stranded DNA promotes Cas10s occupancy at a selected set of conformational states, which is also sensitively modulated by target mutations and predictive of CRISPR interference activity.

Two closely spaced hydrophobic domains are contained within the C-terminal region.

Describing cell lineages in most organisms is challenging, given the number of cells involved; even a fruit fly larva has ~50,000 cells and a small mammal has more than 1 billion cells. Recently, the idea of using CRISPR to induce mutations during development as heritable markers for lineage reconstruction has been proposed and trialled by several groups. While an attractive idea, its practical value depends on the accuracy of the cell lineages that can be generated by this method. Here, we use computer simulations to estimate the performance of this approach under different conditions. Our simulations incorporate empirical data on CRISPR-induced mutation frequencies in Drosophila. We show significant impacts from multiple biological and technical parameters - variable cell division rates, skewed mutational outcomes, target dropouts and different mutation sequencing strategies. Our approach reveals the limitations of recently published CRISPR recorders, and indicates how future implementations can be optimised to produce accurate cell lineages.",

Tap water, bottled water (bottled purified water, and bottled natural water) are now the three most popular drinking waters consumed by adolescents in China. However, the constituents of them differ, which may cause different long-term health effects. In order to determine which type of water is the most beneficial regarding developmental behaviors, lipid metabolism and antioxidant capacity of juvenile zebrafish, 21 dpf (days post-fertilization) zebrafish were given these three waters separately with the same feed until 90 dpf. Results showed that zebrafish in purified water had the lowest survival rate, body weight and body length, while zebrafish in natural water and tap water had similar developmental behaviors; the highest HDL-C level and the lowest TG level were found in natural water, tap water second; and zebrafish in natural water showed the best antioxidant capacity. Thus, the best outcomes were found in natural water, which had suitable pH and proper amount of minerals, tap water also showed good performance, while purified water seemed not suitable for juvenile zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon is stored within secretory granules of pancreatic alpha cells until a stimulus, such as a change in microenvironmental conditions, triggers its release. We hypothesized that the secretory response of the alpha cell to various stimuli could be determined by plasticity in the network of proteins that interact with glucagon within alpha cell secretory granules. To answer this question, we isolated secretory granules from alpha TC1-6 cells and identified glucagon-interacting proteins by affinity purification coupled with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Proteomic analyses revealed a network of cytoplasmic and histone proteins. Specifically, the interaction between glucagon and histone H4 and the ER stress protein GRP78 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation of secretory granule lysates, and co-localization within secretory granules using high-resolution confocal microscopy. The composition of these networks was altered at different glucose levels (25 mM vs 5.5 mM) and in response to the paracrine inhibitors of glucagon secretion, GABA and insulin. Finally, siRNA-mediated silencing of a subset of nonhistone proteins revealed novel proteins that may regulate glucagon secretion. We have therefore described a novel and dynamic glucagon interactome within alpha cell secretory granules, and suggest that plasticity in the interactome governs the alpha cell secretory response to paracrine and nutritional stimuli.",

We observed that knockout of Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) improved the performance of the screen due to ZAP-mediated inhibition of the vector. We identify a small panel of IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, including MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin/BST2 and TRIM5 which together explain the inhibitory effects of IFN on the HIV-1 LAI strain in THP-1 cells.

In this study, we describe a novel heterogeneous motility phenotype in Pseudomonas syringae, where under normally suppressive incubation conditions (30{degrees}C) punctate colonies arise that are spatially isolated from the point of inoculation, giving rise to a motility pattern we term constellation swimming (CS). We demonstrate that this phenotype is reproducible, reversible, and dependent on a functioning flagellum. Mirroring the heterogeneous motility phenotype, we demonstrate the existence of a sub-population of cells under non-permissive conditions that express flagellin (fliC) at levels similar to cells incubated under permissive conditions using both quantitative single cell microscopy and flow cytometry. To understand the genetics underlying the CS phenotype, we selected for naturally arising mutants that exhibited a normal swimming phenotype at the warmer incubation temperature. Sequencing these mutants recovered several independent non-synonymous mutations within FleN (also known as FlhG) as well as mutations within the promoter region of FleQ, the master flagellum regulator in Pseudomonas. We further show that nutrient depletion is the likely underlying cause of CS, as reduced nutrients will stimulate both fliC expression and a normal swimming phenotype at 30 {degrees}C.",

    "abstract": "To explore inhomogeneous and anisotropic systems such as lipid bilayers, the Lennard-Jones particle mesh Ewald (LJ-PME) method was applied without a traditional isotropic dispersion correction. As the popular AMBER and CHARMM lipid force fields were developed using a cutoff scheme, their lipid bilayers unacceptably shrank when using LJ-PME method. A new lipid force field (FUJI) was developed on the basis of the AMBER force field scheme including the Lipid14 van der Waals parameters. Point charges were calculated by the restrained electrostatic potentials of many lipid conformers. The torsion energy profiles were calculated by high level ab initio molecular orbitals (LCCSD(T)/Aug-cc-pVTZ//LMP2/Aug-cc-pVTZ); then, the molecular mechanical dihedral parameters were derived by means of a fast Fourier transform. Incorporating these parameters into a new lipid force field without any fittings to experimental data, desirable lipid characteristics such as the area per lipid and lateral diffusion coefficients were obtained by GROMACS molecular dynamics simulations using the LJ-PME method and hydrogen virtual sites. The stability and structures of large membranes with undulatory fluctuations were studied by a multidrug efflux transporter (AcrABZ-TolC) with inner and outer membranes.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/373183_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (92K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12cf574org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a6cdbforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10dbd16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8fd3a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Hospital-acquired bacterial infections lead to prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality. The problem is exacerbated by antibiotic resistant strains that delay or impede effective treatment. To ensure a successful therapy and to manage antibiotic resistance, treatment protocols that draw on several different antibiotics might be used. This includes the administration of drug cocktails to individual patients (\\\"combination therapy\\\") but also the random assignment of drugs to different patients (\\\"mixing\\\") and a regular switch in the default drug used in the hospital from drug A to drug B and back (\\\"cycling\\\"). For the past 20 years, mathematical models have been used to assess the prospects of antibiotic combination therapy, mixing, and cycling. But while tendencies in their ranking across studies have emerged, the picture remains surprisingly inconclusive and incomplete. In this article, we review existing modeling studies and demonstrate by means of examples how methodological factors complicate the emergence of a consistent picture. These factors include the choice of the criterion by which the effects of the protocols are compared, the model implementation, and its analysis. We thereafter discuss how progress can be made and suggest future modeling directions.",

    "abstract": "Control of protein expression results from the fine tuning of mRNA synthesis, decay and translation. These processes, which are controlled by a large number of RNA-binding proteins and by localization in RNP granules such as P-bodies, appear often intimately linked although the rules of this interplay are not well understood. In this study, we combined our recent P-body transcriptome with various transcriptomes obtained following silencing of broadly acting mRNA decay and repression factors. This analysis revealed the central role of GC content in mRNA fate, in terms of P-body localization, mRNA translation and mRNA decay. It also rationalized why PBs mRNAs have a strikingly low protein yield. We report too the existence of distinct mRNA decay pathways with preference for AU-rich or GC-rich transcripts. Compared to this impact of the GC content, sequence-specific RBPs and miRNAs appeared to have only modest additional effects on their bulk targets. Altogether, these results lead to an integrated view of post-transcriptional control in human cells where most regulation at the level of translation is dedicated to AU-rich mRNAs, which have a limiting protein yield, whereas regulation at the level of 5 decay applies to GC-rich mRNAs, whose translation is optimal.",

It depends on the precise spatial and temporal separations of the stimuli. For large spatiotemporal separation, the long-range apparent motion (lrAM), it remains unclear how the visual system computes unambiguous motion signals. Here we investigated whether intracortical interactions within retinotopic maps could shape a global motion representation at the level of V1 population in response to a lrAM. In fixating monkeys, voltage-sensitive dye imaging revealed the emergence of a spatio-temporal representation of the motion trajectory at the scale of V1 population activity, shaped by systematic backward suppressive waves. We show that these waves are the expected emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the horizontal intra-cortical network. Such non-linearities explain away ambiguous correspondence problems of the stimulus along the motion path, preformating V1 population response for an optimal read-out by downstream areas.",

The use of indirect social information may help mitigate these costs, yet in many cases little is known about the proximate sources of such information, and how dispersers and residents may differ in their information use. Land gastropods, which have a high cost of movement and obligatorily leave information potentially exploitable by conspecifics during movement (through mucus trails), are a good model to investigate links between dispersal costs and information use. We used Y-mazes to see whether dispersers and residents differed in their trail-following propensity, in the snail Cornu aspersum. Dispersers followed mucus trails more frequently than expected by chance, contrary to non-dispersers. Ignoring dispersal status during tests would lead to falsely conclude to no trail-following for the majority of ecologically realistic scenarios. Trail following by dispersers may reduce dispersal costs by reducing energy expenditure and helping snails find existing patches. Finally, we point that ignoring the potential for collective dispersal provided by trail-following abilities may lead to wrong inferences on the demographic and genetic consequences of dispersal.",

Crossing divergent species to form hybrids can break up coadapted variation, resulting in genetic incompatibilities within developmental networks shaping adaptive traits. We crossed two closely related sympatric Cyprinodon pupfish species - a dietary generalist and a specialized molluscivore - and measured expression levels in their F1 hybrids to identify regulatory variation underlying the novel craniofacial morphology found in this recent microendemic adaptive radiation. We extracted mRNA from eight day old whole-larvae tissue and from craniofacial tissues dissected from 17-20 day old larvae to compare gene expression between a total of seven F1 hybrids and 24 individuals from parental species populations. We found 3.9% of genes differentially expressed between generalists and molluscivores in whole-larvae tissues and 0.6% of genes differentially expressed in craniofacial tissue. We found that 2.1% of genes were misexpressed in whole-larvae hybrids at 8 dpf whereas 19.1% of genes were misexpressed in hybrid craniofacial tissue at 17-20 dpf, after correcting for sequencing biases. We also measured allele specific expression across 15,429 phased heterozygous sites to identify regulatory mechanisms underlying differential expression between generalists and molluscivores. Together, our results highlight the importance of considering misexpression as an early indicator of genetic incompatibilities in the context of rapidly diverged morphology and suggests that wide-spread compensatory regulatory divergence drives hybrid misexpression in developing tissues that give rise to novel craniofacial traits.",

The genetic foundations of this complex form are largely unknown. We report the draft genome of the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica and use multiple transcriptomes to determine gene use across life-cycle stages. Medusa, planula larva and polyp are each characterised by distinct transcriptome signatures reflecting abrupt life cycle transitions, and all deploy a mixture of phylogenetically old and new genes. Medusa specific transcription factors, including many with bilaterian orthologs, associate with diverse neurosensory structures. Compared to Clytia, the polyp-only hydrozoan Hydra has lost many of the medusa-expressed transcription factors, despite similar overall rates of gene content and sequence evolution. Absence of expression and gene loss among Clytia orthologs of genes patterning the anthozoan aboral pole, secondary axis and endomesoderm support simplification of planulae and polyps in Hydrozoa, including loss of bilateral symmetry. Consequently, although the polyp and planula are generally considered the ancestral cnidarian forms, in Clytia the medusa maximally deploys ancestral cnidarian-bilaterian transcription factor gene complexity.",

    "abstract": "Morphological phylogenies of mammals continue to show major conflicts with the robust molecular consensus view of their relationships. This raises doubts as to whether current morphological character sets are able to accurately resolve mammal relationships, particularly for fossil taxa for which, in most cases, molecular data is unlikely to ever become available. We tested this under a hypothetical \\\"best case scenario\\\" by using ancestral state reconstruction (under both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood) to infer the morphologies of fossil ancestors for all clades present in a recent comprehensive molecular phylogeny of mammals, and then seeing what effect inclusion of these predicted ancestors had on unconstrained analyses of morphological data. We found that this resulted in topologies that are highly congruent with the molecular consensus, even when simulating the effect of incomplete fossilisation. Most strikingly, several analyses recovered monophyly of clades that have never been found in previous morphology-only studies, such as Afrotheria and Laurasiatheria. Our results suggest that, at least in principle, improvements in the fossil record may be sufficient to largely reconcile morphological and molecular phylogenies of mammals, even with current morphological character sets.",

    "abstract": "Maternal effect senescence is the detrimental effect of increased maternal age on offspring performance. Despite much recent interest given to describing this phenomenon, its origins and distribution across the tree-of-life are poorly understood. We find that age affects neonatal survival in 83 of 90 studies across 51 species, but we observed a puzzling difference between groups of animal species. Amongst wild bird populations, the average effect of age was only -0.7% per standardized unit of increasing age, but maternal effects clearly senesced in laboratory invertebrates (-67.1%) and wild mammals (-57.8%). Comparisons amongst demographic predictions derived from evolutionary theory and conventional demographic models suggest that natural selection has shaped maternal effect senescence in the natural world. These results emphasize both the general importance of maternal age effects and the potential for evolutionary genetics to provide a valuable framework for understanding the diversity of this manifestation of ageing in animal species.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that planned and corrective actions are recalibrated during some forms of motor adaptation. However, corrective (a.k.a., reactive) movements in human locomotion are thought to simply reflect sudden environmental changes independently from sensorimotor recalibration. Thus, we asked if corrective responses can indicate the motor systems adapted state following prolonged exposure to a novel walking situation inducing sensorimotor adaptation. We recorded electromyographic signals bilaterally on 15 leg muscles before, during, and after split-belts walking (i.e., novel walking situation), in which the legs move at different speeds. We exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of corrective responses upon introduction or removal of an unexpected speed transition to isolate them from the overall motor output. We found that corrective muscle activity was structurally different following short vs. long exposures to split-belts walking. Only after a long exposure, removal of the novel environment elicited corrective muscle patterns that matched those expected in response to a perturbation opposite to the one originally experienced. This indicated that individuals who recalibrated their motor system adopted split-belts environment as their new \"normal\" and transitioning back to the original walking environment causes subjects to react as if it was novel to them. Interestingly, this learning declined with age, but steady state modulation of muscle activity during split-belts walking did not, suggesting potentially different neural mechanisms underlying these motor patterns. Taken together, our results show that corrective motor commands reflect the adapted state of the motor system, which is less flexible as we age.\n\nSignificance statementWe showed that corrective muscle activity elicited by sudden environmental transitions is revealing of the underlying recalibration process during sensorimotor adaptation. This allowed us to identify age-related decline in motor learning that was not discernible from kinematic measures conventionally used in motor adaptation studies. These findings suggest that older populations may have limited potential to correct their movements through error-based protocols simply given their age. Moreover, we describe the distinct motor patterns recruited during and after the split condition, informing our understanding of the therapeutic effect of this task. Therefore, our detailed EMG characterization provides valuable normative data of muscle activity that could be reinforced with repeated exposure of split-belts walking.",

    "abstract": "Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with electromyography (EMG) recordings can be used to map the brain regions in which TMS evokes motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in certain muscles. Navigated TMS (nTMS) is used increasingly to identify the functional motor area of different muscles for clinical applications, including neurosurgical planning. However, the accuracy of TMS-based mapping of functional motor areas may depend on the TMS-induced current direction due to anisotropic cortical morphology, complicating association of the functional motor maps with neuroanatomical structures. Furthermore, it is not clear how well nTMS can distinguish nearby muscle representations on the cortical surface. We therefore investigated the functional motor maps obtained with posterior-to-anterior (PA) and lateral-to-medial (LM) TMS-induced currents within a spatially defined area by stimulating targets in a grid of locations over the left primary motor cortex in 8 healthy participants. Results were compared to functional MRI (fMRI) activation maps obtained using a voluntary opposing thumb movement task. We found that TMS applied with PA-induced currents identifies a motor area that is located significantly more anterior (8.7 - 10.4 mm depending on the muscle) with respect to an MEP motor area identified using LM-induced currents for the same muscle. Motor maps obtained with LM-induced currents show more overlap with the motor map identified using fMRI compared to PA-induced currents. In conclusion, the spatial representation of the MEP motor map identified by TMS is dependent on the direction of the induced current. These findings suggest that the application of nTMS using an LM-induced current direction corresponds best with the hand motor area as measured with fMRI.",

However, analysis of brain images remains dependent on highly subjective manual processing. In the present study, we introduce AMaSiNe, a novel software for automated mapping of single neurons in the standard mouse brain atlas. The AMaSiNe automatically calibrates alignment angles of each brain slice to match the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA), locates labeled neurons from multiple brain samples in a common brain space, and achieves a standardized 3D-rendered brain. Due to the high fidelity and reliability of AMaSiNe, the retinotopic structures of neural projections to the primary visual cortex (VISp) were determined from single and dual injections of the rabies virus onto different visual areas. Our results demonstrate that distinct retinotopic organization of bottom-up and top-down projections could be precisely mapped using AMaSiNe.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWStrong trophic interactions link primary producers (phytoplankton) and consumers (zooplankton) in lakes. However, the influence of such interactions on the biogeographical distribution of the taxa and functional traits of planktonic organisms in lakes has never been explicitly tested. To better understand the spatial distribution of these two major aquatic groups, we related composition across boreal lakes (104 for zooplankton and 48 for phytoplankton) in relation to a common suite of environmental and spatial factors. We then directly tested the degree of coupling in their taxonomic and functional distributions across the subset of common lakes. Although phytoplankton composition responded mainly to properties related to water quality while zooplankton composition responded more strongly to lake morphometry, we found significant coupling between their spatial distributions at taxonomic and functional levels based on a Procrustes test. This coupling was not significant after removing the effect of environmental drivers (water quality and morphometry) on the spatial distributions of the two groups. This result suggests that top-down and bottom-up effects (e.g. nutrient concentration and predation) drove trophic interactions at the landscape level. We also found a significant effect of dispersal limitation on the distribution of taxa, which could explain why coupling was stronger for taxa than for traits at the scale of this study, with a turnover of species observed between regions, but no trait turnover. Our results indicate that landscape pelagic food web responses to anthropogenic changes in ecosystem parameters should be driven by a combination of top-down and bottom-factors for taxonomic composition, but with a relative resilience in functional trait composition of lake communities.",

Here we focus on an orbweaver spider genus Cyrtognatha (Tetragnathidae) from the Caribbean, with the aims to reconstruct its evolutionary history, describe its biogeographic history in the archipelago, and to estimate the timing and route of Caribbean colonization. Specifically, we test if Cyrtognatha biogeographic history is consistent with an ancient vicariant scenario (the GAARlandia landbridge hypothesis) or overwater dispersal. We reconstructed a species level phylogeny based on one mitochondrial (CO1) and one nuclear (28S) marker. We then used this topology to constrain a time-calibrated mtDNA phylogeny, for subsequent biogeographical analyses of over 100 originally sampled Cyrtognatha individuals. Our results suggest a monophyletic radiation of Caribbean Cyrtognatha, containing 11 to 14 species that are exclusively single island endemics. Our analyses refute vicariance and instead support an overwater colonization to the Caribbean in mid-Miocene. Having colonized Hispaniola first, Cyrtognatha subsequently dispersed to, and diversified on, the other islands of the Greater, and Lesser Antilles.",

Here, we show that the histone-fold domain protein NF-Y, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, controls the fidelity of transcription initiation at gene promoters. We report that NF-Y maintains the region upstream of TSSs in a nucleosome-depleted state while simultaneously protecting this accessible region against aberrant and/or ectopic transcription initiation. We find that loss of NF-Y binding in mammalian cells disrupts the promoter chromatin landscape, leading to nucleosomal encroachment over the canonical TSS. Importantly, this chromatin rearrangement is accompanied by upstream relocation of the transcription preinitiation complex and ectopic transcription initiation. Further, this phenomenon generates aberrant extended transcripts that undergo translation, disrupting gene expression profiles. These results establish NF-Y as a central player in TSS selection in metazoans and highlight the deleterious consequences of inaccurate transcription initiation.",

In a simple microreactor, we harness the well-known inhibition of radicals by oxygen to enable topographical photopolymerization. Strikingly, by sustaining an oxygen rich environment, we can also induce hydrogel photo-scission which turns out to be a powerful and generic subtractive manufacturing method. We finally introduce a flexible patterned functionalization protocol based on available photo-linkers. Using these common tools on the most popular hydrogels, we tailored soft templates where cells grow or self-organize into standardized structures.

    "abstract": "We recently introduced a new approach to the evaluation of weight of evidence (WoE) for Y-chromosome profiles. Rather than attempting to calculate match probabilities, which is particularly problematic for modern Y-profiles with high mutation rates, we proposed using simulation to describe the distribution of the number of males in the population with a matching Y-profile, both the unconditional distribution and conditional on a database frequency of the profile. Here we further validate the new approach by showing that our results are robust to assumptions about the allelic ladder and the founder haplotypes, and we extend the approach in two important directions. Firstly, forensic databases are not the only source of background data relevant to the evaluation of Y-profile evidence: in many cases the Y-profiles of one or more relatives of the accused are also available. To date it has been unclear how to use this additional information, but in our simulation-based approach its effect is readily incorporated. We describe this approach and illustrate how the WoE that a man was the source of an observed Y-profile changes when the Y-profiles of some of his male-line relatives are also available. Secondly, we extend our new approach to mixtures of Y-profiles from two or more males. Surprisingly, our simulation-based approach reveals that observing a 2-male mixture that includes an alleged contributors profile is almost as strong evidence as observing a matching single-contributor evidence sample, and even 3-male and 4-male mixtures are only slightly weaker.",

    "abstract": "AbstractObjectives: The most pronounced effect of high altitude (>2700m) on reproductive outcomes is reduced birth weight. Indigenous Bolivians (Andean Native Americans) residing for generations at high altitudes have higher birth weights relative to more recent migrants of primarily European ancestry. Previous research demonstrated that the placenta is a key contributor to the preservation of Andean birth weight at high altitude. Our current research investigated how gene expression and epigenetics contributes to the conservation of birth weight at high altitude by examining mRNA expression and DNA methylation differences between placentas of Andeans and those of European ancestry residing at high and low altitude.\\n\\nMethods: Genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation of villous placenta tissue was quantified utilizing microarray technology. Subjects were of Andean and European ancestry and resident at high (3600m) or low (400m) altitudes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with altitude or ancestry were identified (FDR<0.1, |fold change|>1.25). To predict which DEGs could be regulated by methylation we tested for correlation between gene expression and methylation values.\\n\\nResults: 69 DEGs associated with altitude (n=36) or ancestry (n=34) were identified. Altitude-associated DEGs included members of the AP-1 transcription factor family. Ancestry-associated DEGs were implicated in inflammatory pathways and associated with pro-angiogenic macrophages. More ancestry-associated DEGs correlated significantly (n=17) (FDR<0.1) with promoter or gene body methylation (p=0.0242) when compared to altitude associated DEGs (n=8).\\n\\nConclusions: Compared to altitude-associated DEGs, methylation regulates more ancestry-associated DEGs, potentially allowing for rapid modification in the expression of inflammatory genes to attract pro-angiogenic macrophages as a means of promoting placental capillary growth in Andeans, regardless of altitude.",

Our data reveals that TPL-2 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and demonstrates that the nucleus is the primary site for TPL-2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. BCL-3 promotes TPL-2 degradation through interaction in the nucleus. As a consequence, Bcl3-/- macrophages have increased TPL-2 stability and MAPK activity following TLR stimulation. The enhanced stability of TPL-2 in Bcl3-/- macrophages lowers the MAPK activation threshold and the level of TLR ligand required to initiate an inflammatory response. This study establishes the nucleus as a key regulatory site for TLR-induced MAPK activity and identifies BCL-3 as a regulator of the cellular decision to initiate inflammation",

    "abstract": "Trophic interactions in the microbial food web of soils are crucial for nutrient and carbon cycling. Traditionally, protozoa are considered the major micropredators of bacteria in soil. However, some prokaryotes, such as Myxobacteria and Bdellovibrio are also famous for bacterivorous life style. Until recently, it was impossible to assess the abundance of pro- and eukaryotic micropredators in soils simultaneously. Using a metatranscriptomic three-domain profiling of small subunit ribosomal RNA we investigated the abundance of bacterivores in 28 datasets from eleven European mineral and organic soils of different climatic zones. In all soils, Myxobacteria comprised a significant proportion from 4 - 19% of prokaryotic 16S rRNA transcripts and more than 60% of all bacterivores in most soils. Haliangiaceae and Polyangiaceae were most abundant, while the name-giving Myxococcaceae were barely present. Other bacterial predators like Bdellovibrio were low abundant. Also Protozoan micropredator 18S rRNA transcripts, e.g. from Cercozoa, Amoebozoa and Ciliophora, were on average less abundant, especially in mineral soils. Nematodes were even less abundant. In addition, we applied a longitudinal approach to identify bacterivores during beech litter colonisation. Here, Myxobacteria showed prey-dependent, protozoa-like community dynamics during colonisation. Thus, their broad prey range and high abundance suggests a major influence of Myxobacteria on structuring the prokaryotic community composition in soil, and might warrant their classification as keystone taxon. Our results suggest the presence of an ecologically important \\\"bacterial loop\\\" in soil food webs, independent of protozoa and nematodes.",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can self-renew indefinitely while maintaining the ability to generate all cell types of the body. This plasticity is proposed to require heterogeneity in gene expression, driving a metastable state which may allow flexible cell fate choices. Contrary to this, naive PSC grown in fully defined  2i environmental conditions, containing small molecule inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 kinases, show homogenous pluripotency and lineage marker expression. However, here we show that 2i induces greater genome-wide heterogeneity than traditional serum-containing growth environments at the population level across both male and female PSCs. This heterogeneity is dynamic and reversible over time, consistent with a dynamic metastable equilibrium of the pluripotent state. We further show that the 2i environment causes increased heterogeneity in the calcium signalling pathway at both the population and single-cell level. Mechanistically, we identify loss of robustness regulators in the form of negative feedback to the upstream EGF receptor. Our findings advance the current understanding of the plastic nature of the pluripotent state and highlight the role of signalling pathways in the control of transcriptional heterogeneity. Furthermore, our results have critical implications for the current use of kinase inhibitors in the clinic, where inducing heterogeneity may increase the risk of cancer metastasis and drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Affective touch supports affiliative bonds and social cognition. However, it remains unknown whether pre-existing models of social relating influence the perception of affective touch. Here, we present the first study (N=44) to examine how individual differences in attachment styles relate to the perception of affective touch, as well as to a different non-social modality of interoception, namely cardiac perceived accuracy. Using the gold standard assessment of adult attachment (Adult Attachment Interview), we found that insecure attachment was associated with reduced pleasantness discrimination between affective vs. non-affective, neutral touch. Acknowledging the different traditions in measuring attachment, we also used a well-validated self-report questionnaire that pertains to explicit representations of current close relationships. Using this measure, we found that higher scores on an attachment anxiety dimension (but not an attachment avoidance) were associated with reduced pleasantness discrimination between affective vs. non-affective, neutral touch. Attachment patterns (in both measures) were not related to cardiac perception accuracy. These results corroborate and extend previous literature on the affectivity of touch and its relation with affiliative bonds and social cognition. Given that attachment was not related to perceived cardiac accuracy, these findings point to the specificity of the relationship between affective touch and attachment.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of interictal spikes in EEG may provide insight on epilepsy disease burden, but manual quantification of spikes is time-consuming and subject to bias. We present a probability-based, automated method for the classification and quantification of interictal events, using EEG data from kainate- and saline-injected mice (C57BL/6J background) several weeks post-treatment. We first detected high-amplitude events, then projected event waveforms into Principal Components space and identified clusters of spike morphologies using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We calculated the odds-ratio of events from kainate-versus saline-treated mice within each cluster, converted these values to probability scores, P(kainate), and calculated an Hourly Epilepsy Index for each animal by summing the probabilities for events where the cluster P(kainate) > 0.5 and dividing the resultant sum by the record duration. This Index is predictive of whether an animal received an epileptogenic treatment (i.e., kainate), even if a seizure was never observed. We applied this method to an out-of-sample dataset to assess epileptiform spike morphologies in five kainate mice monitored for ~1 month. The magnitude of the Index increased over time in a subset of animals and revealed changes in the prevalence of epileptiform (P(kainate) > 0.5) spike morphologies. Importantly, in both data sets, animals that had electrographic seizures also had a high Index. This analysis is fast, unbiased, and provides information regarding the salience of spike morphologies for disease progression. Future refinement will allow a better understanding of the definition of interictal spikes in quantitative and unambiguous terms.",

    "abstract": "Gastropods often show signs of unsuccessful attacks by predators in the form of healed scars in their shells. As such, fossil gastropods can be taken as providing a record of predation through ge-ological time. However, interpreting the number of such scars has proved to be problematic - would a low number of scars mean a low rate of attack, or a high rate of success, for example? Here we develop a model of scar formation, and formally show that in general these two variables cannot be disambiguated without further information about population structure. Nevertheless, by making the probably reasonable assumptions that the non-predatory death rate is both constant and low, we show that it is possible to use relatively small assemblages of gastropods to produce accurate estimates of both attack and success rates, if the overall death rate can be estimated. We show in addition what sort of information would be required to solve this problem in more general cases. However, it is unlikely that it will be possible to extract the relevant information easily from the fossil record: a variety of important collection and taphonomic biases are likely to intervene to obscure the data that gastropod assemblages may yield.",

    "abstract": "Class I ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) consists of a catalytic subunit (NrdA) and a radical-generating subunit (NrdB) that together catalyse reduction of the four ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides. Facklamia ignava NrdB is an unprecedented fusion protein with N-terminal add-ons of a glutaredoxin (Grx) domain followed by an ATP-cone. Grx, which in general is encoded elsewhere in the genome than is the RNR operon, is a known physiological reductant of RNRs. Here we show that the fused Grx domain functions as an efficient reductant of the F. ignava class I RNR via the common dithiol mechanism and interestingly also via a monothiol mechanism, although less efficiently. A Grx that utilizes either or of these two reaction mechanisms has to our knowledge not been observed with a native substrate before. The ATP-cone, which is commonly found as an N-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit of RNRs, is an allosteric on/off switch that promotes dNDP reduction in presence of ATP and inhibits the enzyme activity in presence of dATP. Here we show that dATP bound to the ATP-cone of F. ignava NrdB promotes formation of tetramers that are unable to form enzymatically competent complexes with F. ignava NrdA. The ATP-cone binds two molecules of dATP, but only one molecule of the activating nucleotide ATP. F. ignava NrdB contains the recently identified radical factor Mn2III/IV. We show that NrdA from the firmicute F. ignava can form a catalytically competent RNR with the Mn2III/IV-containing NrdB from the flavobacterium Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis.",

    "abstract": "The short half-life and use of recombinant bone morphogentic protein (BMP)-2 in large doses poses major limitations in the clinic. Events regulating post-translational processing and degradation of BMP2 in situ, linked to its secretion, have not been understood. Towards identifying mechanisms regulating intracellular BMP2 stability, we first discovered that inhibiting proteasomal degradation enhances both intracellular BMP2 level and its extracellular secretion. Next, we identified BMP2 degradation occurs through an ubiquitin-mediated mechanism. Since ubiquitination precedes proteasomal turnover and mainly occurs on lysine residues of nascent proteins, we systematically mutated individual lysine residues within BMP2 and tested them for enhanced stability. Results revealed that substitutions on four lysine residues within the pro-BMP2 region and three in the mature region increased both BMP2 turnover and extracellular secretion. Structural modeling revealed key lysine residues involved in proteasomal degradation occupy a lysine cluster near proprotein convertase cleavage site. Interestingly, mutations within these residues did not affect biological activity of BMP2. These data suggest preventing intracellular proteasomal loss of BMP2 through genetic modifications can overcome limitations related to its short half-life.",

Here we use single cell live imaging of an endogenous HES5 reporter and absolute protein quantification to gain a dynamic view of neurogenesis in the embryonic mammalian spinal cord. We report that dividing neural progenitors show both aperiodic and periodic HES5 protein fluctuations. Mathematical modelling suggests that in progenitor cells the HES5 oscillator operates close to its bifurcation boundary where stochastic conversions between dynamics are possible. HES5 expression becomes more frequently periodic as cells transition to differentiation which, coupled with an overall decline in HES5 expression, creates a transient period of oscillations with higher fold expression change. This increases the decoding capacity of HES5 oscillations and correlates with interneuron versus motor neuron cell fate. Thus, HES5 undergoes complex changes in gene expression dynamics as cells differentiate.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with stroke. However, the specific stroke subtypes affected, and whether loci influence both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, remains unknown. For loci associated with stroke, we aimed to infer the combination of stroke subtypes likely to be affected, and in doing so assess the extent to which such loci have homogeneous effects across stroke subtypes.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed Bayesian multinomial regression in 16,664 stroke cases and 32,792 controls of European ancestry to determine the most likely combination of stroke subtypes affected for loci with published genome-wide stroke associations, using model selection. Cases were subtyped under two commonly used stroke classification systems, Trial of Org 10172 Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) and Causative Classification of Stroke (CCS). All individuals had genotypes imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium 1.1 Panel.\\n\\nResultsSixteen loci were considered for analysis. Seven loci influenced both haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke, three of which influenced ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes under both TOAST and CCS. Under CCS, 4 loci influenced both small vessel stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage. An EDNRA locus demonstrated opposing effects on ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. No loci were predicted to influence all stroke subtypes in the same direction and only one locus (12q24) was predicted to influence all ischaemic stroke subtypes.\\n\\nConclusionsHeterogeneity in the influence of stroke-associated loci on stroke subtypes is pervasive, reflecting differing causal pathways. However, overlap exists between haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke, which may reflect shared pathobiology predisposing to small vessel arteriopathy. Stroke is a complex, heterogeneous disorder requiring tailored analytic strategies to decipher genetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Viral genomes exhibit a higher gene density and more diversified transcriptome than the host cell. Coding potential is maximized through the use of multiple reading frames, placement of genes on opposing strands, inefficient or modified use of termination signals, and the deployment of complex alternative splicing patterns. As a consequence, detailed characterization of viral transcriptomes by conventional methods can be challenging. Full length native RNA sequencing (nRNA-seq) using nanopore arrays offers an exciting alternative. Individual transcripts are sequenced directly, without the biases inherent to the recoding or amplification steps included in other sequencing methodologies. nRNA-seq simplifies the detection of variation brought about by RNA splicing, use of alternative transcription initiation and termination sites, and other RNA modifications. Here we use nRNA-seq to profile the herpes simplex virus type 1 transcriptome during early and late stages of productive infection of primary cells. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and identify a novel class of intergenic transcripts, including an mRNA that accumulates late in infection that codes for a novel fusion of the viral E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 and viral membrane glycoprotein L.",

Research on perceptual decision making has revealed a late event-related EEG potential (the Centro-Parietal Positivity, CPP) to be a correlate of the accumulation of sensory evidence. We tested to what extent this evidence accumulation signal is driven by externally presented (physical) versus internally experienced (subjective) sensory evidence. The results show that the known relationship between external evidence and the evidence accumulation signal (reflected in the CPP amplitude) is mediated by the level of subjective awareness. Additionally, the CPP closely tracks the subjective perceptual evidence during both correct and incorrect trials. Hence, a remarkably close relationship exists between the evidence accumulation process (i.e. CPP) and subjective perceptual experience, suggesting that neural decision processes and components of conscious experience are tightly linked.",

    "abstract": "Flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may contribute to spine morphogenesis, as mutations affecting both cilia motility and CSF flow lead to scoliosis1. However, the mechanisms underlying detection of the CSF flow in the central canal of the spinal cord remain elusive. Here we used full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) and bead tracking to demonstrate that CSF flows bidirectionally along the antero-posterior axis in the central canal of zebrafish embryos. In the zebrafish mutant cfap298tm304, previously known as kurly, reduction of cilia motility slows transport down the length of central canal. To investigate downstream mechanisms that could transduce CSF flow, we performed calcium imaging in sensory neurons contacting the CSF (CSF-cNs) and found that disruption in cilia motility impaired the activity of CSF-cNs. CSF-cNs across species express the transient receptor potential channel PKD2L1, also known as TRPP3, which contributes to CSF-cN chemosensory properties. Using calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we found that the loss of the Pkd2l1 channel in pkd2l1 mutant embryos also abolished CSF-cN activity. Whole-cell recordings further demonstrated that opening of a single channel is sufficient to trigger action potentials in wild type CSF-cNs. Recording from isolated cells in vitro, we showed that CSF-cNs are mechanosensory cells that respond to pressure in a Pkd2l1-dependent manner. Interestingly, adult pkd2l1 mutant zebrafish develop an exaggerated spine curvature, reminiscent of kyphosis in humans. Our study indicates that CSF-cNs are mechanosensory cells whose spontaneous activity reflects CSF flow in vivo. Furthermore, Pkd2l1 in CSF-cNs contributes to the maintenance of the natural curvature of the spine.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian epithelial cells use a pair of mother centrioles (MCs) and numerous deuterosomes as platforms for efficient basal body assembly during multiciliogenesis. How deuterosomes form and function, however, remain controversial. They are proposed to either arise spontaneously followed by maturation into larger ones with increased procentriole-producing capacity or be assembled solely on the young MC, nucleate procentrioles under the MCs guidance, and released as procentriole-occupied \\\"halos\\\". Here we show that both MCs are dispensable for deuterosome formation in multiciliate cells. In both mouse tracheal epithelial and ependymal cells (mTECs and mEPCs), discrete deuterosomes in the cytoplasm were initially procentriole-free and then grew into halos. More importantly, eliminating the young MC or both MCs in proliferating precursor cells through shRNA-mediated depletion of Plk4, a kinase essential to procentriole assembly, did not abolish deuterosome formation when these cells were induced to differentiate into mEPCs. The average deuterosome numbers per cell only reduced by 21% as compared to control mEPCs. Therefore, MC is not essential to the assembly of both deuterosomes and deuterosome-mediated procentrioles.",

    "abstract": "For over a thousand years throughout Asia, the common goldfish (Carassius auratus) was raised for both food and as an ornamental pet. Selective breeding over more than 500 years has created a wide array of body and pigmentation variation particularly valued by ornamental fish enthusiasts. As a very close relative of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), goldfish shares the recent genome duplication that occurred approximately 14-16 million years ago (mya) in their common ancestor. The combination of centuries of breeding and a wide array of interesting body morphologies is an exciting opportunity to link genotype to phenotype as well as understanding the dynamics of genome evolution and speciation. Here we generated a high-quality draft sequence of a \\\"Wakin\\\" goldfish using 71X PacBio long-reads. We identified 70,324 coding genes and more than 11,000 non-coding transcripts. We found that the two sub-genomes in goldfish retained extensive synteny and collinearity between goldfish and zebrafish. However, \\\"ohnologous\\\" genes were lost quickly after the carp whole-genome duplication, and the expression of 30% of the retained duplicated gene diverged significantly across seven tissues sampled. Loss of sequence identity and/or exons determined the divergence of the expression across all tissues, while loss of conserved, non-coding elements determined expression variance between different tissues. This draft assembly also provides an important resource for comparative genomics with the very commonly used zebrafish model (Danio rerio), and for understanding the underlying genetic causes of goldfish variants.",

    "abstract": "The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) provides critical models for studying regeneration, evolution and development. However, its large genome (~32 gigabases) presents a formidable barrier to genetic analyses. Recent efforts have yielded genome assemblies consisting of thousands of unordered scaffolds that resolve gene structures, but do not yet permit large scale analyses of genome structure and function. We adapted an established mapping approach to leverage dense SNP typing information and for the first time assemble the axolotl genome into 14 chromosomes. Moreover, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to verify the structure of these 14 scaffolds and assign each to its corresponding physical chromosome. This new assembly covers 27.3 gigabases and encompasses 94% of annotated gene models on chromosomal scaffolds. We show the assemblys utility by resolving genome-wide orthologies between the axolotl and other vertebrates, identifying the footprints of historical introgression events that occurred during the development of axolotl genetic stocks, and precisely mapping several phenotypes including a large deletion underlying the cardiac mutant. This chromosome-scale assembly will greatly facilitate studies of the axolotl in biological research.",

Here, we evaluate the impact of four common PD-associated Parkin point mutations (T240M, R275W, R334C, G430D) on glutamatergic synaptic function in hippocampal neurons. We find that expression of these point mutants in Parkin-deficient and -null backgrounds alters NMDA and AMPA receptor-mediated currents and cell-surface levels, and prevents the induction of long-term depression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Parkin regulates NMDA receptor trafficking through its ubiquitination of GluN1, and that all four mutants are impaired in this ubiquitinating activity. Furthermore, Parkin regulates synaptic AMPA receptor trafficking via its binding and retention of postsynaptic scaffold Homer1, and all mutants are similarly impaired in this capacity. Our findings demonstrate that pathogenic Parkin mutations disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity by impeding NMDA and AMPA receptor trafficking, and through these effects likely contribute to the pathophysiology of PD in PARK2 patients.",

This is especially true for microorganisms with known genome sequences from which nearly complete sets of enzymes and metabolic pathways are determined, or can be inferred. Yeasts are highly diverse eukaryotes whose metabolic traits have long been exploited in industry, and although many of their genome sequences are available, few genome-scale metabolic models have so far been produced. For the first time, we reconstructed the genome-scale metabolic model of the hybrid yeast Zygosaccharomyces parabailii, which is a member of the Z. bailii sensu lato clade notorious for stress-tolerance and therefore relevant to industry. The model comprises 3096 reactions, 2091 metabolites, and 2413 genes. Our own laboratory data were then used to establish a biomass synthesis reaction, and constrain the extracellular environment. Through constraint-based modeling, our model reproduces the co-consumption and catabolism of acetate and glucose posing it as a promising platform for understanding and exploiting the metabolic potential of Z. parabailii.",

It is known that fluorophore brightness increases substantially under cryogenic conditions and that cryo-fixation is far superior in preserving ultrastructure. However, cryogenic conditions have not been exploited to improve resolution or sample quality because liquid immersion media freezes at the objective, losing its optical properties. Here, simply by replacing the immersion fluid with a low-cost super-hemispherical solid immersion lens (superSIL), we effortlessly achieve <8 nm localisation precision and 12 nm resolution under cryogenic conditions in a low-cost, low-tech system. This is to our knowledge the best resolution yet attained in biological samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate multicolour imaging and show that the inexpensive setup outperforms 10-fold more costly super-resolution microscopes. By also removing the barrier to total internal reflection fluorescence imaging of mammalian cells under cryogenic conditions, superSIL microscopy delivers a straightforward route to achieve unmatched nanoscale resolution on both bacterial and mammalian cell samples, which any laboratory can effortlessly and inexpensively implement.",

    "abstract": "Under hypoxia, most of glucose is converted to secretory lactate, which leads to the lack of carbon source from glucose and thus the overuse of glutamine-carbon. However, under such a condition how glutamine nitrogen is disposed to avoid releasing potentially toxic ammonia remains to be determined. Here we identify a metabolic flux of glutamine to secretory dihydroorotate under hypoxia. We found that glutamine nitrogen is indispensable to nucleotide biosynthesis, but enriched in dihyroorotate and orotate rather than processing to its downstream uridine monophosphate under hypoxia. Dihyroorotate, not orotate, is then secreted out of cells. The specific metabolic pathway occurs in vivo and is required for tumor growth. Such a metabolic pathway renders glutamine mainly to acetyl coenzyme A for lipogenesis, with the rest carbon and nitrogen being safely removed. Our results reveal how glutamine carbon and nitrogen are coordinatively metabolized under hypoxia, and provide a comprehensive understanding on glutamine metabolism.\\n\\nSignificanceTumor cells often addict to glutamine, and particularly utilize its carbon for lipogenesis under hypoxia. We reveal that tumor cells package the excessive glutamine-nitrogen into secretory dihydroorotate, instead of toxic ammonia. This specifically reprogrammed pathway supports in vivo tumor growth, and could offer diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for cancers.",

    "abstract": "Until the late 20th Century, it was believed that different sensory modalities were processed by largely independent pathways in the primate cortex, with cross-modal integration only occurring in specialized polysensory areas. This model was challenged by the finding that the peripheral representation of the primary visual cortex (V1) receives monosynaptic connections from areas of the auditory cortex in the macaque. However, auditory projections to V1 have not been reported in other primates. We investigated the existence of direct interconnections between V1 and auditory areas in the marmoset, a New World monkey. Labelled neurons in auditory cortex were observed following 4 out of 10 retrograde tracer injections involving V1. These projections to V1 originated in the caudal subdivisions of auditory cortex (primary auditory cortex, caudal belt and parabelt areas), and targeted parts of V1 that represent parafoveal and peripheral vision. Injections near the representation of the vertical meridian of the visual field labelled few or no cells in auditory cortex. We also placed 8 retrograde tracer injections involving core, belt and parabelt auditory areas, none of which revealed direct projections from V1. These results confirm the existence of a direct, nonreciprocal projection from auditory areas to V1 in a different primate species, which has evolved separately from the macaque for over 30 million years. The essential similarity of these observations between marmoset and macaque indicate that early-stage audiovisual integration is a shared characteristic of primate sensory processing.",

PI(4,5)P2 is produced by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) and byphosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases (PIP4Ks). Here we show that deletion of the three genes that encode PIP4Ks (PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B and PIP4K2C) in vitro results in a paradoxical increase in PI(4,5)P2 and a subsequent increase in insulin-stimulated production of PI(3,4,5)P3. Surprisingly, reintroduction of either wild-type or kinase-dead forms of the PIP4Ks restored cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels and insulin stimulation of the PI3K pathway. These effects are explained by an increase in PIP5K activity upon deletion of PIP4Ks, which we demonstrate can suppress PIP5K activity in vitro through a direct binding interaction. Collectively, our work reveals an important non-catalytic function of PIP4Ks in suppressing PIP5K-mediated PI(4,5)P2 synthesis and insulin-dependent conversion to PI(3,4,5)P3 by PI3K enzymes and suggests that pharmacological depletion of PIP4K enzymes using emerging degrader technologies could represent a novel strategy for stimulating insulin signaling.",

To explore their functional relationship, we looked for mRNAs that are differentially spliced following the depletion of CELF1, ELAVL1, or both. We found that these proteins control the usage of their target exons in the same direction. Double depletion has a greater effect than individual depletions, showing that CELF1 and ELAVL1 exert additive control. To confirm these results, we carried out RT-PCR on the alternative cassette exons of several mRNAs, including CD44, WNK1, PHACTR2, MICAL3, SPTBN1, and PPP3CB. Using FRET, we found that CELF1 and ELAVL1 directly interact in cell nuclei. We demonstrated that the combined levels of CELF1 and ELAVL1 are a valuable biomarker in several cancers, even when their individual levels may yield very limited information. CD44 alternative splicing probably accounts in part for the effects of CELF1 and ELAVL1 levels on patient survival. These data point to strong functional interactions between CELF1 and ELAVL1 in the control of mRNA isoform production, resulting in significant impacts on human pathology.",

Identifying the mechanism of aberrant metabolism is of great potential to provide novel targets for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we demonstrated that glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2) restricted tumor growth in HBV-related HCC via a negative feedback loop with p53. Expression of GYS2 was significantly downregulated in HCC and correlated with decreased glycogen content and unfavorable patient outcomes. GYS2 overexpression suppressed, whereas GYS2 knockdown facilitated cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo via modulating p53 expression. GYS2 competitively bound to MDM2 to prevent p53 from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, GYS2 enhanced the p300-induced acetylation of p53 at K373/382, which in turn inhibited the transcription of GYS2 in the support of HBx/HDAC1 complex.

We present numerical results that predict how membrane properties, protein density, and local tension compete to create a phase space that governs the morphology of a nanotube. We also find that there is an energy barrier that prevents two beads from fusing.

However, our understanding of the signals that lead to cell-type specific repulsion, and the precise capacity of heterotypic CIL responses to drive emergent behaviors is lacking. Using a new in vitro model of heterotypic CIL between epithelial and mesenchymal cells, we show that fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080), but not fibroblasts (NIH3T3), are actively repelled by epithelial cells in culture. We show that knocking down EphB2 in fibrosarcoma cells specifically leads to disruption of the repulsion phase of CIL in response to interactions with epithelial cells. Furthermore, this heterotypic interaction requires ERK activation, downstream of EphB2 signaling. We also examine the population-wide effects when these various cell combinations, and their specific heterotypic CIL responses, are allowed to interact in culture. Mixtures of fibrosarcoma and epithelial cells - unlike fibroblasts and epithelial cells - lead to complete sorting and segregation of the two populations, and inhibiting their distinct CIL response by knocking down EphB2 or ERK in fibrosarcoma cells disrupts this emergent sorting behavior. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental behaviors such as cell sorting is lacking as predominant sorting hypotheses, such as differential adhesion, have recently been found inadequate in predicting the sorting of mesenchymal cells [3, 4]. These data suggest that heterotypic CIL responses, in conjunction with processes such as differential adhesion, may aid the sorting of cell populations during embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Small circular DNAs of 1.8 and 2.4kb were initially discovered in highly infectious CJD and scrapie particles from mammalian brain and cultured cells. Surprisingly, these protected cytoplasmic \\\"SPHINX\\\" DNAs contained replication (REP) initiation sequences resembling those of Acinetobacter phage viruses. An antibody was generated against a REP peptide encoded by the SPHINX 1.8 ORF that was not present in mammals. It bound to a 41kd \\\"spx1\\\" protein on Western blots. Cytologically, spx1 concentrated in spinal cord synapses and pancreatic islet, but not exocrine cells. We hypothesized that circular SPHINX DNAs are ancient symbiotic elements that can participate in functional differentiation and neurodegeneration. Cell and tissue specific patterns of spx1 expression shown below implicate somatic cell-to-cell communication and differentiation functions that would favor conservation of SPHINX 1.8 in evolution. Remarkably, primary human oocytes and spermatogonia, but not mature sperm, displayed intense cytoplasmic spx1 signals that underscore the maternal inheritance of SPHINX 1.8. These findings should encourage investigations of unexplored networks of incorporated environmental infectious agents that can be key actors in progressive neurodegeneration, immunity and cancer.",
