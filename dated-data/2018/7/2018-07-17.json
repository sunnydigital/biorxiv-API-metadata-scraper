    "abstract": "Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is one of the most common types of RNA editing, a posttranscriptional modification made by special enzymes. We present a proteomic study on this phenomenon for Drosophila melanogaster. Three proteome data sets were used in the study: two taken from public repository and the third one obtained here. A customized protein sequence database was generated using results of genome-wide adenosine-to-inosine RNA studies and applied for identifying the edited proteins. The total number of 68 edited peptides belonging to 59 proteins was identified in all data sets. Eight of them being shared between the whole insect, head and brain proteomes. Seven edited sites belonging to synaptic vesicle and membrane trafficking proteins were selected for validation by orthogonal analysis by Multiple Reaction Monitoring. Five editing events in cpx, Syx1A, Cadps, CG4587 and EndoA were validated in fruit fly brain tissue at the proteome level using isotopically labeled standards. Ratios of unedited-to-edited proteoforms varied from 35:1 (Syx1A) to 1:2 (EndoA). Lys-137 to Glu editing of endophilin A may have functional consequences for its interaction to membrane. The work demonstrates the feasibility to identify the RNA editing event at the proteome level using shotgun proteomics and customized edited protein database.",

    "abstract": "Whole cell responses involve multiple subcellular processes (SCPs). To understand how balance between SCPs controls the dynamics of whole cell responses we studied neurite outgrowth in rat primary cortical neurons in culture. We used a combination of dynamical models and experiments to understand the conditions that permitted growth at a specified velocity and when aberrant growth could lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We hypothesized that dystrophic bulb formation is due to quantitative imbalances between SCPs. Simulations predict redundancies between lower level sibling SCPs within each type of high level SCP. In contrast, higher level SCPs, such as vesicle transport and exocytosis or microtubule growth characteristic of each type need to be strictly coordinated with each other and imbalances result in stalling of neurite outgrowth. From these simulations, we predicted the effect of changing the activities of SCPs involved in vesicle exocytosis or microtubule growth could lead to formation of dystrophic bulbs. siRNA ablation experiments verified these predictions. We conclude that whole cell dynamics requires balance between the higher-level SCPs involved and imbalances can terminate whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth.",

Statistical analysis of cancer data from different tissues of origin highlights differences and similarities which can guide drug repositioning as well as the design of targeted and precise treatments. Here, we developed an improved Bayesian network model for tumour mutational profiles and applied it to 8,198 patient samples across 22 cancer types from TCGA. For each cancer type, we identified the interactions between mutated genes, capturing signatures beyond mere mutational frequencies. When comparing mutation networks, we found genes which interact both within and across cancer types. To detach cancer classification from the tissue type we performed de novo clustering of the pancancer mutational profiles based on the Bayesian network models. We found 22 novel clusters which significantly improved survival prediction beyond clinical and histopathological information. The models highlight key gene interactions for each cluster that can be used for genomic stratification in clinical trials and for identifying drug targets within strata.",

    "abstract": "Experiments show that evolutionary fitness landscapes can have a rich combinatorial structure due to epistasis. For some landscapes, this structure can produce a computational constraint that prevents evolution from finding local fitness optima - thus overturning the traditional assumption that local fitness peaks can always be reached quickly if no other evolutionary forces challenge natural selection. Here, I introduce a distinction between easy landscapes of traditional theory where local fitness peaks can be found in a moderate number of steps and hard landscapes where finding local optima requires an infeasible amount of time. Hard examples exist even among landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis; on these semi-smooth fitness landscapes, strong selection weak mutation dynamics cannot find the unique peak in polynomial time. More generally, on hard rugged fitness landscapes that include reciprocal sign epistasis, no evolutionary dynamics - even ones that do not follow adaptive paths - can find a local fitness optimum quickly. Moreover, on hard landscapes, the fitness advantage of nearby mutants cannot drop off exponentially fast but has to follow a power-law that long term evolution experiments have associated with unbounded growth in fitness. Thus, the constraint of computational complexity enables open-ended evolution on finite landscapes. Knowing this constraint allows us to use the tools of theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization to characterize the fitness landscapes that we expect to see in nature. I present candidates for hard landscapes at scales from single genes, to microbes, to complex organisms with costly learning (Baldwin effect) or maintained cooperation (Hankshaw effect). Just how ubiquitous hard landscapes (and the corresponding ultimate constraint on evolution) are in nature becomes an open empirical question.",

    "abstract": "The interrelationship between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in mechanoregulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesions, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin-IIA filaments. Myosin-IIA filaments, augmenting the focal adhesions and disrupting the podosomes, are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-dependent regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin-IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF, GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capturing by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the myosin-IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

We show that this quantitative framework allows for the understanding and prediction of ROS stress responses at three levels: 1) pathways: amino acid auxotrophies, 2) networks: the systemic response to ROS stress, and 3) genetic basis: adaptation to ROS stress during laboratory evolution.

    "abstract": "O_LIUnderstanding how changes in biodiversity will impact the stability and functioning of ecosystems is a central challenge in ecology. Food-web approaches have been advocated to link community composition with ecosystem functioning by describing the fluxes of energy among species or trophic groups. However, estimating such fluxes remains problematic because current methods become unmanageable as network complexity increases.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a generalisation of previous indirect estimation methods assuming a steady state system [1, 2, 3]: the model estimates energy fluxes in a top-down manner assuming system equilibrium; each nodes losses (consumption and physiological) balances its consumptive gains. Jointly, we provide theoretical and practical guidelines to use the fluxweb R package (available on CRAN at https://bit.ly/2OC0uKF).\\nWe also present how the framework can merge with the allometric theory of ecology [4] to calculate fluxes based on easily obtainable organism-level data (i.e. body masses and species groups -eg, plants animals), opening its use to food webs of all complexities. Physiological losses (metabolic losses or losses due to death other than from predation within the food web) may be directly measured or estimated using allometric relationships based on the metabolic theory of ecology, and losses and gains due to predation are a function of ecological efficiencies that describe the proportion of energy that is used for biomass production.\\nC_LIO_LIThe primary output is a matrix of fluxes among the nodes of the food web. These fluxes can be used to describe the role of a species, a function of interest (e.g. predation; total fluxes to predators), multiple functions, or total energy flux (system throughflow or multitrophic functioning). Additionally, the package includes functions to calculate network stability based on the Jacobian matrix, providing insight into how resilient the network is to small perturbations at steady state.\\nC_LIO_LIOverall, fluxweb provides a flexible set of functions that greatly increase the feasibility of implementing food-web energetic approaches to more complex systems. As such, the package facilitates novel opportunities for mechanistically linking quantitative food webs and ecosystem functioning in real and dynamic natural landscapes.\\nC_LI",

To better understand the cell-type specific regulatory landscape of human melanocytes, which give rise to melanoma but account for <5% of typical human skin biopsies, we performed an eQTL analysis in primary melanocyte cultures from 106 newborn males. We identified 597,335 cis-eQTL SNPs prior to LD-pruning and 4,997 eGenes (FDR<0.05), which are higher numbers than in any GTEx tissue type with a similar sample size. Melanocyte eQTLs differed considerably from those identified in the 44 GTEx tissues, including skin. Over a third of melanocyte eGenes, including key genes in melanin synthesis pathways, were not observed to be eGenes in two types of GTEx skin tissues or TCGA melanoma samples. The melanocyte dataset also identified cell-type specific trans-eQTLs with a pigmentation-associated SNP for four genes, likely through its cis-regulation of IRF4, encoding a transcription factor implicated in human pigmentation phenotypes. Melanocyte eQTLs are enriched in cis-regulatory signatures found in melanocytes as well as melanoma-associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Co-localization of melanoma GWAS variants and eQTLs from melanocyte and skin eQTL datasets identified candidate melanoma susceptibility genes for six known GWAS loci including unique genes identified by the melanocyte dataset. Further, a transcriptome-wide association study using published melanoma GWAS data uncovered four new loci, where imputed expression levels of five genes (ZFP90, HEBP1, MSC, CBWD1, and RP11-383H13.1) were associated with melanoma at genome-wide significant P-values. Our data highlight the utility of lineage-specific eQTL resources for annotating GWAS findings and present a robust database for genomic research of melanoma risk and melanocyte biology.",

A potential drawback is that reaction norms measured in different constant environments may not capture all aspects of organismal responses to fluctuating environments. We examined growth of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa in fluctuating temperatures and tested if growth in fluctuating temperatures can be explained simply by growth in different constant temperatures or if more complex models are needed. In addition, as previous studies on fluctuating environments have revealed that past temperatures that organisms have experienced can affect their response to current temperature, we tested the roles of different epigenetic mechanisms in response to fluctuating environments using different mutants. We found that growth of Neurospora can be predicted in fluctuating temperatures to some extent if acclimation times are taken into account in the model. Interestingly, while fluctuating environments have been linked with epigenetic responses we found only some evidence of involvement of epigenetic mechanisms on tolerating fluctuating temperatures. Mutants which lacked H3K4 or H3K36 methylation had slightly impaired response to temperature fluctuations, in addition the H3K4 methylation mutant and a mutant in the RNA interference pathway had altered acclimation times.",

    "abstract": "Malarial dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) are cysteine proteases important for parasite development thus making them attractive drug targets. In order to develop inhibitors specific to the parasite enzymes it is necessary to map the determinants of substrate specificity of the parasite enzymes and its mammalian homologue cathepsin C (CatC). Here, we screened peptide-based libraries of substrates and covalent inhibitors to characterize the differences in specificity between parasite DPAPs and CatC, and used this information to develop highly selective DPAP1 and DPAP3 inhibitors. Interestingly, while the primary amino acid specificity of a protease is often used to develop potent inhibitors, we show that equally potent and highly specific inhibitors can be developed based on the sequences of non-optimal peptide substrates. Importantly, analysis of previously published data about the specificity of other proteases also unveiled significant discrepancies in the amino acid preference between substrates and inhibitors. In this article, we also discuss important structural and theoretical reasons that might account for these discrepancies. Overall, this study illustrates that focusing the development of protease inhibitors solely on substrate specificity might overlook important structural features that can be exploited to develop highly potent and selective compounds.",

    "abstract": "Several models have been proposed to explain how eukaryotic cells control the length of their cilia and flagella. Here, we investigated this process in the protist Trypanosoma brucei, an excellent system for cells with stable cilia like photoreceptors or spermatozoa. We show that the total amount of intraflagellar transport material (IFT, the machinery responsible for flagellum construction) increases during flagellum elongation, consistent with constant delivery of precursors and the previously reported linear growth. Reducing the IFT frequency by RNAi knockdown of the IFT kinesin motors slows down the elongation rate and results in the assembly of shorter flagella. These keep on elongating after cell division but fail to reach the normal length. This failure is neither due to an absence of precursors nor to a morphogenetic control by the cell body. We propose that the flagellum is locked after cell division, preventing further elongation or shortening. This is supported by the fact that subsequent increase in the IFT rate does not lead to further elongation. The distal tip FLAM8 protein was identified as a marker for the locking event. It is initiated prior cell division, leading to an arrest of elongation in the daughter cell. Here, we propose a new model termed grow-and-lock where the flagellum elongates until a locking event takes place in a timely defined manner hence fixing length. Alteration in the growth rate and/or in the timing of the locking event would lead to the formation of flagella of different lengths.",

Here, we combined ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets from three distinct neuronal culture systems in two activity states, enabling genome-wide enhancer identification and prediction of putative enhancer-gene pairs based on correlation of transcriptional output. Notably, stimulus-dependent enhancer transcription preceded mRNA induction, and CRISPR- based activation of eRNA synthesis increased mRNA at paired genes, functionally validating enhancer-gene predictions. Focusing on enhancers surrounding the Fos gene, we report that targeted eRNA manipulation bidirectionally modulates Fos mRNA, and that Fos eRNAs directly interact with the histone acetyltransferase domain of the enhancer-linked transcriptional co-activator CBP. Together, these results highlight the unique role of eRNAs in neuronal gene regulation and demonstrate that eRNAs can be used to identify putative target genes.",

    "abstract": "Control of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation at human mucosal surfaces is critical to reducing the burden of pneumonia and invasive disease, interrupting onward transmission, and in achieving herd protection. We hypothesised that the pattern of pneumococcal-epithelial engagement dictates the inflammatory response to colonisation, and that this epithelial sensing is linked to bacterial clearance. Here we have used nasal curette biopsies from a serotype 6B Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage Model (EHPC) to visualize S. pneumoniae colonisation and relate these interactions to epithelial surface marker expression and transcriptomic profile upregulation. We have used a Detroit 562 cell co-culture model to further understand these processes and develop an integrated epithelial transcriptomic module to interrogate gene expression in the EHPC model. We have shown for the first time that pneumococcal colonisation in humans is characterised by microcolony formation at the epithelial surface, microinvasion, cell junction protein association, epithelial sensing, and both epithelial endocytosis and paracellular transmigration. Comparisons with other clinical strains in vitro has revealed that the degree of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell surface marker expression (ICAM-1 and CD107), cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8 and ICAM-1) and the transcriptomic response. In the context of retained barrier function, epithelial microinvasion is associated with the upregulation of a wide range of epithelial innate signalling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes. The prominence of epithelial TLR4R signalling pathways implicates pneumolysin, a key virulence factor, but although pneumolysin gene deletion partially ameliorates the inflammatory transcriptional response in vitro, critical inflammatory pathways persist in association with enhanced epithelial adhesion and microinvasion. Importantly, the pattern of the host-bacterial interaction seen with the 6B strain in vitro is also reflected in the EHPC model, with evidence of microinvasion and a relatively silent epithelial transcriptomic profile that becomes most prominent around the time of bacterial clearance. Together these data suggest that epithelial sensing of the pneumococcus during colonisation in humans is enhanced by microinvasion, resulting in innate epithelial responses that are associated with bacterial clearance.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nO_LIColonisation of the human mucosa by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with microcolony formation, microinvasion, epithelial sensing and an epithelial innate response.\\nC_LIO_LIFollowing adherence to the epithelial cell surface, microinvasion of the epithelium may occur by endocytosis and/or lateral migration between cells without necessarily compromising barrier integrity.\\nC_LIO_LIThe pattern of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell response through a range of innate signaling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes.\\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial sensing is triggered by, but not wholly dependent on pneumolysin, a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A growing body of literature points to the important roles that different microbial communities play in diverse natural environments and the human body. The dynamics of these communities is driven by a range of microbial interactions from symbiosis to predator-prey relationships, the majority of which are poorly understood, making it hard to predict the response of the community to different perturbations. With the increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing based community composition data, it is now conceivable to directly learn models that explicitly define microbial interactions and explain community dynamics. The applicability of these approaches is however affected by several experimental limitations, particularly the compositional nature of sequencing data. We present a new computational approach (BEEM) that addresses this key limitation in the inference of generalised Lotka-Volterra models (gLVMs) by coupling biomass estimation and model inference in an expectation maximization like algorithm (BEEM). Surprisingly, BEEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for inferring gLVMs, while simultaneously eliminating the need for additional experimental biomass data as input. BEEMs application to previously inaccessible public datasets (due to the lack of biomass data) allowed us for the first time to analyse microbial communities in the human gut on a per individual basis, revealing personalised dynamics and keystone species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "Despite the high clinical burden little is known about pathophysiology underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have found atypical synchronization of brain activity in ASD. However, no consensus has been reached on the nature and clinical relevance of these alterations. Here we address these questions in the most comprehensive, large-scale effort to date comprising evaluation of four large ASD cohorts. We followed a strict exploration and replication procedure to identify core rs-fMRI functional connectivity (degree centrality) alterations associated with ASD as compared to typically developing (TD) controls (ASD: N=841, TD: N=984). We then tested for associations of these imaging phenotypes with clinical and demographic factors such as age, sex, medication status and clinical symptom severity. We find reproducible patterns of ASD-associated functional hyper- and hypo-connectivity with hypo-connectivity being primarily restricted to sensory-motor regions and hyper-connectivity hubs being predominately located in prefrontal and parietal cortices. We establish shifts in between-network connectivity from outside to within the identified regions as a key driver of these abnormalities. The magnitude of these alterations is linked to core ASD symptoms related to communication and social interaction and is not affected by age, sex or medication status. The identified brain functional alterations provide a reproducible pathophysiological phenotype underlying the diagnosis of ASD reconciling previous divergent findings. The large effect sizes in standardized cohorts and the link to clinical symptoms emphasize the importance of the identified imaging alterations as potential treatment and stratification biomarkers for ASD.",

In particular, ocular dominance is assumed to be hard-wired after the end of the critical period. We show that short-term (2h) monocular deprivation in adult humans boosts the BOLD response to the deprived eye, changing ocular dominance of V1 vertices, consistently with homeostatic plasticity. The boost is strongest in V1, present in V2, V3 & V4 but absent in V3a and MT. Assessment of spatial frequency tuning in V1 by a population Receptive-Field technique shows that deprivation primarily boosts high spatial frequencies, consistent with a primary involvement of the parvocellular pathway. Crucially, the V1 deprivation effect correlates across participants with the perceptual increase of the deprived eye dominance assessed with binocular rivalry, suggesting a common origin. Our results demonstrate that visual cortex, particularly the ventral pathway, retains a high potential for homeostatic plasticity in the human adult.",

    "abstract": "By engulfing potentially harmful microbes, professional phagocytes are continually at risk from intracellular pathogens. To avoid becoming infected, the host must kill pathogens in the phagosome before they can escape or establish a survival niche. Here, we analyse the role of the phosphoinositide (PI) 5-kinase PIKfyve in phagosome maturation and killing, using the amoeba and model phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum.\\n\\nPIKfyve plays important but poorly understood roles in vesicular trafficking by catalysing formation of the lipids phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)2) and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI(5)P). Here we show that its activity is essential during early phagosome maturation in Dictyostelium. Disruption of PIKfyve inhibited delivery of both the vacuolar V-ATPase and proteases, dramatically reducing the ability of cells to acidify newly formed phagosomes and digest their contents. Consequently, PIKfyve- cells were unable to generate an effective antimicrobial environment and efficiently kill captured bacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate that cells lacking PIKfyve are more susceptible to infection by the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. We conclude that PIKfyve-catalysed phosphoinositide production plays a crucial and general role in ensuring early phagosomal maturation, protecting host cells from diverse pathogenic microbes.\\n\\nImportanceCells that capture or eat bacteria must swiftly kill them to prevent pathogens from surviving long enough to escape the bactericidal pathway and establish an infection. This is achieved by the rapid delivery of components that produce an antimicrobial environment in the phagosome, the compartment containing the captured microbe. This is essential both for the function of immune cells and for amoebae that feed on bacteria in their environment. Here we identify a central component of the pathway used by cells to deliver antimicrobial components to the phagosome and show that bacteria survive over three times as long within the host if this pathway is disabled. We show that this is of general importance for killing a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, and that it is physiologically important if cells are to avoid infection by the opportunistic human pathogen Legionella.",

In addition to the moment estimation system, we incorporated an advantageous part of AdaDelta, namely a unit correction system, into YamAdam.

The European mitochondrial haplogroup K has previously been reported to be increased in frequency in centenarians and nonagenarians relative to its frequency in younger individuals, by standard case/control study designs. To select for mitochondrial genomes likely to carry beneficial genetic variants, we screened a large genealogical database (the Utah Population Database, UPDB) for mitochondrial lineages in which the frequency of survival past 90 years was significantly higher than in the general population, and also significantly higher than in close non-matrilineal relatives. We ranked 14,900 distinct matrilineages by the strength of their association with longevity. Full sequencing of the mtDNAs from a single individual from each of 53 matrilineages in the top longevity ranks and each of 374 control matrilineages from the general Utah population, followed by analyses of the mtDNA haplogroup frequencies, identified haplogroup K2 as the haplogroup most enriched in frequency by the longevity selection (Odds Ratio = 23.05). We then analyzed overall survival and cause-specific mortality in the several thousand individuals aged 40 years or older whose mtDNA genotypes could be imputed from the 374 fully sequenced control mtDNAs. In these control matrilineages Haplogroup K2 individuals (n=332) enjoyed a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk than the general population (HR=0.81), attributable in part to a significantly lower risk of dying from heart disease (HR=0.50), as well as lower (though not significantly lower) risks of dying from cancer (HR=0.72) and diabetes (HR=0.74).

    "abstract": "The influence of intraspecific variation in cytoplasmic genomes and cytonuclear interactions on key seed traits that can impact adaptation and agriculture has not been thoroughly explored, so far. Here, dormancy, germination performance and longevity of seeds have been assessed in Arabidopsis plants with novel cytonuclear combinations that disrupt coadaptation between natural variants of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes. Although all three traits were affected by cytonuclear reshuffling, the sensitivity of seed traits to cytoplasmic change was dependent on the nuclear background. Both deleterious and, more surprisingly, favorable effects of novel cytonuclear combinations (in comparison with the nuclear parent) were observed, suggesting suboptimal genetic combinations exist in natural populations for these traits. Significant changes on dormancy and germination performance due to specific cytonuclear interacting combinations mainly occurred in opposite directions, in accordance with the previously proposed  dormancy continuum. Consistently, reduced sensitivity to exogenous ABA and faster endogenous ABA decay during germination were observed in a novel cytonuclear combination that also exhibited enhanced longevity and better germination performance, compared to its natural nuclear parent. Cytoplasmic genomes, therefore, represent an additional resource of natural variation for breeding seed vigor traits.\\n\\nIssue sectionGrowth and development\\n\\nHighlightNatural variation in Arabidopsis organelles and cytonuclear interactions influence seed dormancy, longevity and germination performance.

    "abstract": "Micro-Tissue Engineered Neural Networks (Micro-TENNs) are living three-dimensional constructs designed to replicate the neuroanatomy of white matter pathways in the brain, and are being developed as implantable microtissue for axon tract reconstruction or as anatomically-relevant in vitro experimental platforms. Micro-TENNs are composed of discrete neuronal aggregates connected by bundles of long-projecting axonal tracts within miniature tubular hydrogels. In order to help design and optimize micro-TENN performance, we have created a new computational model including geometric and functional properties. The model is built upon the three-dimensional diffusion equation and incorporates large-scale uni- and bi-directional growth that simulates realistic neuron morphologies. The model captures unique features of 3D axonal tract development that are not apparent in planar outgrowth, and may be insightful for how white matter pathways form during brain development. The processes of axonal outgrowth, branching, turning and aggregation/bundling from each neuron are described through functions built on concentration equations and growth time distributed across the growth segments. Once developed we conducted multiple parametric studies to explore the applicability of the method and conducted preliminary validation via comparisons to experimentally grown micro-TENNs for a range of growth conditions. Using this framework, this model can be applied to study micro-TENN growth processes and functional characteristics using spiking network or compartmental network modeling. This model may be applied to improve our understanding of axonal tract development and functionality, as well as to optimize the fabrication of implantable tissue engineered brain pathways for nervous system reconstruction and/or modulation.",

    "abstract": "Intensive postgraduate courses provide an opportunity for junior and senior level scientists to learn concepts and techniques that will advance their training and research programs. It is commonly assumed that short intensive courses have positive impacts within fields of research; however, these assumptions are rarely tested. Here we describe the framework of a long running postgraduate summer course at Cold Spring Harbor and attempt to quantify the impact made over its history. For over three decades, the Drosophila Neurobiology: Genes, Circuits & Behavior Summer Course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (CSHL) has provided participants with intense instruction on a wide variety of topics and techniques in integrative neuroscience using Drosophila as a model organism. Students are introduced to the latest approaches for studying nervous system development, activity and connectivity, as well as complex behaviors and diseases. The course has a long history of successful alumni, many of whom describe participation in the course as foundational to their training. Student surveys of recent participants indicate a high level of satisfaction, improved career outcomes, and direct impact on publications. Analysis of student success reveals that over 64% of participants obtain independent faculty positions. Further, we describe ongoing efforts to enhance diversity and encourage access to scientific research at undergraduate-focused institutions. Together, our findings suggest that laboratory-intensive postgraduate courses provide a highly effective mechanism for scientific training that has lasting positive impacts on trainees.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae. The RNA viral genome encodes for a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without affecting virion release. Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC in mosquito infected cells. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV infected cells. Finally, the treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells with brefeldin A and golgicide A showed no effect on NS1 secretion, while affecting virion release. ZIKV NS1 was also found to co-localize with CAV-1 in infected mosquito cells. These results suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway observed for DENV NS1. The association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells. In humans, secreted NS1 have been associated with pathogenesis. In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1. This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells. Reduction of the expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory system faces the difficult task of identifying an enormous variety of odors independent of their intensity. Primacy coding, where the odor identity is encoded by the receptor types that respond earliest, is one possible representation that can facilitate this task. So far, it is unclear whether primacy coding facilitates typical olfactory tasks and what constraints it implies for the olfactory system. In this paper, we develop a simple model of primacy coding, which we simulate numerically and analyze using a statistical description. We show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of the odor intensity and the transmitted information is useful to perform typical olfactory tasks, like detecting a target odor or discriminating similar mixtures, with close to experimentally measured performance. Interestingly, we find situations in which a smaller receptor repertoire is advantageous for identifying a target odor. The model also suggests that overly sensitive receptor types could dominate the entire response and make the whole array useless, which allows us to predict how receptor arrays need to adapt to stay useful during environmental changes. By quantifying the information transmitted using primacy coding, we can thus connect microscopic characteristics of the olfactory system to its overall performance.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHumans can identify odors independent of their intensity. Experimental data suggest that this is accomplished by representing the odor identity by the earliest responding receptor types. Using theoretical modeling, we here show that such a primacy code allows discriminating odors with close to experimentally measured performance. This performance depends strongly on the number of receptors considered in the primacy code, but the receptor repertoire size is less important. The model also suggests a strong evolutionary pressure on the receptor sensitivities, which could explain observed receptor copy number adaptations. Taken together, the model connects detailed molecular measurements to large-scale psycho-physical measurements, which will contribute to our understanding of the olfactory system.",

    "abstract": "Francisella tularensis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes the zoonotic disease tularemia in human and animal hosts. This bacterium possesses a non-canonical type VI secretion systems (T6SS) required for phagosomal escape and access to its replicative niche in the cytosol of infected macrophages. KCl stimulation has been previously used to trigger assembly and secretion of the Francisella T6SS in culture. We found that the amounts of essentially all the TSS6 proteins remained unchanged upon KCl stimulation. We therefore hypothesized that a post-translational modification might be involved in T6SS assembly. A whole cell phosphoproteomic analysis allowed us to identify a unique phosphorylation site on IglB, the TssC homologue and key component of the T6SS sheath. Importantly, the phosphorylated form of IglB was not present in the contracted sheath and 3D modeling indicated that the charge repulsion provoked by addition of a phosphogroup on tyrosine 139 was likely to weaken the stability of the sheath structure. Substitutions of the phosphorylatable residue of IglB (tyrosine 139) with alanine or with phosphomimetics prevented T6SS formation and totally impaired phagosomal escape. In contrast, the substitution with the non-phosphorylatable aromatic analog phenylalanine impaired but did not prevent phagosomal escape and cytosolic bacterial multiplication in J774-1 macrophages. Altogether these data suggest that phosphorylation of the sheath participates to T6SS disassembly. Post-translational modifications of the sheath may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism to finely modulate the dynamics of T6SS assembly-disassembly.\n\nData are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012507.\n\nSynopsisFrancisella possesses a non-canonical T6SS that is essential for efficient phagosomal escape and access to the cytosol of infected macrophages.

    "abstract": "As human population density and antibiotic exposure increases, specialised bacterial subtypes have begun to emerge. Arising among species that are common commensals and infrequent pathogens, antibiotic-resistant  high-risk clones have evolved to better survive in the modern human. Here, we show that the major matrix porin (OmpK35) of Klebsiella pneumoniae is not required in the mammalian host for colonisation, pathogenesis, nor for antibiotic resistance, and that it is commonly absent in pathogenic isolates. This is found in association with, but apparently independent of, a highly specific change in the co-regulated partner porin, the osmoporin (OmpK36), which provides enhanced antibiotic resistance without significant loss of fitness in the mammalian host. These features are common in well-described  high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae, as well as in unrelated members of this species and similar adaptations are found in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae that share this lifestyle. Available sequence data indicates evolutionary convergence, with implications for the spread of lethal antibiotic-resistant pathogens in humans.\\n\\nAuthor summaryKlebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative enterobacteria and a significant cause of human disease. It is a frequent agent of pneumonia, and systemic infections can have high mortality rates (60%). OmpK35 and OmpK36 are the major co-regulated outer membrane porins of K. pneumoniae. OmpK36 absence has been related to antibiotic resistance but decreased bacterial fitness and diminished virulence. A mutation that constricts the porin channel (Gly134Asp135 duplication in loop 3 of the porin, OmpK36GD) has been previously observed and suggested as a solution to the fitness cost imposed by loss of OmpK36.\\n\\nIn the present study we constructed isogenic mutants to verify this and test the impact of these porin changes on antimicrobial resistance, fitness and virulence. Our results show that loss of OmpK35 has no significant cost in bacterial survival in nutrient-rich environments nor in the mammalian host, consistent with a predicted role outside that niche. When directly compared with the complete loss of the partner osmoporin OmpK36, we found that isogenic OmpK36GD strains maintain high levels of antibiotic resistance and that the GD duplication significantly reduces neither gut colonisation nor pathogenicity in a pneumonia mouse model. These changes are widespread in unrelated genomes. Our data provide clear evidences that specific variations in the loop 3 of OmpK36 and the absence of OmpK35 in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates are examples of successful adaptation to human colonization/infection and antibiotic pressure, and are features of a fundamental evolutionary shift in this important human pathogen.",

It is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), but how individual Hsa21 genes contribute to various aspects of the disorder is incompletely understood. Previous work has demonstrated a role for triplication of the Hsa21 gene DYRK1A in cognitive and motor deficits, as well as in altered neurogenesis and neurofibrillary degeneration in the DS brain, but its contribution to other DS phenotypes is unclear. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of minibrain (mnb), the Drosophila ortholog of DYRK1A, in the Drosophila nervous system accelerated age-dependent decline in motor performance and shortened lifespan. Overexpression of mnb in the eye was neurotoxic and overexpression in ellipsoid body neurons in the brain caused age-dependent neurodegeneration. At the larval neuromuscular junction, an established model for mammalian central glutamatergic synapses, neuronal mnb overexpression enhanced spontaneous vesicular transmitter release. It also slowed recovery from short-term depression of evoked transmitter release induced by high-frequency nerve stimulation and increased the number of boutons in one of the two glutamatergic motor neurons innervating the muscle. These results provide further insight into the roles of DYRK1A triplication in abnormal aging and synaptic dysfunction in DS.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDown syndrome (DS) is caused by three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two.

Uncertainty about the year of his birth poses an additional question regarding his age at death in 1240. The reliquary, located in the Saint Marie dOigines church, Belgium, was reopened in 2015 for an interdisciplinary study around his relics as well as the Treasure of Oignies, a remarkable cultural heritage notably built from Jacques de Vitrys donation. Anthropological, isotopic and genetic analyses were performed independently on the remains found in the reliquary. Results of the analyses provided evidence that the likelihood that these remains are those of Jacques de Vitry is very high: the remains belong to the same human male individual and the historical tradition about his age is confirmed. In addition, a separate relic (left tibia) was analysed and found to match with the remains of the reliquary (right tibia). The unique Jacques de Vitrys mitre, made of parchment, was sampled non-destructively and the extracted parchment collagen was analysed by a proteomic method in order to determine the animal species. The results showed that, surprisingly, not all parts of the mitre were made from the same species. All together, these findings are expected to fertilize knowledge carried by historical tradition around the relics of Jacques de Vitry and his related cultural heritage.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of acceleration intensity at wrist and thigh sites as estimates of AEE and TEE under free-living conditions using a gold-standard criterion.\\n\\nMethodsMeasurements for 193 UK adults (105 men, 88 women, aged 40-66 years, BMI 20.4-36.6 kg{middle dot}m-2) were collected with triaxial accelerometers worn on the dominant wrist, non-dominant wrist and thigh in free-living conditions for 9-14 days. In a subsample (50 men, 50 women) TEE was simultaneously assessed with doubly labelled water (DLW). AEE was estimated from non-dominant wrist using an established estimation model, and novel models were derived for dominant wrist and thigh in the non-DLW subsample. Agreement with both AEE and TEE from DLW was evaluated by mean bias, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation.\\n\\nResultsMean TEE and AEE derived from DLW was 11.6 (2.3) MJ{middle dot}day-1 and 49.8 (16.3) kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-1. Dominant and non-dominant wrist acceleration were highly correlated in free-living (r=0.93), but less so with thigh (r=0.73 and 0.66, respectively). Estimates of AEE were 48.6 (11.8) kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-1 from dominant wrist, 48.6 (12.3) from non-dominant wrist, and 46.0 (10.1) from thigh; these agreed strongly with AEE (RMSE ~12.2 kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-1, r ~0.71) with small mean biases at the population level (~6%). Only the thigh estimate bias was statistically significantly different from the criterion. When combining these AEE estimates with estimated REE, agreement was stronger with the criterion (RMSE ~1.0 MJ{middle dot}day-1, r ~0.90). Conclusions: In UK adults, acceleration measured at either wrist or thigh can be used to estimate population levels of AEE and TEE in free-living conditions with high precision.",

Specifically, we found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of structural integrity, in the ONs of eyes with advanced, as compared to mild, glaucoma (F(1,10) = 55.474, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, by comparing the ratios of ON FA in glaucoma patients to those of healthy controls (n = 6), we determined that this difference was beyond that expected from normal anatomical variation (F(1,9) = 20.276, p < 0. 005). Finally, we linked the DWI-measures of neural integrity to standard clinical glaucoma measures. ON vertical cup-to-disc ratio (vCD) predicted ON FA (F(1,10) = 11.061, p < 0.01, R2 = 0.66), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) predicted ON FA (F(1,10) = 11.477, p < 0.01, R2 = 0.63) and ON FA predicted perceptual deficits (visual field index [VFI]) (F(1,10) = 15.308, p < 0.005, R2 = 0.52).\\n\\nConclusionWe provide semi-automated methods to detect glaucoma-related structural changes using DWI and confirm that they correlate with clinical measures of glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Cell survival, differentiation, and migration are all dependent on the cells interaction with its external environment. In addition to chemical cues, cells react to their physical environment, particularly the stiffness of the substrate. In order for cells to react to these elements, they must make use of cellular machinery to signal changes in their microenvironment. One such proposed machinery is the protein p130Cas, which has been shown to regulate focal adhesion turnover, actin dynamics, and cell migration. Here we show that p130Cas localizes to focal adhesions depending on substrate stiffness and subsequently modulates cellular force exertion. We compared on substrates of tunable stiffness knock-out CAS-/-cells to cells re-expressing either the full-length p130Cas or a mutant lacking the focal adhesion targeting domains. On polyacrylamide gels, we observed that p130Cas prevented focal adhesion formation at low stiffness. On structured micro-pillar arrays, p130Cas preferentially localized to sites of force exertion when the apparent Youngs modulus of the substrate was higher than E = 47 kPa. Stiffness-dependent localization of p130Cas coincided with slower, but increased force exertion for the full-length p130Cas. Cas localization to focal adhesions preceded force build-up by three minutes, suggesting a coordinating role for p130Cas in the cellular mechanoresponse. Thus, p130Cas appears to relay mechanosensory information in the cell through its ability to tune force exertion at the focal adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Short-term depression is a low pass filter of synaptic information that reduces and flattens synaptic information transfer at high presynaptic firing frequencies. This view questions the relevance of spontaneous high firing rates in some networks. In the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, spontaneously active neurons in the globus pallidus (GP) form depressing inhibitory synapses in the basal ganglia output nuclei. Using numerical modeling and whole-cell recordings from single entopeduncular nucleus (EP) neurons in rat brain slices we investigated the contribution of the different firing rates of GP neurons to information transmission in the indirect pathway. Wholecell recordings showed significant variability in steady-state depression which decreased as stimulation frequency increased. Modeling predicted that this variability would translate into different postsynaptic noise levels during constitutive presynaptic activity. Our simulations further predicted that individual GP-EP synapses mediate gain control. However, when we consider integration of multiple inputs, the large range of GP firing rates would enable different modes of information transmission in which the magnitude and temporal features of postsynaptic modulation would change as a function of present and past firing rates of GP neurons. Finally, we predict that changes in dopamine levels can shift the action of GP neurons from rate coding to gain modulation. Our results thus demonstrate how short-term synaptic depression shapes information transmission in the basal ganglia in particular and via GABAergic synapses in general.\\n\\nSignificant statementSynapses displaying short-term depression are low-pass filters of synaptic input. Consequently, when presynaptic firing is high, little information passes to the postsynaptic neuron. However, many neurons fire at relatively high frequencies all the time. Are their synapses constantly silenced by depression? We tested this apparent contradiction in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, where neurons from the globus pallidus (GP) form constitutively active depressing synapses on basal ganglia output. We hypothesized that the different rates of ongoing activity underlie different modes of action for GP neurons. We show that the synaptic and structural properties of the indirect pathway map GP baseline frequencies to different postsynaptic signals, thus demonstrating how short-term synaptic depression shapes information transmission in the basal ganglia.",

Here we show that N. gruberi trophozoites need oxygen for normal functioning and growth and that they furthermore shun both glucose and amino acids as growth substrates. Trophozoite growth depends mainly upon lipid oxidation via a mitochondrial branched respiratory chain, both ends of which require oxygen as final electron acceptor. Growing N. gruberi trophozoites thus have a strictly aerobic energy metabolism with a marked substrate preference for the oxidation of fatty acids. Analyses of N. fowleri genome data and comparison with those of N. gruberi indicate that N. fowleri has the same type of metabolism.

Although positively correlated, circRNAs exhibit higher tissue specificity than cognate mRNAs. Also, genes with higher expression levels exhibit a larger fraction of spliced circular transcripts than their linear counterparts. Intriguingly, while we observed a monotonic increase of circRNA abundance with age in the rat brain, we further discovered a dynamic, age-dependent pattern of circRNA expression in the testes that is characterized by a dramatic increase with advancing stages of sexual maturity and a decrease with aging. The age-sensitive testicular circRNAs are highly associated with spermatogenesis, independent of cognate mRNA expression. The tissue/age implications of circRNAs suggest that they present unique physiological functions rather than simply occurring as occasional by-products of gene transcription.",

    "abstract": "The migration of cells through tight constricting spaces or along fibrous tracks in tissues is important for biological processes, such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis, and depends on the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. Migratory cells often express and upregulate the intermediate filament protein vimentin. The viscoelasticity of vimentin networks in shear deformation has been documented, but its role in motility is largely unexplored. Here, we studied the effects of vimentin on cell motility and stiffness using mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from wild-type and vimentin-null mice. We find that loss of vimentin increases motility through small pores and along thin capillaries. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that the presence of vimentin enhances the perinuclear stiffness of the cell, to an extent that depends on surface ligand presentation and therefore signaling from extracellular matrix receptors. Together, our results indicate that vimentin hinders three-dimensional motility by providing mechanical resistance against large strains and may thereby protect the structural integrity of cells.",

Certain MHC alleles are generalists: they present an exceptionally large variety of antigenic peptides.

According to what we term the pathogen-driven promiscuity hypothesis, exposure to a broad range of pathogens favors the evolution of highly promiscuous MHC variants. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles, and the switch between high and low promiscuity levels has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. We also show that selection for promiscuous peptide binding shapes MHC genetic diversity. In sum, our study offers a conceptually novel mechanism to explain the global distribution of allelic variants of a key human immune gene by demonstrating that pathogen pressure maintains promiscuous MHC class II alleles.

    "abstract": "BackgroundI have previously evaluated the efficiency of one-size-fits-all dosing for single agents in oncology (Norris 2017b). By means of a generic argument based on an Emax-type dose-response model, I showed that one-size-fits-all dosing may roughly halve a drugs value to society. Since much of the past decades  innovation in oncology dose-finding methodology has involved the development of special methods for combination therapies, a generalization of my earlier investigations to combination dosing seems called-for.\\n\\nMethodsFundamental to my earlier work was the premise that optimal dose is a characteristic of each individual patient, distributed across the population like any other physiologic characteristic such as height. I generalize that principle here to the 2-dimensional setting of combination dosing with drugs A and B, using a copula to build a bivariate joint distribution of (MTDi,A, MTDi,B) from single-agent marginal densities of MTDi,A and MTDi,B, and interpolating  toxicity isocontours in the (a, b)-plane between the respective monotherapy intercepts. Within this framework, three distinct notional toxicities are elaborated: one specific to drug A, a second specific to drug B, and a third  nonspecific toxicity clinically attributable to either drug. The dose-response model of (Norris 2017b) is also generalized to this 2-D scenario, with the addition of an interaction term to provide for a complementary effect from combination dosing. A population of 1,000 patients is simulated, and used as a basis to evaluate population-level efficacy of two pragmatic dose-finding designs: a dose-titration method that maximizes dose-intensity subject to tolerability, and the well-known POCRM method for 1-size-fits-all combination-dose finding. Hypothetical  oracular methods are also evaluated, to define theoretical upper limits of performance for individualized and 1-size-fits-all dosing respectively.\\n\\nResultsIn our simulation, pragmatic titration attains 89% efficiency relative to theoretically optimal individualized dosing, whereas POCRM attains only 55% efficiency. The passage from oracular individualized dosing to oracular 1-size-fits-all dosing incurs an efficiency loss of 33%, while the parallel passage (within the  pragmatic realm) from titration to POCRM incurs a loss of 38%.\\n\\nConclusionsIn light of the 33% figure above, the greater part of POCRMs 38% efficiency loss relative to titration appears attributable to POCRMs 1-size-fits-all nature, rather than to any pragmatic difficulties it confronts. Thus, appeals to pragmatic considerations would seem neither to justify the decision to use 1-size-fits-all dose-finding designs, nor to excuse their inefficiencies",

Recent studies have shown that some proteins undergo extremely rapid palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycles after cellular stimulation supporting a direct signaling role for this posttranslational modification. Here we investigated whether {beta}-adrenergic stimulation of cardiomyocytes led to stimulus-dependent palmitoylation of downstream signaling proteins. We found that {beta}-adrenergic stimulation led to increased Gs and Gi palmitoylation. The kinetics of palmitoylation was temporally consistent with the downstream production of cAMP and positive inotropic responses. Additionally, we identified for the first time that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a palmitoylated protein in cardiomyocytes. The kinetics of GRK2 palmitoylation were distinct from those observed with Gs and Gi after {beta}-adrenergic stimulation. Knockdown of the plasma membrane-localized palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC5 revealed that this enzyme is necessary for palmitoylation of Gs, Gi, and GRK2 and functional responses downstream of {beta}-adrenergic stimulation.

Here, we develop HiPLA (high-throughput imaging proximity ligation assay), a method that employs the antibody-based proximity ligation assay in a high-throughput imaging screening format to systematically probe protein interactomes. Using HiPLA, we probe the interaction of 60 proteins and associated PTMs with the nuclear lamina in a model of the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). We identify a subset of proteins that differentially interact with the nuclear lamina in HGPS. In combination with quantitative indirect immunofluorescence, we find that the majority of differential interactions were accompanied by corresponding changes in expression of the interacting protein. Taken together, HiPLA offers a novel approach to probe cellular protein-protein interaction at a large scale and reveals mechanistic insights into the assembly of protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "The explosive evolutionary diversification of flowering plants traditionally is attributed to the coevolution of plants and their animal pollinators. Plant-pollinator interactions are held as classical examples of mutualisms - beneficial to both parties - in spite of the fact that most other cases of rapid coevolution are the result of conflicts of interest (e.g., predator-prey, host-parasite, sexual conflict, competition for resources). Could the co-diversification of plants and their pollinators be driven by conflict rather than by mutualism? To address this question, we employed the theoretical morphospace paradigm using a combination of 3D printing, electronic sensing, and machine vision technologies to determine the influence of two flower morphological features (corolla curvature and nectary diameter) on the fitness of both parties: the artificial flower and its hawkmoth pollinator. We found that the two parties have almost opposite interests in corolla curvature evolution, with non-overlapping fitness peaks in flower morphospace, suggesting that the evolutionary radiation of flowering plants and their pollinators could be the result of conflict instead of mutualism.",

    "abstract": "All viruses require strategies to inhibit or evade the immunity pathways of cells they infect. The viruses that infect bacteria, bacteriophages (phages), must avoid nucleic-acid targeting immune pathways such as CRISPR-Cas and restriction endonucleases to replicate efficiently1. Here, we show that a jumbo phage infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phage {Phi}KZ, is resistant to many immune systems in vivo, including CRISPR-Cas3 (Type I-C), Cas9 (Type II-A), Cas12 (Cpf1, Type V-A), and Type I restriction-modification (R-M) systems. We propose that {Phi}KZ utilizes a nucleus-like shell to protect its DNA from attack. Supporting this, we demonstrate that Cas9 is able to cleave {Phi}KZ DNA in vitro, but not in vivo and that Cas9 is physically occluded from the shell assembled by the phage during infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Achilles heel for this phage is the mRNA, as translation occurs outside of the shell, rendering the phage sensitive to the RNA targeting CRISPR-Cas enzyme, Cas13a (C2c2, Type VI-A). Collectively, we propose that the nucleus-like shell assembled by jumbo phages enables potent, broad spectrum evasion of DNA-targeting nucleases.",

    "abstract": "Successful prediction of the likely paths of tumor progression is valuable for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes. Cancer progression models (CPMs) use cross-sectional samples to identify restrictions in the order of accumulation of driver mutations and thus CPMs encode the paths of tumor progression. Here we analyze the performance of four CPMs to examine whether they can be used to predict the true distribution of paths of tumor progression and to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. Employing simulations we show that if fitness landscapes are single peaked (have a single fitness maximum) there is good agreement between true and predicted distributions of paths of tumor progression when sample sizes are large, but performance is poor with the currently common much smaller sample sizes. Under multi-peaked fitness landscapes (i.e., those with multiple fitness maxima), performance is poor and improves only slightly with sample size. In all cases, detection regime (when tumors are sampled) is a key determinant of performance. Estimates of evolutionary unpredictability from the best performing CPM, among the four examined, tend to overestimate the true un-predictability and the bias is affected by detection regime; CPMs could be useful for estimating upper bounds to the true evolutionary unpredictability. Analysis of twenty-two cancer data sets shows low evolutionary unpredictability for several of the data sets. But most of the predictions of paths of tumor progression are very unreliable, and unreliability increases with the number of features analyzed. Our results indicate that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting cancer progression but that, currently, obtaining useful predictions of paths of tumor progression from CPMs is dubious, and emphasize the need for methodological work that can account for the probably multi-peaked fitness landscapes in cancer.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryKnowing the likely paths of tumor progression is instrumental for cancer precision medicine as it would allow us to identify genetic targets that block disease progression and to improve therapeutic decisions. Direct information about paths of tumor progression is scarce, but cancer progression models (CPMs), which use as input cross-sectional data on genetic alterations, can be used to predict these paths. CPMs, however, make assumptions about fitness landscapes (genotype-fitness maps) that might not be met in cancer. We examine if four CPMs can be used to predict successfully the distribution of tumor progression paths; we find that some CPMs work well when sample sizes are large and fitness landscapes have a single fitness maximum, but in fitness landscapes with multiple fitness maxima prediction is poor. However, the best performing CPM in our study could be used to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. When we apply the best performing CPM in our study to twenty-two cancer data sets we find that predictions are generally unreliable but that some cancer data sets show low unpredictability. Our results highlight that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting disease progression, but emphasize the need for methodological work to account for multi-peaked fitness landscapes.",

We and others previously reported that BRCA1-deficient tumors are initially hypersensitive to the inhibition of topoisomerase I/II and PARP, but acquire drug resistance through restoration of HR activity by the loss of end-resection antagonists of the 53BP1/RIF1/REV7/Shieldin/CST pathway. Here, we identified radiotherapy as an acquired vulnerability of 53BP1;BRCA1-deficient cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to the radioresistance caused by HR restoration through BRCA1 reconstitution, HR restoration by 53BP1 pathway inactivation further increases radiosensitivity. This highlights the relevance of this pathway for the repair of radiotherapy-induced damage. Moreover, our data show that BRCA1-mutated tumors that acquired drug resistance due to BRCA1-independent HR restoration can be targeted by radiotherapy.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEIn this study, we uncovered radiosensitivity as a novel therapeutically exploitable vulnerability of BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary cells that have acquired drug resistance due to the loss of the 53BP1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "The response of quantitative characters to selection depends on their transmission from parents to offspring. A common estimate of this transmission is the biometric heritability defined as the slope of the regression of offspring phenotype on same-aged mid-parent phenotype (i.e. the ratio of the phenotypic parent-offspring covariance over the parental phenotypic variance). This slope is often interpreted as the percentage of phenotypic variation due to additive genetic effects after accounting for confounding factors such as environment, litter or parental effects. However, researchers seldom account for the possible influence of selection on this estimate. Here we study the effect on biometric heritability of fertility and viability selection, as well as phenotype ontogeny (growth) and inheritance from parents to offspring. We present exact formulas for the elasticities of biometric heritability in age-phenotype-structured integral projection models (IPMs), and illustrate these for two iteroparous long-lived species. We find that both viability and fertility selection can strongly affect heritability, mediated by growth and inheritance. Generally, demographic processes that result in parents reproducing at large phenotypes, regardless of their own birth phenotype, decrease heritability. Analysed at equilibrium, our models imply that a heritable character can show no response to selection, if parental phenotypes affect offspring phenotypes and if phenotypes develop with age. Our results further highlight the importance of accounting for demographic processes when estimating heritability.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear envelope (NE) is an essential cellular structure that contributes to nuclear stability, organization, and function. Mutations in NE-associated proteins result in a myriad of pathologies with widely diverse clinical manifestations, ages of onsets, and affected tissues. Notably, several hundred disease-causing mutations have been mapped to the LMNA gene, which encodes the intermediate filament proteins lamin A and C, two of the major architectural components of the nuclear envelope. However, how NE dysfunction leads to the highly variable pathologies observed in patient cells and tissues remains poorly understood. One model suggests alterations in the dynamic properties of the nuclear lamina and its associated proteins contribute to disease phenotype. Here, we describe the application of single molecule tracking (SMT) methodology to characterize the behavior of nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs) and nuclear lamins in their native cellular environment at the single molecule level. As proof-of-concept, we demonstrate by SMT that Halo-tagged lamin B1, Samp1, lamin A, and lamin A {Delta}50 have distinct binding and kinetic properties, and we identify several disease-relevant mutants which exhibit altered binding dynamics. SMT is also able to separately probe the dynamics of the peripheral and the nucleoplasmic populations of lamin A mutants. We suggest that SMT is a robust and sensitive method to investigate how pathogenic mutations or cellular processes affect protein dynamics at the NE.",

Only 41% of centers had adopted high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, with wide variation from 7% in North America to 60% in Europe. Sites using high-sensitivity assays more frequently employed serial sampling pathways (91% vs. 78%) and the 99th percentile diagnostic threshold (74% vs. 66%) when compared to sites using the previous generation of troponin assays.

    "abstract": "In mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes, invaginations of the surface membrane form the transverse tubular system (T-system) which consists of transverse tubules (TTs) that align with sarcomeres and Z-lines as well as longitudinal tubules (LTs) that are present between Z-lines in some species. In many cardiac disease etiologies the T-system is perturbed, which is believed to promote spatially heterogeneous, dyssynchronous Ca2+ release and inefficient contraction. In general, T-system characterization approaches have been directed primarily at isolated cells and do not detect subcellular T-system heterogeneity. Here we present MatchedMyo, a matched-filter based algorithm for subcellular T-system characterization in isolated cardiomyocytes and millimeter-scale myocardial sections. The algorithm utilizes \"filters\" representative of TTs, LTs, and T-system absence. Application of the algorithm to cardiomyocytes isolated from rat disease models of myocardial infarction (MI), dilated cardiomyopathy induced via aortic banding (AB), and sham surgery confirmed and quantified heterogeneous T-system structure and remodeling. Cardiomyocytes from post-MI hearts exhibited increasing T-system disarray as proximity to the infarct increased. We found significant (p<0.05, Welchs t-test) increases in LT density within cardiomyocytes proximal to the infarct (12{+/-}3%, data reported as mean {+/-} SD, n=3) vs. sham (4{+/-}2%, n=5), but not distal to the infarct (7{+/-}1%, n=3). The algorithm also detected decreases in TTs within 5{degrees} of the myocyte minor axis for isolated AB (36{+/-}9%, n=3) and MI cardiomyocytes located intermediate (37{+/-}4%, n=3) and proximal (34{+/-}4%, n=3) to the infarct vs. sham (57{+/-}12%, n=5). Application of bootstrapping to rabbit MI tissue revealed distal sections comprised 18.9{+/-}1.0% TTs while proximal sections comprised 10.1{+/-}0.8% TTs (p<0.05), a 46.6% decrease. The matched filter approach therefore provides a robust and scalable technique for T-system characterization from isolated cells through millimeter-scale myocardial sections.",

    "abstract": "The great potential of computational diffusion MRI (dMRI) relies on indirect inference of tissue microstructure and brain connections, since modelling and tractography frameworks map diffusion measurements to neuroanatomical features. This mapping however can be computationally highly expensive, particularly given the trend of increasing dataset sizes and the complexity in biophysical modelling. Limitations on computing resources can restrict data exploration and methodology development. A step forward is to take advantage of the computational power offered by recent parallel computing architectures, especially Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs are massive parallel processors that offer trillions of floating point operations per second, and have made possible the solution of computationally-intensive scientific problems that were intractable before. However, they are not inherently suited for all problems. Here, we present two different frameworks for accelerating dMRI computations using GPUs that cover the most typical dMRI applications: a framework for performing biophysical modelling and microstructure estimation, and a second framework for performing tractography and long-range connectivity estimation. The former provides a front-end and automatically generates a GPU executable file from a user-specified biophysical model, allowing accelerated non-linear model fitting in both deterministic and stochastic ways (Bayesian inference). The latter performs probabilistic tractography, it can generate whole-brain connectomes and supports new functionality for imposing anatomical constraints, such as inherent consideration of surface meshes (GIFTI files) along with volumetric images. We validate the frameworks against well-established CPU-based implementations and we show that despite the very different challenges for parallelising these problems, GPU-based designs can offer accelerations of more than two orders of magnitude in both cases.",

    "abstract": "Physiological processes in multicellular organisms depend on the function and interactions of a multitude of specialized cell types operating in context. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) provides a powerful tool to determine the cell type composition of complex mixtures and to purify highly homogeneous cell populations using a small number of differentially expressed marker proteins. These populations can be further characterized, e.g. by phenotypic or molecular analyses.\\n\\nWe describe an ultra-sensitive mass spectrometric method for the robust quantitative and reproducible proteomic analysis of cohorts of FACS-isolated cell samples. It uses a minimum of post-sorting sample processing steps prior to data-independent acquisition MS on a current generation Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer. The method provides highly accurate and reproducible quantitative proteome profiles across the cohort with an average coefficient of variance <15% from as little as 150 ng of total peptide mass. We quantified the proteome of 25,000 sorted human hematopoietic stem/multipotent progenitor cell and three committed progenitor cell subpopulations (common myeloid progenitors, megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors) isolated from five healthy donors. On average, 5,851 protein groups were identified per sample. After stringent filtering, a subset of 4,131 protein groups ([&ge;]2 peptides) was used for differential comparison across the 20 samples, defining unique proteomic signatures for each cell type tested. A comparison of proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of the four cell types indicated hematopoietic stem/multipotent progenitor cell-specific divergent regulation of biochemical processes that are essential for maintaining stemness and were detected at the proteome rather than the transcriptome level.\\n\\nThe technology supports the generation of extensive and accurate quantitative proteomic profiles from low numbers of FACS-purified cells providing new information about the biochemical state of the analyzed cell types that is essential for basic and translational research.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in CRISPR-based gene editing have provided new avenues to interrogate gene function. However, application of these tools in the central nervous system has been delayed due to difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons. Here, we present a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system to drive gene expression in primary neuronal cultures and the adult brain of rodent model systems. We demonstrate robust, modular, and tunable induction of endogenous target genes as well as multiplexed gene regulation necessary for investigation of complex transcriptional programs. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of Bdnf regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient in vivo, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the diversity of cell types in the brain has been an enduring challenge and requires detailed characterization of individual neurons in multiple dimensions. To profile morpho-electric properties of mammalian neurons systematically, we established a single cell characterization pipeline using standardized patch clamp recordings in brain slices and biocytin-based neuronal reconstructions. We built a publicly-accessible online database, the Allen Cell Types Database, to display these data sets. Intrinsic physiological and morphological properties were measured from over 1,800 neurons from the adult laboratory mouse visual cortex. Quantitative features were used to classify neurons into distinct types using unsupervised methods. We establish a taxonomy of morphologically- and electrophysiologically-defined cell types for this region of cortex with 17 e-types and 35 m-types, as well as an initial correspondence with previously-defined transcriptomic cell types using the same transgenic mouse lines.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with increased incidence and severity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, mechanisms underlying this relationship are incompletely understood. Macrophages, which accumulate in adipose tissue and are activated during obesity, are an attractive mechanistic link. Here, we show that, during obesity, murine and human mammary adipose tissue macrophages adopt a pro-inflammatory, metabolically- activated (MMe) macrophage phenotype that promotes TNBC stem-like markers and functions, including increased tumorsphere growth in vitro and tumor-initiating potential in vivo. We demonstrate that MMe macrophages release cytokines in an NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent manner that signal through glycoprotein 130 (GP130) on TNBC cells to promote their stem-like properties. Accordingly, deleting Nox2 in myeloid cells or depleting GP130 in TNBC cells attenuates the ability of obesity to drive TNBC tumor formation. Our studies implicate MMe macrophage accumulation in mammary adipose tissue during obesity as a mechanism for promoting TNBC stemness and tumorigenesis.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS Obesity promotes TNBC tumor formation and stemness.\\nMammary adipose tissue macrophages are metabolically activated (MMe) in obese mice and humans.\\nMMe macrophages in mammary adipose tissue contribute to obesity-induced stemness.\\nMMe macrophages promote TNBC stemness through GP130 signaling.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective ion channel composed of species-and tissue-specific structural and regulatory subunits. However, the contribution of each component to uniporter-mediated activity still remains unclear. Here, we employ an evolutionary and synthetic biology approach to investigate the functional inter-dependence between the pore-forming subunit MCU and the EF-hand protein MICU1. Using phylogenetic profiling and genetic complementation analyses, we show that MCU and MICU1 constitute the minimal eukaryotic unit of the uniporter, pointing towards a strong selective pressure behind their co-occurrence. Heterologous reconstitution of MCU-mediated and MICU1-gated mitochondrial calcium entry in vivo in yeast cells demonstrates that MICU1 per se is essential to protect yeast from MCU-dependent manganese cytotoxicity. Accordingly, MICU1 deletion significantly sensitizes human HEK-293 cells to manganese-induced stress. Our study identifies a critical role of MICU1 in the regulation of MCU ion selectivity, with potential implications for patients with MICU1 deficiency.",
