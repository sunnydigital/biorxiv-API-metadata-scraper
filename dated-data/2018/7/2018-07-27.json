    "abstract": "Minimizing spatial uncertainty is essential for navigation, but the neural mechanisms remain elusive. Here we combine predictions of a simulated grid cell system with behavioural and fMRI measures in humans during virtual navigation. First, we showed that polarising cues produce anisotropy in motion parallax. Secondly, we simulated entorhinal grid cells in an environment with anisotropic information and found that self-location is decoded best when grid-patterns are aligned with the axis of greatest information. Thirdly, when exposing human participants to polarised virtual reality environments, we found that navigation performance is anisotropic, in line with the use of parallax. Eye movements showed that participants preferentially viewed polarising cues, which correlated with navigation performance. Finally, using fMRI we found that the orientation of grid-cell-like representations in entorhinal cortex anchored to the environmental axis of greatest parallax information, orthogonal to the polarisation axis. In sum, we demonstrate a crucial role of the entorhinal grid system in reducing uncertainty in representations of self-location and find evidence for adaptive spatial computations underlying entorhinal representations in service of optimal navigation.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a comparatively higher rate of more polymorphisms in regulatory regions of the primate CCR5 gene, an immune system gene with both general and specific functions. This has been interpreted as allowing flexibility and diversity of gene expression in response to varying disease loads. A broad expression repertoire is useful to humans--the only globally distributed primate--due to our unique adaptive pattern that increased pathogen exposure and disease loads (e.g., sedentism, subsistence practices). The main objective of the study was to determine if the previously observed human pattern of increased variation extended to other members of our genus, Homo. The data for this study are mined from the published genomes of extinct hominins (four Neandertals and two Denisovans), an ancient human (Ust-Ishim), and modern humans (1000 Genomes). An average of 15 polymorphisms per individual were found in human populations (with a total of 262 polymorphisms). There were 94 polymorphisms identified across extinct Homo (an average of 13 per individual) with 41 previously observed in modern humans and 53 novel polymorphisms (32 in Denisova and 21 in Neandertal). Neither the frequency nor distribution of polymorphisms across gene regions exhibit significant differences within the genus Homo. Thus, humans are not unique with regards to the increased frequency of regulatory polymorphisms and the evolution of variation patterns across CCR5 gene appears to have originated within the genus. A broader evolutionary perspective on regulatory flexibility may be that it provided an advantage during the transition to confrontational foraging (and later hunting) that altered human-environment interaction as well as during migration to Eurasia and encounters with novel pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is a major impediment to the success of cancer treatment. Resistance is typically thought to arise through random genetic mutations, after which mutated cells expand via Darwinian selection. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that the progression to drug resistance need not occur randomly, but instead may be induced by the treatment itself, through either genetic changes or epigenetic alterations. This relatively novel notion of resistance complicates the already challenging task of designing effective treatment protocols. To better understand resistance, we have developed a mathematical modeling framework that incorporates both spontaneous and drug-induced resistance. Our model demonstrates that the ability of a drug to induce resistance can result in qualitatively different responses to the same drug dose and delivery schedule. We have also proven that the induction parameter in our model is theoretically identifiable, and proposed an in vitro protocol which could be used to determine a treatments propensity to induce resistance.",

Although many disease-associated miRNAs are known, their global targets and culminating network effects on pathophysiology remain poorly understood. We applied AGO CLIP to systematically elucidate altered miRNA-target interactions in brain following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Among 1,190 identified, most prominent was the cumulative loss of target regulation by miR-29 family members. Integration of translational and time-course RNA profiles revealed a dynamic mode of miR-29 target de-regulation, led by acute translational activation and later increase in RNA levels, allowing rapid proteomic changes to take effect. These functional regulatory events rely on canonical and non-canonical miR-29 binding and engage glutamate reuptake signals to control local glutamate levels. These results uncover a miRNA target network that acts acutely to maintain brain homeostasis after ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "We used the Kasumi-3 model to study HCMV latency and reactivation in myeloid progenitor cells. Kasumi-3 cells were infected with HCMV strain TB40/Ewt-GFP, flow sorted for GFP+ cells, and cultured for various times to monitor establishment of latency, as judged by repression of viral gene expression (RNA/DNA ratio) and loss of virus production. We found that, in the vast majority of cells, latency was established post-transcriptionally in the GFP+ infected cells: transcription was initially turned on, and then turned off. We also found that some of the GFP-cells were infected, suggesting that latency might be established in these cells at the outset of infection. We were not able to test this hypothesis because some GFP-cells expressed lytic genes, and thus, it was not possible to separate them from GFP-quiescent cells. In addition, we found that the pattern of expression of lytic genes that have been associated with latency, including UL138, US28, and RNA2.7, was the same as that of other lytic genes, indicating that there was no preferential expression of these genes once latency is established. We confirmed previous studies showing that TNF- induced reactivation of infectious virus, and by analyzing expression of the progenitor cell marker CD34 as well as myeloid cell differentiation markers in IE+ cells after treatment with TNF-, we showed that TNF- induced transcriptional reactivation of IE gene expression independently of differentiation. TNF--mediated reactivation in Kasumi-3 cells was correlated with activation of NF-{kappa}B, KAP-1 and ATM.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEHCMV is an important human pathogen that establishes lifelong latent infection in myeloid progenitor cells, and reactivates frequently to cause significant disease in immunocompromised people. Our observation that viral gene expression is first turned on, and then turned off to establish latency suggests that there is a host defense, which may be myeloid-specific, responsible for transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression. Our observation that TNF- induces reactivation independently of differentiation provides insight into molecular mechanisms that control reactivation.",

    "abstract": "The lateral hypothalamus (LH) controls various homeostatic processes, including sleep-wake cycles, energy balance and thermoregulation in many mammalian species. In the LH, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and hypocretin/orexin (HO) containing neurons differentially regulate these processes. Naked mole-rats (NMR) (Heterocephalus glaber) are eusocial mammals with remarkable physiological peculiarities including extreme longevity without significant weight gain and absence of thermoregulation. Altered hypothalamic function could potentially underlie the unusual NMR phenotypes, but to date electrophysiological characterization of LH NMR neurons and expression of MCH and HO is missing. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from LH neurons in acute NMR and mouse brain slices and found that NMR and mouse neuronal basic properties and activities were comparable. Additionally, we showed that both MCH-positive and HO-positive neuronal populations exist in the NMR hypothalamus and although the majority of MCH- and HO-positive neurons are located in the LH, as previously described in rodents, significant differences exist in MCH/HO distribution in other NMR hypothalamic areas. These results indicate that NMR LH neurons are comparable to mouse neurons with respect to their electrophysiological properties, but differences in the neuronal MCH and HO populations in hypothalamic regions exist and may contribute to the adaptive changes seen in NMR homeostatic processes.",

There has as yet been no overall comparison of how different classes of exposure associate with telomeres. We present a meta-analysis of the literature relating telomere measures to stresses and adversities in humans. The analysed dataset contained 543 associations from 138 studies involving 402,116 people. Overall, there was a weak association between telomere variables and exposures (greater adversity, shorter telomeres: r = -0.15, 95% CI - 0.18 to -0.11). This was not driven by any one type of exposure, since significant associations were found separately for physical diseases, environmental hazards, nutrition, psychiatric illness, smoking, physical activity, psychosocial and socioeconomic exposures. Methodological features of the studies did not explain any substantial proportion of the heterogeneity in association strength. There was, however, evidence consistent with publication bias, with unexpectedly strong negative associations reported by studies with small samples. Restricting analysis to sample sizes greater than 100 attenuated the overall association substantially (r = -0.09, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.05). Most studies were underpowered to detect the typical association magnitude. The literature is dominated by cross-sectional and correlational studies which makes causal interpretation problematic.",

However, the molecular mechanism used by Ensconsin to activate Kinesin-1 remains elusive. Ensconsin/ MAP7 contains an N-terminal microtubule-binding domain (MBD) and a C-terminal Kinesin-binding domain (KBD). Using rescue experiments in live flies, we show that KBD expression alone is sufficient to fully rescue Ensconsin-dependent centrosome separation defects, but not the fast oocyte streaming and the localization patterns of Staufen and Gurken proteins. Interestingly, we show here for the first time that KBD binds and stimulates Kinesin-1 binding to Mts in vivo and in vitro. We propose that the KBD/Kinesin-1 motor represents a minimal activation module that stimulates Kinesin-1 binding to Mts. Addition of the MBD, present in the full length Ensconsin allows this activation to occur directly on the Mt. Our data also suggest that in a very large cell with a complex microtubule network, but not in smaller cells, this dual activation by Ensconsin is essential for optimal Kinesin-1 targeting to the microtubule cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common debilitating chronic disease diagnosed primarily using bone mineral density (BMD). We undertook a comprehensive assessment of human genetic determinants of bone density in 426,824 individuals, identifying a total of 518 genome-wide significant loci, (301 novel), explaining 20% of the total variance in BMD--as estimated by heel quantitative ultrasound (eBMD). Next, meta-analysis identified 13 bone fracture loci in ~1.2M individuals, which were also associated with BMD. We then identified target genes from cell-specific genomic landscape features, including chromatin conformation and accessible chromatin sites, that were strongly enriched for genes known to influence bone density and strength (maximum odds ratio = 58, P = 10-75). We next performed rapid throughput skeletal phenotyping of 126 knockout mice lacking eBMD Target Genes and showed that these mice had an increased frequency of abnormal skeletal phenotypes compared to 526 unselected lines (P < 0.0001). In-depth analysis of one such Target Gene, DAAM2, showed a disproportionate decrease in bone strength relative to mineralization. This comprehensive human and murine genetic atlas provides empirical evidence testing how to link associated SNPs to causal genes, offers new insights into osteoporosis pathophysiology and highlights opportunities for drug development.",

    "abstract": "The brain has a central, short-term learning module, the hippocampus, which transfers what it has learned to long-term memory in cortex during non-REM sleep. The putative mechanism responsible for this type of memory consolidation invokes hierarchically nested hippocampal ripples (100-250 Hz), thalamo-cortical spindles (7-15 Hz), and cortical slow oscillations (< 1 Hz) to enable transfer. Suppression of, for instance, thalamic spindles has been shown to impair hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation. Cortical oscillations are central to information transfer in neural systems. Significant evidence supports the idea that coincident spike input can allow the neural threshold to be overcome, and spikes to be propagated downstream in a circuit. Thus, an observation of oscillations in neural circuits would be an indication that repeated synchronous spiking is enabling information transfer. However, for memory transfer, in which synaptic weights must be being transferred from one neural circuit (region) to another, what is the mechanism? Here, we present a synaptic transfer mechanism whose structure provides some understanding of the phenomena that have been implicated in memory transfer, including the nested oscillations at various frequencies. The circuit is based on the principle of pulse-gated, graded information transfer between neural populations.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.18.Sn,87.19.lj,87.19.lm,87.19.lq",

    "abstract": "Our ability to predict the impact of mutations on traits relevant for disease and evolution remains severely limited by the dependence of their effects on the genetic background and environment. Even when molecular interactions between genes are known, it is unclear how these translate to organism-level interactions between alleles. We therefore characterized the interplay of genetic and environmental dependencies in determining fitness by quantifying ~4,000 fitness interactions between expression variants of two metabolic genes, in different environments. We detect a remarkable variety of environment-dependent interactions, and demonstrate they can be quantitatively explained by a mechanistic model accounting for catabolic flux, metabolite toxicity and expression costs. Complex fitness interactions between mutations can therefore be predicted simply from their simultaneous impact on a few connected molecular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "1Whole genome duplications have played an important role in the evolution of angiosperms. These events often occur through hybridization between closely related species, resulting in an allopolyploid with multiple subgenomes. With the availability of affordable genotyping and a reference genome to locate markers, breeders of allopolyploids now have the opportunity to manipulate subgenomes independently. This also presents a unique opportunity to investigate epistatic interactions between homeologous orthologs across subgenomes. We present a statistical framework for partitioning genetic variance to the subgenomes of an allopolyploid, predicting breeding values for each subgenome, and determining the importance of inter-genomic epistasis. We demonstrate using an allohexaploid wheat breeding population evaluated in Ithaca, NY and an important wheat dataset previously shown to demonstrate non-additive genetic variance. Subgenome covariance matrices were constructed and used to calculate subgenome interaction covariance matrices across subgenomes for variance component estimation and genomic prediction. We propose a method to extract population structure from all subgenomes at once before covariances are calculated to reduce collinearity between subgenome estimates. Variance parameter estimation was shown to be reliable for additive subgenome effects, but was less reliable for subgenome interaction components. Predictive ability was equivalent to current genomic prediction methods. Including only inter-genomic interactions resulted in the same increase in accuracy as modeling all pairwise marker interactions. Thus, we provide a new tool for breeders of allopolyploid crops to characterize the genetic architecture of existing populations, determine breeding goals, and develop new strategies for selection of additive effects and fixation of inter-genomic epistasis.",

    "abstract": "We recently discovered that inhibition of the lipid peroxidase GPX4 can selectively kill cancer cells in a therapy-resistant state through induction of ferroptosis. Although GPX4 lacks a conventional druggable pocket, covalent small-molecule inhibitors are able to overcome this challenge by reacting with the GPX4 catalytic selenocysteine residue to eliminate enzymatic activity. Unfortunately, all currently-reported GPX4 inhibitors achieve their activity through reactive chloroacetamide groups. We demonstrate that such chloroacetamide-containing compounds are poor starting points for further advancement given their promiscuity, instability, and low bioavailability. Development of improved GPX4 inhibitors, including those with therapeutic potential, requires the identification of new electrophilic chemotypes and mechanisms of action that do not suffer these shortcomings. Here, we report our discovery that nitrile oxide electrophiles, and a set of remarkable chemical transformations that generates them in cells from masked precursors, provide an effective strategy for selective targeting of GPX4. Our results, which include structural insights, target engagement assays, and diverse GPX4-inhibitor tool compounds, provide critical insights that may galvanize development of improved compounds that illuminate the basic biology of GPX4 and therapeutic potential of ferroptosis induction. In addition, our discovery that nitrile oxide electrophiles engage in highly selective cellular interactions and are bioavailable in their masked forms may be relevant for targeting other currently undruggable proteins, such as those revealed by recent proteome-wide ligandability studies.",

    "abstract": "1Hybridization between related species results in the formation of an allopolyploid with multiple subgenomes. These subgenomes will each contain complete, yet evolutionarily divergent, sets of genes. Like a diploid hybrid, allopolyploids will have two versions, or homeoalleles, for every gene. Partial functional redundancy between homeologous genes should result in a deviation from additivity. These epistatic interactions between homeoalleles are analogous to dominance effects, but are fixed across subgenomes through self pollination. An allopolyploid can be viewed as an immortalized hybrid, with the opportunity to select and fix favorable homeoallelic interactions within inbred varieties. We present a subfunctionalization epistasis model to estimate the degree of functional redundancy between homeoallelic loci and a statistical framework to determine their importance within a population. We provide an example using the homeologous dwarfing genes of allohexaploid wheat, Rht-1, and search for genome-wide patterns indicative of homeoallelic subfunctionalization in a breeding population. Using the IWGSC RefSeq vl.0 sequence, 23,796 homeoallelic gene sets were identified and anchored to the nearest DNA marker to form 10,172 homeologous marker sets. Interaction predictors constructed from products of marker scores were used to fit the homeologous main and interaction effects, as well as estimate whole genome genetic values. Some traits displayed a pattern indicative of homeoallelic subfunctionalization, while other traits showed a less clear pattern or were not affected. Using genomic prediction accuracy to evaluate importance of marker interactions, we show that homeologous interactions explain a portion of the non-additive genetic signal, but are less important than other epistatic interactions.",

There has been a longstanding interest in psilocybin research with regard to treatment for addiction2, depression3, and end-of-life suffering4. However, until recently very little was known about psilocybin biosynthesis and its ecological role. Here we confirm and refine recent findings5 about the genes underpinning psilocybin biosynthesis, discover that there is more than one psilocybin biosynthesis cluster in mushrooms, and we provide the first data directly addressing psilocybins ecological role. By analysing independent genome assemblies for the hallucinogenic mushrooms Psilocybe cyanescens and Pluteus salicinus we recapture the recently discovered psilocybin biosynthesis cluster5,6 and show that a transcription factor previously implicated in its regulation is actually not part of the cluster. Further, we show that the mushroom Inocybe corydalina produces psilocybin but does not contain the established biosynthetic cluster, and we present an alternative cluster. Finally, a meta-transcriptome analysis of wild-collected mushrooms provides evidence for intra-mushroom insect gene expression of flies whose larvae grow inside Psilocybe cyanescens. These larvae were successfully reared into adults. Our results show that psilocybin does not confer complete protection against insect mycophagy, and the hypothesis that it is produced as an adaptive defense compound may need to be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "1Epistasis is an important contributor to genetic variance, even in inbred populations where it is present as additive by additive interactions. Testing for epistasis presents a multiple testing problem as the search space for modest numbers of markers is large. Additionally, single markers do not necessarily track functional units of interacting chromatin as well as haplotype based methods do. To harness the power of multiple markers while drastically minimizing the number of tests conducted, we present a low resolution test for epistatic interactions across whole chromosome arms. Two additive genetic covariance matrices are constructed from markers on two different chromosome arms. The Hadamard product of these additive covariance matrices is then used to produce the additive by additive epistasis covariance matrix between the two chromosome arms. The covariance matrices are subsequently used to estimate an epistatic interaction variance parameter in a mixed model framework, while correcting for background additive and epistatic effects. We find significant epistatic interactions for 2% of interactions tested for four agronomic traits in a population of winter wheat. Interactions across homeologous chromosome arms were identified, but were less abundant than other interaction chromosome arm pairs. Of these, homeologous chromosome arm pair 4BL and 4DL showed a strong relationship between the product of their additive effects and the interaction effect that may be indicative of functional redundancy. Several chromosome arms were involved in many interactions across the genome, suggesting that they may contain important large effect regulatory factors. The differential patterns of epistasis across different traits suggests that detection of epistatic interactions is robust when correcting for background additive and epistatic effects in the population. The low resolution epistasis mapping method presented here identifies important epistatic interactions with a limited number of statistical tests at the cost of relatively lower precision.",

Why or whether Africa was the source region of modern humans and what caused their spread remains subject of ongoing debate. We present a spatially explicit, stochastic numerical model that includes ongoing mutations, demic diffusion, assortative mating and migration waves. Diffusion and assortative mating alone result in a structured population with relatively homogeneous regions bound by sharp clines. The addition of migration waves results in a power-law distribution of wave areas: for every large wave, many more small waves are expected to occur. This suggests that one or more out-of-Africa migrations would probably have been accompanied by numerous smaller migration waves across the world. The migration waves are considered \\\"spontaneous\\\", as the current model excludes environmental or other factors. Large waves preferentially emanate from the central areas of large, compact inhabited areas. During the Pleistocene, Africa was the largest such area most of the time, making Africa the statistically most likely origin of anatomically modern humans, without a need to invoke additional environmental or ecological drivers.",

    "abstract": "There are two disparate views regarding phenotypic plasticity. One regards plasticity as a derived adaptation to help organisms survive in variable environments1, 2 while the other views plasticity as the outcome of flexible, non-canalized, developmental processes, ancestrally present in most organisms, that helps them colonize or adapt to novel environments3-5 e.g., a pre-adaptation. Both views of plasticity currently lack a rigorous, mechanistic examination of ancestral and derived states and direction of change2. Here we show that the origin of phenotypic plasticity in eyespot size in response to environmental temperature observed in Bicyclus anynana butterflies is a derived adaptation of this lineage. Eyespot size is regulated by temperature-mediated changes in levels of a steroid hormone, 20E, that affects proliferation of eyespot central cells expressing the 20E receptor (EcR)6, 7. By estimating the origin of the known physiological and molecular components of eyespot size plasticity in a comparative framework, we showed that 20E titer plasticity in response to temperature is a pre-adaptation shared by all butterfly species examined, whereas the origin of expression of EcR in eyespot centers, and the origin of eyespot sensitivity to the hormone-receptor complex are both derived traits found only in a subset of species with eyespots. The presence of all three molecular components required to produce a plastic response is only observed in B. anynana. This gradual, step-wise, physiological/molecular response to temperature is a likely adaptation to temperature variation experienced across wet and dry seasons in the habitat of this species. This work supports, thus, the first view of plasticity as a derived adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Haplotype aware genome assembly plays an important role in genetics, medicine, and various other disciplines, yet generation of haplotype-resolved de novo assemblies remains a major challenge. Beyond distinguishing between errors and true sequential variants, one needs to assign the true variants to the different genome copies. Recent work has pointed out that the enormous quantities of traditional NGS read data have been greatly underexploited in terms of haplotig computation so far, which reflects that methodology for reference independent haplotig computation has not yet reached maturity. We present POLYTE (POLYploid genome fitTEr) as a new approach to de novo generation of haplotigs for diploid and polyploid genomes. Our method follows an iterative scheme where in each iteration reads or contigs are joined, based on their interplay in terms of an underlying haplotype-aware overlap graph. Along the iterations, contigs grow while preserving their haplotype identity. Benchmarking experiments on both real and simulated data demonstrate that POLYTE establishes new standards in terms of error-free reconstruction of haplotype-specific sequence. As a consequence, POLYTE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in various relevant aspects, where advantages become particularly distinct in polyploid settings.

    "abstract": "The microbiome is an integral component of many animal species, potentially affecting behaviour, physiology, and other biological properties. Despite this importance, bacterial communities remain vastly understudied in many groups of invertebrates, including mites. Quill mites (Acariformes: Syringophilidae) are a poorly known group of permanent bird ectoparasites that occupy quills of feathers and feed on bird subcutaneous tissue and fluids. Most species have strongly female biased sex ratios and it was hypothesized that this is caused by endosymbiotic bacteria. Their peculiar lifestyle further makes them potential vectors for bird diseases. Previously, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and a high diversity of Wolbachia strains were detected in quill mites via targeted PCR screens. Here, we use an unbiased 16S amplicon sequencing approach to determine other Bacteria that potentially impact quill mite biology.\\n\\nWe performed 16S V4 amplicon sequencing of 126 quill mite individuals from eleven species parasitizing twelve bird species (four families) of passeriform birds. In addition to Wolbachia, we found Spiroplasma as potential symbiont of quill mites. Interestingly, consistently high Spiroplasma titres were only found in individuals of two mite species associated with finches of the genus Cardfuelis, suggesting a history of horizontal transfers of Spiroplasma via the bird host. Furthermore, there was evidence for Spiroplasma negatively affecting Wolbachia titres. We found no evidence for the previously reported Anaplasma in quill mites, but detected the potential pathogens Brucella and Bartonella at low abundances. Other amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) could be assigned to a diverse number of bacterial taxa, including several that were previously isolated from bird skin. We observed a relatively uniform distribution of these ASVs across mite taxa and bird hosts, i.e, there was a lack of host-specificity for most detected ASVs. Further, many frequently found ASVs were assigned to taxa that show a very broad distribution with no strong prior evidence for symbiotic association with animals. We interpret these findings as evidence for a scarcity or lack of resident microbial associates (other than inherited symbionts) in quill mites, or for abundances of these taxa below our detection threshold.",

    "abstract": "Human-robot interaction (HRI) for gait rehabilitation could benefit from data-driven, subject-specific gait models that account for gait phases and gait dynamics. Here we address the current limitation in gait models driven by averaged kinematic data, which do not model interlimb gait dynamics and have not been shown to precisely identify gait events. We used Switched Linear Dynamical Systems (SLDS) to model joint angle kinematic data from healthy individuals walking on a treadmill during normal gait and during gait perturbed by electrical muscle stimulation. We compared model-inferred gait phases to gait phases measured independently via a force plate. We found that SLDS models accounted for over 88% of the variation in each joint angle and labeled the joint kinematics with the correct gait phase with 84% precision on average. The transitions between hidden states matched measured gait events, with a median absolute difference of 25ms. To our knowledge, this is the first time that SLDS inferred gait phases have been validated by an external measure of gait, instead of against pre-defined gait phase durations. SLDS provide individual-specific representations of gait that incorporate both gait phases and gait dynamics. SLDS may be useful for developing control policies for HRI aimed at improving gait by allowing for changes in control to be precisely timed to different gait phases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOsteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic connective tissue disorder characterized by increased bone fragility and recurrent fractures. The phenotypic severity of OI has a significant influence on the ability to walk but little is known about the ambulatory characteristics, strength, or functional abilities in individuals with OI, especially in the more severe forms. To advance clinical research in OI, the Linked Clinical Research Centers, network of clinical centers in North America with significant experience in treating patients with OI, was established in 2009. The purpose of this work was to characterize mobility in OI using standard clinical assessment tools. and determine if any patient characteristics could be used to predict mobility outcomes.\\n\\nMethodsData were collected at five clinical sites and included age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, use of assistive device, and bisphosphonate use and mobility metrics (age at first walk, Gillette Functional Assessment Questionnaire, Functional Mobility Scale, and distance walked in the 6 minute walk test). Linear mixed models were developed to explore the relationships between subject demographics and mobility metrics.\\n\\nResultsThe study identified 491 individuals age 3 and older. In general, the results showed minor limitations in the type I group while the more severe types showed more significant limitations in all mobility metrics analyzed. Height and weight were shown to be the most significant predictors of mobility metrics. Relationships with mobility and bisphosphonates varied with OI type and whether oral or IV was used.\\n\\nConclusionThis paper is the most comprehensive report of mobility in individuals with OI to date. These results are vital to understanding the mobility limitations of specific types of OI and beneficial when developing rehabilitation protocols for this population. It is important for physicians, patients, and caregivers to gain insight into severity and classification of the disease and the influence of disease-related characteristics on the prognosis for mobility.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing has led to the discovery of many transcript isoforms created by alternative splicing, but the translational status and functional significance of most alternative splicing events remain unknown. Here we applied a splice junction-centric approach to survey the landscape of protein alternative isoform expression in the human proteome. We focused on alternative splice events where pairs of splice junctions corresponding to included and excluded exons with appreciable read counts are translated together into selective protein sequence databases. Using this approach, we constructed tissue-specific FASTA databases from ENCODE RNA sequencing data, then reanalyzed splice junction peptides in existing mass spectrometry datasets across 10 human tissues (heart, lung, liver, pancreas, ovary, testis, colon, prostate, adrenal gland, and esophagus). Our analysis reidentified 1,108 non-canonical isoforms annotated in SwissProt. We further found 253 novel splice junction peptides in 212 genes that are not documented in the comprehensive Uniprot TrEMBL or Ensembl RefSeq databases. On a proteome scale, non-canonical isoforms differ from canonical sequences preferentially at sequences with heightened protein disorder, suggesting a functional consequence of alternative splicing on the proteome is the regulation of intrinsically disordered regions. We further observed examples where isoform-specific regions intersect with important cardiac protein phosphorylation sites. Our results reveal previously unidentified protein isoforms and may avail efforts to elucidate the functions of splicing events and expand the pool of observable biomarkers in profiling studies.\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations",

    "abstract": "Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) decline over the past 25 years has received considerable public and scientific attention, in large part because its decline, and that of its milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plant, have been linked to genetically modified (GM) crops and the associated herbicide use. Therefore, the monarch has emerged as a poster child for the anti-GM movement. Here we use museum and herbaria specimens to extend our knowledge of the dynamics of both monarchs and milkweeds in the United States to more than a century, from 1900-2016. We show that monarch population trends closely follow those of their milkweed hosts; that both monarchs and milkweeds increased during the early 20th century, and that recent declines are actually part of a much longer term decline in both monarchs and milkweed beginning around 1950. Herbicide resistant crops, therefore, are clearly not the only culprit, and likely not even the primary culprit, as these declines began decades before GM crops were introduced.",

    "abstract": "Epistasis is a common feature of genotype-phenotype maps. Understanding the patterns of epistasis is critical for predicting unmeasured phenotypes, explaining evolutionary trajectories, and for inferring the biological mechanisms that determine a map. One common approach is to use a linear model to decompose epistasis into specific pairwise and high-order interactions between mutations. Such interactions are then used to identify important biology or to explain how the genotype-phenotype map shapes evolution. Here we show that the coefficients extracted from such analyses are likely uninterpretable. They cannot be extracted reliably from experimental genotype-phenotype maps due to regression bias. Further, we can generate epistatic \\\"interactions\\\" indistinguishable from those in experimental maps using a completely random process. From this, we conclude that epistasis should be treated as a random, but quantifiable, variation in these maps. This perspective allows us to build predictive models with known error from a small number of measured phenotypes. It also suggests that we need mechanistic, nonlinear models to account for epistasis and decompose genotype-phenotype maps.",

    "abstract": "The role of large, rare copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders is well-established,1-5 but their contribution to common psychiatric disorders, such as depression, remains unclear. We have previously shown that a substantial proportion of CNV enrichment in schizophrenia is explained by CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.6, 7 Depression shares genetic risk with schizophrenia8, 9 and is frequently comorbid with neurodevelopmental disorders10, 11, suggesting to us the hypothesis that if CNVs play a role in depression, neurodevelopmental CNVs are those most likely to be associated. We confirmed this in UK Biobank by showing that neurodevelopmental CNVs were associated with depression (24,575 cases, 5.87%; OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.22-1.51, p=1.61x10-8), whilst finding no evidence implicating other CNVs. Four individual neurodevelopmental CNVs increased risk of depression (1q21.1 duplication, PWS duplication, 16p13.11 deletion, 16p11.2 duplication). The association between neurodevelopmental CNVs and depression was partially explained by social deprivation but not by education attainment or physical illness.",

    "abstract": "Typicality, or averageness, is one of the key features that influences face evaluation, but the role of this property in the perception of facial expressions of emotions is still not fully understood. Typical faces are usually considered more pleasant and trustworthy, and neuroimaging results suggest typicality modulates amygdala and fusiform activation, influencing face perception. At the same time, there is evidence that arousal is a key affective feature that modulates neural reactivity to emotional expressions. In this sense, it remains unclear whether the neural effects of typicality depend on altered perceptions of affect from facial expressions or if the effects of typicality and affect independently modulate face processing. The goal of this work was to dissociate the effects of typicality and affective properties, namely valence and arousal, in electrophysiological responses and self-reported ratings across several facial expressions of emotion. Two ERP components relevant for face processing were measured, the N170 and Vertex Positive Potential (VPP), complemented by subjective ratings of typicality, valence, and arousal, in a sample of 30 healthy young adults (21 female). The results point out to a modulation of the electrophysiological responses by arousal, regardless of the typicality or valence properties of the face. These findings suggest that previous findings of neural responses to typicality may be better explained by accounting for the subjective perception of arousal in facial expressions.",

    "abstract": "Depression is characterized by a marked decrease in social interactions and blunted sensitivity to rewards. Surprisingly, despite the importance of social deficits in depression, non-social aspects have been disproportionally investigated. As a consequence, the cognitive mechanisms underlying atypical decision-making in social contexts in depression are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate whether deficits in reward processing interact with the social context and how this interaction is affected by self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms. Two cohorts of subjects (discovery and replication sample: N = 50 each) took part in a task involving reward learning in a social context with different levels of social information (absent, partial and complete). Behavioral analyses revealed a specific detrimental effect of depressive symptoms - but not anxiety - on behavioral performance in the presence of social information, i.e. when participants were informed about the choices of another player. Model-based analyses further characterized the computational nature of this deficit as a negative audience effect, rather than a deficit in the way others choices and rewards are integrated in decision making. To conclude, our results shed light on the cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying the interaction between social cognition, reward learning and decision-making in depressive disorders.",

After specifying a few parameters in a small set of user-friendly functions, COMPASS allows the user to efficiently fit of a wide range of computational behavioral models. The model output can be analyzed as an experimental outcome or used as a regressor for neural data, and can be tested using goodness-of-fit methods. Here, we demonstrate that COMPASS can replicate two computational behavior analyses from different groups. COMPASS replicates and, in one case, slightly improves on the original modeling results.

We demonstrate that ISETBio-derived CSFs agree well with CSFs derived using traditional ideal observer approaches, when the mosaic, optics, and inference engine are matched. Further simulations extend earlier work by considering more realistic cone mosaics, more recent measurements of human physiological optics, and the effect of varying the inference engine used to link visual representations to psy-chohysical performance. Relative to earlier calculations, our simulations show that the spatial structure of realistic cone mosaics reduces upper bounds on performance at low spatial frequencies, whereas realistic optics derived from modern wavefront measurements lead to increased upper bounds high spatial frequencies. Finally, we demonstrate that the type of inference engine used has a substantial effect on the absolute level of predicted performance. Indeed, the performance gap between an ideal observer with exact knowledge of the relevant signals and human observers is greatly reduced when the inference engine has to learn aspects of the visual task. ISETBio-derived estimates of stimulus representations at different stages along the visual pathway provide a powerful tool for computing the limits of human performance.",

    "abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most deleterious lesions DNA can endure. Yet, DSBs are programmed at the onset of meiosis and are required to facilitate appropriate reduction of ploidy in daughter cells. Repair of these break is tightly controlled to favor homologous recombination (HR), the only repair pathway that can form crossovers.\\n\\nHowever, little is known about how the activities of alternative repair pathways are regulated at these stages. We discovered an unexpected synthetic interaction between the DSB machinery and strand-exchange proteins. Depleting the C. elegans DSB-promoting factors HIM-5 and DSB-2 suppresses the formation of chromosome fusions that arise in the absence of RAD-51 or other strand-exchange mediators. Our investigations reveal that non-homologous and theta-mediated end joining (c-NHEJ and TMEJ, respectively) and single strand annealing (SSA) function redundantly to repair DSBs when HR is compromised and that HIM-5 influences the utilization of TMEJ and SSA.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/376582_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e6a89org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1145d1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eccd82org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a82e7d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation is often a product of environmental variations in the geographical space and has implications for biodiversity conservation. We investigated the role of latitudinal heterogeneity in climate on the organization of genetic and phenotypic variation in the dominant coastal tree, Avicennia schaueriana. In a common garden experiment, samples from an equatorial region, marked by rainy/dry seasons, accumulated less biomass, showed lower stomatal conductance and transpiration, narrower xylem vessels, smaller leaves and higher reflectance of long wavelengths (red light) on the stem epidermis, than samples from a subtropical region, marked by warm/cold seasons. Transcriptome differences identified between trees sampled under field conditions at equatorial and subtropical sites, were enriched in functional categories as responses to temperature, solar radiation, water deficit, photosynthesis and cell wall biosynthesis. The diversity based on thousands of SNP loci revealed a north-south genetic structure. Remarkably, signatures of selection were identified in loci associated with photosynthesis, anthocyanin accumulation and the responses to osmotic and hypoxia stresses. Our results suggest the existence of divergence in key resource-use characteristics, likely driven by climate seasonality, based on water-deficit and solar radiation. These findings provide a basis for conservation plans and for predictions for coastal plant responses to climate change.",

The root cap is known to sense environmental cues, making it a relevant candidate for a mechanosensing site. An original two-layer medium was developed in order to study root responses to growth medium strength and the importance of the root cap in the establishment of these responses. Root growth and trajectory of primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were investigated using in vivo image analysis. After contact with the harder layer, the root either penetrated it or underwent rapid curvature, enabling reorientation of the root primary growth. The role of the root cap in tip reorientation was investigated by analyzing the responses of Arabidopsis mutant roots with altered caps. The primary root of fez-2 mutant lines, which has fewer root cap cell layers than wild-type roots, showed impaired penetration ability. Conversely, smb-3 roots of mutant lines, which display a higher number of root cap cells, showed enhanced penetration abilities. This work highlights that alterations in root cap shape and size affect the root responses to medium strength.\\n\\nHighlightThe analysis of the growth and orientation of Arabidopsis thaliana mutant roots affected in root cap size and shape showed that properly formed root cap is required to trigger the root responses to medium strength.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Epicuticular waxes, long-chain hydrocarbon compounds, form the outermost layer of plant surfaces in most terrestrial plants. The presence of epicuticular waxes protects plants from water loss and other environmental stresses. Cloning and characterization of genes involved in the regulation, biosynthesis, and extracellular transport of epicuticular waxes on to the surface of epidermal cells have revealed the molecular basis of epicuticular wax accumulation. However, intracellular trafficking of synthesized waxes to the plasma membrane for cellular secretion is poorly understood. Here, we characterized a maize glossy (gl6) mutant that exhibited decreased epicuticular wax load, increased cuticle permeability, and reduced seedling drought tolerance relative to wild type. We combined an RNA-sequencing based mapping approach (BSR-Seq) and chromosome walking to identify the gl6 candidate gene, which was confirmed via the analysis of multiple independent mutant alleles. The gl6 gene represents a novel maize glossy gene containing a conserved, but uncharacterized domain. Functional characterization suggests that the GL6 protein may be involved in the intracellular trafficking of epicuticular waxes, opening a door to elucidating the poorly understood process by which epicuticular wax is transported from its site of biosynthesis to the plasma membrane.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPlant surface waxes provide an essential protective barrier for terrestrial plants. Understanding the composition and physiological functions of surface waxes, as well as the molecular basis underlying wax accumulation on plant surfaces provides opportunities for the genetic optimization of this protective layer. Genetic studies have identified genes involved in wax biosynthesis, extracellular transport, as well as spatial and temporal regulation of wax accumulation. In this study, a maize mutant, gl6 was characterized that exhibited reduced wax load on plant surfaces, increased water losses, and reduced seedling drought tolerance compared to wild type controls. The gl6 gene is a novel gene harboring a conserved domain with an unknown function. Quantification and microscopic observation of wax accumulation as well as subcellular localization of the GL6 protein provided evidence that gl6 may be involved in the intracellular trafficking of waxes, opening a door for studying this necessary yet poorly understood process for wax loading on plant surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Herbivore-induced plant volatiles prime plant defenses and resistance. How volatiles are integrated into early defense signaling is not well understood. Furthermore, whether there is a causal relationship between volatile defense priming and herbivore resistance is unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of indole, a common herbivore-induced plant volatile and known defense priming cue, on early defense signaling and herbivore resistance in rice. We show that rice plants infested by Spodoptera frugiperda caterpillars release up to 25 ng*h-1. Exposure to equal doses of synthetic indole enhances rice resistance to S. frugiperda. Screening of early signaling components reveals that indole directly enhances the expression of the receptor like kinase OsLRR-RLK1. Furthermore, indole specifically primes the transcription, accumulation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK3 as well as the expression of the downstream WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY70 and several jasmonate biosynthesis genes, resulting in a higher accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA). Using transgenic plants defective in early signaling, we show that OsMPK3 is required, and that OsMPK6 and OsWRKY70 contribute to indole-mediated defense priming of JA-dependent herbivore resistance. We conclude that volatiles can increase herbivore resistance of plants by priming early defense signaling components.",

    "abstract": "The skeleton is able to adapt to mechanical loading through bone remodeling, i.e. bone resorption followed by bone formation. The osteoclasts close to microdamages are believed to initiate bone resorption, but whether local mechanical loading such as fluid flow regulates recruitment and differentiation of osteoclast precursors at the site of bone resorption has yet to be investigated. In the present study, finite element analysis first revealed that there exists low fluid shear stress (FSS) field inside microdamage. Basing on a custom-made device of cone-and-plate fluid chamber, finite element analysis and particle image velocimetry measurement were performed to verify the formation of gradient FSS flow field. Furthermore, the effects of gradient FSS on the migration, aggregation, and fusion of osteoclast precursors were observed. Results showed that osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells migrate along radial direction toward the region with lower FSS during exposure to gradient FSS stimulation for 40 min, obviously deviating from the direction of actual fluid flow indicated by fluorescent particles. When inhibiting calcium signaling pathway with gadolinium and thapsigargin, cell migration toward low-FSS region was significantly reduced. For other cell lines, MC3T3-E1, PDLF, rMSC and MDCK, gradient FSS stimulation did not lead to the low-FSS-inclined migration. After being cultured under gradient FSS stimulation for 6 days, the density of RAW264.7 cells and the ratio of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts in low-FSS region were significantly higher than those in high-FSS region. Therefore, osteoclast precursor cells may have special ability to sense FSS gradient and tend to actively migrate toward low-FSS region, which is regulated by calcium signaling pathway.",

The SecY complex (SecYEG) in bacteria forms a membrane channel responsible for protein translocation. This work demonstrates that weakening the sealability of the SecY channel allowed free diffusion of sugars, including glucose, fructose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, and lactose, into the engineered cells, facilitating its rapid growth on a wide spectrum of monosaccharides and bypassing/reducing stereospecificity, transport saturation, competitive inhibition, and carbon catabolite repression (CCR), which are usually encountered with the specific sugar transporters. The SecY channel is structurally conserved in prokaryotes, thus it may be engineered to serve as a unique and universal transporter for bacteria to passage sugars as demonstrated in Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum.",

As a model system, we used renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common malignant kidney tumor which canonically activates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) pathway. We performed genome-wide chromatin accessibility and transcriptome profiling on paired tumor/normal samples and found that numerous transcription factors with a RCC-selective expression pattern also demonstrated evidence of HIF binding in the vicinity of their gene body. Some of these transcription factors influenced the tumors regulatory landscape, notably the stem cell transcription factor POU5F1 (OCT4). Unexpectedly, we discovered a HIF-pathway-responsive cryptic promoter embedded within a human-specific retroviral repeat element that drives POU5F1 expression in RCC via a novel transcript. Elevat POU5F1 expression levels were correlated with advanced tumor stage and poorer overall survival in RCC patients. Thus, integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of even a small number of primary patient samples revealed remarkably convergent shared regulatory landscapes and a novel mechanism for dysregulated expression of POU5F1 in RCC.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositide lipids provide spatial landmarks during polarized secretion. Here, we elucidate a role for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) metabolism in the control of cell polarity. In budding yeast, PI4P is enriched at the plasma membrane of growing daughter cells. Upon heat shock however, PI4P rapidly increases at the plasma membrane in mother cells resulting in a more uniform PI4P distribution. Rather than phosphoinositide kinase activation, PI4P hydrolysis is impaired to generate the heat-induced PI4P signal in mother cells. This fine tune control of PI4P metabolism is mediated through attenuation of the Osh3 protein that binds and presents PI4P to a phosphoinositide phosphatase. Importantly, Osh3 undergoes phase transitions upon environmental stress conditions, resulting in intracellular aggregates and reduced cortical localization. The chaperone Hsp104 co-assembles with intracellular Osh3 granules, but is not required for their formation. Interestingly, the Osh3 GOLD domain, also present in the ER-localized p24 cargo adaptor family, is sufficient to form stress granules. Accordingly, GOLD-mediated phase transitions may provide a general mechanism to modulate secretion and growth upon transient changes in physiological and environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Congenital toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease that occurs due vertical transmission of the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) during pregnancy. The parasite crosses the placental barrier and reaches the developing brain, infecting progenitor, glial, neuronal and vascular cell types. Although the role of Radial glia (RG) neural stem cells in the development of the brain vasculature has been recently investigated, the impact of T. gondii infection in these events is not yet understood. Herein, we studied the role of T. gondii infection on RG cell function and its interaction with endothelial cells. By infecting isolated RG cells with T. gondii tachyzoites, we observed reduced cell proliferation and neurogenesis without affecting gliogenesis levels. Conditioned medium (CM) from RG control cultures increased ZO-1 and {beta}-catenin protein levels and organization on endothelial bEnd.3 cells membranes, which was completely impaired by CM from infected RG, resulting in decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Cytokine Bead Array and ELISA assays revealed the presence of increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and reduced levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}1 in CM from T.gondii-infected RG cells. Treatment with recombinant TGF-{beta}1 concomitantly with CM from infected RG cultures led to restoration of ZO-1 staining in bEnd.3 cells. Our results suggest that infection of RG cells by T. gondii modulate cytokine secretion, which might contribute to endothelial loss of barrier properties, thus leading to impairment of neurovascular interaction establishment.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are resident immune cells that play critical roles in maintaining normal physiology of the central nervous system. Remarkably, microglia have intrinsic capacity to replenish after being acutely ablated. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive such microglial restoration remain elusive. Here, we removed microglia via CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 and characterized repopulation both spatially and temporally. We also investigated the cellular origin of repopulated microglia and report that microglia are replenished via self-renewal, with little contribution from non-microglial lineage progenitors, including nestin+ progenitors and the circulating myeloid population. Interestingly, spatial analyses with multi-color labeling reveal that newborn microglia recolonize the parenchyma by forming distinctive clusters that maintain stable territorial boundaries over time, indicating proximal expansion nature of adult microgliogenesis and stability of microglia tiling. Temporal transcriptome profiling from newborn microglia at different repopulation stages revealed that the adult newborn microglia gradually regain steady-state maturity from an immature state that is reminiscent of neonatal stage and follow a series of maturation programs that include NF-{kappa}B activation, interferon immune activation and apoptosis, etc. Importantly, we show that the restoration of microglial homeostatic density requires NF-{kappa}B signaling as well as apoptotic egress of excessive cells. In summary, our study reports key events that take place from microgliogenesis to homeostasis re-establishment.",

    "abstract": "Modularity is an aspect of a decomposable system with a coordinating authority that acts as a glue which holds the loosely held components. These multi-component entities (\\\"modules\\\") facilitate rewiring into different designs allowing for change. Such modular character is a fundamental property of many biological entities, especially the family of megasynthases such as polyketide synthases (PKSs). The ability of these PKSs to produce diverse product spectra is strongly coupled to their broad architectural modularity. Decoding the molecular basis of modularity, i.e. identifying the folds and domains that comprise the modules as well as understanding constrains of the assembly of modules, is of utmost importance for harnessing megasynthases for the synthesis of designer compounds. In this study, we exploit the close semblance between PKSs and animal FAS to re-engineer animal FAS to probe the modularity of the FAS/PKS family. Guided by structural and sequence information, we truncate and dissect animal FAS into its components, and reassemble them to generate new PKS-like modules as well as bimodular constructs. The novel engineered modules resemble all four common module types of PKSs and demonstrate that this approach can be a powerful tool to create higher catalytic efficiency. Our data exemplify the inherent plasticity and robustness of the overall FAS/PKS fold, and open new avenues to explore FAS-based biosynthetic pathways for custom compound design.",

Its essential functionality--co-translational protein-targeting/delivery to cellular membranes-- hinges on the RNA attaining a native long-hairpin fold that facilitates protein conformational rearrangements within the SRP complex.

This analysis allows identification of folding intermediates adopted during the real-time co-transcriptional folding of SRP RNA.

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of mitochondrial gene expression, caused by mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes, is associated with a diverse group of human disorders characterized by impaired mitochondrial respiration. Within this group, an increasing number of mutations have been identified in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. For instance, pathogenic mutations have been identified in the genes encoding enzymes involved in the precursor transcript processing, including ELAC2. The ELAC2 gene codes for the mitochondrial RNase Z, which is responsible for endonucleolytic cleavage of the 3 ends of mitochondrial pre-tRNAs. Here, we report the identification of sixteen novel ELAC2 variants in individuals presenting with mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis. We provided further evidence for the pathogenicity of the three previously reported variants by studying the RNase Z activity in an in vitro system and applied this recombinant system to investigate all novel missense variants, confirming the pathogenic role of these new ELAC2 mutations. We also modelled the residues affected by missense mutation in solved RNase Z structures, providing insight into enzyme structure and function. Finally, we show that primary fibroblasts from the individuals with novel ELAC2 variants have elevated levels of unprocessed mitochondrial RNA precursors. Our study thus broadly confirms the correlation of ELAC2 variants with severe infantile-onset forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. One rare missense variant associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer (p.Arg781His) impairs the mitochondrial RNase Z activity of ELAC2, possibly indicating a functional link between tumorigenesis and mitochondrial RNA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The neocortex is organized into distinct areas, whose interconnectivity underlies sensorimotor transformations and integration1-7. These behaviorally critical functions are mediated by intracortically-projecting neurons (ICPN), which are a heterogeneous population of cells sending axonal branches to distinct cortical areas as well as to subcortical targets8-10. Although population-based11-14 and single-cell15-19 intracortical wiring diagrams are being identified, the transcriptional signatures corresponding to single-cell axonal projections of ICPN to multiple sites remain unknown. To address this question, we developed a high-throughput approach, \\\"ConnectID\\\", to link connectome and transcriptome in single neurons. ConnectID combines MAPseq projection mapping17,20 (to identify single-neuron multiplex projections) with single-cell RNA sequencing (to identify corresponding gene expression). Using primary somatosensory cortex (S1) ICPN as proof-of-principle neurons, we identify three cardinal targets: (1) the primary motor cortex (M1), (2) the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and (3) subcortical targets (Sub). Using ConnectID, we identify transcriptional modules whose combined activities reflect multiplex projections to these cardinal targets. Based on these findings, we propose that the combinatorial activity of connectivity-defined transcriptional modules serves as a generic molecular mechanism to create diverse axonal projection patterns within and across neuronal cell types.",

While such mosaic ensures the balanced activity of the two pathways, how it emerges remains largely unknown. Here, we show that both SPN populations are specified embryonically and progressively intermix through multidirectional iSPN migration. Using conditional mutants of the dSPN-specific transcription factor Ebf1, we found that inactivating this gene impaired selective dSPN properties, including axon pathfinding, whereas molecular and functional features of iSPN were preserved. Remarkably, Ebf1 mutation disrupted iSPN/dSPN intermixing, resulting in an uneven distribution. Such architectural defect was selective of the matrix compartment, revealing that intermixing is a parallel process to compartment formation. Our study reveals that, while iSPN/dSPN specification is largely independent, their intermingling emerges from an active migration of iSPN, thereby providing a novel framework for the building of striatal architecture.",

    "abstract": "Marine ecosystems are characterized by an intricate set of interactions among their representatives. One of the most important occurs through the exchange of dissolved organic matter (DOM) provided by phototrophs and used by heterotrophic bacteria as their main carbon and energy source. This metabolic interaction represents the foundation of the entire ocean food-web.\\n\\nHere we have assembled a synthetic ecosystem to assist the systems-level investigation of this biological association. This was achieved building an integrated, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction using two model organisms (a diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and an heterotrophic bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis) to explore and predict their metabolic interdependencies. The model was initially analysed using a constraint-based approach (Flux Balance Analysis, FBA) and then turned into a dynamic (dFBA) model to simulate a diatom-bacteria co-culture and to study the effect of changes in growth parameters on such a system. Finally, we developed a simpler dynamic ODEs system that, fed with dFBA results, was able to qualitatively describe this synthetic ecosystem and allowed performing stochastic simulations to assess the effect of noise on the overall balance of this co-culture.\\n\\nWe show that our model recapitulates known metabolic cross-talks of a phototroph-heterotroph system, including mutualism and competition for inorganic ions (i.e. phosphate and sulphate). Further, the dynamic simulation predicts realistic growth rate for both the diatom and the bacterium and a steady state balance between diatom and bacterial cell concentration that matches those determined in experimental co-cultures. This steady state, however, is reached following an oscillatory trend, a behaviour that is typically observed in the presence of metabolic co-dependencies. Finally, we show that, at high diatom/bacteria cell concentration ratio, stochastic fluctuations can lead to the extinction of bacteria from the co-culture, causing the explosion of diatom population. We anticipate that the developed synthetic ecosystem will serve in the future as a basis for the generation of testable hypotheses and as a scaffold for integrating and interpreting-omics data from experimental co-cultures.",

Although TZDs have potent antidiabetic effects, they also display harmful side effects that have necessitated a better understanding of their mechanisms of action. In particular, little is known about the effect of in vivo TZD metabolites on the structure and function of PPAR{gamma}. Here, we present a structure-function comparison of Pio and a major in vivo metabolite, 1-hydroxypioglitazone (PioOH). PioOH displayed a lower binding affinity and reduced potency in coregulator recruitment assays compared to Pio. To determine the structural basis of these findings, we solved an X-ray crystal structure of PioOH bound to PPAR{gamma} ligand-binding domain (LBD) and compared it to a published Pio-bound crystal structure. PioOH exhibited an altered hydrogen bonding network that could underlie its reduced affinity and potency compared to Pio. Solution-state structural analysis using NMR spectroscopy and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis revealed that PioOH stabilizes the PPAR{gamma} activation function-2 (AF-2) coactivator binding surface better than Pio. In support of AF-2 stabilization, PioOH displayed stabilized coactivator binding in biochemical assays and better transcriptional efficacy (maximal transactivation response) in a cell-based assay that reports on the activity of the PPAR{gamma} LBD. These results, which indicate that Pio hydroxylation affects both its potency and efficacy as a PPAR{gamma} agonist, contribute to our understanding of PPAR{gamma}-binding drug metabolite interactions and may assist in future PPAR{gamma} drug design efforts.",

Yet it remains unclear whether these fluctuations can persist for much longer than the time of one cell division. Current methods for measuring gene expression in single cells mostly rely on single time point measurements, making the duration of gene expression fluctuations or cellular memory difficult to measure. Here, we report a method combining Luria and Delbrucks fluctuation analysis with population-based RNA sequencing (MemorySeq) for identifying genes transcriptome-wide whose fluctuations persist for several cell divisions. MemorySeq revealed multiple gene modules that are expressed together in rare cells within otherwise homogeneous clonal populations. Further, we found that these rare cell subpopulations are associated with biologically distinct behaviors, such as the ability to proliferate in the face of anti-cancer therapeutics, in different cancer cell lines. The identification of non-genetic, multigenerational fluctuations has the potential to reveal new forms of biological memory at the level of single cells and suggests that non-genetic heritability of cellular state may be a quantitative property.",

    "abstract": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin positive interneurons (PV-INs) are essential for controlling network firing and the gain of the cortical response to sensory stimulation. Crucial for these functions, PV-INs can sustain high frequency firing with no accommodation. However, PV-INs also exhibit short-term depression (STD) during sustained activation, which is largely due to the depletion of synaptic resources (vesicles). In most synapses the rate of replenishment of depleted vesicles is constant, determining an inverse relationship between the STD level and the activation rate, which theoretically, severely limits rate coding capabilities. We examined STD of the PV-IN to pyramidal cell synapse in the mouse visual cortex, and found that in these synapses the recovery of depleted resources is not constant but increases linearly with the frequency of use. By combining modeling, dynamic clamp and optogenetics, we demonstrated that this dynamic regulation of recovery enables PV-INs to reduce pyramidal cell firing in a linear manner, which, theoretically, is crucial for controlling the gain of cortical visual responses.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has one of the highest deaths to incidence ratios. High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common and deadliest EOC histotype because of the lack of secondary therapeutic options following debulking surgery and platinum/taxane-based chemotherapies. For recurrent chemosensitive HGSOC, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi; olaparib, rucaparib, or niraparib) represent an emerging treatment strategy. While PARPi are most effective in homologous recombination DNA repair-deficient (HRD) HGSOCs, more recent studies have observed a significant clinical benefit in non-HRD HGSOCs. However, all HGSOC patients are likely to acquire resistance to PARPi. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need to better understand PARPi resistance, and to introduce novel combinatorial therapies to overcome PARPi resistance and extend HGSOC disease-free intervals. Utilizing a two BRCA2-mutated and one BRCA-wildtype HGSOC cell lines that are olaparib sensitive, we established resistant cells. Transcriptome analysis of the matched olaparib-sensitive versus resistant cells did not detect BRCA2 reversion mutations, but revealed activation of Wnt/TCF signaling pathway, as TCF transcriptional activity was significantly increased in PARPi-resistant cells. In parallel, forced activation of Wnt signaling in PARPi-sensitive cells via WNT3A stimulation reduced response to PARPi. In a recurrent-HGSOC PARPi insensitive patient-derived xenograft model there was an increase in a Wnt/TCF transcriptional target. PARPi resistant cells were sensitive to inhibition of Wnt signaling using the FDA-approved compound, pyrvinium pamoate, which has been shown to inhibit Wnt signaling. We observed that combining pyrvinium pamoate with olaparib resulted in a significant decrease in tumor burden and number of tumor nodules. This study demonstrates that Wnt signaling can mediate PARPi resistance in HGSOC and provides a clinical rationale for combining PARPi and Wnt inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar Purkinje cells integrate sensory information with motor efference copies to adapt movements to behavioural and environmental requirements. They produce complex spikes that are triggered by the activity of climbing fibres originating in neurons of the inferior olive. These complex spikes can shape the onset, amplitude and direction of movements as well as the adaptation of such movements to sensory feedback. Clusters of nearby inferior olive neurons project to parasagittally aligned stripes of Purkinje cells, referred to as \"microzones\". It is currently unclear to what extent individual Purkinje cells within a single microzone integrate climbing fibre inputs from multiple sources of different sensory origins, and to what extent sensory-evoked climbing fibre responses depend on the strength and recent history of activation. Here we imaged complex spike responses in cerebellar lobule crus 1 to various types of sensory stimulation in awake mice. We find that different sensory modalities and receptive fields have a mild, but consistent, tendency to converge on individual Purkinje cells. Purkinje cells encoding the same stimulus show increased events with coherent complex spike firing and tend to lie close together. Moreover, whereas complex spike firing is only mildly affected by variations in stimulus strength, it strongly depends on the recent history of climbing fibre activity. Our data point towards a mechanism in the olivo-cerebellar system that regulates complex spike firing during mono- or multisensory stimulation around a relatively low set-point, highlighting an integrative coding scheme of complex spike firing under homeostatic control.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases are complex disorders that exhibit their primary effects in energetically active tissues. Damage generated by mitochondria is also thought to be a key component of aging and age-related disease. An important model for mitochondrial dysfunction is the bang sensitive (bs) mutants in Drosophila melanogaster. Although these mutants all show a striking seizure phenotype, several bs mutants have gene products that are involved with mitochondrial function, while others affect excitability another way. All of the bs mutants (parabss, eas, jus, ses B, tko are examined here) paralyze and seize upon challenge with a sensory stimulus, most notably mechanical stimulation. These and other excitability mutants have been linked to neurodegeneration with age. In addition to these phenotypes, we have found age-related defects for several of the bs strains. The mutants eas, ses B, and tko display shortened lifespan, an increased mean recovery time from seizure with age, and decreased climbing ability over lifespan as compared to isogenic CS or w1118 lines.. Other mutants show a subset of these defects. The age-related phenotypes can be rescued by feeding melatonin, an antioxidant, in all the mutants except ses B. The age-related defects do not appear to be correlated with the seizure phenotype. Inducing seizures on a daily basis did not exacerbate the phenotypes and treatment with antiepileptic drugs did not increase lifespan. The results suggest that the excitability phenotypes and the age-related phenotypes may be somewhat independent and that these phenotypes mutants may arise from impacts on different pathways.",

    "abstract": "A growing literature conceptualises human brain development from a network perspective, but it remains unknown how functional brain networks are refined during the preschool years. The extant literature diverges in its characterisation of functional network development, with little agreement between haemodynamic- and electrophysiology-based measures. In children aged from 4 to 12 years, as well as adults, age appropriate magnetoencephalography was used to estimate unbiased network topology, using minimum spanning tree (MST) constructed from phase synchrony between beamformer-reconstructed time-series. During childhood, network topology becomes increasingly segregated, while cortical regions decrease in centrality. We propose a heuristic MST model, in which a clear developmental trajectory for the emergence of complex brain networks is delineated. Our results resolve topological reorganisation of functional networks across temporal and special scales in youth and fill a gap in the literature regarding neurophysiological mechanisms of functional brain maturation during the preschool years.",

    "abstract": "Memory impairments and cognitive decline persist long after recovery from major illness or injury, and correlate with increased risk of later dementia. Here we developed a subchronic peripheral immune challenge model to examine delayed and persistent memory impairments in females and in males. We show that intermittent injections of either lipopolysaccharide or Poly I:C cause memory decline in both sexes that are evident eight weeks after the immune challenge. Importantly, we observed sex-specific patterns of deficits. Females showed impairments in object recognition one week after challenge that persisted for at least eight weeks. In contrast, males had intact memory one week after the immune challenge but exhibited broad impairments in memory tasks including object recognition, and both context and tone fear conditioning several months later. The differential patterns of memory deficits in males and in females were observed without sustained microglial activation or changes in blood-brain barrier permeability. Together, these data suggest that transient neuroimmune activity results in differential vulnerabilities of females and males to memory decline after immune challenge. This model will be an important tool for determining the mechanisms in both sexes that contribute to memory impairments that develop over the weeks and months after recovery from illness. Future studies using this model will provide new insights into the role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of long-lasting memory decline and dementias.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in chronic pain and alcohol abuse are not well understood. The development of rodent models is imperative for investigating the underlying changes behind these pathological states. However, past attempts have failed to produce drinking outcomes similar to those reported in humans. In the present study, we investigated whether hind paw treatment with the inflammatory agent Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) could generate hyperalgesia and alter alcohol consumption in male and female C57BL/6J mice. CFA treatment led to greater nociceptive sensitivity for both sexes in the Hargreaves test, and increased alcohol drinking for males in a continuous access two-bottle choice (CA2BC) paradigm. Regardless of treatment, female mice exhibited greater alcohol drinking than males. Following a 2-hour terminal drinking session, CFA treatment failed to produce changes in alcohol drinking, blood ethanol concentration (BEC), and plasma corticosterone (CORT) for both sexes. 2-hr alcohol consumption and CORT was higher in females than males, irrespective of CFA treatment. Taken together, these findings have established that male mice are more susceptible to escalations in alcohol drinking when undergoing pain, despite higher levels of total alcohol drinking and CORT in females. Furthermore, the exposure of CFA-treated C57BL/6J mice to the CA2BC drinking paradigm has proven to be a useful model for studying the relationship between chronic pain and alcohol abuse. Future applications of the CFA/CA2BC model should incorporate manipulations of stress signaling and other related biological systems to improve our mechanistic understanding of pain and alcohol interactions.",

    "abstract": "Precise temporal control of gene expression in neuronal progenitors is necessary for correct regulation of neurogenesis and cell fate specification. However, the extensive cellular heterogeneity of the developing CNS has posed a major obstacle to identifying the gene regulatory networks that control these processes. To address this, we used single cell RNA-sequencing to profile ten developmental stages encompassing the full course of retinal neurogenesis. This allowed us to comprehensively characterize changes in gene expression that occur during initiation of neurogenesis, changes in developmental competence, and specification and differentiation of each of the major retinal cell types. These data identify transitions in gene expression between early and late-stage retinal progenitors, as well as a classification of neurogenic progenitors. We identify here the NFI family of transcription factors (Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix) as genes with enriched expression within late RPCs, and show they are regulators of bipolar interneuron and Muller glia specification and the control of proliferative quiescence.",
