    "abstract": "Artificial selection has produced varieties of domesticated maize which thrive in temperate climates around the world. However, the direct progenitor of maize, teosinte, is indigenous only to a relatively small range of tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and grows poorly or not at all outside of this region. Tripsacum, a sister genus to maize and teosinte, is naturally endemic to the majority of areas in the western hemisphere where maize is cultivated. A full-length reference transcriptome for Tripsacum dactyloides generated using long-read isoseq data was used to characterize independent adaptation to temperate climates in this clade. Genes related to phospholipid biosynthesis, a critical component of cold acclimation on other cold adapted plant lineages, were enriched among those genes experiencing more rapid rates of protein sequence evolution in T. dactyloides. In contrast with previous studies of parallel selection, we find that there is a significant overlap between the genes which were targets of artificial selection during the adaptation of maize to temperate climates and those which were targets of natural selection in temperate adapted T. dactyloides. This overlap between the targets of natural and artificial selection suggests genetic changes in crop-wild relatives associated with adaptation to new environments may be useful guides for identifying genetic targets for breeding efforts aimed at adapting crops to a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "A user ready, portable, documented software package, NFTsim, is presented to facilitate numerical simulations of a wide range of brain systems using continuum neural field modeling. NFTsim enables users to simulate key aspects of brain activity at multiple scales. At the microscopic scale, it incorporates characteristics of local interactions between cells, neurotransmitter effects, synaptodendritic delays and feedbacks. At the mesoscopic scale, it incorporates information about medium to large scale axonal ranges of fibers, which are essential to model dissipative wave transmission and to produce synchronous oscillations and associated cross-correlation patterns as observed in local field potential recordings of active tissue. At the scale of the whole brain, NFTsim allows for the inclusion of long range pathways, such as thalamocortical projections, when generating macroscopic activity fields. The multiscale nature of the neural activity produced by NFTsim has the potential to enable the modeling of resulting quantities measurable via various neuroimaging techniques. In this work, we give a comprehensive description of the design and implementation of the software. Due to its modularity and flexibility, NFTsim enables the systematic study of an unlimited number of neural systems with multiple neural populations under a unified framework and allows for direct comparison with analytic and experimental predictions. The code is written in C++ and bundled with Matlab routines for a rapid quantitative analysis and visualization of the outputs. The output of NFTsim is stored in plain text file enabling users to select from a broad range of tools for offline analysis. This software enables a wide and convenient use of powerful physiologically-based neural field approaches to brain modeling. NFTsim is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.",

    "abstract": "Summary StatementTemperature elevation increases the frequency of the heart and pyloric rhythms of the crab, Cancer borealis, but the heart rhythm has a higher critical temperature than the pyloric rhythm.\\n\\nAbstractThe heart and pyloric rhythms of crustaceans have been studied separately and extensively over many years. Local and hormonal neuromodulation and sensory inputs onto these central pattern generating circuits play a significant role in the animals responses to perturbations, but are usually lost or removed during in vitro studies. To examine simultaneously the in vivo motor output of the heart and pyloric rhythms, we used photoplethysmography (PPG). In the population measured (n = 49), the heart rhythm frequencies ranged from 0.3-2.3 Hz. The pyloric rhythms varied from 0.2-1.6 Hz. During multiple hour-long recordings, many animals held at control temperature showed strong inhibitory bouts in which the heart decreased in frequency or become quiescent and the pyloric rhythm also decreased in frequency. Many animals show significant coherence in frequency between the rhythms at the frequency of the heart rhythm. We measured the simultaneous responses of the rhythms to temperature ramps by heating or cooling the saline bath while recording both the heart and pyloric muscle movements. Q10s, critical temperatures (temperatures at which function is compromised), and changes in frequency were calculated for each of the rhythms tested. The heart rhythm was more robust to high temperature than the pyloric rhythm.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic molecular clusters are assembled through weak multivalent interactions and are platforms for cellular functions, especially receptor-mediated signaling. Clustering is also a prerequisite for liquid-liquid phase separation. But it is not well understood how molecular structure and cellular organization control clustering. Using coarse-grain kinetic Langevin dynamics, we performed computational experiments on a prototypical ternary system modeled after membrane-bound nephrin, the adaptor Nck1 and the actin nucleation promoting factor NWASP. Steady state cluster size distributions favored stoichiometries that optimized binding (stoichiometry matching), but still were quite broad. At high concentrations, the system can be driven beyond the saturation boundary such that cluster size is limited only by the number of available molecules. This behavior would be predictive of phase separation. Domains close to binding sites sterically inhibited clustering much less than terminal domains because the latter effectively restrict access to the cluster interior. Increased flexibility of interacting molecules diminished clustering by shielding binding sites within compact conformations. Membrane association of nephrin increased the cluster size distribution in a density-dependent manner. These properties provide insights into how molecular ensembles function to localize and amplify cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "A neuronal population encodes information most efficiently when its activity is uncorrelated and high-dimensional, and most robustly when its activity is correlated and lower-dimensional. Here, we analyzed the correlation structure of natural image coding, in large visual cortical populations recorded from awake mice. Evoked population activity was high dimensional, with correlations obeying an unexpected power-law: the nth principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This was not inherited from the 1/f spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that the variance spectrum must decay at least this fast if a population code is smooth, i.e. if small changes in input cannot dominate population activity. The theory also predicts larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness represents a fundamental constraint governing correlations in neural population codes.",

Individual transcription factors act simultaneously in multiple regions that develop very differently, raising questions about the extent to which their actions vary regionally. We found that the transcription factor Pax6 affects the transcriptomes and the balance between proliferation and differentiation in opposite directions in murine diencephalon versus cortex. We tested several possible mechanisms to explain Pax6s tissue-specific actions and found that the presence of the transcription factor Foxg1 in cortex but not diencephalon was most influential. We found that Foxg1 is responsible for many of the differences in cell cycle gene expression between diencephalon and cortex. In cortex lacking Foxg1, Pax6s action on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation became diencephalon-like. Our findings reveal a mechanism for generating regional forebrain diversity in which the actions of one transcription factor completely reverse the actions of another.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs a result of its simplicity and high efficiency, the CRISPR-Cas system has been widely used as a genome editing tool. Recently, CRISPR base editors, which consist of deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) or Cas9 nickase (nCas9) linked with a cytidine or a guanine deaminase, have been developed. Base editing tools will be very useful for gene correction because they can produce highly specific DNA substitutions without the introduction of any donor DNA, but dedicated web-based tools to facilitate the use of such tools have not yet been developed.\\n\\nResultsWe present two web tools for base editors, named BE-Designer and BE-Analyzer. BE-Designer provides all possible base editor target sequences in a given input DNA sequence with useful information including potential off-target sites. BE-Analyzer, a tool for assessing base editing outcomes from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, provides information about mutations in a table and interactive graphs. Furthermore, because the tool runs client-side, large amounts of targeted deep sequencing data (>100MB) do not need to be uploaded to a server, substantially reducing running time and increasing data security. BE-Designer and BE-Analyzer can be freely accessed at http://www.rgenome.net/bedesigner/ and http://www.rgenome.net/be-analyzer/respectively\\n\\nConclusionWe develop two useful web tools to design target sequence (BE-Designer) and to analyze NGS data from experimental results (BE-Analyzer) for CRISPR base editors.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Designed to measure a diversity of executive functioning (EF) through classical neuropsychological tests, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scale (D-KEFS) allows for the investigation of the neural architecture of EF. We examined how the D-KEFS Tower, Verbal Fluency, Design Fluency, Color-Word Interference, and Trail Making Test tasks related to regional frontal lobe volumes, quantifying how components of EF were represented in disparate neural networks. Method: Adults from the Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-RS), an open-access community study of brain development, with complete MRI (3T scanner) and D-KEFS data were selected for analysis (N = 478; ages 20-85). In a mixed-effects model predicting volume, D-KEFS task, D-KEFS score, region of interest (ROI; 13 frontal, 1 occipital control), were entered as fixed effects with intercepts for participants as random effects. Results: Unitary EF (average of D-KEFS scores) was positively associated with superior frontal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral orbitofrontal volumes; a negative association was observed with frontal pole volume (| z-score slope | range = 0.040 to 0.051). Diverse EF skills (individual D-KEFS task scores) were differentially associated with two or three ROIs, respectively, but to a stronger extent (| z-score slope | range = 0.053 to 0.103). Conclusions: The neural correlates found for the D-KEFS support the prefrontal modularity of EF at both the unitary (aspects of EF ability common to all tasks) and task (diverse EF skills) levels. The separation of task-general variance in neurocognition from task-specific variance can further evaluate neuropsychological tests as indices of brain integrity.",

Analyzing extended lineage trees with latent-variable models, we find that two antagonistic heritable variables account for the observed cycle-length correlations. Using molecular perturbations of mTOR and MYC we identify these variables as cell size and regulatory license to divide, which are coupled through a minimum-size checkpoint. The checkpoint is relevant only for fast cell cycles, explaining why growth control of mammalian cell proliferation has remained elusive.

    "abstract": "Theory predicts that sexually dimorphic traits under strong sexual selection, particularly those involved with intersexual signaling, can accelerate speciation and produce bursts of diversification. Sexual dichromatism (sexual dimorphism in color) is widely used as a proxy for sexual selection and is associated with rapid diversification in several animal groups, yet studies using phylogenetic comparative methods to explicitly test for an association between sexual dichromatism and diversification have produced conflicting results. Sexual dichromatism is rare in frogs, but it is both striking and prevalent in African reed frogs, a major component of the diverse frog radiation termed Afrobatrachia. In contrast to most other vertebrates, reed frogs display female-biased dichromatism in which females undergo color transformation, often resulting in more ornate coloration in females than in males. We produce a robust phylogeny of Afrobrachia to investigate the evolutionary origins of sexual dichromatism in this radiation and examine whether the presence of dichromatism is associated with increased rates of net diversification. We find that sexual dichromatism evolved once within hyperoliids and was followed by numerous independent reversals to monochromatism. We detect significant diversification rate heterogeneity in Afrobatrachia and find that sexually dichromatic lineages have double the average net diversification rate of monochromatic lineages. By conducting trait simulations on our empirical phylogeny, we demonstrate our inference of trait-dependent diversification is robust. Although sexual dichromatism in hyperoliid frogs is linked to their rapid diversification and supports macroevolutionary predictions of speciation by sexual selection, the function of dichromatism in reed frogs remains unclear. We propose that reed frogs are a compelling system for studying the roles of natural and sexual selection on the evolution of sexual dichromatism across both micro- and macroevolutionary timescales.",

    "abstract": "1Systematic delineation of complex biological systems is an ever-challenging and resource-intensive process. Single cell transcriptomics allows us to study cell-to-cell variability in complex tissues at an unprecedented resolution. Accurate modeling of gene expression plays a critical role in the statistical determination of tissue-specific gene expression patterns. In the past few years, considerable efforts have been made to identify appropriate parametric models for single cell expression data. The zero-inflated version of Poisson/Negative Binomial and Log-Normal distributions have emerged as the most popular alternatives due to their ability to accommodate high dropout rates, as commonly observed in single cell data. While the majority of the parametric approaches directly model expression estimates, we explore the potential of modeling expression-ranks, as robust surrogates for transcript abundance. Here we examined the performance of the Discrete Generalized Beta Distribution (DGBD) on real data and devised a Wald-type test for comparing gene expression across two phenotypically divergent groups of single cells. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method, to understand its advantages as compared to some of the existing best practice approaches. Besides striking a reasonable balance between Type 1 and Type 2 errors, we concluded that ROSeq, the proposed differential expression test is exceptionally robust to expression noise and scales rapidly with increasing sample size. For wider dissemination and adoption of the method, we created an R package called ROSeq, and made it available on the Bioconductor platform.",

    "abstract": "Investigating fitness interactions in natural populations remains a considerable challenge. We take advantage of the unique population structure of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a bacterial pathogen of humans and shrimp, to perform a genome-wide screen for coadapted genetic elements. We identified 90 interaction groups involving 1,560 coding genes. 82 of these interaction groups are between accessory genes, many of which have functions related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Only 8 interaction groups involve both core and accessory genomes. The largest includes 1,540 SNPs in 82 genes and 338 accessory genome elements, many involved in lateral flagella and cell wall biogenesis. The interactions have a complex hierarchical structure encoding at least four distinct ecological strategies. Preliminary experiments imply that the strategies influence biofilm formation and bacterial growth rate in vitro. One strategy involves a divergent profile in multiple genome regions, implying that strains have irreversibly specialized, while the others involve fewer genes and are more plastic. Our results imply that most genetic alliances are ephemeral but that increasingly complex strategies can evolve and eventually cause speciation.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing allows the characterization of an individuals TCR repertoire and directly query their immune state. However, it remains a non-trivial task to couple these sequenced TCRs to their antigenic targets. In this paper, we present a novel strategy to annotate full TCR sequence repertoires. The strategy is based on a machine learning algorithm to learn the TCR patterns common to the recognition of a specific epitope. These results are then combined with a statistical analysis to evaluate the occurrence of specific epitope-reactive TCR sequences per epitope in repertoire data. In this manner, we can directly study the capacity of full TCR repertoires to target specific epitopes of the relevant vaccines or pathogens. We demonstrate the usability of this approach on three independent datasets related to vaccine monitoring and infectious disease diagnostics by independently identifying the epitopes that are targeted by the TCR repertoire.

    "abstract": "Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here, we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL. Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners coordinated management decisions within a landscape context.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LICitizen science provided access to domestic gardens, understudied urban green spaces\\nC_LIO_LIImpervious surfaces limit pollinators presence at landscape level\\nC_LIO_LISufficient critical amount of gardens increased pollinator diversity at local scale\\nC_LIO_LICritical amount of gardens knowledge may favor coordinated decisions by gardeners\\nC_LIO_LIPollinators may benefit from patches of domestic gardens in an urban matrix\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=84 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/374116_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (42K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@116b7bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@799072org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa484eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a12db3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Type 1 narcolepsy (T1N) is a neurological condition, in which the death of hypocretin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus leads to excessive daytime sleepiness and symptoms of abnormal Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. Known triggers for narcolepsy are influenza-A infection and associated immunization during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Here, we genotyped all remaining consented narcolepsy cases worldwide and assembled this with the existing genotyped individuals. We used this multi-ethnic sample in genome wide association study (GWAS) to dissect disease mechanisms and interactions with environmental triggers (5,339 cases and 20,518 controls). Overall, we found significant associations with HLA (2 GWA significant subloci) and 11 other loci. Six of these other loci have been previously reported (TRA, TRB, CTSH, IFNAR1, ZNF365 and P2RY11) and five are new (PRF1, CD207, SIRPG, IL27 and ZFAND2A). Strikingly, in vaccination-related cases GWA significant effects were found in HLA, TRA, and in a novel variant near SIRPB1. Furthermore, IFNAR1 associated polymorphisms regulated dendritic cell response to influenza-A infection in vitro (p-value =1.92*10-25). A partitioned heritability analysis indicated specific enrichment of functional elements active in cytotoxic and helper T cells. Furthermore, functional analysis showed the genetic variants in TRA and TRB loci act as remarkable strong chain usage QTLs for TRAJ*24 (p-value = 0.0017), TRAJ*28 (p-value = 1.36*10-10) and TRBV*4-2 (p-value = 3.71*10-117). This was further validated in TCR sequencing of 60 narcolepsy cases and 60 DQB1*06:02 positive controls, where chain usage effects were further accentuated. Together these findings show that the autoimmune component in narcolepsy is defined by antigen presentation, mediated through specific T cell receptor chains, and modulated by influenza-A as a critical trigger.",

    "abstract": "Decreases in low frequency power (2-30 Hz) alongside high frequency power increases (>40 Hz) have been demonstrated to predict successful memory formation. Parsimoniously this change in the frequency spectrum can be explained by one factor, a change in the tilt of the power spectrum (from steep to flat) indicating engaged brain regions. A competing view is that the change in the power spectrum contains several distinct brain oscillatory fingerprints, each serving different computations. Here, we contrast these two theories in a parallel MEG-intracranial EEG study where healthy participants and epilepsy patients, respectively, studied either familiar verbal material, or unfamiliar faces. We investigated whether modulations in specific frequency bands can be dissociated in time, space and by experimental manipulation. Both, MEG and iEEG data, show that decreases in alpha/beta power specifically predicted the encoding of words, but not faces, whereas increases in gamma power and decreases in theta power predicted memory formation irrespective of material. Critically, these different oscillatory signatures of memory encoding were evident in different brain regions. Moreover, high frequency gamma power increases occurred significantly earlier compared to low frequency theta power decreases. These results speak against a \\\"spectral tilt\\\" and demonstrate that brain oscillations in different frequency bands serve different functions for memory encoding.",

    "abstract": "Detecting the targets of drugs and other molecules in intact cellular contexts is a major objective in drug discovery and in biology more broadly. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) pursues this aim at proteome-wide scale by inferring target engagement from its effects on temperature-dependent protein denaturation. However, a key challenge of TPP is the statistical analysis of the measured melting curves with controlled false discovery rates at high proteome coverage and detection power. We present non-parametric analysis of response curves (NPARC), a statistical method for TPP based on functional data analysis and nonlinear regression. We evaluate NPARC on five independent TPP datasets and observe that it is able to detect subtle changes in any region of the melting curves, reliably detects the known targets, and outperforms a melting point-centric, single-parameter fitting approach in terms of specificity and sensitivity. NPARC can be combined with established analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics and enables flexible, factorial experimental designs and replication levels. To facilitate access to a wide range of users, a freely available software implementation of NPARC is provided.",

    "abstract": "We find that variation in the dbt-1 gene underlies natural differences in Caenorhabditis elegans responses to the toxin arsenic. This gene encodes the E2 subunit of the branched-chain -keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex, a core component of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. We causally linked a non-synonymous variant in the conserved lipoyl domain of DBT-1 to differential arsenic responses. Using targeted metabolomics and chemical supplementation, we demonstrate that differences in responses to arsenic are caused by variation in iso-branched chain fatty acids. Additionally, we show that levels of branched chain fatty acids in human cells are perturbed by arsenic treatment. This finding has broad implications for arsenic toxicity and for arsenic-focused chemotherapeutics across human populations. Our study implicates the BCKDH complex and BCAA metabolism in arsenic responses, demonstrating the power of C. elegans natural genetic diversity to identify novel mechanisms by which environmental toxins affect organismal physiology.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe packing of genomic DNA from double string into highly-order hierarchial assemblies has great impact on chromosome flexibility, dynamics and functions. The open and accessible regions of chromosome are the primary binding positions for regulatory elements and are crucial to nuclear processes and biological functions.\\n\\nResultsMotivated by the success of flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) in biomolecular flexibility analysis and drug design, we propose a FRI based model for quantitatively characterizing the chromosome flexibility. Based on the Hi-C data, a flexibility index for each locus can be evaluated. Physically, the flexibility is tightly related to the packing density. Highly compacted regions are usually more rigid, while loosely packed regions are more flexible. Indeed, a strong correlation is found between our flexibility index and DNase and ATAC values, which are measurements for chromosome accessibility. Recently, Gaussian network model (GNM) is applied to analyze the chromosome accessibility and a mobility profile has been proposed to characterize the chromosome flexibility. Compared with GNM, our FRI is slightly more accurate (1% to 2% increase) and significantly more efficient in both computational time and costs. For a 5kb resolution Hi-C data, the flexibility evaluation process only takes FRI a few minutes on a single-core processor. In contrast, GNM requires 1.5 hours on 10 CPUs. Moreover, interchromosome information can be easily incorporated into the flexibility evaluation, thus further enhance the accuracy of our FRI. In contrast, the consideration of interchromosome information into GNM will significantly increase the size of its Laplacian matrix, thus computationally extremely challenging for the current GNM.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software is available at https://github.com/jiajiepeng/FRI_chrFle.\\n\\nContactxiakelin@ntu.edu.sg; jiajiepeng@nwpu.edu.cn",

The basic cochlea mechanics is extended by the new concept of the molecular filters, which allows us to discuss the transduction mechanism on the molecular level in the space-time domain. The molecular filters are supposed to be built on the set of the stereocilia of every inner hair cell. It is hypothesized that the molecular filters are the sensors in the feedback loop, which includes also outer hair cells along with the tectorial membrane and uses the zero compensation method to evaluate the traveling wave shape on the basilar membrane. Besides the compensation, the feedback loop, being spatially distributed along the cochlea, takes control over the tectorial membrane strain field generated by the outer hair cells, and implements it as the mechanism for the automatic gain control in the sound transduction.",

Here, using timelapse microscopy and four-dimensional cell tracking in zebrafish, we establish that genetic loss of neural crest impairs cell movements within the optic vesicle. At the ultrastructural level, neural crest cells are required for basement membrane formation specifically around the retinal pigment epithelium. Neural crest cells express the extracellular matrix crosslinking protein nidogen and, strikingly, ectopically expressing nidogen in the absence of neural crest partially restores optic cup morphogenesis.

    "abstract": "Complex biological functions are carried out by the interaction of genes and proteins. Uncovering the gene regulation network behind a function is one of the central themes in biology. Typically, it involves extensive experiments of genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. In this paper, we show that much of the inference task can be accomplished by a deep neural network (DNN), a form of machine learning or artificial intelligence. Specifically, the DNN learns from the dynamics of the gene expression. The learnt DNN behaves like an accurate simulator of the system, on which one can perform in-silico experiments to reveal the underlying gene network. We demonstrate the method with two examples: biochemical adaptation and the gap-gene patterning in fruit fly embryogenesis. In the first example, the DNN can successfully find the two basic network motifs for adaptation - the negative feedback and the incoherent feed-forward. In the second and much more complex example, the DNN can accurately predict behaviors of essentially all the mutants. Furthermore, the regulation network it uncovers is strikingly similar to the one inferred from experiments. In doing so, we develop methods for deciphering the gene regulation network hidden in the DNN \"black box\". Our interpretable DNN approach should have broad applications in genotype-phenotype mapping.\n\nSignificanceComplex biological functions are carried out by gene regulation networks. The mapping between gene network and function is a central theme in biology. The task usually involves extensive experiments with perturbations to the system (e.g. gene deletion). Here, we demonstrate that machine learning, or deep neural network (DNN), can help reveal the underlying gene regulation for a given function or phenotype with minimal perturbation data. Specifically, after training with wild-type gene expression dynamics data and a few mutant snapshots, the DNN learns to behave like an accurate simulator for the genetic system, which can be used to predict other mutants behaviors. Furthermore, our DNN approach is biochemically interpretable, which helps uncover possible gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypic behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessel formation by angiogenesis is critical for tissue development, homeostasis and repair, and is frequently dysregulated in disease[1-3]. Angiogenesis is triggered by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2/3 (VEGFR) signalling, which induces motile endothelial cell (ECs) tip identity[4,5]. Tip cells lead new branching vessels, but also coordinate collective EC movement by repressing tip identity in adjacent ECs via Delta-Like 4 (DLL4)-Notch-mediated down-regulation of VEGFR activity[6-13]. Hence, angiogenesis is driven by lateral inhibition-mediated competition of ECs for migratory status. Recent work reveals that temporal modulation of this DLL4-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition circuit fundamentally shapes both normal and pathological angiogenesis[14-17]. However, the core regulatory network defining the timing and dynamics of EC decision-making is unclear. Here, by integrating computational modeling with in-vivo experimentation, we uncover a unique ultrasensitive switch that temporally defines EC lateral inhibition and ultimately determines the timing, magnitude and robustness of angiogenic responses. We reveal that positive-feedback to Vegfr via the atypical tetraspanin, tm4sf18, amplifies Vegfr activity and expedites EC decision-making in-vivo. Moreover, this Tm4sf18-mediated positive-feedback confers robustness to angiogenesis against changeable environmental conditions by invoking bistable-like behavior. Consequently, mutation of tm4sf18 in zebrafish delays motile EC selection, generates hypoplastic vessels, sensitizes ECs to fluctuations in pro-angiogenic signal and disrupts angiogenesis. We propose that positive-feedback transforms the normally protracted process of lateral inhibition into a quick, adaptive and robust decision-making mechanism, suggestive of a general framework for temporal modulation of cell fate specification in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Animals and their neuronal circuits must maintain function despite significant environmental fluctuations. The crab, Cancer borealis, experiences daily changes in ocean temperature and pH. Here, we describe the effects of extreme changes in extracellular pH - from pH 5.5 to 10.4 - on two central pattern generating networks, the stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia of C. borealis. Given that the physiological properties of ion channels are known to be sensitive to pH within the range tested, it is surprising that these rhythms generally remained robust from pH 6.1 to pH 8.8. Unexpectedly, the stomatogastric ganglion was more sensitive to acid while the cardiac ganglion was more sensitive to base. Considerable animal-to-animal variability was likely a consequence of similar network performance arising from variable sets of underlying conductances. Together, these results illustrate the potential difficulty in generalizing the effects of environmental perturbation across circuits, even within the same animal.\\n\\nAbbreviations",
