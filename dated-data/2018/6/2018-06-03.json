    "abstract": "The molecular makeup of the offspring of a dividing cell gradually becomes phenotypically decorrelated from the parent cell by noise and regulatory mechanisms that amplify phenotypic heterogeneity. Such regulatory mechanisms form networks that contain thresholds between phenotypes. Populations of cells can be poised near the threshold so that a subset of the population probabilistically undergoes the phenotypic transition. We sought to characterize the diversity of bacterial populations around a growth-modulating threshold via analysis of the effect of non-genetic inheritance, similar to conditions that create antibiotictolerant persister cells and other examples of bet hedging. Using simulations and experimental lineage data in Escherichia coli, we present evidence that regulation of growth amplifies the dependence of growth arrest on cellular lineage, causing clusters of related cells undergo growth arrest in certain conditions. Our simulations predict that lineage correlations and the sensitivity of growth to changes in toxin levels coincide in a critical regime. Below the critical regime, the sizes of related growth arrested clusters are distributed exponentially, while in the critical regime clusters sizes are more likely to become large. Furthermore, phenotypic diversity can be nearly as high as possible near the critical regime, but for most parameter values it falls far below the theoretical limit. We conclude that lineage information is indispensable for understanding regulation of cellular growth.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOne of the most important characteristics of a cell is whether it is growing. Actively growing cells can multiply exponentially. In the case of infections and cancer, growth causes problems for the host organism. On the other hand, cells that have stopped growing can allocate cellular resources toward different activities, such as bacteria surviving antibiotics and tissues in multicellular organisms performing their physiological roles. Observing small bacterial colonies in a microscope over time, we have found that cells closely related to each other often have similar growth state. We were curious if lineage dependence was an intrinsic property of growth regulation or if other factors were needed to explain this effect. We therefore built a computational model of a growing and dividing cellular colony with an encoded growth regulation network. We found that regulation of growth is sufficient for lineage dependence to emerge. We next asked if lineage dependence constrains how diverse the cellular population can become. We found that cellular diversity can reach a peak that is nearly as high as possible near the conditions that have the highest lineage dependence, but that most conditions do not permit such high diversity. We conclude that lineage is an important constraint and discuss how the growth arrest transition is in some ways like a phase transition from physics, and in some ways strikingly different, making it a unique phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Many quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays indirectly quantify a target of interest as a drop in amplification signal relative to a larger total signal. The targeted sequence features include: DNA strand breaks introduced by enzymes that cleave at specific sequences or modifications, or caused by ionizing radiation or other DNA-damaging agents; DNA damage that does not break the DNA but blocks the DNA polymerase; and deletions of various sizes that prevent one or both primers from annealing. All of these loss of signal (a.k.a. negative) assays share the drawback of low sensitivity, as compared to positive assays, which generate an amplification signal that directly reflects the copy numbers of the sequence feature. Here we present a novel qPCR strategy that converts all of the above negative assays into positive ones. A mixture of three primers is added to genomic DNA, one primer pair that targets a sequence for strand-specific PCR, and a third, longer primer that prevents initiation of that PCR, by annealing at high temperature and extending across the target sequence, rendering it doublestranded and inaccessible for priming. Any sequence feature that blocks the third primers annealing or extension, while leaving the target sequence intact, allows the PCR to proceed and quantify the copy number of the sequence feature. This Primer Extension Blockade Enabled qPCR (PEBE-qPCR) method will facilitate many high-throughput, low-cost qPCR-based investigations in biology and medicine. As a first example, we present direct qPCR of the unmethylated allele at a MspI/HpaII site in the promoter of the human 45S rDNA gene.",

    "abstract": "Temperature compensation, expressed as the ability to maintain clock characteristics (mainly period) in face of temperature changes, is considered a key feature of circadian clock systems. In this study, we explore the genetic basis for circadian clock plasticity under high temperatures by utilizing a new doubled haploid (DH) population derived from two reciprocal Hordeum vulgare sps. spontaneum hybrids genotypes (crosses between B1K-50-04 and B1K-09-07). Genotyping by sequencing of DH lines indicated a rich recombination landscape, with minor fixation (less than 8%), for one of the parental alleles, yet with prevalent and varied segregation distortion across seven barley chromosomes. Phenotyping was conducted with a high-throughput platform under optimal and high temperature environments. Genetic analysis, which included QxE and binary-threshold models, identified a significant influence of the maternal organelle genome (the plasmotype), as well as several nuclear quantitative trait loci (QTL), on clock phenotypes (free-running period and amplitude). Moreover, it showed the differential contribution of cytoplasmic genome clock rhythm buffering against high temperature. Resequencing of the parental chloroplast indicated the presence of several candidate genes underlying these significant effects. This first reported plasmotype-driven clock plasticity paves the way for identifying an hitherto unknown impact of nuclear and plasmotype variations on clock robustness and on plant adaptation to changing environments.\\n\\nHighlightCircadian clock robustness to high temperature is controlled by nuclear and plasmotype quantitative trait loci in a wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) reciprocal doubled haploid population.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis is one of the neglected infectious diseases in sub Saharan Africa and most of the available data is based on blood donors. Health care workers (HCWs) often get infected as a result of their close contact with patients. A cross sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C among this group of professionals with a view to improving the quality of care to their patients. Hepatitis B and C infections pose a major public health problem worldwide. While infection is highest in the developing world particularly Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, healthcare workers are at higher risk of acquiring blood-borne viral infections, particularly Hepatitis B and C which are mostly asymptomatic. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of Hepatitis B and C infections and associated risk factors among health care workers in Dutse Metropolis, Jigawa State - Nigeria. A standard rapid immuno-chromatographic technique i.e. rapid ELISA was used to screen all sera for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C viral antibody (HCVAb) respectively. Strips containing coated antibodies and antigens to HBV and HCV respectively were removed from the foil. Strips were labeled according to samples. Using a separate disposable pipette, 2 drops of the sample (plasma) were added into each test strip and allowed to run across the absorbent pad. Results were read after 15 minutes. The prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in 100 healthcare workers was determined by testing the plasma collected from the clients during their normal checkup using HBsAg and HCVAb test strips. Results were subjected to statistical analysis using chi-square test. The prevalence of HBV among HCWs was 19 out of 100 (19.0%) and that of HCV was 5 out of 100 (5.0%) where in both cases, higher prevalence was observed among female nurses. It was also observed that all HCV positive cases were recorded among nurses only. The study revealed that nurses are at greater risk of contracting HBV and HCV due to their frequent contact with patients. It is therefore recommended that effective vaccination and other infection control measures be encouraged among healthcare workers.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic connectivity, measured using resting-state fMRI, has emerged as a fundamental tool in the study of the human brain. However, due to practical limitations, many studies do not collect enough resting-state data to generate reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity necessary for studying individual differences. Here we present general functional connectivity (GFC) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task fMRI and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that GFC offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, GFC displays higher heritability on average than resting-state functional connectivity. We also show that predictions of cognitive ability from GFC generalize across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that GFC can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of GFC rather than solely using resting-state data. Moreover, by better capturing heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, GFC represents a novel endophenotype with broad applications in clinical neuroscience and biomarker discovery.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis, a disease marked by diarrhea in adults and stunted growth in children, is associated with the unicellular protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium; often the species parvum. Cryptopain-1, a cysteine protease characterized in the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, had been earlier shown to be inhibited by a vinyl sulfone compound called K11777 (or K-777). Cysteine proteases have long been established as valid drug targets, which can be covalently and selectively inhibited by vinyl sulfones. This computational study was initiated to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds, which could possibly inhibit cryptopain-1 with higher efficacy than K11777. Docking simulations screened a number of such possibly better inhibitors. The work was furthered to probe the enzymatic pocket of cryptopain-1, through in-silico mutations, to derive a map of receptor-ligand interactions in the docked complexes. The idea was to provide crucial clues to aid the design of inhibitors, which would be able to bind the protease well by making favorable interactions with important residues of the enzyme. The analyses dictated placement of ligands towards the front of the enzymatic cleft, and disfavored interactions deep within. The S1 and S2 subsites of the enzyme preferred to remain occupied by polar ligand subgroups. Reasonably distanced ring systems and polar backbones of ligands were desired across the cleft. Large as well as inflexible subgroups were not tolerated. Double ringed systems such as substituted napthalene, especially in S1, were exceptions though. The S2 subsite, which is typically a specificity determinant in papain (C1) family cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L-like cryptopain-1, can possibly accommodate polar and hydrophobic ligand subgroups alike.",

    "abstract": "Calcium imaging has revolutionized systems neuroscience, providing the ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The resulting datasets are quite large (with scales of TB/hour in some cases), which has presented a barrier to routine open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem, and are highly effective when good initializations are available, but can break down e.g. in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail.\\n\\nHere we introduce an improved approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD) of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated) noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon, widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets): in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of 20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from the video data.",

It has been implicated in acting as a scaffolding protein for other division proteins, being a force generator during constriction, and more recently, as an active regulator of septal cell wall production. During an early stage of the division cycle, FtsZ assembles into a heterogeneous structure coined the \\\"Z-ring\\\" due to its resemblance to a ring confined by the midcell geometry. While in vitro experiments on supported lipid bilayers have shown that purified FtsZ can self-organize into a swirling ring roughly the diameter of a bacterial cell, it is not known how, and if, membrane curvature affects FtsZ assembly and dynamics in vivo.\\n\\nTo establish a framework for examining geometrical influences on proper Z-ring assembly and dynamics, we sculptured Escherichia coli cells into unnatural shapes, such as squares and hearts, using division-and cell wall-specific inhibitors in a micro fabrication scheme.

    "abstract": "The health impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) remain debated and their tissue and molecular targets are poorly understood. Here we leveraged systems biology approaches to assess the target tissues, molecular pathways, and gene regulatory networks associated with prenatal exposure to the model EDC Bisphenol A (BPA). Prenatal BPA exposure led to scores of transcriptomic and methylomic alterations in the adipose, hypothalamus, and liver tissues in mouse offspring, with cross-tissue perturbations in lipid metabolism as well as tissue-specific alterations in histone subunits, glucose metabolism and extracellular matrix. Network modeling prioritized main molecular targets of BPA, including Pparg, Hnf4a, Esr1, and Fasn. Lastly, integrative analyses identified the association of BPA molecular signatures with cardiometabolic phenotypes in mouse and human. Our multi-tissue, multi-omics investigation provides strong evidence that BPA perturbs diverse molecular networks in central and peripheral tissues, and offers insights into the molecular targets that link BPA to human cardiometabolic disorders.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe inability to pinpoint the mechanistic underpinnings of environmentally-induced diseases likely stems from the pleiotropic effects of chemicals such as BPA on diverse tissues and molecular space (transcriptome, epigenome, etc.). This makes it challenging to fully dissect their health impact and merits a call for modern big data approaches to examine environmental factors. Our data-driven study is the first unbiased, multi-tissue multiomic systems biology investigation of the molecular circuitry and mechanisms underlying offspring response to prenatal BPA exposure. Importantly, the incorporation of network-based modeling allows us to capture novel players in the regulation of BPA activities in vivo, and the integration with human disease association datasets helps bridge the molecular pathways affected by BPA with diverse human diseases. In doing so, our study provides compelling molecular evidence that developmental BPA exposure significantly perturbs metabolic and endocrine systems in the offspring, and supports BPA as one of the environmental factors involved in the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD).",

Genomes of archaeological crops have the potential to reveal these dynamics without being obscured by recent breeding or introgression. We report a temporal series of archaeogenomes of the crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) from a single locality in Egyptian Nubia. These data indicate no evidence for the effects of a domestication bottleneck but instead suggest a steady decline in genetic diversity over time coupled with an accumulating mutation load. Dynamic selection pressures acted sequentially on architectural and nutritional domestication traits, and adaptation to the local environment. Later introgression between sorghum races allowed exchange of adaptive traits and achieved mutual genomic rescue through an ameliorated mutation load. These results reveal a model of domestication in which genomic adaptation and deterioration was not focused on the initial stages of domestication but occurred throughout the history of cultivation.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the most common cause of cancer-related death and, as such, there is an urgent need to discover new therapies to treat metastasized cancers. Cancer cell lines are widely-used models to study cancer biology and test drug candidates. However, it is still unknown to what extent they adequately resemble the disease in patients. The recent accumulation of large-scale genomic data in cell lines, mouse models, and patient tissue samples provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the suitability of cell lines for metastatic cancer research. In this work, we used breast cancer as a case study. The comprehensive comparison of the genetic profiles of 57 breast cancer cell lines with those of metastatic breast cancer samples revealed substantial genetic differences. In addition, we identified cell lines that more closely resemble different subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. Surprisingly, a combined analysis of mutation, copy number variation and gene expression data suggested that MDA-MB-231, the most commonly used triple negative cell line for metastatic breast cancer research, had little genomic similarity with Basal-like metastatic breast cancer samples. We further compared cell lines with organoids, a new type of preclinical model which are becoming more popular in recent years. We found that organoids outperformed cell lines in resembling the transcriptome of metastatic breast cancer samples. However, additional differential expression analysis suggested that both types of models could not mimic the effects of tumor microenvironment and meanwhile had their own bias towards modeling specific biological processes. Our work provides a guide of cell line selection in metastasis-related study and sheds light on the potential of organoids in translational research.",

    "abstract": "Electrically non-excitable astroglia take up neurotransmitters, buffer extracellular K+ and generate Ca2+ signals that release molecular regulators of neural circuitry. The underlying machinery remains enigmatic, mainly because the nanoscopic, sponge-like astrocyte morphology has been difficult to access experimentally or explore theoretically. Here, we have systematically evaluated the multi-scale morphology of protoplasmic astroglia to construct a realistic multi-compartmental cell model that can be biophysically interrogated in NEURON computational environment. This approach has been implemented as an astrocyte-model builder ASTRO. As a proof of concept, we explored a hippocampal astrocyte reconstructed in silico against a battery of physiological and imaging experiments. This exploration has unveiled some basic features of astroglial physiology inaccessible empirically, such as the characteristic length of membrane voltage propagation, membrane effects of local glutamate transport, spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular K+ redistribution, key Ca2+ buffering properties, and some basic relationships between free Ca2+ dynamics and experimental readout of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators.",

    "abstract": "Information processing by brain circuits depends on Ca2+-dependent, stochastic release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Recently developed optical sensors have enabled detection of evoked and spontaneous release at common glutamatergic synapses. However, monitoring synaptic release probability, its use-dependent changes, and its underpinning presynaptic machinery in situ requires concurrent, intensity-independent readout of presynaptic Ca2+ and glutamate release. Here, we find that the red-shifted Ca2+ indicator Cal-590 shows Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence lifetime, and employ it in combination with the novel green glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR variant to document quantal release of glutamate together with presynaptic Ca2+ concentration, in multiple synapses in an identified neural circuit. At the level of individual presynaptic boutons, we use multi-exposure and stochastic reconstruction procedures to reveal nanoscopic co-localisation of presynaptic Ca2+ entry and glutamate release, a fundamental unknown in modern neurobiology. This approach opens a new horizon in the quest to understand release machinery of central synapses.",

Moreover, when we compared mRNA half-life determined by these methods with other cellular measurements such as mRNA and protein abundance low correlation was found. To clarify this matter, we analyzed mRNA half-life datasets from nine different groups to determine the most accurate method of measurement. Since codon optimality is one of the significant determinants of mRNA stability, we used the codon stabilization coefficient (CSC) as a reference for mRNA half-life measurement accuracy. After CSC calculation for each dataset, we find strong positive correlations between the CSC from some datasets with other parameters that reflect codon optimality such as tRNA abundance and ribosome residence time. By the use of CSC parameter, we observed that most genes contain non-optimal codons and that codon bias exists toward optimized and non-optimized genes. We also observed that stretches of non-optimal are not randomly distributed since it causes impacts on translation.",

We compared the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-14 days) of lumefantrine and safety profile of artemether-lumefantrine in malaria-negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults in two steps. In step 1, a half-dose adult course of artemether-lumefantrine was administered as a safety check in four groups (n = 6/group): (i) antiretroviral-naive, (ii) on nevirapine-based ART, (iii) on efavirenz-based ART and (iv) on ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based ART.

In step 1, lumefantrines AUC0-14 days was 53% [95% CI: 0.27-0.82] lower in the efavirenz-based ART group than the ART-naive group and was 2.4 [95% CI: 1.58-3.62] and 2.9 [95% CI: 1.75-4.72] times higher in the nevirapine and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir groups, respectively.

    "abstract": "The vertebrate stress response enables individuals to react to and cope with environmental challenges. A crucial aspect of the stress response is the elevation of circulating glucocorticoids. However, continued activation of the stress response under repeated (or chronic) stress can be damaging to fitness. Under certain circumstances it may therefore be adaptive to habituate to repeated exposures to a particular stressor by reducing the magnitude of any associated release of glucocorticoids. Here, we investigate whether Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) habituate to repeated exposure to a mild stressor, using a waterborne hormone sampling approach that has previously been shown to elicit a stress response in small fish. We also test for individual variation in the extent of habituation to this stressor. Concentrating on freely circulating cortisol, we found that the first exposure to the assay induced high cortisol release rates but that guppies tended to habituate quickly to subsequent exposures. There were consistent differences among individuals in their average cortisol release rate (after accounting for effects of variables such as body size) over repeated exposures. Our analyses did not find evidence of individual differences in habituation rate, although limitations in statistical power could account for this finding. We also present data on free 11-ketotestosterone, in addition to conjugated forms of both hormones. We discuss consistent individual differences around the general pattern of habituation in the flexible stress response, and highlight the potential for individual variation in habituation to facilitate selection against the deleterious effects of chronic stress.\\n\\nSummary statementTrinidadian guppies habituate quickly to repeated stress exposure, and exhibit consistent differences in their endocrine stress response. We provide a framework for analysing individual variation in habituation rate.",

Specifically, we estimated allele frequencies genome-wide from flies sampled early and late in the growing season from 20 widely dispersed populations. We identified parallel seasonal allele frequency shifts across North America and Europe, demonstrating that seasonal adaptation is a general phenomenon of temperate fly populations. Seasonally fluctuating polymorphisms are enriched in large chromosomal inversions and we find a broad concordance between seasonal and spatial allele frequency change. The direction of allele frequency change at seasonally variable polymorphisms can be predicted by weather conditions in the weeks prior to sampling, linking the environment and the genomic response to selection.

    "abstract": "Automatic emotion regulation (AER) has received increasing attention. However, the effortless hypothesis of AER has yet to be directly tested and the neural mechanisms supporting AER remain unclear. Here, we addressed these two issues, by simultaneous recording behavioral assessments and functional MRI (fMRI) signals when thirty-one participants were required to watch neutral and disgust pictures in three experimental conditions: Watching, Goal Intention (GI) and Reappraisal by Implementation Intention (RII). RII decreased negative feelings and bilateral amygdala activity without engendering cognitive efforts, evidenced by the reduced self-reported efforts and less prefrontal engagement during RII compared to Watching and GI. These regulation effects should not be explained by emotional habituation, as further experiment did not show significant emotional habituation for the repetition of the same stimuli. Moreover, RII and GI produced similar functional connectivity (FC) of vACC (ventral anterior cingulate cortex) to left insula and right precuneus, corresponding to the common goal pursuit component of both strategies. Furthermore, RII relative to GI exhibited weaker FC in distributed brain networks subserving effortful control (e.g. inferior-superior parietal lobe FC), memory retrieval (e.g. inferior-middle temporal lobes and lingual-putamen FCs), aversive anticipation and emotion-related motor planning (e.g. putamen-operculum and vACC-supramarginal gyrus FCs). These findings suggest that RII downregulates disgust effortlessly, most likely mediated by the reduced online mobilization of neural systems subserving emotion-related coping.",

This function has been studied extensively in the auditory and visual domains using various oddball paradigms, but only little exploration of this phenomenon has been done in the somatosensory domain. In this study, we explore how expectations of somatosensory stimulations are established and expressed in neural activity as measured with magnetoencephalography. Using tactile stimulations to the index finger, we compared conditions with actual stimulation to conditions with omitted stimulations, both of which were either expected or unexpected.\\n\\nOur results show that when a stimulation is expected but omitted, a time-locked response occurs [~]135 ms subsequent to the expected stimulation. This somatosensory response to \\\"nothing\\\" was source localized to the secondary somatosensory cortex and to the insula. This provides novel evidence of the capability of the brain of millisecond time-keeping of somatosensory patterns across intervals of 3000 ms.\\n\\nOur results also show that when stimuli are repeated and expectations are established, there is associated activity in the theta and beta bands. These theta and beta band expressions of expectation were localized to the primary somatosensory area, inferior parietal cortex and cerebellum. Furthermore, there was gamma band activity in the right insula for the first stimulation after an omission, which indicates the detection of a new stimulation event after an expected pattern has been broken.\\n\\nFinally, our results show that cerebellum play a crucial role in predicting upcoming stimulation and in predicting when stimulation may begin again.",

We developed a sensory-driven adaptation protocol for reflexive whisker protraction and recorded Purkinje cell activity from crus 1 and 2 of awake mice. Before training, simple spikes of individual Purkinje cells correlated during reflexive protraction with the whisker position without lead or lag. After training, simple spikes and whisker protractions were both enhanced with the spiking activity now leading the behavioral response. Neuronal and behavior changes did not occur in two cell-specific mouse models with impaired long-term potentiation at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses. Consistent with cerebellar plasticity rules, increased simple spike activity was prominent in cells with low complex spike response probability. Thus, potentiation at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses may contribute to reflex adaptation and enable expression of cerebellar learning through increases in simple spike activity.\\n\\nImpact statementRomano et al. show that expression of cerebellar whisker learning can be mediated by increases in simple spike activity, depending on LTP induction at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses.",

Use of the drug by mothers during lactation may transfer active cannabinoids to the developing offspring, altering postnatal neurodevelopment during this critical period. During early life, GABA undergoes a functional switch from an excitatory to an inhibitory neurotransmitter due to reciprocal changes in expression of the K+/Cl- co-transporters KCC2 and NKCC1. Here, we characterize the functional GABA switch in the prefrontal cortex of both male and female rats. We show that treating rat dams with {Delta}9-THC or a synthetic cannabinoid during early lactation (PND01-10) retards KCC2 expression and delays the GABA switch in pups of both sexes via a CB1R-dependent mechanism. Our results indicate that the developmental trajectory of GABA in PFC neurons is significantly altered by perinatal exposure to cannabinoids through lactation during the early perinatal period.",

Moreover, because MHC products can influence the components of bodily secretions, an individuals body odor may signal its MHC and influence partner identification or mate choice. To investigate MHC-based signaling and recipient sensitivity, we test for odor-gene covariance and behavioral discrimination of MHC diversity and pairwise dissimilarity, under the good genes and good fit paradigms, in a strepsirrhine primate, the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). First, we coupled genotyping with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to investigate if diversity of the MHC-DRB gene is signaled by the chemical diversity of lemur genital scent gland secretions. We also assessed if the chemical similarity between individuals correlated with their MHC similarity. Next, we assessed if lemurs discriminated this chemically encoded, genetic information in opposite-sex conspecifics. We found that both sexes signaled overall MHC diversity and pairwise MHC similarity via genital secretions, but in a sex- and season-dependent manner. Additionally, both sexes discriminated absolute and relative MHC-DRB diversity in the genital odors of opposite-sex conspecifics, supporting previous findings that lemur genital odors function as advertisement of genetic quality. In this species, genital odors provide honest information about an individuals absolute and relative MHC quality. Complementing evidence in humans and Old World monkeys, our results suggest that reliance on scent signals to communicate MHC quality may be important across the primate lineage.",

    "abstract": "MotivationComplex neuropsychiatric conditions including autism spectrum disorders are among the most heritable neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct profiles of neuropsychological traits. A variety of genetic factors modulate these traits (phenotypes) underlying clinical diagnoses. To explore the associations between genetic factors and phenotypes, genome-wide association studies are broadly applied. Stringent quality checks and thorough downstream analyses for in-depth interpretation of the associations are an indispensable prerequisite. However, in the area of neuropsychology there is no framework existing, which besides performing association studies also affiliates genetic variants at the brain and gene network level within a single framework.\\n\\nResultsWe present a novel bioinformatics approach in the field of neuropsychology that integrates current state-of-the-art tools, algorithms and brain transcriptome data to elaborate the association of phenotype and genotype data. The integration of transcriptome data gives an advantage over the existing pipelines by directly translating genetic associations to brain regions and developmental patterns. Based on our data integrative approach, we identify genetic variants associated with Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in an autism cohort and found their respective genes to be expressed in specific brain areas.\\n\\nConclusionOur data integrative approach revealed that IQ is related to early down-regulated and late up-regulated gene modules implicated in frontal cortex and striatum, respectively. Besides identifying new gene associations with IQ we also provide a proof of concept, as several of the identified genes in our analysis are candidate genes related to intelligence in autism, intellectual disability, and Alzheimers disease. The framework provides a complete extensive analysis starting from a phenotypic trait data to its association at specific brain areas at vulnerable time points within a timespan of four days.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationOur framework is implemented in R and Python. It is available as an in-house script, which can be provided on demand.\\n\\nContactafsheen.yousaf@kgu.de",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSmaller hippocampal volume in patients with PTSD represents the most consistently reported structural alteration in the brain. Subfields of the hippocampus play distinct roles in encoding and processing of memories, which are disrupted in PTSD. We examined PTSD-associated alterations in 12 hippocampal subfields in relation to global hippocampal shape, and clinical features.\\n\\nMethodsCase-control cross-sectional study of US military veterans (n=282) from the Iraq and Afghanistan era were grouped into PTSD (n=142) and trauma-exposed controls (n=140). Participants underwent clinical evaluation for PTSD and associated clinical parameters followed by MRI at 3-Tesla. Segmentation with Free Surfer v6.0 produced hippocampal subfield volumes for the left and right CA1, CA3, CA4, DG, fimbria, fissure, hippocampus-amygdala transition area, molecular layer, parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, and tail, as well as hippocampal meshes. Covariates included age, gender, trauma exposure, alcohol use, depressive symptoms, antidepressant medication use, total hippocampal volume, and MRI scanner model.\\n\\nResultsSignificantly lower subfield volumes were associated with PTSD in left CA1 (p=.01; d=.21; uncorrected), CA3 (p=.04; d=.08; uncorrected), and right CA3 (p=.02; d=.07; uncorrected) only if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume was included as a covariate. A trend level association of L-CA1 with PTSD [F4, 221=3.32, p = 0.07] is present and the other subfield findings are non-significant if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume is not included as a covariate. PTSD associated differences in global hippocampal shape were non-significant.\\n\\nConclusionsThe present finding of smaller hippocampal CA1 in PTSD is consistent with model systems in rodents that exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior from repeated exposure to acute stress. Behavioral correlations with hippocampal subfield volume differences in PTSD will elucidate their relevance to PTSD, particularly behaviors of associative fear learning, extinction training, and formation of false memories.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have implicated hippocampal dysregulation in the pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, over the past twenty years, a growing body of evidence has revealed distinct functional roles of the dorsal (dHC) and ventral (vHC) hippocampal subregions, with the dHC being primarily involved in spatial learning and memory and the vHC regulating anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors. Notably, to our knowledge, no rodent studies have examined the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on synaptic transmission along the dorsal/ventral axis. To that end, we examined the effects of the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) model of AUD on dHC and vHC synaptic excitability. Adult male Long-Evans rats were exposed to CIE or air for 10 days (12 hrs/day; targeting blood ethanol levels of 175-225 mg%) and recordings were made 24 hours into withdrawal. As expected, this protocol increased anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. Extracellular recordings revealed marked CIE-associated increases in synaptic excitation in the CA1 region that were exclusively restricted to the ventral domain of the hippocampus. Western blot analysis of synaptoneurosomal fractions revealed that the expression of two proteins that regulate synaptic strength, GluA2 and SK2, was dysregulated in the vHC, but not the dHC, following CIE. Together, these findings suggest that the ventral CA1 region may be particularly sensitive to the maladaptive effects of chronic ethanol exposure and provide new insight into some of the neural substrates that may contribute to the negative affective state that develops during withdrawal.\\n\\nHighlightsChronic intermittent ethanol exposure produces robust increases in anxiety-like behavior in male Long Evans rats.\\nChronic intermittent ethanol exposure increases synaptic excitability in the ventral, but not the dorsal, domain of the hippocampus.\\nThese changes in excitability are associated with alterations in synaptoneurosomal expression of small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and the GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit that are also restricted to the ventral hippocampus.",

We used pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons to determine their role in the cue-elicited reward seeking, and applied a novel analytic approach to assay cue-induced changes in reward expectancy. Inhibiting ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons abolished cue-induced reward seeking but not reward retrieval, indicating that this pathway modulates response vigor but not reward expectancy. Locally inhibiting dopamine inputs to nucleus accumbens also disrupted cue-elicited reward seeking but not retrieval. Interestingly, the suppression produced by this treatment was greater in rats that responded to cues with exploratory reward seeking, without attempting to retrieve reward, than in rats exhibiting complete bouts of seeking with retrieval, indicating that individuals differ in their reliance on a dopamine-mediated motivational process. These findings shed new light on the behavioral and neural mechanisms of adaptive and compulsive forms of cue-motivated behavior.",

    "abstract": "Socially exchanged fluids are a direct means for organisms to influence conspecifics. When orally feeding larval offspring via trophallaxis, Camponotus floridanus ant workers were shown to transfer Juvenile Hormone (JH), a key developmental regulator, as well as paralogs of JH esterase (JHE), an enzyme that hydrolyzes JH. We combine proteomic, phylogenetic and selection analyses to investigate the evolution of this esterase subfamily. We show that Camponotus JHE-like proteins have sustained multiple duplications, positive selection, and changed localization to become abundantly and selectively present in trophallactic fluid. To assess their potential role in larval development, we fed workers a JHE-specific inhibitor to introduce it into the trophallactic network. This increased the proportion larvae reared to metamorphosis by these workers, similar to supplementation with JH. Together these findings suggest that JHE-like proteins have evolved new roles in inter-individual regulation of larval development in Camponotus.",

    "abstract": "How are the myriad stimuli arriving at our senses transformed into conscious thought? To address this question, in a series of studies, we asked whether a common mechanism underlies loss of information processing in unconscious states across different conditions, which could shed light on the brain mechanisms of conscious cognition. With a novel approach, we brought together for the first time, data from the same paradigm--a highly engaging auditory-only narrative--in three independent domains: anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, unconsciousness after brain injury, and individual differences in intellectual abilities during conscious cognition. During external stimulation in the unconscious state, the functional differentiation between the auditory and fronto-parietal systems decreased significantly relatively to the conscious state. Conversely, we found that stronger functional differentiation between these systems in response to external stimulation predicted higher intellectual abilities during conscious cognition, in particular higher verbal acuity scores in independent cognitive testing battery. These convergent findings suggest that the responsivity of sensory and higher-order brain systems to external stimulation, especially through the diversification of their functional responses is an essential feature of conscious cognition and verbal intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of motor cortices is thought to contribute to motor disorders such as Parkinsons disease (PD). However, little is known on the link between cortical dopaminergic loss, abnormalities in motor cortex neural activity and motor deficits. We address the role of dopamine in modulating motor cortical activity by focusing on the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing a cued-licking task. We first demonstrate licking deficits and concurrent alterations of spiking activity in ALM of mice with unilateral depletion of dopaminergic neurons (i.e., mice injected with 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle). Hemi-lesioned mice displayed delayed licking initiation, shorter duration of licking bouts, and lateral deviation of tongue protrusions. In parallel with these motor deficits, we observed a reduction in the prevalence of cue responsive neurons and altered preparatory activity. Acute and local blockade of D1 receptors in ALM recapitulated some of the key behavioral and neural deficits observed in hemi-lesioned mice. Altogether, our data show a direct relationship between cortical D1 receptor modulation, cue-evoked and preparatory activity in ALM, and licking initiation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe link between dopaminergic signaling, motor cortical activity and motor deficits is not fully understood. This manuscript describes alterations in neural activity of the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) that correlate with licking deficits in mice with unilateral dopamine depletion or with intra-ALM infusion of dopamine antagonist. The findings emphasize the importance of cortical dopaminergic modulation in motor initiation. These results will appeal not only to researchers interested in cortical control of licking, but also to a broader audience interested in motor control and dopaminergic modulation in physiological and pathological conditions. Specifically, our data suggest that dopamine deficiency in motor cortex could play a role in the pathogenesis of the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Advances in hardware, pulse sequences, and reconstruction techniques have made it possible to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at sub-millimeter resolution while maintaining high spatial coverage and acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we examine whether ultra-high-resolution fMRI can be exploited for routine use in neuroscience research. We conducted fMRI in human visual cortex during a simple event-related visual experiment (7T, gradient-echo EPI, 0.8-mm isotropic voxels, 2.2-s sampling rate, 84 slices), and developed analysis and visualization tools to assess the quality of the data. We make three main observations. First, we find that the acquired fMRI images, combined with appropriate surface-based processing, provide reliable and accurate measurements of fine-scale blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity patterns. Second, we show that the highly folded structure of cortex causes substantial biases on spatial resolution and data visualization. Third, we examine the well-recognized issue of venous contributions to fMRI signals. In a systematic assessment of large sections of cortex measured at a fine scale, we show that time-averaged T2*-weighted EPI intensity is a simple, robust marker of venous effects. These venous effects are unevenly distributed across cortex, are more pronounced in gyri and outer cortical depths, and are, to a certain degree, in consistent locations across subjects relative to cortical folding. Furthermore, we show that these venous effects are strongly correlated with BOLD responses evoked by the experiment. We conclude that ultra-high-resolution fMRI can provide robust information about fine-scale BOLD activity patterns, but special care must be exercised in visualizing and interpreting these patterns, especially with regards to the confounding influence of the brains vasculature. To help translate these methodological findings to neuroscience research, we provide practical suggestions for both high-resolution and standard-resolution fMRI studies.",

We found a high level of concordance between scientific and societal taxonomic attention, which was consistent among assessed species groups and media sources. Results indicate that research is apparently not as disconnected from the interests of society as it is often reproached, and that societal support for current research objectives should be adequate. While the high degree of similarity between scientific and societal interest is both striking and satisfying, the dissimilarities are also interesting, as new scientific findings may constitute a constant source of novel interest for the society.",

Strain W-6 was monitored with the ability of biological nitrogen fixation when N2 was used for the sole nitrogen source, and yet nitrogenase activity would be inhibited in the presence of extra nitrogen. Moreover, Strain W-6 could utilize NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ for cell growth through assimilation, but unable to convert them to atmospheric nitrogen. Meantime, accumulation of nitrite was observed during the nitrate removal process, and the optimal conditions for nitrate removal were temperature of 20{degrees}C, shaking speed of 150 rpm, sodium succinate as the carbon source and C/N of 12. The experimental results indicate that Stenotrophomonas maltophiliautilize W-6 could utilize not only N2 but also other nitrogen sources directly as its N substance. Therefore, heterotrophic Azotobacter may possess a great significance to nitrogen cycle except in biological nitrogen fixation.\\n\\nImportanceAzotobacter spp. are found in soils worldwide, with features not simply for the nitrogen fixation, but for the energy metabolism relevant to agriculture.

As such, whether bacteria utilize either inorganic nitrogen or organic nitrogen has remained obscure. The present studies indicate that Stenotrophomonas maltophilia W-6 could highly efficient utilize nitrate, nitrite and ammonium etc. N substance and detect NH4+ as final product.

    "abstract": "Turning during flight is a complex behaviour that requires coordination to ensure that the resulting centrifugal force is never large enough to disrupt the intended turning trajectory. The centrifugal force during a turn increases with the curvature (sharpness) of the turn, as well as the speed of flight. Consequently, sharp turns would require lower flight speeds, in order to limit the centrifugal force to a manageable level and prevent unwanted sideslips. We have video-filmed honeybees flying near a hive entrance when the entrance is temporarily blocked. A 3D reconstruction and analysis of the flight trajectories executed during this loitering behaviour reveals that sharper turns are indeed executed at lower speeds. During a turn, the flight speed is matched to the curvature, moment to moment, in such a way as to maintain the centrifugal force at an approximately constant, low level of about 30% of the body weight, irrespective of the speed or the curvature of the turn. This ensures that turns are well coordinated, with few or no sideslips - as is evident from analysis of other properties of the flight trajectories.",

    "abstract": "All organisms are faced with survival and fitness challenges. However, differences in how ectotherms and endotherms deal with these challenges causes confusion when theoretical explanations are proposed. Herein, an immunochallenged, immature ectothermic vertebrate increased growth in the face of immunochallenge, reminiscent of up-regulated physiological efficiency termed hormesis. The immunochallenged subjects increased food intake relative to control animals, a largely ignored possibility in previous studies. This likely led to an energy surplus that fueled additional growth. Although there was increased resource demand from the immune response that exceeded internal stores, the acceptably sized food items contained more resources than immunologically-driven demand required. We theorize that because ectotherms lack significant internally-stored resources compared to endotherms, they must feed to fuel increased physiological demand. This can lead to excess resource intake because the minimum acceptably sized prey contains more available resources than upregulation required. This creates a pseudo-hormetic hormetic response, fueled by excess food intake rather than significant improved physiological efficiency. Further, we speculate that lifespan and/or maturity may interact with resource management ectotherms, though our data are inconclusive on this matter. Ultimately, our data suggest additional growth when ectotherms face stressors is a pseudo-hormetic response stemming from increased food intake instead of upregulated physiological efficiency.",

    "abstract": "As sequencing read length has increased, researchers have quickly adopted longer reads for their experiments. Here, we examine host-pathogen interaction studies to assess if using longer reads is warranted. Six diverse datasets encountered in studies of host-pathogen interactions were used to assess what genomic attributes might affect the outcome of differential gene expression analysis including: gene density, operons, gene length, number of introns/exons, and intron length. Principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering with bootstrap support, and regression analyses of pairwise comparisons were undertaken on the same reads, looking at all combinations of paired and unpaired reads trimmed to 36,54,72, and 101-bp. For E coli, 36-bp single end reads performed as well as any other read length and as well as paired end reads. For all other comparisons, 54-bp and 72-bp reads were typically equivalent and different from 36-bp and 101-bp reads. Read pairing improved the outcome in several, but not all, comparisons in no discernable pattern, such that using paired reads is recommended in most scenarios. No specific genome attribute appeared to influence the data. However, experiments with an a priori expected greater biological complexity had more variable results with all read lengths relative to those with decreased complexity. When combined with cost, 54-bp paired end reads provided the most robust, internally reproducible results across all comparisons. However, using 36-bp single end reads may be desirable for bacterial samples, although possibly only if the transcriptional response is expected a priori to be robust.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYO_LIThe human only CSHL Encode data set (1) was downloaded from ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hgl9/encodeDCC/wgEncodeCshlLongRnaSeq/.\\nC_LIO_LIThe data from mice vaginas infected with Candida albicans (2) was downloaded from the SRA (url - https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP057050).\\nC_LIO_LIThe data from Aspergillus fumigatus cells in contact with human cells was downloaded from the SRA (url - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/399754).\\nC_LIO_LIThe data from a strand-specific library from a study comparing C. albicans cells in contact with human cells with those in media (3) was downloaded from the SRA (url - https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP011085).\\nC_LIO_LIThe data from C. albicans in culture media (3) was downloaded from the SRA (url - https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP011085).\\nC_LIO_LIThe data from Escherichia coli grown in different media (4) was downloaded from the SRA (url - https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP056578).\\nC_LI\\n\\nI/We confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. {boxtimes}\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTAs sequencing technologies improve, sequencing costs decrease and read lengths increase. We examine host-pathogen interaction studies to assess if using these longer reads is warranted given their increased cost relative to using the same number of shorter reads. To this end we compared the use of various read lengths and read pairing for six diverse host-pathogen datasets with varying genomic attributes including: gene density, operons, gene length, number of introns/exons, and intron length. We find that in the bacterial sample, 36-bp single end reads performed as well as any other read length and as well as paired end reads. When combined with cost, 54-bp paired end reads provided the most robust, internally reproducible results for all other comparisons. Read pairing improved the outcome in several, but not all, comparisons in no discernable pattern, such that using paired reads is recommended in most scenarios. No specific genome attribute appeared to influence the data.",

    "abstract": "Two largely independent research lines use rhythmic sensory stimulation to study visual processing. Despite the use of strikingly similar experimental paradigms, they differ crucially in their notion of the stimulus-driven periodic brain responses: One regards them mostly as synchronised (entrained) intrinsic brain rhythms; the other assumes they are predominantly evoked responses (classically termed steady-state responses, or SSRs) that add to the ongoing brain activity. This conceptual difference can produce contradictory predictions about, and interpretations of, experimental outcomes. The effect of spatial attention on brain rhythms in the alpha-band (8 - 13 Hz) is one such instance: alpha-range SSRs have typically been found to increase in power when participants focus their spatial attention on laterally presented stimuli, in line with a gain control of the visual evoked response. In nearly identical experiments, retinotopic decreases in entrained alpha-band power have been reported, in line with the inhibitory function of intrinsic alpha. Here we reconcile these contradictory findings by showing that they result from a small but far-reaching difference between two common approaches to EEG spectral decomposition. In a new analysis of previously published human EEG data, recorded during bilateral rhythmic visual stimulation, we find the typical SSR gain effect when emphasising stimulus-locked neural activity and the typical retinotopic alpha suppression when focusing on ongoing rhythms. These opposite but parallel effects suggest that spatial attention may bias the neural processing of dynamic visual stimulation via two complementary neural mechanisms.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAttending to a visual stimulus strengthens its representation in visual cortex and leads to a retinotopic suppression of spontaneous alpha rhythms. To further investigate this process, researchers often attempt to phase-lock, or entrain, alpha through rhythmic visual stimulation under the assumption that this entrained alpha retains the characteristics of spontaneous alpha. Instead, we show that the part of the brain response that is phase-locked to the visual stimulation increased with attention (in line with steady-state evoked potentials), while the typical suppression was only present in non-stimulus-locked alpha activity. The opposite signs of these effects suggest that attentional modulation of dynamic visual stimulation relies on two parallel cortical mechanisms - retinotopic alpha suppression and increased temporal tracking.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) gains entry into cells is a complex one, involving a broad range of host proteins. Entry is a critical phase of the viral lifecycle, and a potential target for therapeutic or vaccine-mediated intervention. However, the mechanics of HCV entry remain poorly understood. Here we describe a novel computational model of viral entry, encompassing the relationship between HCV and the key host receptors CD81 and SR-B1. We conduct experiments to thoroughly quantify the influence of an increase or decrease in receptor availability upon the extent of viral entry. We use these data to build and parameterise a mathematical model, which we then validate by further experiments. Our results are consistent with sequential HCV-receptor interactions, whereby initial interaction between the HCV E2 glycoprotein and SR-B1 facilitates the accumulation CD81 receptors, leading to viral entry. However, we also demonstrate that a small minority of virus can achieve entry in the absence of SR-B1. Our model estimates the impact of the different obstacles that viruses must surmount to achieve entry; among virus particles attaching to the cell surface, 20-35% accumulate sufficient CD81 receptors, of these 4-8% then complete the subsequent steps to achieve productive infection. Furthermore, we make estimates of receptor stoichiometry; between 3 and 6 CD81 receptors are likely to be required to achieve viral entry. Our model provides a tool to investigate the entry characteristics of HCV variants and outlines a framework for future quantitative studies of the multi-receptor dynamics of HCV entry.",

    "abstract": "The clinical presentations of papillomavirus (PV) infections come in many different flavors. While most PVs are part of a healthy skin microbiota and are not associated to physical lesions, other PVs cause benign lesions, and only a handful of PVs are associated to malignant transformations linked to the specific activities of the E5, E6 and E7 oncogenes. The functions and origin of E5 remain to be elucidated. These E5 ORFs are present in the genomes of a few polyphyletic PV lineages, located between the early and the late viral gene cassettes. We have computationally assessed whether these E5 ORFs have a common origin and whether they display the properties of a genuine gene. Our results suggest that during the evolution of Papillomaviridae, at least four events lead to the presence of a long non-coding DNA stretch between the E2 and the L2 genes. In three of these events, the novel regions evolved coding capacity, becoming the extant E5 ORFs. We then focused on the evolution of the E5 genes in AlphaPVs infecting humans. The sharp match between the type of E5 protein encoded in AlphaPVs and the infection phenotype (cutaneous warts, genital warts or anogenital cancers) supports the role of E5 in the differential oncogenic potential of these PVs. In our analyses, the best-supported scenario is that the five types of extant E5 proteins within the AlphaPV genomes may not have a common ancestor. However, the chemical similarities between E5s regarding amino acid composition prevent us from confidently rejecting the model of a common origin. Our evolutionary interpretation is that an originally non-coding region entered the genome of the ancestral AlphaPVs. This genetic novelty allowed to explore novel transcription potential, triggering an adaptive radiation that yielded three main viral lineages encoding for different E5 proteins, and that display distinct infection phenotypes. Overall, our results provide an evolutionary scenario for the de novo emergence of viral genes and illustrate the impact of such genotypic novelty in the phenotypic diversity of the viral infections.",

This number is reduced by orders of magnitude from previous studies (thousands or tens of thousands), owing to differences in both experimental design and statistical analysis. Whole genome simulations calibrated from several Drosophila genetic datasets support the contention that the observed genome-wide response could be generated by as few as 30 loci under strong directional selection, with a corresponding hitch-hiking effect. Finally, the SNPs that showed strong parallel evolution in the novel laboratory environment exhibit an (initial) allele frequency spectrum indicative of balancing in nature.

    "abstract": "Predicting gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression profiles has become a common approach for identifying important biological regulators. Despite the increase in the use of inference methods, existing computational approaches do not integrate RNA-sequencing data analysis, are often not automated, and are restricted to users with bioinformatics and programming backgrounds. To address these limitations, we have developed TuxNet, an integrated user-friendly platform, which, with just a few selections, allows to process raw RNA-sequencing data (using the Tuxedo pipeline) and infer GRNs from these processed data. TuxNet is implemented as a graphical user interface and, using expression data from any organism with an existing reference genome, can mine the regulations among genes either by applying a dynamic Bayesian network inference algorithm, GENIST, or a regression tree-based pipeline that uses spatiotemporal data, RTP-STAR. To illustrate the use of TuxNet while getting insight into the regulatory cascade downstream of the Arabidopsis root stem cell regulator PERIANTHIA (PAN), we obtained time course gene expression data of a PAN inducible line and inferred a GRN using GENIST. Using RTP-STAR, we then inferred the network of a PAN secondary downstream gene, ATHB13, for which we obtained wildtype and mutant expression profiles. Our case studies feature the versatility of TuxNet to infer networks using different types of gene expression data (i.e time course and steady-state data) as well as how inference networks are used to identify important regulators.\\n\\nSUMMARYTuxNet offers a simple interface for non-computational biologists to infer GRNs from raw RNA-seq data.",

Since several physiological processes are involved and the relation among them is complicated, analyses of single-traits is insufficient in revealing the complex mechanism of altitude acclimatization. In this study, we examined whether these physiological responses could be studied as composite phenotypes which are represented by a linear combination of physiological traits. We developed a strategy which combines both spectral clustering and PLSPM to define composite phenotypes. We captured 14 composite phenotypes from 28 physiological traits of altitude acclimatization. Using these composite phenotypes, we applied k-means to reveal hidden physiological heterogeneity in altitude acclimatization. Furthermore, we employed linear regression to systematically model oxygen saturation (SpO2) changes in altitude acclimatization and evaluated the model fitness performance. And composite phenotypes based Model 2 has better fitness than single-traits based Model 1 in all measurement indices. Therefore, this new strategy of defining and applying composite phenotypes can be considered as a general strategy of complex traits.",

Some eukaryotic genomes and all, or nearly all, bacterial genomes require alternate methods of quantification since they lack annotation of transcriptional boundaries with EST or EST-like data, have overlapping transcriptional boundaries, and/or have polycistronic transcripts.\\n\\nResultsAn algorithm was developed and tested that better quantifies transcriptomics data for differential gene expression analysis in organisms with overlapping transcriptional units and polycistronic transcripts. Using data from standard libraries originating from Escherichia coli and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and strand-specific libraries from the Wolbachia endosymbiont wBm, FADU can derive counts for genes that are missed by HTSeq and featurecounts. Using the default parameters with the E. coli data, FADU can detect transcription of 51 more genes than HTSeq in union mode and 21 genes more than featurecounts, with 42 and 18 of these features being <300 bp, respectively. Due to its ability to derive counts for otherwise unrepresented genes without overstating their abundance, we believe FADU to be an improved tool for quantifying transcripts in prokaryotic systems for RNA-Seq analyses.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationFADU is available at https://github.com/adkinsrs/FADU.

Laboratory experiments show that different phytoplankton taxa exhibit a wide variety of responses, with some strains having higher fitness under projected future conditions, and others being negatively impacted. Previous studies have suggested that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the numerically dominant picophytoplankton in the oceans, have very different responses to elevated CO2 that may result in a dramatic shift in their relative abundances in future oceans. Here we show that these two genera experience faster exponential growth rates under future CO2 conditions, similar to most other cyanobacteria that have been studied. However, Prochlorococcus strains have significantly lower realized growth rates due to more extreme lag periods after exposure to fresh culture media. Surprisingly, however, Synechococcus was unable to outcompete Prochlorococcus in co-culture at elevated CO2. Under these conditions, Prochlorococcus poor response to elevated CO2 disappeared, and it showed negative frequency dependence in its relative fitness compared to Synechococcus, with a significant fitness advantage when it was initially rare. Moreover, both Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus had faster growth rates in co-culture with each other than either had in unialgal culture. We speculate that this negative frequency dependence is an outgrowth of reductive Black Queen evolution operating on both taxa that has resulted in a passively mutualistic relationship analogous to that connecting Prochlorococcus with the \\\"helper\\\" heterotrophic microbes in its environment.",

However, both scanner and site variability are confounds that hinder pooling data collected across different sites or across different operating systems on the same scanner, even when all acquisition protocols are harmonized. These confounds degrade statistical analyses and can lead to spurious findings. Unfortunately, methods to address this problem are scant. In this study, we propose a novel denoising approach for multi-site multimodal MRI data that implements a data-driven linked independent component analysis (LICA) to efficiently identify scanner/site-related effects for removal. Removing these effects results in denoised data that can then be combined across sites/studies to improve modality-specific statistical processing. We use data from six different studies collected on the same scanner across major hardware (gradient and head coil) and software upgrades to demonstrate our LICA-based denoising approach. The proposed method is superior compared to the existing methods we tested and has great potential for large-scale multi-site studies to produce combined data free from study/site confounds.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing efforts are increasingly identifying candidate genetic variants associated with human disease. However, predicting and testing the pathogenicity of a genetic variant remains challenging. Genome editing allows for the rigorous functional testing of human genetic variants in animal models. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are a prominent example of a human disorder with complex genetics. An inherited sequence variant in the human PBX3 gene (PBX3 p.A136V) has previously been shown to be enriched in a CHD patient cohort, indicating that the PBX3 p.A136V variant could be a modifier allele for CHDs. PBX genes encode TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension)-class homeodomain-containing DNA-binding proteins with diverse roles in development and disease and are required for heart development in mouse and zebrafish. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to directly test whether this PBX gene variant acts as a genetic modifier in zebrafish heart development. We used a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide to precisely introduce the human PBX3 p.A136V variant in the homologous zebrafish pbx4 gene (pbx4 p.A131V). We find that zebrafish that are homozygous for pbx4 p.A131V are viable as adults. However, we show that the pbx4 p.A131V variant enhances the embryonic cardiac morphogenesis phenotype caused by loss of the known cardiac specification factor, Hand2. Our study is the first example of using precision genome editing in zebrafish to demonstrate a function for a human disease-associated single nucleotide variant of unknown significance. Our work underscores the importance of testing the roles of inherited variants, not just de novo variants, as genetic modifiers of CHDs. Our study provides a novel approach toward advancing our understanding of the complex genetics of CHDs.\\n\\nSummary statementOur study provides a novel example of using genome editing in zebrafish to demonstrate how a human DNA sequence variant of unknown significance may contribute to the complex genetics of congenital heart defects.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOur appreciation of the critical role of the 3D organization of the genome in gene regulation is steadily increasing. Recent 3C-based deep sequencing techniques elucidated a hierarchy of structures that underlie the spatial organization of the genome in the nucleus. At the top of this hierarchical organization are chromosomal territories and the megabase-scale A/B compartments that correlate with transcriptional activity within cells. Below them are the relatively cell-type invariant topologically associated domains (TADs), characterized by high frequency of physical contacts between loci within the same TAD and are assumed to function as regulatory units. Within TADs, chromatin loops bring enhancers and target promoters to close spatial proximity. Yet, we still have only rudimentary understanding how differences in chromatin organization between different cell types affect cell-type specific gene expression programs that are executed under basal and challenged conditions.\\n\\nResultsHere, we carried out a large-scale meta-analysis that integrated Hi-C data from thirteen different cell lines and dozens of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets measured on these cells, either under basal conditions or after treatment. Pairwise comparisons between cell lines demonstrated the strong association between modulation of A/B compartmentalization, differential gene expression and transcription factor (TF) binding events. Furthermore, integrating the analysis of transcriptomes of different cell lines in response to various challenges, we show that 3D organization of cells under basal conditions constrains not only gene expression programs and TF binding profiles that are active under the basal condition but also those induced in response to treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results further elucidate the role of dynamic genome organization in regulation of differential gene expression between different cell types, and indicate the impact of intra-TAD enhancer-promoter interactions that are established under basal conditions on both the basal and treatment-induced gene expression programs.",

    "abstract": "Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian nervous system is largely mediated by GABAA receptors, chloride-selective members of the superfamily of pentameric Cys-loop receptors. Native GABAA receptors are heteromeric assemblies sensitive to many important drugs, from sedatives to anesthetics and anticonvulsive agents, with mutant forms of GABAA receptors implicated in multiple neurological diseases, including epilepsy. Despite the profound importance of heteromeric GABAA receptors in neuroscience and medicine, they have proven recalcitrant to structure determination. Here we present the structure of the triheteromeric 1{beta}1{gamma}2EM GABAA receptor in complex with GABA, determined by single particle cryo-EM at 3.1-3.8 [A] resolution, elucidating the molecular principles of receptor assembly and agonist binding. Remarkable N-linked glycosylation on the 1 subunit occludes the extracellular vestibule of the ion channel and is poised to modulate receptor assembly and perhaps ion channel gating. Our work provides a pathway to structural studies of heteromeric GABAA receptors and a framework for the rational design of novel therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "For improving the microbial production of fuels and chemicals, gene knock-outs and overexpression are routinely applied to intensify the carbon flow from substrate to product.

The production of single cell oils is especially challenging, as the synthesis is strongly regulated, competes directly with biomass, and requires defined conditions, such as nitrogen limitation.

    "abstract": "The structure of mRNA in vivo is influenced by various factors involved in the translation process, resulting in significant differentiation of mRNA structure from that in vitro. Because multiple factors cause the differentiation of in vivo and in vitro mRNA structures, it was difficult to perform a more accurate analysis of mRNA structures in previous studies. In this study, we have proposed a novel application of a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the structural stability of mRNA in vivo by fitting six quantifiable features that may affect mRNA folding: ribosome density, minimum folding free energy, GC content, mRNA abundance, ribosomal initial density and position of mRNA structure. Simulated mutations of the mRNA structure were designed and then fed into the trained DNN model to compute their structural stability. We found unique effects of these six features on mRNA structural stability in vivo. Strikingly, the ribosome density of the structural region is the most important factor affecting the structural stability of mRNA in vivo, and the strength of the mRNA structure in vitro should have a relatively small effect on its structural stability in vivo. The recruitment of DNNs provides a new paradigm to decipher the differentiation of mRNA structure in vivo and in vitro. This improved knowledge on the mechanisms of factors influencing mRNA structural stability will facilitate the design and functional analysis of mRNA structure in vivo.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentifying and characterizing the function of non coding regions in the genome, and the genetic variants disrupting gene regulation, is a challenging question in genetics. Through the use of high throughput experimental assays that provide information about the chromatin state within a cell, coupled with modern computational approaches, much progress has been made towards this goal, yet we still lack a comprehensive characterization of the regulatory grammar. We propose a new method that combines sequence and chromatin accessibility information through a neural network framework with the goal of determining and annotating the effect of genetic variants on regulation of chromatin accessibility and gene transcription. Importantly, our new approach can consider multiple combinations of transcription factors binding at the same location when assessing the functional impact of non-coding genetic variation.\\n\\nResultsOur method, circuitSNPs, generates predictions describing the functional effect of genetic variants on local chromatin accessibility. Further, we demonstrate that circuitSNPs not only performs better than other variant annotation tools, but also retains the causal motifs / transcription factors that drive the predicted regulatory effect.\\n\\nContactfluca@wayne.edu, rpique@wayne.edu\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://github.com/piquelab/circuitSNPs",

    "abstract": "Prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e. TF regulon) is becoming a widely-used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and datasets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are: (i) manually curated repositories, (ii) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (iii) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (iv) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression datasets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations, and thereby downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark datasets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions among 1,541 TFs, and evaluated how the different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity changes. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies with a confidence score, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.",

    "abstract": "Variation at the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster is functionally associated with differences in lipid metabolism and is often hypothesized to reflect adaptation to an agricultural diet. Here, we test the evidence for this relationship using both modern and ancient DNA data. We show that almost all the inhabitants of Europe carried the ancestral allele until the derived allele was introduced approximately 8,500 years ago by Early Neolithic farming populations. However, we also show that it was not under strong selection in these populations. We find that this allele, and other proposed agricultural adaptations at LCT/MCM6 and SLC22A4, were not strongly selected until much later, perhaps as late as the Bronze Age. Similarly, increased copy number variation at the salivary amylase gene AMY1 is not linked to the development of agriculture although, in this case, the putative adaptation precedes the agricultural transition. Our analysis shows that selection at the FADS locus was not tightly linked to the initial introduction of agriculture and the Neolithic transition. Further, it suggests that the strongest signals of recent human adaptation in Europe did not coincide with the Neolithic transition but with more recent changes in environment, diet or efficiency of selection due to increases in effective population size.",

    "abstract": "A now classical argument for the marginal thermodynamic stability of proteins explains the distribution of observed protein stabilities as a consequence of an entropic pull in protein sequence space. In particular, most sequences that are sufficiently stable to fold will have stabilities near the folding threshold. Here we extend this argument to consider its predictions for epistatic interactions for the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding. Although there is abundant evidence to indicate that the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding are nearly additive and conserved over evolutionary time, we show that these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that a non-additive contribution to the folding free energy is essential for observed proteins to maintain their native structure. In particular through both simulations and analytical results, we show that even very small departures from additivity are sufficient to drive this effect.",
