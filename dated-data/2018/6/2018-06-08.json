    "abstract": "Liver cancer is among the top deadly cancers worldwide with a very poor prognosis, and the liver is a particularly vulnerable site for metastasis of other cancers. In this study, we developed a novel computational framework for the stage-specific analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma initiation and progression. Using publicly available clinical and RNA-Seq data of cancer samples and controls, we annotated the gene expression matrix with sample stages. We performed a linear modelling analysis of gene expression across all stages and found significant genome-wide changes in gene expression in cancer samples relative to control. Using a contrast against the control, we were able to identify differentially expressed genes (log fold change >2) that were significant at an adjusted p-value < 10E-3. In order to identify genes that were specific to each stage without confounding differential expression in other stages, we developed a full set of pairwise stage contrasts and enforced a p-value threshold (<0.05) for each such contrast. Genes were specific for a stage if they passed all the significance filters for that stage. Our analysis yielded two stage-I specific genes (CA9, WNT7B), two stage-II specific genes (APOBEC3B, FAM186A), ten stage-III specific genes including DLG5, PARI and GNMT, and ten stage-IV specific genes including GABRD, PGAM2 and PECAM1. Of these, only APOBEC3B is an established cancer driver gene. DLG5 was found to be tumor-promoting contrary to the cancer literature on this gene. Further, GABRD, well studied in literature on other cancers, emerged as a stage-IV specific gene. Our findings could be validated using multiple sources of omics data as well as experimentally. The biomarkers identified herein could potentially underpin diagnosis as well as pinpoint drug targets.",

    "abstract": "The harmonious orchestration of intercellular communication is essential for multicellular organisms. One mechanism by which cells communicate is through long, actin-rich membranous protrusions, called tunneling nanotubes, that allow for the intercellular transport of various cargoes, including viruses, organelles, and proteins between the cytoplasm of distant cells in vitro and in vivo. Over the last decade, studies have focused on their functional role but information regarding their structure and the differences with other cellular protrusions such as filopodia, is still lacking. Here, we report the structural characterization of tunneling nanotubes using correlative light- and cryo-electron microscopy approaches. We demonstrate their structural identity compared to filopodia by showing that they are comprised of a bundle of functional individual Tunneling Nanotubes containing membrane-bound compartments and allowing organelle transfer.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium crown rot (FCR), caused by Fusarium culmorum (Wm.G.Sm) Sacc., is an important disease of wheat both in Iraq and other regions of wheat production worldwide. Changes in environmental conditions and cultural practices such as crop rotation generate stress on pathogen populations leading to the evolution of new strains that can tolerate more stressful environments. This study aims to investigate the genetic diversity among isolates of F. culmorum in Iraq. Twenty-nine samples were collected from different regions of wheat cultivation in Iraq to investigate the pathogenicity and genetic diversity of F. culmorum using the REP-PCR technique. Among the twenty-nine isolates of F. culmorum examined for pathogenicity, 96% were pathogenic to wheat at the seedling stage. The most aggressive isolate, from Baghdad, was IF 0021 at 0.890 on the FCR severity index. Three primer sets were used to assess the genotypic diversity via REP, ERIC and BOX elements. The amplicon sizes ranged from 200-800 bp for BOX-ERIC2, 110-1100 bp for ERIC-ERIC2 and 200-1300 bp for REP. In total, 410 markers were polymorphic, including 106 for BOX, 175 for ERIC and 129 for the REP. Genetic similarity was calculated by comparing markers according to minimum variance (Squared Euclidean). Clustering analysis generated two major groups, group 1 with two subgroup 1a and 1b with 5 and 12 isolates respectively, and group 2 with two subgroups 2a and 2b with 3 and 9 isolates respectively. This is the first study in this field that has been reported in Iraq.",

    "abstract": "The vitamin B12 family of cofactors known as cobamides are essential for a variety of microbial metabolisms. We used comparative genomics of 11,000 bacterial species to analyze the extent and distribution of cobamide production and use across bacteria. We find that 86% of bacteria in this data set have at least one of 15 cobamide-dependent enzyme families, yet only 37% are predicted to synthesize cobamides de novo. The distribution of cobamide biosynthesis varies at the phylum level, with 57% of Actinobacteria, 45% of Proteobacteria, and 30% of Firmicutes, and less than 1% of Bacteroidetes containing the complete biosynthetic pathway. Cobamide structure could be predicted for 58% of cobamide-producing species, based on the presence of signature lower ligand biosynthesis and attachment genes. Our predictions also revealed that 17% of bacteria that have partial biosynthetic pathways, yet have the potential to salvage cobamide precursors. These include a newly defined, experimentally verified category of bacteria lacking the first step in the biosynthesis pathway. These predictions highlight the importance of cobamide and cobamide precursor crossfeeding as examples of nutritional dependencies in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Studies of gene expression have provided insights on the regulation of Plasmodium parasites. However, few studies have targeted P. vivax, the cause of one third of all human malaria cases outside Africa, due to the lack of in vitro culture system and the difficulties associated with studying clinical samples. Here, we describe robust RNA-seq profiles of P. vivax parasites generated directly from infected patient blood. Gene expression deconvolution analysis reveals that most parasite mRNAs derive from trophozoites and that the asynchronicity of P. vivax infections is unlikely to confound gene expression studies. We also show that gametocyte genes form two clusters of co-regulated genes, possibly indicating the independent regulation of male and female gametocytogeneses. Finally, despite a large effect on parasitemia, we find that chloroquine does not alter trophozoite gene expression. Overall, our study highlights the biological knowledge that can be gathered by directly studying P. vivax patient infections.\\n\\nImportancePlasmodium vivax is the second most common cause of human malaria worldwide but, since it cannot be cultured in the laboratory, its biology remains poorly understood. In this study, we describe the analysis of the parasite gene expression profiles generated from 26 patient infections. We show that the proportion of male and female parasites varies greatly among infections, suggesting that they are independently regulated. We also compare the gene expression profiles of the same infections before and after treatment with chloroquine, a common antimalarial, and show that the drug efficiently kills most P. vivax parasites but appears to have little effect on one specific parasite stage, the trophozoites, in contrast with the effect of the drug on P. falciparum. Overall, our study exemplifies the biological insights that can be gained from applying modern genomic tools to study this difficult human pathogen.",

    "abstract": "StkP and PhpP of Streptococcus pneumoniae have been confirmed to compose a signaling couple, in which the former is a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase while the latter was annotated as a phosphotase. StkP has been reported to be involved in penicillin-binding protein (PBP)-independent penicillin resistance of S. pneumoniae. However, the enzymatic characterization of PhpP and the role of PhpP in StkP-PhpP couple remain poorly understood. Here we showed that 1/4 minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin (PCN) or cefotaxime (CTX), the representatives of {beta}-lactam antibiotics, could induce the expression of stkP and phpP genes and phosphorylation of StkP in PCN/CTX-sensitive strain ATCC6306 and three isolates of S. pneumoniae (MICs: 0.02-0.5 g/ml). The product of phpP gene hydrolyzed PP2C type Ser/Thr phosphotase-specific RRA(pT)VA phosphopeptide substrate with the Km and Kcat values of 277.35 mol/L and 0.71 S-1, and the hydrolytic activity was blocked by sodium fluoride, a PP2C type Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor. The phosphorylation levels of StkP in the four phpP gene-knockout ({Delta}phpP) mutants were significantly higher than that in the wild-type strains. In particular, the MICs of PCN and CTX against the {Delta}phpP mutants were significantly elevated as 4-16 g/ml. Therefore, our findings confirmed that sublethal PCN and CTX act as environmental inducers to cause the increase of phpP and stkP gene expression and StkP phosphorylation. PhpP is a PP2C type Ser/Thr protein phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of StkP. Knockout of the phpP gene results in a high level of StkP phosphorylation and PBP-independent PCN/CTX resistance of S. pneumoniae.\\n\\nImportanceStreptococcus pneumoniae is a common pathogen in human populations in many countries and areas due to the prevalence of {beta}-lactam antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal strains. Production of {beta}-lactamases and mutation of penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) have been considered as the major {beta}-lactam antibiotic-resistant mechanisms in bacteria, but S. pneumoniae has not been confirmed to produce any {beta}-lactamases and many pneumococcal strains present PBP mutation-independent {beta}-lactam antibiotic resistance. StkP is a Ser/Thr kinase of S. pneumoniae to compose a signal-couple with PhpP protein. The present study demonstrated that the PhpP is a PP2C-type phosphotase for dephosphorylation of StkP and the sublethal penicillin (PCN) or cefotaxime (CTX) acted as environmental signal molecules to induce the expression of PhpP. The knockout of PhpP-encoding gene caused the PCN/CTX resistance generation of PCN/CTX-sensitive pneumococcal strains. All the data indicate that StkP-PhpP couple of S. pneumoniae is involved in PBP mutation-independent {beta}-lactam antibiotic resistance by phosphorylation of StkP.",

    "abstract": "The inactive X chromosome (Xi) in female mammals adopts an atypical higher-order chromatin structure, manifested as a global loss of local topologically associated domains (TADs), and formation of two mega-domains. In this study we demonstrate that the non-canonical SMC family protein, SmcHD1, which is important for gene silencing on Xi, contributes to this unique chromosome architecture. Specifically, allelic mapping of the transcriptome and epigenome in SmcHD1 null cells revealed the appearance of sub-megabase domains defined by gene activation, CpG hypermethylation and depletion of Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3. These domains, which correlate with sites of SmcHD1 enrichment on Xi in wild-type cells, additionally adopt features of active X chromosome higher-order chromosome architecture, including partial restoration of TAD boundaries. Xi chromosome architecture changes also occurred in an acute SmcHD1 knockout model, but in this case, independent of Xi gene de-repression. We conclude that SmcHD1 is a key factor in antagonising TAD formation on Xi.",

    "abstract": "The majority of conclusions and interpretations in quantitative sciences such as neuroscience are based on statistical tests. However, the statistical inferences, especially in multivariate analyses, commonly rely on the p-values, but not on more expressive measures such as posterior probabilities, false discovery rates (FDR) and statistical power (1 - {beta}). The aim of this report is to make these statistical measures further accessible in single and multiple statistical testing. For multiple testing, the Empirical Bayesian Inference (Efron et al., 2001; Efron, 2007) was implemented using non-parametric test statistics (e.g. the Area Under the Curve of the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve or Spearmans rank correlation) and Gaussian Mixture Model estimation of the probability density function of the original and bootstrapped data. For single statistical tests, the same test statistics were used to construct and estimate the null and non-null probability density functions using bootstrapping under null and non-null grouping assumptions. Simulations were used to test the reliability of the results under a wide range of conditions. The results show conformity to the real truth in the simulated conditions, which is held under various conditions imposed on the simulated data. The open-source MATLAB codes are provided and the utility of the approach has been exemplified and discussed for real-world electroencephalographic signals. This implementation of Empirical Bayesian Inference and informed selection of statistical thresholds are expected to facilitate more realistic scientific deductions in versatile fields, especially in neuroscience, neural signal analysis and neuro-imaging.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian olfactory bulb has presented a challenging system for understanding information processing, in part because the bulb largely lacks the topographical ordering of neurons that promotes processes such as lateral inhibition. Here we have used dual and triple-cell recordings in rodent bulb slices combined with ultrastructural methods to provide the first experimental evidence for a processing mechanism circumventing this problem that operates at the level of single glomeruli, the bulbs odorant receptor-specific modules. A key feature is non-traditional, extrasynaptic glutamatergic signaling derived from excitatory interneurons and what it means for the local balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I). We found that the distinct dynamic properties of extrasynaptic excitation versus synaptic inhibition create a thresholding effect whereby only strong stimuli produce a favorable E/I balance enabling an output. This single-glomerulus threshold could have a number of important functions during natural odor responses, for example enhancing stimulus tuning.",

    "abstract": "Myelin insulates and protects axons in vertebrate nervous systems. In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes (OLs) make numerous myelin sheaths on multiple axons, whereas in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelinating Schwann cells (SCs) make just one myelin sheath on a single axon. Why the myelinating potentials of OLs and SCs are so fundamentally different is unclear. Here, we find that loss of Fbxw7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, enhances the myelinating potential of SCs. Fbxw7 mutant SCs are seen myelinating multiple axons in a fashion reminiscent of OLs as well as aberrantly myelinating large axons while simultaneously ensheathing small unmyelinated axons - typically distinct roles of myelinating SCs and non-myelinating Remak SCs, respectively. We found that several of the Fbxw7 mutant phenotypes, including the ability to generate thicker myelin sheaths, were due to dysregulation of mTOR. However, the remarkable ability of mutant SCs to either myelinate multiple axons or myelinate some axons while simultaneously encompassing other unmyelinated axons is independent of mTOR signaling. This indicates distinct roles for Fbxw7 in regulating multiple aspects of SC behavior and that novel Fbxw7-regulated mechanisms control modes of myelination previously thought to fundamentally distinguish myelinating SCs from non-myelinating SCs and OLs. Our data reveal unexpected plasticity in the myelinating potential of SCs, which may have important implications for our understanding of both PNS and CNS myelination and myelin repair.",

    "abstract": "The integration of distinct sensory modalities is essential for behavioural decision making. In C. elegans this process is coordinated by neural circuits that integrate sensory cues from the environment to generate an appropriate behaviour at the appropriate output muscles. Food is a multimodal cue that impacts on the microcircuits to modulating feeding and foraging drivers at the level of the pharyngeal and body wall muscle respectively. When food triggers an upregulation in pharyngeal pumping it allows the effective ingestion of food. Here we show that a C. elegans mutant in the single orthologous gene of human neuroligins, nlg-1 are defective in food induced pumping. This is not explained by an inability to sense food, as nlg-1 mutants are not defective in chemotaxis towards bacteria. In addition, we show that neuroligin is widely expressed in the nervous system including AIY, ADE, ALA, URX and HSN neurones. Interestingly, despite the deficit in pharyngeal pumping neuroligin is not expressed within the pharyngeal neuromuscular network, which suggests an extrapharyngeal regulation of this circuit. We resolve electrophysiologically the neuroligin contribution to the pharyngeal circuit by mimicking a food-dependent pumping, and show that the nlg-1 phenotype is similar to mutants impaired in GABAergic and/or glutamatergic signalling. We suggest that neuroligin organizes extrapharyngeal circuits that regulate the pharynx. These observations based on the molecular and cellular determinants of feeding are consistent with the emerging role of neuroligin in discretely impacting functional circuits underpinning complex behaviours.",

We hypothesized that large-scale dynamics are also shaped by heterogeneity of intrinsic local properties across cortical areas. One key axis along which microcircuit properties are specialized relates to hierarchical levels of cortical organization. We developed a large-scale dynamical circuit model of human cortex that incorporates heterogeneity of local synaptic strengths, following a hierarchical axis inferred from MRI-derived T1w/T2w mapping, and fit the model using multimodal neuroimaging data. We found that incorporating hierarchical heterogeneity substantially improves the model fit to fMRI-measured resting-state functional connectivity and captures sensory-association organization of multiple fMRI features. The model predicts hierarchically organized high-frequency spectral power, which we tested with resting-state magnetoencephalography. These findings suggest circuit-level mechanisms linking spatiotemporal levels of analysis and highlight the importance of local properties and their hierarchical specialization on the large-scale organization of human cortical dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Scientific progress depends on evidence-based research, and reliance on accurate scholarship is essential when making management decisions for imperiled species. However, erroneous claims are sometimes perpetuated in the scientific and technical literature, which can complicate policy and regulatory judgments. The literature associated with two enigmatic California desert vertebrates, the Panamint alligator lizard Elgaria panamintina and the Inyo Mountains salamander Batrachoseps campi, exemplifies this problem. We produced a comprehensive threat analysis and status assessment for these species, which are both under review for possible listing under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA). Despite uncertainties and limited data, we find that many sources contain factual errors about the status of these two species, particularly the original petition that advocated for ESA listing. Although localized declines may have gone undetected, no evidence exists of population declines, population extirpation, or population-scale habitat conversion for E. panamintina. However, there is evidence of recent flash flood damage to some occupied B. campi habitat, which has possibly led to population declines at those localities. Contrary to inaccurate statements by some authors, all known populations of both species occur exclusively on federal lands, and numerous populations have likely benefited from recent federal management targeted at reducing known threats. Of the 12 threats that we identified for one or both species, only three currently appear to be serious: water diversions, climate change, and flash floods. The remaining threats are neither widespread nor severe, despite numerous contrary yet poorly supported statements in the literature. We thus evaluate the contemporary conservation status of both species as relatively secure, although B. campi is more at-risk compared to E. panamintina. This conclusion is independently supported by a recent review. Nonetheless, ongoing stewardship of these species in a multi-use context by federal agencies remains vital, and we identify several priority management actions and research needs for both species. We also recommend updated determinations on the IUCN Red List, and the Species of Conservation Concern list of the Inyo National Forest. To maximize the quality and effectiveness of conservation planning, we urge government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and individual scientists to maintain high standards of scholarship and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster are known to live in a social but cryptic world of touch and odours, but the extent to which they can perceive and integrate visual information is a hotly debated topic. Some researchers fixate on the limited resolution of D. melanogasters optics, others on their seemingly identical appearance; yet there is evidence of individual recognition and surprising visual learning in flies. Here, we apply machine learning and show that individual D. melanogaster are visually distinct. We also use the striking similarity of Drosophilas visual system to current convolutional neural networks to theoretically investigate D. melanogasters capacity for visual understanding. We find that, despite their limited optical resolution, D. melanogasters neuronal architecture has the capability to extract and encode a rich feature set that allows flies to re-identify individual conspecifics with surprising accuracy. These experiments provide a proof of principle that Drosophila inhabit in a much more complex visual world than previously appreciated.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn this paper, we determine a proof of principle for inter-individual recognition in two parts; is there enough information contained in low resolution pictures for inter-fly discrimination, and if so does Drosophilas visual system have enough capacity to use it. We show that the information contained in a 29x29 pixel image (number of ommatidia in a fly eye) is sufficient to achieve 94% accuracy in fly re-identification. Further, we show that the fly eye has the theoretical capacity to identify another fly with about 75% accuracy. Although it is unlikely that flies use the exact algorithm we tested, our results show that, in principle, flies may be using visual perception in ways that are not usually appreciated.",

We perform numerical simulations of this model in order to study the mechanics of cell-cell separation.

Using this model, we show that mechanical parameters can be obtained that are consistent with both Dual Pipette Aspiration (DPA) and Micropipette Aspiration (MA), a problem not successfully tackled so far. We estimate a cortex elastic modulus of Ec {approx} 15 kPa, an effective cortex thickness of tc {approx} 0.3 {micro}m and an active tension of{gamma} {approx} 0.4 nN/{micro}m. With these parameters, a JKR-like scaling of the separation force is recovered. Finally, the change of contact radius with applied force in a pull-off experiment was investigated. For small forces, a scaling similar to both BWdG and DMT is found.\\n\\nManuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal.",

    "abstract": "Redistribution of heterochromatin during aging has been linked to the de-repression of transposable elements and an overall loss of gene regulation in the soma. Whether or not epigenetic factors such as heterochromatin marks are perturbed in reproductive and germline tissues is of particular interest because some epigenetic factors are known to transmit across generations. Additionally, the relative contribution of factors intrinsic or extrinsic to the germ line have in reproductive decline remains unknown. Using mRNA sequencing data from late stage egg chambers in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that age-related expression changes occur in genes residing in heterochromatin, particularly on the largely heterochromatic 4th chromosome. In addition, we identify an increase in expression of the piRNA machinery. We further identify a striking age-related reduction in mitochondrial transcripts that we can attribute to the somatic tissues. Other than a modest increase in overall TE expression in the aging germline, we find no global TE de-repression in reproductive tissues. Rather, the observed effects of aging on TEs are primarily strain and family specific. These results indicate unique responses in somatic versus germline tissue with regards to epigenetic aging effects and suggest that the global loss of TE control observed in other studies may be specific to certain tissues, genetic backgrounds and TE family. This study also demonstrates that while age-related effects can be maternally transmitted, the germline is generally robust to age-related changes.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evolution with microbes is often highly repeatable under identical conditions, suggesting the possibility to predict short-term evolution. However, it is not clear to what degree evolutionary forecasts can be extended to related species in non-identical environments, which would allow testing of general predictive models and fundamental biological assumptions. To develop an extended model system for evolutionary forecasting, we used previous data and models of the genotype-to-phenotype map from the wrinkly spreader system in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 to make predictions of evolutionary outcomes on different biological levels for Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5. In addition to sequence divergence (78% amino acid and 81% nucleotide identity) for the genes targeted by mutations, these species also differ in the inability of Pf-5 to make cellulose, which is the main structural basis for the adaptive phenotype in SBW25. The experimental conditions were also changed compared to the SBW25 system to test the robustness of forecasts to environmental variation. Forty-three mutants with increased ability to colonize the air-liquid interface were isolated, and the majority had reduced motility and was partly dependent on the pel exopolysaccharide as a structural component. Most (38/43) mutations are expected to disrupt negative regulation of the same three diguanylate cyclases as in SBW25, with a smaller number of mutations in promoter regions, including that of an uncharacterized polysaccharide operon. A mathematical model developed for SBW25 predicted the order of the three main pathways and the genes targeted by mutations, but differences in fitness between mutants and mutational biases also appear to influence outcomes. Mutated regions in proteins could be predicted in most cases (16/22), but parallelism at the nucleotide level was low and mutational hot spots were not conserved. This study demonstrates the potential of short-term evolutionary forecasting in experimental populations and provides testable predictions for evolutionary outcomes in other Pseudomonas species.\n\nAuthor SummaryBiological evolution is often repeatable in the short-term suggesting the possibility of forecasting and controlling evolutionary outcomes. In addition to its fundamental importance for biology, evolutionary processes are at the core of several major societal problems, including infectious diseases, cancer and adaptation to climate change. Experimental evolution allows study of evolutionary processes in real time and seems like an ideal way to test the predictability of evolution and our ability to make forecasts. However, lack of model systems where forecasts can be extended to other species evolving under different conditions has prevented studies that first predict evolutionary outcomes followed by direct testing. We showed that a well-characterized bacterial experimental evolution system, based on biofilm formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens at the surface of static growth tubes, can be extended to the related species Pseudomonas protegens. We tested evolutionary forecasts experimentally and showed that mutations mainly appear in the predicted genes resulting in similar phenotypes. We also identified factors that we cannot yet predict, such as variation in mutation rates and differences in fitness. Finally, we make forecasts for other Pseudomonas species to be tested in future experiments.",

Interestingly, a majority of these microbial taxa, including the most heritable bacterial family, Christensenellaceae, overlap with genetically-associated taxa and form co-occurring clusters linked by similar fermentative and methanogenic metabolic processes.

Here we reveal the non-canonical SMC protein Smchd1 as a novel regulator of long-range chromatin interactions, and add it to the canon of epigenetic proteins required for Hox gene regulation. The effect of losing Smchd1-dependent chromatin interactions has varying outcomes dependent on chromatin context. At autosomal targets transcriptionally sensitive to Smchd1 deletion, we find increased short-range interactions and ectopic enhancer activation. By contrast, the inactive X chromosome is transcriptionally refractive to Smchd1 ablation, despite chromosome-wide increases in short-range interactions. There we observe spreading of H3K27me3 domains into regions not normally decorated by this mark. Together these data suggest Smchd1 has the capacity to insulate the chromatin, thereby limiting access to other chromatin modifying proteins.",

One context included painful shocks administered just after presentation of some of the words; the other context involved no shocks. For the context that included painful stimulations, every other word was followed by a shock and subjects were informed to expect this pattern. Word lists were repeated three times within each context in randomized order, with different category judgments but consistent pain-word pairings. After a brief delay, recognition memory was assessed. Non-pain words from the pain context were less strongly encoded than non-pain words from the completely pain-free context. An important accompanying finding is that response times to repeated experimental items were slower for non-pain words from the pain context, compared to non-pain words from the completely pain-free context. This demonstrates that the effect of pain on memory may generalize to non-pain items experienced in the same experimental context.",

Exosomes released by glioblastoma cross the blood-brain-barrier into the peripheral circulation, and carry molecular cargo distinct to that of  free-circulating miRNA. In this pilot study, serum exosomal-microRNAs were isolated from glioblastoma (n=12) patients and analyzed using unbiased deep sequencing. Results were compared to sera from age- and gender-matched healthy controls, and to grades II-III (n=10) glioma patients. Significant differentially expressed microRNAs were identified, and the predictive power of individual and subsets of microRNAs were tested using univariate and multivariate analyses. Additional sera from glioblastoma patients (n=4) and independent sets of healthy (n=9) and non-glioma (n=10) controls were used to further test the specificity and predictive power of this unique exosomal-microRNA signature. Twenty-six microRNAs were differentially expressed in serum exosomes from glioblastoma patients relative to healthy controls. Random forest modeling and data partitioning selected seven miRNAs (miR-182-5p, miR-328-3p, miR-339-5p, miR-340-5p, miR-485-3p, miR-486-5p and miR-543) as the most stable for classifying glioblastoma. Strikingly, within this model, six iterations of these miRNA classifiers could distinguish glioblastoma patients from controls with perfect accuracy. The seven-miRNA panel was able to correctly classify all specimens in validation cohorts (n=23). Also identified were 23 dysregulated miRNAs in IDHMUT gliomas, a partially overlapping yet distinct signature of lower grade glioma. Serum exosomal-miRNA signatures can accurately diagnose glioblastoma preoperatively. miRNA signatures identified are distinct from previously reported  free-circulating miRNA studies in GBM patients, and appear to be superior.",

Further, iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics of yeast whole cell lysate showed that the level of heterologous fusion protein was low in cells stored at 23-25 {degrees}C compared to those at 2-8 {degrees}C.

Proper membrane physiology requires maintenance of a narrow range of physicochemical properties, which must be buffered from external perturbations. While homeostatic adaptation of membrane fluidity to temperature variation is a ubiquitous design feature of ectothermic organisms, such responsive membrane adaptation to external inputs has not been directly observed in mammals. Here, we report that challenging mammalian membrane homeostasis by dietary lipids leads to robust lipidomic remodeling to preserve membrane physical properties. Specifically, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are rapidly and extensively incorporated into membrane lipids, inducing a reduction in membrane packing. These effects are rapidly compensated both in culture and in vivo by lipidome-wide remodeling, most notably upregulation of saturated lipids and cholesterol. These lipidomic changes result in recovery of membrane packing and permeability. This lipidomic and biophysical compensation is mediated in part by lipid regulatory machinery, whose pharmacological or genetic abrogation results in cytotoxicity when membrane homeostasis is challenged by dietary lipids. These results reveal an essential mammalian mechanism for membrane homeostasis wherein lipidome remodeling in response to dietary lipid inputs preserves functional membrane phenotypes.",

However, the relationship between plasticity and transgenerational epigenetic memory is not understood. Dauer diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans provides an opportunity to determine how a plastic response to the early-life environment affects traits later in life and in subsequent generations. We report that after extended diapause, post-dauer worms initially exhibit reduced reproductive success and greater inter-individual variation. In contrast, F3 progeny of post-dauers display increased starvation resistance and lifespan, revealing potentially adaptive transgenerational effects. Transgenerational effects are dependent on the duration of diapause, indicating an effect of extended starvation. In agreement, RNA-seq demonstrates a transgenerational effect on nutrient-responsive genes. Further, post-dauer F3 progeny exhibit reduced gene expression plasticity, suggesting a trade-off between plasticity and epigenetic memory. This work reveals complex effects of nutrient stress over different time scales in an animal that evolved to thrive in feast and famine.",

    "abstract": "Real-time neurofeedback enables human subjects to learn to regulate their brain activity, effecting behavioral changes and improvements of psychiatric symptomatology. Neurofeedback up-regulation and down-regulation have been assumed to share common neural correlates. Neuropsychiatric pathology and aging incur suboptimal functioning of the default mode network. Despite the exponential increase in real-time neuroimaging studies, the effects of aging, pathology and the direction of regulation on neurofeedback performance remain largely unknown. Using open-access analyses and real-time fMRI data shared through the Rockland Sample Real-Time Neurofeedback project (N=136), we first modeled neurofeedback performance and learning in a group of subjects with psychiatric history (na=74) and a healthy control group (nb=62). Subsequently, we examined the relationship between up-regulation and down-regulation learning, the relationship between age and neurofeedback performance in each group and differences in neurofeedback performance between the two groups. Results show that in an initial session of default mode network neurofeedback with real-time fMRI, up-regulation and down-regulation learning scores are negatively correlated. Moreover, age correlates negatively with default mode network neurofeedback performance, only in absence of psychiatric history. Finally, adults with psychiatric history outperform healthy controls in default mode network up-regulation. Interestingly, the performance difference is related to no up-regulation learning in controls.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the visual system encodes natural scenes is a fundamental goal of sensory neuroscience. We show here that a three-layer network model predicts the retinal response to natural scenes with an accuracy nearing the fundamental limits of predictability. The models internal structure is interpretable, in that model units are highly correlated with interneurons recorded separately and not used to fit the model. We further show the ethological relevance to natural visual processing of a diverse set of phenomena of complex motion encoding, adaptation and predictive coding. Our analysis uncovers a fast timescale of visual processing that is inaccessible directly from experimental data, showing unexpectedly that ganglion cells signal in distinct modes by rapidly (< 0.1 s) switching their selectivity for direction of motion, orientation, location and the sign of intensity. A new approach that decomposes ganglion cell responses into the contribution of interneurons reveals how the latent effects of parallel retinal circuits generate the response to any possible stimulus. These results reveal extremely flexible and rapid dynamics of the retinal code for natural visual stimuli, explaining the need for a large set of interneuron pathways to generate the dynamic neural code for natural scenes.",

    "abstract": "In flies, the olfactory information is carried from the first relay in the brain, the antennal lobe, to the mushroom body (MB) and the lateral horn (LH). Olfactory associations are formed in the MB. The LH was ascribed a role in innate responses based on the stereotyped connectivity with the antennal lobe, stereotyped physiological responses to odors and MB silencing experiments. Direct evidence for the functional role of the LH is still missing. Here we investigate the behavioral role of the LH neurons directly, using the CO2 response as a paradigm. Our results show the involvement of the LH in innate responses. Specifically, we demonstrate that activity in two sets of neurons is required for the full behavioral response to CO2. Using calcium imaging we observe that the two sets of neurons respond to CO2 in different manners. Using independent manipulation and recording of the two sets of neurons we find that the one that projects to the SIP also outputs to the local neurons within the LH. The design of simultaneous output at the LH and the SIP, an output of the MB, allows for coordination between innate and learned responses.",

    "abstract": "The availability of high-resolution single-cell data makes data analysis and interpretation an important open problem, for example, to disentangle sources of cell-to-cell and intra-cellular variability. Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMEs), well established in pharmacometrics, account for such multiple sources of variations, but their estimation is often difficult. Single-cell analysis is an even more challenging application with larger data sets and models that are more complicated. Here, we show how to leverage the quality of time-lapse microscopy data with a simple two-stage method to estimate realistic dynamic NLMEs accurately. We demonstrate accuracy by benchmarking with a published model and dataset, and scalability with a new mechanistic model and corresponding dataset for amino acid transporter endocytosis in budding yeast. We also propose variation-based sensitivity analysis to identify time-dependent causes of cell-to-cell variability, highlighting important sub-processes in endocytosis. Generality and simplicity of the approach will facilitate customized extensions for analyzing single-cell dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Germline DNA damage is a double-edged sword. Programmed double-strand breaks establish the foundation for meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation. However, double-strand breaks also pose a significant challenge for genome stability. Because of this, meiotic double-strand break formation is tightly regulated. However, natural selection can favor selfish behavior in the germline and transposable elements can cause double-strand breaks independent of the carefully regulated meiotic process. To understand how the regulatory mechanisms of meiotic recombination accommodate unregulated transposition, we have characterized the female recombination landscape in a syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis. In this system, a cross between two strains of D. virilis with divergent transposable element and piRNA profiles results in germline transposition of diverse transposable elements, reduced fertility, and male recombination. We sought to determine how increased transposition during hybrid dysgenesis might perturb the meiotic recombination landscape. Our results show that the overall frequency and distribution of meiotic recombination is extremely robust to germline transposable element activation. However, we also find that hybrid dysgenesis can result in mitotic recombination within the female germline. Overall, these results show that landscape of meiotic recombination may be insensitive to the DNA damage caused by transposition during early development.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is critical to many aspects of cognition, but it frequently fails. Much WM research has focused on capacity limits, but even for single, simple features, the fidelity of individual representations is limited. Why is this? We used fMRI and a pattern-based index of \\\"representational drift\\\" to investigate how ongoing changes in brain activity patterns throughout the WM maintenance period predicted performance, using a delayed-match-to-sample task for a single item with a single critical feature: orientation. In trials where the target and probe stimuli matched, participants incorrectly reported more non-matches when their activity patterns drifted away from the target. In trials where the target and probe did not match, participants incorrectly reported more matches when their activity patterns drifted towards the probe. Our results suggest that WM errors are not simply due to unstructured noise, but also drift within representation space that can be indexed by neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Fatal cardiac arrhythmias are caused by some, but not all, drugs that inhibit the cardiac rapid delayed-rectifier current (IKr) by blocking hERG channels. Here, we propose a novel mechanism that could make certain hERG blockers less proarrhythmic. Several drugs that block hERG channels, yet have favorable cardiac safety profiles, also evoke another effect; they increase the current amplitude upon low-voltage depolarization (facilitation). Voltage-clamp recordings of hERG block and facilitation by nifekalant, a Class III antiarrhythmic agent, constrained a model of human cardiac IKr. In human ventricular action potential simulations, nifekalant showed its therapeutic ability to suppress ectopic excitations, with or without facilitation. Without facilitation, excessive IKr block evoked early afterdepolarizations, which cause lethal arrhythmias. Facilitation prevented early afterdepolarizations at the same degree of block by increasing IKr during repolarization phase of action potentials. Thus, facilitation is proposed to reduce the arrhythmogenic risk of hERG blockers.\\n\\nAbbreviationsAP: action potential; APD: action potential duration; APD90: action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization; EAD: early afterdepolarization; hERG: human ether-ago-go-related gene; ICaL: L-type Ca2+ channel current; Inet: net ionic current; IK1: inward-rectifier potassium current; IKr: rapid component of the delayed-rectifier potassium current; INa: sodium current; ORd: OHara-Rudy dynamic",

Yet, little is known about how the response to limiting water supply changes among closely related plant species with distinct ecological preferences. Comparison of the model annual species A. thaliana to its close perennial relatives A. lyrata and A. halleri, can help disentangle the molecular and physiological changes contributing to tolerance and avoidance mechanisms, because these species must maintain tolerance and avoidance mechanisms to increase long-term survival, but they are exposed to different levels of water stress and competition in their natural habitat.\\nC_LIO_LIMethods We conducted a dry-down experiment that mimics a period of missing precipitation. We quantified the covariation of progressive decrease in soil water content (SWC) with various physiological and morphological plant traits across a set of representative genotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri. To quantify the degree of plant stress, transcriptome changes were also monitored.\\nC_LIO_LIKey Results The analysis of trait co-variation demonstrates that the three species differ in the strategies they deploy to respond to drought stress. A. thaliana showed drought avoidance reaction but failed to survive wilting. A. lyrata efficiently combined avoidance and tolerance mechanisms. By contrast, A. halleri showed some degree of tolerance to wilting but it did not seem to protect itself from the stress imposed by drought. Transcriptome data collected just before plant wilting and after recovery corroborated the phenotypic analysis, with A. lyrata and A. halleri showing a stronger activation of recovery- and stress-related genes, respectively.\\nC_LIO_LIConclusions We conclude that these three Arabidopsis species have evolved distinct strategies to face drought stress, and discuss the extent to which these strategic differences reflect their respective ecological priorities.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans can ferment a variety of sugars to produce organic acids. Exposure of S. mutans to certain non-metabolizable carbohydrates such as xylitol impairs growth and can cause cell death. Recently, the presence of a sugar-phosphate stress in S. mutans was demonstrated using a mutant lacking 1-phosphofructokinase (FruK) that accumulates fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P). Here we studied an operon in S. mutans, sppRA, which was highly expressed in the fruK mutant. Biochemical characterization of a recombinant SppA protein indicated that it possessed hexose-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity, with preferences for F-1-P and, to a lesser degree, fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P). SppA activity was stimulated by Mg2+ and Mn2+, but inhibited by NaF. SppR, a DeoR-family regulator, repressed the expression of the sppRA operon to minimum levels in the absence of the fructose-derived metabolites, F-1-P and likely also F-6-P. Accumulation of F-1-P, as a result of growth on fructose, not only induced sppA expression, it significantly altered biofilm maturation through increased cell lysis and enhanced extracellular DNA release. Constitutive expression of sppA, via a plasmid or by deleting sppR, greatly alleviated fructose-induced stress in a fruK mutant, enhanced resistance to xylitol, and reversed effects of fructose on biofilm formation. Finally, by identifying three additional putative phosphatases that are capable of promoting sugar-phosphate tolerance, we show that S. mutans is capable of mounting a sugar-phosphate stress response by modulating the levels of certain glycolytic intermediates, functions that are interconnected with the ability of the organism to manifest key virulence behaviors.\\n\\nImportanceStreptococcus mutans is a major etiologic agent for dental caries, primarily due to its ability to form biofilms on tooth surface and to convert carbohydrates into organic acids. We have discovered a two-gene operon in S. mutans that regulates fructose metabolism by controlling the levels of fructose-1-phosphate, a potential signaling compound that affects bacterial behaviors. With fructose becoming increasingly common and abundant in the human diet, we reveal the ways fructose may alter bacterial development, stress tolerance, and microbial ecology in the oral cavity to promote oral diseases.",
