    "abstract": "Photosystem II is a photochemical reaction center that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water to molecular oxygen. Water oxidation is the distinctive photochemical reaction that permitted the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the eventual rise of Eukaryotes. At what point during the history of life an ancestral photosystem evolved the capacity to oxidize water still remains unknown. Here we study the evolution of the core reaction center proteins of Photosystem II using sequence and structural comparisons in combination with Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks. Our results indicate that a homodimeric photosystem with sufficient oxidizing power to split water had already appeared in the early Archean about a billion years before the most recent common ancestor of all described Cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, and well before the diversification of some of the known groups of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Based on a structural and functional rationale we hypothesize that this early Archean photosystem was capable of water oxidation and had already evolved some level of protection against the formation of reactive oxygen species, which would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is one of the most important mechanisms of prokaryotic species evolution but its exact roles are still in debate. Here we try to infer genome-wide recombination events within a species uti-lizing a dataset of 104 complete genomes of Escherichia coli from diverse origins, among which 45 from world-wide animal-hosts are in-house sequenced using SMRT (single-molecular real time) technology.Two major clades are identified based on evidences of ecological and physiological characteristics, as well as distinct genomic features implying scarce inter-clade genetic exchange. By comparing the synteny of identical fragments genome-widely searched for each genome pair, we achieve a fine-scale map of re-combination within the population. The recombination is rather extensive within clade, which is able to break linkages between genes but does not interrupt core genome framework and primary metabolic port-folios possibly due to natural selection for physiological compatibility and ecological fitness. Meanwhile,the recombination between clades declines drastically as the phylogenetic distance increases, generally 10-fold reduced than those of the intra-clade, which establishes genetic barrier between clades. These empirical data of recombination suggest its critical role in the early stage of speciation, where recombina-tion rate differs according to phylogentic distance. The extensive intra-clade recombination coheres sister strains into a quasi-sexual group and optimizes genes or alleles to streamline physiological activities,whereas shapely declined inter-clade recombination split the population into clades adaptive to divergent ecological niches.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRoles of recombination in species evolution have been debated for decades due to difficulties in inferring recombination events during the early stage of speciation, especially when recombination is always complicated by frequent gene transfer events of bacterial genomes. Based on 104 high-quality complete E. coli genomes, we infer gene-centric dynamics of recombination in the formation of two E. coli clades or subpopulations, and recombination is found to be rather intensive in a within-clade fashion, which forces them to be quasi-sexual. The recombination events can be mapped among individual genomes in the context of genes and their variations; decreased between-clade and increased intra-claderecombination engender a genetic barrier that further encourages clade-specific secondary metabolic portfolios for better environmental adaptation. Recombination is thus a major force that accelerates bacterial evolution to fit ecological diversity.",

Neither withheld Kaggle images, nor Messidor-2 were used for training. For Messidor-2 we achieved sensitivity 99%, specificity 71%, and AUC 0.97. These results close to recent state-of-the-art models trained on much larger data sets and surpass average results of diabetic retinopathy screening when performed by trained optometrists.

    "abstract": "Mechanotransduction is likely to be an important mechanism of signalling in thin, elongated cells like neurons. Maintenance of pre-stress or rest tension may facilitate mechanotransduction in these cells. In recent years, functional roles for mechanical tension in neuronal development and physiology are beginning to emerge but the cellular mechanisms regulating neurite tension remain poorly understood. Active contraction of neurites is a potential mechanism of tension regulation. In this study, we have explored cytoskeletal mechanisms mediating active contractility of neuronal axons. We have developed a simple assay where we evaluate contraction of curved axons upon trypsin-mediated detachment. We show that curved axons undergo contraction and straighten upon de-adhesion. Axonal straightening was found to be actively driven by actomyosin contractility, while microtubules may subserve a secondary role. We find that while axons show a monotonous decrease in length upon contraction, subcellularly, the cytoskeleton shows a heterogeneous contractile response. Further, using an assay for spontaneous development of tension without trypsin-induced de-adhesion, we show that axons are intrinsically contractile. These experiments, using novel experimental approaches, implicate the axonal cytoskeleton in tension homeostasis. Our data suggest that while globally the axon behaves as a mechanical continuum, locally the cytoskeleton is remodelled heterogeneously.",

    "abstract": "More than 80,000 angiosperm species produce flowers with petals fused into a corolla tube. As an important element of the tremendous diversity of flower morphology, the corolla tube plays a critical role in many specialized interactions between plants and animal pollinators (e.g., beeflies, hawkmoths, hummingbirds, nectar bats), which in turn drives rapid plant speciation. Despite its clear significance in plant reproduction and evolution, the corolla tube remains one of the least understood plant structures from a developmental genetics perspective. Through mutant analyses and transgenic experiments, here we show that the tasiRNA-ARF pathway is required for corolla tube formation in the monkeyflower species Mimulus lewisii. Loss-of-function mutations in the M. lewisii orthologs of ARGONAUTE7 and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 cause a dramatic decrease in abundance of TAS3-derived small RNAs and a moderate up-regulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 3 (ARF3) and ARF4, which lead to inhibition of lateral expansion of the bases of petal primordia and complete arrest of the upward growth of the inter-primordial regions, resulting in unfused corollas. By using an auxin reporter construct, we discovered that auxin distribution is continuous along the petal primordium base and the inter-primordial region during the critical stage of corolla tube formation in the wild-type, and that this auxin distribution is much weaker and more restricted in the mutant. Together, these results suggest a new conceptual model highlighting the central role of auxin directed synchronized growth of the petal primordium base and the inter-primordial region in corolla tube formation.",

    "abstract": "Theory and empirical data showed that two processes can boost selection against deleterious mutations, thus facilitating the purging of the mutation load: inbreeding, by exposing recessive deleterious alleles to selection in homozygous form, and sexual selection, by enhancing the relative reproductive success of males with small mutation loads. These processes tend to be mutually exclusive because sexual selection is reduced under mating systems that promote inbreeding, such as self-fertilization in hermaphrodites. We estimated the relative efficiency of inbreeding and sexual selection at purging the genetic load, using 50 generations of experimental evolution, in a hermaphroditic snail (Physa acuta). To this end, we generated lines that were exposed to various intensities of inbreeding, sexual selection (on the male function) and nonsexual selection (on the female function). We measured how these regimes affected the mutation load, quantified through the survival of outcrossed and selfed juveniles. We found that juvenile survival strongly decreased in outbred lines with reduced male selection, but not when female selection was relaxed, showing that male-specific sexual selection does purge deleterious mutations. However, in lines exposed to inbreeding, where sexual selection was also relaxed, survival did not decrease, and even increased for self-fertilized juveniles, showing that purging through inbreeding can compensate for the absence of sexual selection. Our results point to the further question of whether a mixed strategy combining the advantages of both mechanisms of genetic purging could be evolutionary stable.",

    "abstract": "Captive populations are considered a key component of ex situ conservation programs. Research on multiple taxa have shown the differential success of maintaining demographic versus genetic stability and viability in captive populations. In typical captive populations, usually founded by few or related individuals, genetic diversity can be lost and inbreeding can accumulate rapidly, calling into question their ultimate utility for release into the wild. Furthermore, domestication selection for survival in captive conditions is another concern. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of population sizes, particularly the effective population size, and genetic diversity at non-neutral, at adaptive loci in captive populations.\\n\\nIn this study, we assessed effective population sizes and genetic variation at both neutral microsatellite markers, as well as SNP variants from the MHC-B locus of a captive Red Junglefowl population. This population is a rare instance of a well-documented history in captivity, and also following a realistic chain-of-custody, unlike captive lab populations. Our analysis of 27 individuals that comprise the entirety of one captive population. Our results show very low neutral and adaptive genetic variation, as well as low effective sizes, which are surprising in spite of the known demographic history. Finally, our study also shows the divergent impacts of small effective size and inbreeding in captive populations on microsatellite versus adaptive genetic variation in the MHC-B locus. Our study provides insights into the difficulties of maintaining adaptive genetic variation in small captive populations.",

The majority of scientific reports investigating the prevalence of SCK and production diseases are based on empirical studies conducted in Western Europe and North America. The present study surveyed the prevalence of SCK and production-related clinical diseases in early lactating cows in various countries across the world other than those in North America and Western Europe. Twelve countries of South and Central America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico), Africa (South Africa), Asia (Thailand, China), Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine), Australia and New Zealand were assessed, and data from a total of 8,902 cows kept at 541 commercial dairy farms were obtained. A minimum of 5 cows per farm were blood sampled and examined once after parturition up to day 21 of lactation. Blood concentration of {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) was measured (threshold for SCK: 1.2 mmol/l) and the presence of production-related diseases such as milk fever, retained placenta, mastitis, metritis, displaced abomasum, claw disease and clinical ketosis was recorded. More than 95% of all cows were examined in their second week of lactation. Across all investigated countries, the SCK prevalence was 24.1%, ranging from 8.3% up to 40.1%. The prevalence of production-related diseases detected during the first 21 days of lactation was relatively low (< 5%). Calculated odds ratios did not indicate an elevated risk for production diseases in cows with SCK. Despite differences in production systems across countries and variation between individual farms within a region, the present study data on SCK prevalence align with observations in Western European and North American dairy herds. At the very early stage of sampling and clinical examination for detection of SCK, it cannot be excluded that certain production diseases such as DA, lameness and mastitis have developed later.",

Conditional deletion of PKM{zeta} within the nucleus accumbens recapitulated the increase in cocaine taking and seeking seen in the constitutive knockout mice, but only in male animals. Site-specific knockdown of PKM{zeta} in the nucleus accumbens had no effect on cocaine or natural reward behaviors in female mice.

However, the mechanisms that temporally and spatially control the activation or repression of important genes during regeneration are not fully understood. To determine the role that chromatin modifiers play in regulating gene expression after tissue damage, we induced ablation in Drosophila imaginal wing discs, and screened for chromatin regulators that are required for epithelial tissue regeneration. Here we show that many of these genes are indeed important for promoting or constraining regeneration. Specifically, the two SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes play distinct roles in regulating different aspects of regeneration. The PBAP complex regulates regenerative growth and developmental timing, and is required for the expression of JNK signaling targets and the growth promoter Myc. By contrast, the BAP complex ensures correct patterning and cell fate by stabilizing expression of the posterior gene engrailed. Thus, both SWI/SNF complexes are essential for proper gene expression during tissue regeneration, but they play distinct roles in regulating growth and cell fate.\n\nSummary statementDuring regeneration of the Drosophila wing disc, the SWI/SNF PBAP complex is required for regenerative growth and expression of JNK signaling targets, while the BAP complex maintains posterior cell fate.",

Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity amongst individuals, with rates of copying increasing with group size, leading to high probabilities of herding amongst large groups confronted with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social learning of small groups, and the greater probability that social information would be accurate for less-challenging tasks, generated  wisdom of the crowd effects in other circumstances.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor 5-year survival rate and lacks effective therapeutics. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify new targets. Using multi-plex data from patient tissue, three-dimensional co-culturing in vitro assays, and orthotopic murine models, we identified Netrin G1 (NetG1) as a promoter of PDAC tumorigenesis. NetG1+ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) supported PDAC survival, through a NetG1 mediated effect on glutamate/glutamine metabolism. NetG1+ CAFs were intrinsically immunosuppressive and inhibited NK cell mediated killing of tumor cells. These pro-tumor functions were controlled by a signaling circuit downstream to NetG1, which was comprised of AKT/4E-BP1, p38/FRA1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1, and glutamine synthetase. Finally blocking NetG1 with a neutralizing antibody stunted in vivo tumorigenesis, suggesting NetG1 as potential target in PDAC.\n\nSignificancePDAC is a devastating disease lacking effective therapies. A major hallmark of PDAC is desmoplasia, characterized by the expansion of CAFs and their extracellular matrix, creating a unique microenvironment that limits blood-supplied nutrition and is highly immunosuppressive. A better understanding of the role of CAFs in PDAC may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we uncovered roles for NetG1 in CAFs to promote tumorigenesis. NetG1 was important for two major CAF functions: the metabolic support of PDAC cells and the intrinsic immunosuppressive capacity of CAFs. Our results helped clarify the role that CAFs play in PDAC, by defining CAF phenotypes through NetG1 expression. Moreover, we established a link between CAF driven metabolism and their intrinsic immunosuppressive capacity, and identified a signaling circuit that governs NetG1 functions. Finally, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting NetG1 in vivo by limiting tumorigenesis in mice with a neutralizing antibody, illustrating that targeting stromal NetG1 could be an attractive therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Humans tend to value things not on their absolute values, but relative to reference points such as former experience or expectations. People rate the quality of a new salary relative to their previous salary and the salaries of their peers, instead of appreciating its absolute value. Here, we demonstrate a similar effect in an insect: ants, which had previously experienced a low quality food source, showed higher acceptance of medium quality food (e.g. 0.1M then 0.5M; positive contrast) than if they had received the medium food all along (e.g. 0.5M then 0.5M; control), and vice versa for high expectations. Further experiments demonstrate that these contrast effects arise from cognitive rather than mere sensory or pre-cognitive perceptual causes. Pheromone deposition also correlates with perceived reward value, and ants showed successive contrasts in their pheromone deposition. Relative value perception can therefore be expected to have strong effects not only on individual behaviour, but also on collective decision-making. Contrast effects were also social: the quality of food received from other ants affected the perceived value of food found later. Value judgement is a key element in decision making, and thus relative value perception will strongly influence how animals interact with their environment.",

    "abstract": "Highlights: O_LISilencing of the intragenic Evelknievel (EK) retroelement is maintained by CMT3-KYP/SUVH4 independently of DDM1 and the RdDM pathways.\\nC_LIO_LIMethylation and silencing of EK is required for transcription through the EK retroelement.\\nC_LIO_LISilencing of EK allows for splicing out of the entire EK and reconstitution of an intact CMT1 mRNA.\\nC_LI\\n\\nBackgroundCHROMOMEHYLASE1 (CMT1) has long been considered a non-essential gene because, in certain Arabidopsis ecotypes, the CMT1 gene is disrupted by the retroelement Evelknievel (EK), inserted within exon 13, or contains frame-shift mutations resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein. Here, we wanted to explore the regulatory pathway responsible for EK silencing in the Ler ecotype and its effect on CMT1 transcription.\\n\\nResultsMethylome databases confirmed that EK retroelement is heavily methylated but methylation is extended toward CMT1 downstream region. Strong transcriptional activation of EK accompanied by significant reduction in non-CG methylation was found in cmt3 and kyp2, but not in ddm1 or RdDM mutants. EK activation in cmt3 and kyp2 did not interfere with upstream CMT1 expression but abolish transcription through the EK. We identified, in wild type Ler, three spliced variants in which the entire EK is spliced out; one variant (25% of splicing incidents) facilitates proper reconstitution of an intact CMT1 mRNA. We could recover very low amount of the full length CMT1 mRNA from WT Ler and Col but not from cmt3 mutant..\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings highlight CMT3-SUVH4/KYP as the major pathway silencing the intragenic EK via inducing non-CG methylation. Furthermore, retroelement insertion within exons (e.g., CMT1) may not lead to a complete abolishment of the gene product when the element is kept silent. Rather the element can be spliced out to bring about reconstruction of a very low level of an intact, functional mRNA and possibly to retrieval of an active protein.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in biology is how gene expression is regulated to give rise to a phenotype. However, transcriptional variability is rarely considered and could influence the relationship between genotype and phenotype. It is known in unicellular organisms that gene expression is often noisy rather than uniform and this has been proposed to be beneficial when environmental conditions are unpredictable. However, little is known about transcriptional variability in plants. Using transcriptomic approaches, we analysed gene expression variability between individual Arabidopsis thaliana plants growing in identical conditions over a 24 hour time-course. We identified hundreds of genes that exhibit high inter-individual variability and found that many are involved in environmental responses. We also identified factors that might facilitate gene expression variability, such as gene length, the number of transcription factors regulating the genes and the chromatin environment. These results shed new light on the impact of transcriptional variability in gene expression regulation in plants.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine nitration is a hallmark of oxidative stress related disease states, commonly detected as anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. The precise reactive oxygen sources, mechanisms of nitration as well as the modified target proteins and functional consequences, however, remain often unclear. Here we explore protein tyrosine nitration under basal conditions and find surprisingly physiologically nitrated proteins. Upon purifying a prominent physiologically nitrotyrosine immunopositive in hearts from mouse, rat and pig, we identify it as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Mechanistically, LDHs degree of basal nitration depended on two canonical sources, NO synthase (NOS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), respectively. When validating the nitrated amino acid by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we, surprisingly, located LDH nitration not to a tyrosine but the C-terminal tryptophan, Trp324. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Trp324 nitration restricts the interaction of the active site loop with the C-terminal -helix essential for activity. This prediction was confirmed by enzyme kinetics revealing an apparent lower Vmax of nitrated LDH, although yet unidentified concurrent oxidative modifications may contribute. Protein nitration is, thus, not a by definition disease marker but reflects also physiological signaling by eNOS/NO, MPO/nitrite and possibly other pathways. The commonly used assay of anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is apparently cross-reactive to nitrotryptophan requiring a reevaluation of the protein nitration literature. In the case of LDH, nitration of Trp324 is aggravated under cardiac metabolic stress conditions and functionally limits maximal enzyme activity. Trp324-nitrated LDH may serve both as a previously not recognized disease biomarker and possibly mechanistic lead to understand the metabolic changes under these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Sericulture is an important cottage industry of Assam producing natural silk of both Mulberry and Non-Mulberry silk. The sericulture industry is closely associated with the Assamese traditions and rituals. In non-mulberry silk, Muga silkworm which is endemic to North-East India only produce exquisite silks of golden color. Rearing of Muga silkworm is one of the important aspects to producing silk of high quality. The quality of the primary host plant i.e. Som (Persea bombycina Kost.) greatly affects the quality of cocoon and silk produced by these industries. Therefore, planting and growing a disease-free plant has its own importance in sericulture. However, Som is very susceptible to different foliar diseases caused by fungi, which can reduce the yield of leaf from 13.8 - 41.6% annually. Therefore, a comprehensive mycofloral study of the host plant is important to forecast the future diseases and design different disease management procedures. This study has been done for a period of two years from 2014 - 2016 in Goalpara district of Assam and overall mycoflora of pedosphere (rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere), phyllosphere and aerosphere were identified and correlated with the seasonal variation. The rhizosphere, air, and phylloplane was dominated by Rhizopus stolonifer (22.13%; 15.08; 24.01) while Aspergillus niger (12.63%) was the dominant flora of non-rhizosphere. Seasonal variation was found to play an important role in shaping the mycofloral community structure in soil and phyllosphere. In summer, soil was majorly dominated by Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Curvularia lunata while Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus clavatus, Penicillium chrysogenum dominated the winter soil. In phyllosphere, the Chatuwa and Jaruwa, the winter generations were mainly dominated by Rhizopus stolonifer. While as the environmental temperature gradually increased with relative humidity in Aheruwa, Bhodia, Kotia and Jethuwa generation there was a shift in diversity with a gradual increase in occurance of Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus. Pestaloptiopsis disseminata one of the major pathogen of Som was found highest in aerosphere followed by phyllosphere and it was only dominated in Aheruwa generation. It was found that occurrence of P. disseminata were high when the temperature ranges between 25{degrees} - 28{degrees} with 70 -80% of relative humidity. This study provides a deep insight into the fungal diversity of host plant Som with respect to pedosphere, aerosphere, and phyllosphere and this knowledge can be used to better select the plantation area and design different disease management strategies to sustain and proliferate the industry for socio-economic development and to conserve its cultural essence.",

As common studies of isolated riboswitches lack the functional context of the transcription machinery, we here combine single-molecule, biochemical and simulation approaches to investigate the coupling between co-transcriptional folding of the pseudoknot-structured preQ1 riboswitch and RNA polymerase (RNAP) pausing. We show that pausing at a site immediately downstream of the riboswitch requires a ligand-free pseudoknot in the nascent RNA, a precisely spaced sequence resembling the pause consensus, and electrostatic and steric interactions with the RNAP exit channel. While interactions with RNAP stabilize the native fold of the riboswitch, binding of the ligand signals RNAP release from the pause. Our results demonstrate that the nascent riboswitch and its ligand actively modulate the function of RNAP and vice versa, a paradigm likely to apply to other cellular RNA transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial genomes are often transcribed into polycistronic primary RNAs punctuated by tRNAs whose excision defines mature RNA boundaries. Although kinetoplast DNA lacks tRNA genes, it is commonly held that monophosphorylated 5'-ends of functional molecules typify precursor partitioning by an unknown endonuclease. To the contrary, we demonstrate that in Trypanosoma brucei individual mRNAs and rRNAs are independently synthesized as 3' extended precursors. The transcription-defined 5' terminus is converted into monophosphorylated state by the 5' pyrophosphohydrolase complex, termed PPsome, which is activated by RNA editing substrate binding complex (RESC). Most guide RNAs lack PPsome recognition sites and, therefore, remain triphosphorylated. We provide evidence that both 5' pyrophosphate removal and 3' adenylation are essential for mRNA stabilization. Furthermore, we uncover a mechanism by which antisense RNA-controlled 3'-5' exonucleolytic trimming defines mRNA 3'-end. We conclude that mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs are transcribed and processed as insulated units irrespective of their genomic location.\\n\\nSignificanceIt is commonly held that in trypanosomes both mitochondrial DNA strands are transcribed into polycistronic precursors. These primary RNAs are presumably partitioned into individual pre-mRNAs by a \\\"cryptic\\\" endonuclease. We challenged the polycistronic transcription/ endonuclease model after revealing precursor processing by 3'-5' degradation. This work demonstrates individual transcription of each gene and mRNA 5'-end definition by the first incorporated nucleotide triphosphate. We have uncovered the stabilizing role of 5' triphosphate to monophosphate conversion and identified a protein complex responsible for this reaction. We have discovered antisense noncoding RNA originating near mRNA 3' end and showed that a duplex formation modulates exonuclease activity to delimit the mature 3' end. Collectively, our findings reveal mechanisms by which transcription defines both mRNA termini.",

Here, we combine quantitative imaging, physical theory, and physiological measurement of hydrostatic pressure and fluid transport in zebrafish to study size control of the developing inner ear. We find that fluid accumulation creates hydrostatic pressure in the lumen leading to stress in the epithelium and expansion of the otic vesicle. Pressure, in turn, inhibits fluid transport into the lumen. This negative feedback loop between pressure and transport allows the otic vesicle to change growth rate to control natural or experimentally-induced size variation. Spatiotemporal patterning of contractility modulates pressure-driven strain for regional tissue thinning. Our work connects moleculardriven mechanisms, such as osmotic pressure driven strain and actomyosin tension, to the regulation of tissue morphogenesis via hydraulic feedback to ensure robust control of organ size.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac looping is an early morphogenic process critical for the formation of four-chambered mammalian hearts. To study the roles of signaling pathways, transcription factors (TFs) and genetic networks in the process, we constructed gene co-expression networks and identified gene modules highly activated in individual cardiomyocytes (CMs) at multiple anatomical regions and developmental stages. Function analyses of the module genes uncovered major pathways important for spatiotemporal CM differentiation. Interestingly, about half of the pathways were highly active in cardiomyocytes at outflow tract (OFT) and atrioventricular canal (AVC), including many well-known signaling pathways for cardiac development and several newly identified ones. Most of the OFT-AVC pathways were predicted to be regulated by 6 6 transcription factors (TFs) actively expressed at the OFT-AVC locations, with the prediction supported by motif enrichment analysis of the TF targets, including 10 TFs that have not been previously associated with cardiac development, e.g., Etv5, Rbpms, and Baz2b. Finally, our study showed that the OFT-AVC TF targets were significantly enriched with genes associated with mouse heart developmental abnormalities and human congenital heart defects.",

    "abstract": "Orthopedia homeobox (OTP) gene encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor involved in brain development. OTP is mapped to human chromosome 5q14.1. Earlier we described transcription in the second intron of this gene in wide variety of tumors, but among normal tissues only in testis. In GeneBank these transcripts are presented by several 300-400 nucleotides long AI267901-like ESTs.\\n\\nWe assumed that AI267901-like ESTs belong to longer transcript(s). We used the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) approach and other methods to find the full-length transcript. The found transcript was 2436 nucleotides long polyadenylated sequence in antisense to OTP gene. The corresponding gene consisted of two exons separated by an intron of 2961 bp long. The first exon was found to be 91 bp long and located in the third exon of OTP gene. The second exon was 2345bp long and located in the second intron of OTP gene.\\n\\nThe search of possible open reading frames (ORFs) showed the lack of significant ORFs. We have shown the expression of new gene in many human tumors and only in one sampled normal testis. The data suggest that we discovered a new antisense cancer-testis sequence OTP-AS1 (OTP- antisense RNA 1), which belongs to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). According to our findings we assume that OTP-AS1 and OTP genes may be the CT-coding gene/CT-ncRNA pair involved in regulatory interactions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPreviously, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were considered as genetic \\\"noise\\\". However, it was later shown that only 2% of genomic transcripts have a protein-coding ability. Non-coding RNA is divided into short non-coding RNAs (20-200 nucleotides) and long noncoding RNAs (200-100,000 nucleotides). Genes encoding lncRNA often overlap or are adjacent to protein-coding genes, and localization of this kind is beneficial in order to regulate the transcription of neighboring genes. Studies have shown that of lncRNAs play many roles in the regulation of gene expression. New evidence indicates that dysfunctions of lncRNAs are associated with human diseases and cancer.\\n\\nIn our study we found a new cancer-testis long noncoding RNA (OTP-AS1), which is an antisense of protein-coding cancer-testis gene (OTP). Thus, OTP-AS1 and OTP genes may be the CT-coding gene/CT-ncRNA pair involved in regulatory interactions. This is supported by the similar profile of their expression. OTP-AS1 may be of interest as a potential diagnostic marker of cancer or a potential target for cancer therapy.\\n\\nPart of OTP-AS1 gene (5-end of the second exon) is evolutionary younger than the rest of gene sequence and is less conservative.

    "abstract": "Cochliobolus heterostrophus is a crucial pathogenic fungus that causes southern corn leaf blight (SCLB) in maize worldwide, however, the virulence mechanism of the dominant race O remains unclear. In this report, the single-cell level of pathogen tissue at three infection stages were collected from the host interaction-situ, and were performed next-generation sequencing from the perspectives of mRNA, circular RNA(circRNA) and long noncoding RNA(lncRNA). In the mRNA section, signal transduction, kinase, oxidoreductase, and hydrolase, et al. were significantly related in both differential expression and co-expression between virulence differential race O strains. The expression pattern of the traditional virulence factors nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NPSs), polyketide synthases (PKSs) and small secreted proteins (SSPs) were multifarious. In the noncoding RNA section, a total of 2279 circRNAs and 169 lncRNAs were acquired. Noncoding RNAs exhibited differential expression at three stages. The high virulence strain DY transcribed 450 more circRNAs than low virulence strain WF. Informatics analysis revealed numbers of circRNAs which positively correlate with race O virulence, and a cross-kingdom interaction between the pathogenic circRNA and host miRNA was predicted. An important exon-intron circRNA Che-cirC2410 combines informatics characteristics above, and highly expressed in the DY strain. Che-cirC2410 initiate from the pseudogene chhtt, which doesnt translate genetic code into protein. In-situ hybridization tells the sub-cellular localization of Che-cirC2410 include pathogen`s mycelium, periplasm, and the diseased host tissues. The target of Che-cirC2410 was predicted to be zma-miR399e-5P, and the interaction between noncoding RNAs was proved. More, the expression of zma-miR399e-5P exhibited a negative correlation to Che-cirC2410 in vivo. The deficiency of Che-circ2410 decreased the race O virulence. The host resistance to SCLB was weakened when zma-miR399e-5P was silenced. Thus, a novel circRNA-type effector and its resistance related miRNA target are proposed cautiously in this report. These findings enriched the pathogen-host dialogue by using noncoding RNAs as language, and revealed a new perspective for understanding the virulence of race O, which may provide valuable strategy of maize breeding for disease resistance.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe southern corn leaf blight (caused by Cochliobolus heterostrophus) is not optimistic in Asia, however we have limit knowledge about the infection mechanism of the dominant C.heterostrophus race O. We take full advantage of the ideal C.heterostrophus genome database, laser capture microdissection and single-cell level RNA sequencing. Hence, we could avert the artificial influence such as medium, and profile the real gene mobilization strategy in the infection. The results of coding RNA section were accessible, virulence related genes (such as the signal transduction, PKS, SSP) were detected in RNA-seq,which accord with previous reports. However, the results of noncoding RNA was astonished, 2279 circular RNAs (circRNA) and 169 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) were revealed in our results. Generally, the function of noncoding RNA was hypothesized in single species, but we boldly guess that the function of circRNA is rather complicated in the pathogen-host interaction. Finally, the circRNA in-situ hybridization (ISH) demonstrate the secretion of pathogen circRNA into the host tissue. By bioinformatic prediction, we found a sole microRNA target, and proved the interaction between circRNA and microRNA. These findings are likely to reveal a novel pathogen effector type: secreted circRNA.",

    "abstract": "Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans is an acidophilic chemolithoautotrophic bacterium widely used in the mining industry due to its metabolic sulfur-oxidizing capability. The biooxidation of sulfide minerals is enhanced through the attachment of A. thiooxidans cells to the mineral surface. The Type IV pili (TfP) of At. thiooxidans may play an important role in the bacteria attachment, since among other functions, TfP play a key adhesive role in the attachment to and colonization of different surfaces. In this work, we reported for the first time the confirmed mRNA sequences of three TfP proteins from At. thiooxidans, the protein PilY1 and the TfP pilins PilW and PilV. The nucleotide sequences of these TfP proteins show changes of some nucleotide positions with respect to the corresponding annotated sequences. The bioinformatic analyses and 3D-modeling of protein structures sustain their classification as TfP proteins, as structural homologs of the corresponding proteins of P. aeruginosa, results that sustain the role of PilY1, PilW and PilV in pili assembly. Also, that PilY1 comprises the conserved Neisseria-PilC (superfamily) domain of the tip-associated adhesin, while PilW of the superfamily of putative TfP assembly proteins and PilV belongs to the superfamily of TfP assembly protein. Also, the analyses suggested the presence of specific functional domains involved in adhesion, energy transduction and signaling functions. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PilY1 of Acidithiobacillus genus forms a cohesive group linked with iron- and/or sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms from acid mine drainage or mine tailings. This work enriches knowledge regarding colonization, adhesion and biooxidation of inorganic sulfurs by A. thiooxidans.",

Over the past few years, many reports have focused on analysis of evolution and biological function of WRKY genes at the whole genome level in different plant species. However, little information is known about WRKY genes in melon (Cucumis melo L.). In the present study, a total of 56 putative WRKY genes were identified in melon, which were randomly distributed on their respective chromosomes. A multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis using melon, cucumber and watermelon predicted WRKY domains indicated that melon WRKY proteins could be classified into three main groups (I-III). Our analysis indicated that no recent duplication events of WRKY genes were detected in melon, and strong purifying selection was observed among the 85 orthologous pairs of Cucurbitaceae species. Expression profiles of CmWRKY derived from RNA-seq data and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed distinct expression patterns in various tissues, and the expression of 16 CmWRKY were altered following powdery mildew infection in melon. Besides, we also found that a total of 24 WRKY genes were co-expressed with 11 VQ family genes in melon. Our comparative genomic analysis provides a foundation for future functional dissection and understanding the evolution of WRKY genes in cucurbitaceae species, and will promote powdery mildew resistance study in melon.",

    "abstract": "Collective behaviors of groups of animals, such as schooling and shoaling of fish, are central to species survival, but genes that regulate these activities are not known. Here we parsed collective behavior of groups of adult zebrafish using computer vision and unsupervised machine learning into a set of highly reproducible, unitary, several hundred millisecond states and transitions, which together can account for the entirety of relative positions and postures of groups of fish. Using CRISPR-Cas9 we then targeted for knockout 35 genes associated with autism and schizophrenia. We found mutations in three genes had distinctive effects on the amount of time spent in the specific states or transitions between states. Mutation in immp2l (inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase 2-like gene) enhances states of cohesion, so increases shoaling; mutation in in the Nav1.1 sodium channel, scn1lab+/- causes the fish to remain scattered without evident social interaction; and mutation in the adrenergic receptor, adra1aa-/-, keeps fish close together and retards transitions between states, leaving fish motionless for long periods. Motor and visual functions seemed relatively well-preserved. This work shows that the behaviors of fish engaged in collective activities are built from a set of stereotypical states. Single gene mutations can alter propensities to collective actions by changing the proportion of time spent in these states or the tendency to transition between states. This provides an approach to begin dissection of the molecular pathways used to generate and guide collective actions of groups of animals.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceLegionella pneumophila is a bacterial pathogen causing outbreaks of a lethal pneumonia. The genus Legionella comprises 65 species for which aquatic amoebae are the natural reservoirs. Using functional and comparative genomics to deconstruct the entire bacterial genus we reveal the surprising parallel evolutionary trajectories that have led to the emergence of human pathogenic Legionella. An unexpectedly large and unique repository of secreted proteins (>16,000) containing eukaryotic-like proteins acquired from all domains of life (plant, animal, fungal, archaea) is contrasting with a highly conserved type 4 secretion system. This study reveals an unprecedented environmental reservoir of bacterial virulence factors, and provides a new understanding of how reshuffling and gene-acquisition from environmental eukaryotic hosts, may allow for the emergence of human pathogens.\\n\\nAbstractThe bacterial genus Legionella comprises 65 species among, which Legionella pneumophila is a human pathogen causing severe pneumonia. To understand the evolution of an environmental to an accidental human pathogen, we have functionally analyzed 80 Legionella genomes spanning 58 species. Uniquely, an immense repository of 16,000 secreted proteins encoding 137 different eukaryotic-like domains and more than 200 eukaryotic-like proteins is paired with a highly conserved T4SS. Specifically, we show that eukaryotic Rho and Rab GTPase domains are found nearly exclusively in eukaryotes and Legionella species. Translocation assays for selected Rab-GTPase proteins revealed that they are indeed T4SS secreted substrates. Furthermore, F/U-box and SET domains were present in >70% of all species suggesting that manipulation of host signal transduction, protein turnover and chromatin modification pathways, respectively are fundamental intracellular replication strategies for Legionellae. In contrast, the Sec-7 domain was restricted to L. pneumophila and seven other species, indicating effector repertoire tailoring within different amoebae. Functional screening of 47 species revealed 60% were competent for intracellular replication in THP-1 cells, but interestingly this phenotype was associated with diverse effector assemblages. These data, combined with evolutionary analysis indicate that the capacity to infect eukaryotic cells has been acquired independently many times within the genus and that a highly conserved yet versatile T4SS secretes an exceptional number of different proteins shaped by inter-domain gene transfer. Furthermore we revealed the surprising extent to which legionellae have co-opted genes and thus cellular functions from their eukaryotic hosts and provides a new understanding of how dynamic reshuffling and gene-acquisition has led to the emergence of major human pathogens.",

We profiled the behavior of 6 endometrial cell types, including a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelial cell type, during four major phases of endometrial transformation, and found characteristic signatures for each cell type and phase. We discovered that human window of implantation opens with an abrupt and discontinuous transcriptomic activation in the epithelia, accompanied with widespread decidualized feature in the stromal fibroblasts. These data reveal signatures in the luminal and glandular epithelia during epithelial gland reconstruction, and suggest a mechanism for adult gland formation.",

The specific factors associated with variability in gut microbiome recovery remain unknown. Using data from 4 different cohorts in 3 continents comprising >500 microbiome profiles from 117 subjects, we identified 20 bacterial species exhibiting robust association with gut microbiome recovery post antibiotic therapy. Functional and growth analysis showed that microbiome recovery is supported by enrichment in carbohydrate degradation and energy production capabilities. Association rule mining on 782 microbiome profiles from the MEDUSA database enabled reconstruction of the gut microbial  food-web, identifying many recovery-associated bacteria (RABs) as primary colonizing species, with the ability to use both host and diet-derived energy sources, and to break down complex carbohydrates to support the growth of other bacteria. Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of RABs (Bacteroides thetaiotamicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) to promote microbiome recovery with synergistic effects, providing a two orders of magnitude boost to microbial abundance in early time-points and faster maturation of microbial diversity. The identification of specific microbial factors promoting microbiome recovery opens up opportunities for rationally fine-tuning pre- and probiotic formulations that prevent pathogen colonization and promote gut health.",

We report that the histone H3-H4 tetramer is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu1+ when assembled in vitro from recombinant histones. Mutations of residues in the putative active site at the interface of the apposing H3 proteins alter the enzymatic activity and cellular processes such as Sod1 function or mitochondrial respiration that depend on availability of reduced copper. These effects are not due to altered gene expression or copper abundance but are consistent with decreased levels of cuprous ions. We propose that the H3-H4 tetramer is an oxidoreductase that provides biousable copper for cellular and mitochondrial chemistry. As the emergence of eukaryotes coincided with the Great Oxidation Event and decreased biousability of metals, the histone enzymatic function may have facilitated eukaryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "T-box riboswitches are cis-regulatory RNA elements that regulate mRNAs encoding for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases or proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport. Rather than using small molecules as their ligands, as do most riboswitches, T-box riboswitches uniquely bind tRNA and sense their aminoacylated state. Whereas the anticodon and elbow regions of the tRNA interact with Stem I, located in the 5 portion of the T-box, sensing of the aminoacylation state involves direct binding of the NCCA sequence at the tRNA 3 end to the anti-terminator sequence located in the 3 portion of the T-box. However, the kinetic trajectory that describes how each of these interactions are established temporally during tRNA binding remains unclear. Using singlemolecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we demonstrate that tRNA binds to the riboswitch in a two-step process, first with anticodon recognition followed by NCCA binding, with the second step accompanied by an inward motion of the 3 portion of the T-box riboswitch relative to Stem I. By using site-specific mutants, we further show that the T-loop region of the T-box significantly contributes to the first binding step, and that the K-turn region of the T-box influences both binding steps, but with a more dramatic effect on the second binding step. Our results set up a kinetic framework describing tRNA binding by T-box riboswitches and highlight the important roles of several T-box structural elements in regulating each binding step.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEBacteria commonly use riboswitches, cis-regulatory RNA elements, to regulate the transcription or translation of the mRNAs upon sensing signals. Unlike small molecule binding riboswitches, T-box riboswitches bind tRNA and sense their aminoacylated state. T-box modular structural elements that recognize different parts of a tRNA have been identified, however, how each of these interactions is established temporally during tRNA binding remains unclear. Our study reveals that tRNA binds to the riboswitch in a two-step mechanism, with anticodon recognition first, followed by binding to the NCCA sequence at the 3 end of the tRNA with concomitant conformational changes in the T-box. Our results also highlight the importance of the modular structural elements of the T-box in each of the binding steps.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of protein-folding theory is to predict the stochastic dynamics of transition paths -- the rare trajectories that transit between the folded and unfolded ensembles -- using only thermodynamic information, such as a low-dimensional equilibrium free-energy landscape. However, commonly used one-dimensional landscapes typically fall short of this aim, because an empirical coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient has to be fit to transition-path trajectory data in order to reproduce the transition-path dynamics. We show that an alternative, first-principles free-energy landscape predicts transition-path statistics that agree well with simulations and single-molecule experiments without requiring dynamical data as an input. This  topological configuration model assumes that distinct, native-like substructures assemble on a timescale that is slower than native-contact formation but faster than the folding of the entire protein. Using only equilibrium simulation data to determine the free energies of these coarse-grained intermediate states, we predict a broad distribution of transition-path transit times that agrees well with the transition-path durations observed in simulations. We further show that both the distribution of finite-time displacements on a one-dimensional order parameter and the ensemble of transition-path trajectories generated by the model are consistent with the simulated transition paths. These results indicate that a landscape based on transient folding intermediates, which are often hidden by one-dimensional projections, can form the basis of a predictive model of protein-folding transition-path dynamics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEpidermal homeostasis requires balanced and coordinated adult stem cell renewal and differentiation. These processes are controlled by both extracellular signaling and by cell intrinsic transcription regulatory networks, yet how these control mechanisms are integrated to achieve this unclear. Here, we developed single-cell ID-seq and measured 69 antibody-DNA conjugates (including 34 phospho-specific epitopes) to study the activation state of signaling pathways during epidermal differentiation at the single-cell level. Computational pseudo-timing inference revealed activation of the JAK-STAT, WNT and BMP pathways along the epidermal differentiation trajectory. During differentiation, cells start producing BMP2 ligands and activate the canonical intracellular effectors SMAD1/5/9. Mechanistically, the BMP pathway is responsible for directly activating a specific transcription program that includes the key differentiation transcription factors MAF and MAFB to allow terminal differentiation. We propose that incorporating autocrine signaling pathway activation into a transcription regulatory network enables regional coordination of transcription programs during epidermal differentiation.",

To protect species from the impacts of land-use change it is important to understand the population dynamics and habitat associations across these scales. Here we present an investigation into the survival and habitat preferences of White-faced Darter (Leucorrhinia dubia) at the local scale at Fenns and Whixall Moss, Shropshire, UK. We used capture-mark-recapture methods to investigate survival and used sightings of individual dragonflies along with habitat data to investigate habitat preference. We found that survival between capture-visits was very low and that White-faced Darter show a clear preference for the open moss habitat on this site. In both cases, we found that the detectability either through sightings or recaptures was potentially very low and suggest that this should be taken into account in future analyses. We suggest that this could be achieved by encouraging recorders to submit complete lists and to repeat visits to sites.",

    "abstract": "Malaria, dengue, Zika, and other mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose a major global health burden through much of the world, despite the widespread distribution of insecticide-based tools and antimalarial drugs. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing and its demonstrated ability to streamline the development of gene drive systems has reignited interest in the application of this technology to the control of mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit. The versatility of this technology has also enabled a wide range of gene drive architectures to be realized, creating a need for their population-level and spatial dynamics to be explored. To this end, we present MGDrivE (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer): a simulation framework designed to investigate the population dynamics of a variety of gene drive architectures and their spread through spatially-explicit mosquito populations. A key strength of the MGDrivE framework is its modularity: a) a genetic inheritance module accommodates the dynamics of gene drive systems displaying user-defined inheritance patterns, b) a population dynamic module accommodates the life history of a variety of mosquito disease vectors and insect agricultural pest species, and c) a landscape module accommodates the distribution of insect metapopulations connected by migration in space. Example MGDrivE simulations are presented to demonstrate the application of the framework to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing gene drive for: a) driving a disease-refractory gene into a population (i.e. population replacement), and b) disrupting a gene required for female fertility (i.e. population suppression), incorporating homing-resistant alleles in both cases. We compare MGDrivE with other genetic simulation packages, and conclude with a discussion of future directions in gene drive modeling.",

    "abstract": "The concept of haplotype blocks has been shown to be useful in genetics. Fields of application range from the detection of regions under positive selection to statistical methods that make use of dimension reduction. We propose a novel approach (\\\"HaploBlocker\\\") for defining and inferring haplotype blocks that focuses on linkage instead of the commonly used population-wide measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) which fail to identify segments shared by individuals in only a subset of the population. We define a haplotype block as a sequence of alleles that has a predefined minimum frequency in the population and only haplotypes with a similar sequence of alleles are considered to be carrying that block, effectively screening a dataset for group-wise identity-by-descent (IBD). Different to most other approaches these blocks are not restricted to shared start or end positions, but can overlap or even contain each other. From these haplotype blocks we construct a haplotype library that represents a large proportion of genetic variability of a population with a limited number of blocks. Our method is implemented in the associated R-package HaploBlocker and provides flexibility to not only optimize the structure of the obtained haplotype library for subsequent analyses (e.g., identification of shared segments between different populations), but is also able to handle datasets of different marker density and genetic diversity. By using haplotype blocks instead of SNPs, local epistatic interactions can be naturally modelled and the reduced number of parameter enables a wide variety of new methods for further genomic analyses. We illustrate our methodology with a dataset comprising 501 doubled haploid lines in a European maize landrace genotyped at 501124 SNPs. With the suggested approach, we identified 2851 haplotype blocks with an average length of 2633 SNPs (compared to 27.8 SNPs per block in HaploView) that together represent 94% of the dataset.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhereas it is quite easy to identify segments of shared DNA between pairs of individuals, the problem becomes far more complex when analyzing a population. Especially for livestock and crop populations under strong selection one can observe long and possibly favourable segments that are segregating at high frequency. We propose here an adaptive and flexible approach to identify such segments (\\\"haplotype blocks\\\"). The main conceptual difference to other approaches is that we allow haplotype blocks to overlap so that patterns shared by a subset of the population can be mapped adequately. Afterwards, we select a set of those haplotype blocks that form a representation of the whole population (\\\"haplotype library\\\"). This haplotype library can be used similar to a SNP-dataset for subsequent genomic approaches with the advantage of a massive reduction of the number of parameters compared to standard haplotyping approaches. Since many breeding goals (e.g. grain yield, milk production) are known to be caused by complex interactions in genomic regions (or even the whole genome) using haplotype blocks instead of single base pairs provides a natural model for local interactions and enables the use of more complex models to incorporate distant interactions between genes, for instance.",

Using computational analysis we document in TD infants a phylogenetic ancient behavior: origin-related exploration. Strikingly, while the TD infants exhibited excursions in reference to mother and deep engagement with mother when visiting her, the NTD infants tended to avoid mothers place, performing few if any excursions, and exhibiting shallow engagement with mother. Given the pervasiveness of origin-related exploration in invertebrates, vertebrates, and primates, we now face a challenge to find an animal model that will exhibit active exploration while ignoring or suppressing the return to the origin, be it a mother or any other safe haven.",

The conclusion shows the limits of performance of these ESI connectivity estimators using both simulations and real data analysis.

    "abstract": "In patients with myositis, persistent skeletal muscle weakness in the absence of significant inflammatory cell infiltrates is a well-recognised, but poorly understood, cause of morbidity. This has led researchers to investigate cellular mechanisms independent of immune cells, which may contribute to this underlying muscle weakness. Chronic ER stress pathway activation is evident in the muscle of myositis patients, and is now a potential mediator of muscle weakness in the absence of inflammation. Abnormal ER stress pathway activation is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in bioenergetic deficits and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which in this context may potentially damage muscle proteins and thus impair contractile performance. This study examined whether treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) could mitigate these ER stress-induced changes. C2C12 myotubes were treated with the ER stress-inducing compound Tunicamycin, in the presence or absence of 17AAG. Myotubes were examined for changes relating to ER stress pathway activation, mitochondrial function, markers of oxidative damage and in myotubular dimensions. ER stress pathway activation caused mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced oxygen consumption and ATP generation and by increased gene expression levels of the bio-energetic regulator, uncoupling protein 3 (UCP-3), the latter indicative of electron transport chain uncoupling. ER stress pathway activation also caused increased gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2 and peroxiredoxin (PRDX) 3, elevated H2O2 levels, and reduced total thiol pool levels and a significant diminution of myotubular dimensions. Exposure to 17AAG ameliorated these ER stress-induced changes. These findings, which suggest that 17AAG can reduce ER stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and myotubular atrophy, have potential implications in the context of human myositis.",

    "abstract": "Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are complex, stochastic and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems intrinsic predictability - the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic v. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a dataset of 461 empirical ecological time series.

    "abstract": "Recently, comprehensive morphological datasets including nearly all the well-recognized Mesozoic birds become available, making it feasible for statistically rigorous methods to unveil finer evolutionary patterns during early avian evolution. However, few quantitative and statistical studies have yet been performed. Here, we exploited the advantage of Bayesian tip dating under relaxed morphological clocks to infer both the divergence times and evolutionary rates while accounting for their uncertainties. We further subdivided the characters into six body regions (i.e., skull, axial skeleton, pectoral girdle and sternum, forelimb, pelvic girdle, and hindlimb) to assess evolutionary rate heterogeneity both along the lineages and across partitions. We observed extremely high rates of morphological character changes during early avian evolution and the clock rates are quite heterogeneous among the six regions. The branch subtending Pygostylia shows extremely high rate in the axial skeleton, while the branches subtending Ornithothoraces and Enantiornithes show very high rates in the pectoral girdle and sternum, and moderately high rates in the forelimb. The extensive modifications in these body regions largely correspond to refinement of the flight capability. The rest of the relatively slow and even rates suggest that there is no dominant selective pressure in favoring of modifications in the skull and pelvis. This study reveals the power and flexibility of Bayesian tip dating implemented in MrBayes to investigate evolutionary dynamics in deep time.",

Only several predicted BTB domain-containing proteins encoded in the human genome have been functionally characterized. No relevant studies have been reported concerning the effect of down-regulated ZBTB38 gene expression on tumor cells through transcriptome analysis. In the present study, 2,438 differentially expressed genes in ZBTB38-/- SH-SY5Y cells were obtained via high-throughput transcriptome sequencing analysis, 83.5% of which was down-regulated. Furthermore, GO functional clustering and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that the knocked-down transcription factor ZBTB38 interacted with p53 and arrested cell cycles to inhibit the proliferation of the tumor cells. Besides, it also significantly down-regulated the expressions of PTEN, a \\\"molecular switch\\\" of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and RB1CC1, the key gene for autophagy initiation, and blocked autophagy to accelerate the apoptosis of tumor cells. ZBTB38-/- SH-SY5Y cells were investigated at the whole transcriptome level and key DEGs were screened in the present study for the first time, providing a theoretical foundation for exploring the molecular mechanism of inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and targeted anti-tumor therapies.",

Growth arrest due to (p)ppGpp accumulation from basal RelA activity apparently explained the essentiality of SpoT hydrolase function. We found, pppGpp degradation was enhanced when the SpoT hydrolase activity was lowered or eliminated and when this was alleviated by inactivation of the GppA hydrolase, gratuitous synthesis of (p)ppGpp by RelA was activated, leading to growth arrest. The RelA-ribosome interaction was not mandatory for these phenotypes. Our results show, for the first time, elevated pppGpp promoted the amplification of RelA-mediated stringent response in the absence of established RelA activating signals in the cell and the SpoT and GppA hydrolases prevented this. The accumulation of pppGpp inhibited the SpoT hydrolase activity. We propose this autocatalytic activation of RelA by pppGpp is likely to be an allosteric regulation and can result in a bistable switch.",

    "abstract": "In response to resource availability, bacteria have evolved two distinct ecological strategies. Copiotrophic bacteria grow fast and are heavily favored by selection where the resource is abundant. In contrast, oligotrophic bacteria grow slowly but more efficiently and are highly adaptive in nutrient-poor environments (Koch, 2001). Although oligotrophs and copiotrophs are ubiquitous, except for a few well-characterized environments like the open ocean and animal gut, the relative abundance of oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria and their importance in the global ecosystem are still unclear. In addition, although several studies have demonstrated the impact of nutrient availability on the bacterial community structure under experimental conditions (Klappenbach et al., 2000, Nemergut et al., 2016), the role of nutrients in shaping the structures of bacterial communities in their natural habitats remains largely unknown. Using the ribosomal RNA operon (rrn) copy number to capture the bacterial ecological strategy, we analyzed 44,045 samples from two large bacterial community repositories that cover 78 environmental types. Here we show that animal-associated microbiota are dominated by copiotrophs while plant-associated and free-living bacterial communities are mostly dominated by oligotrophs. Our results suggest that nutrient availability plays an important role in determining the structure and ecological strategy of bacterial communities in nature. We demonstrate that the average and distribution of rrn copy number are simple yet robust predictors of the ecological strategy of bacterial communities that can be applied to all sequence-based microbial surveys to link the community structure and function.",

We derive this consensus from the clustering of subject-level networks. We show that this subject-derived consensus framework yields clusters that better map to the individual, compared to the widely-used group-derived consensus approach.

    "abstract": "A consensus on the number of morphologically different types of pyramidal cells (PCs) in the neocortex has not yet been reached, despite over a century of anatomical studies. This is because of a lack of agreement on the subjective classifications of neuron types, which is based on expert analyses of neuronal morphologies: the shapes of somata, dendrites, and axons. Even for neurons that are visually different to non-experts, there is no common ground to consistently distinguish morphological types. We found that objective classification is possible with methods from algebraic topology, and that the dendritic arbor is sufficient for reliable identification of distinct types of PCs. We also provide a solution for the more challenging problem of whether two similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Using this scheme, we objectively identify seventeen types of PCs in the rat somatosensory cortex. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing, spontaneous pain is characteristic of inflammatory joint pain and reduces an individuals quality of life. To understand the neural basis of inflammatory joint pain, we made a unilateral knee injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) in mice, which reduced their natural digging behavior. We hypothesized that sensitization of knee-innervating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons underlies this altered behavior. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophysiological recordings on retrograde labelled knee-innervating primary DRG neuron cultures and measured their responses to a number of electrical and chemical stimuli. We found that 24-hours after CFA-induced knee inflammation, knee neurons show a decreased action potential generation threshold, as well as increased GABA and capsaicin sensitivity, but have unaltered acid sensitivity. The inflammation-induced sensitization of knee neurons persisted for 24-hours in culture, but was not observed after 48-hours in culture. Through immunohistochemistry, we showed that the increased knee neuron capsaicin sensitivity correlated with enhanced expression of the capsaicin receptor, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in knee-innervating neurons of the CFA-injected side. We also observed an increase in the co-expression of TRPV1 with tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), which is the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), suggesting that NGF partially induces the increased TRPV1 expression. Lastly, we found that systemic administration of the TRPV1 antagonist A-425619 reversed the decrease in digging behavior induced by CFA injection, further confirming the role of TRPV1, expressed by knee neurons, in acute inflammatory joint pain.",

Plasmids have evolved several mechanisms for stability, one of which, post-segregational killing (PSK), ensures that plasmid-free cells do not grow or survive. Here we demonstrate the plasmid-stabilising capabilities of the axe/txe two component system and the microcin-V system in the probiotic bacteria Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and show they can outperform the hok/sok system commonly used in biotechnological applications. Using plasmid stability assays, automated flow cytometry analysis, mathematical models and Bayesian statistics we quantified plasmid stability in vitro.

Defects in the synthesis or degradation of sphingolipids are associated with various neurological pathologies, however, the entire spectrum of disorders affecting sphingolipid metabolism remains elusive. By whole-exome sequencing in a patient with a multisystem neurological disorder of both the central and peripheral nervous system, we identified a homozygous variant p.(Ala280Val) in DEGS1, encoding an enzyme of the ceramide synthesis pathway. The blood sphingolipid profile and patient-derived fibroblasts both showed a significant shift from the unsaturated to the dihydro-forms of sphingolipids. Moreover, an atypical and potentially toxic sphingolipid metabolite is formed as consequence of the altered synthesis pathway. The changes in the sphingolipid profile were recapitulated in a CRISPR/Cas-based DEGS1 knockout HAP1-cell model and by chemical inhibition of DEGS1, suggesting a loss of DEGS1 function in the disease. DEGS1 insufficiency is thus a novel cause for a multisystem neurological disorder. A sphingolipid-rich diet may correct the metabolic profile and improve the clinical outcome of affected individuals and suggests that this heritable condition might be treatable.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Localized flows of cerebrospinal fluid throughout the ventricular system of the brain are established from the polarized beating of the ependymal cell (EC) cilia. Here, we identified a homozygous truncating mutation in KIF6 in a child displaying neuro-cranial defects and intellectual disability. To test the function of KIF6 in vivo, we engineered mutations of Kif6 in mouse. These Kif6 mutant mice display severe hydrocephalus, coupled with a loss of EC cilia. Similarly, we observed hydrocephalus and a reduction in EC cilia in kif6 mutant zebrafish. Overall, this work describes the first clinically-defined KIF6 mutation in human, while our animal studies demonstrate the pathogenicity of mutations in KIF6 and establish KIF6 as a conserved mediator of neuro-cranial development and EC cilia maintenance in vertebrates.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=183 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/350140_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (58K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d36bc6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@48cbfborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147e273org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@641ce3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We found that cortical and not subcortical PAM measures were strongly associated with {beta}-amyloid, tau-related neuropathology, and rates of cognitive decline. Effect sizes for PAM measures are substantial, comparable to that of APOE {varepsilon}4, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease. Mediation modeling suggests that PAM accelerates accumulation of tau pathology leading to cognitive decline, supporting an upstream role for microglial activation in Alzheimers disease. Genome-wide analyses identified a common variant (rs2997325) influencing cortical PAM that also affected in vivo microglial activation measured by positron emission tomography using [11C]-PBR28 in an independent cohort. Finally, we identify overlaps of PAMs genetic architecture with those of Alzheimers disease, educational attainment, and several other traits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism is a heterogenous collection of disorders with a complex molecular underpinning. Evidence from post-mortem brain studies using adult brains have indicated that early prenatal development may be altered in autism. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from autistic individuals with macrocephaly also indicate prenatal development as a critical period for this condition. But little is known about early altered cellular events during prenatal stages in autism.\n\nMethodsIPSCs were generated from 9 unrelated autistic individuals without macrocephaly and with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds, and 6 typically developing, control, individuals. IPSCs were differentiated towards either cortical or midbrain fates. Gene expression and high throughput cellular phenotyping was used to characterise iPSCs at different stage of differentiation.\n\nResultsA subset of autism-iPSC cortical neurons were RNA-sequenced to reveal autism-specific signatures similar to post-mortem brain studies, indicating a potential common biological mechanism. Autism-iPSCs differentiated towards a cortical fate displayed impairments in the ability to self-form into neural rosettes. In addition, autism-iPSCs demonstrated significant differences in rate of cell type assignment of cortical precursors, and dorsal and ventral forebrain precursors. These cellular phenotypes occurred in the absence of alterations in cell proliferation during cortical differentiation, differing from previous studies. Acquisition of cell fate during midbrain differentiation was not different between control- and autism-iPSCs.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, our data indicate that autism-iPSCs diverge from control-iPSCs at a cellular level during early stage of neurodevelopment. This suggests that unique developmental differences associated with autism may be established at early prenatal stages.",

    "abstract": "In perceptual decision making the brain extracts and accumulates decision evidence from a stimulus over time and eventually makes a decision based on the accumulated evidence. Several characteristics of this process have been observed in human electrophysiological experiments, especially an average build-up of motor-related signals supposedly reflecting accumulated evidence, when averaged across trials. A more direct approach to investigate the representation of decision evidence in brain signals is to correlate the trial-to-trial fluctuations of a model-based prediction of evidence with the measured signals. We here report results for an experiment in which we applied this approach to human magnetoencephalographic recordings. These results consolidate a range of previous findings and suggest that decision evidence is processed in three consecutive phases in the human brain: In an early phase around 120 ms after the evidence became visible on the screen, in a transition phase around 180 ms and a plateau phase roughly from 300 to 500 ms. We located sources of evidence representations in these phases in early visual (early), parietal (transition) and motor (plateau) regions of the brain while signals in posterior cingulate cortex represented decision evidence in all three phases. These findings imply that parietal cortex is only transiently involved in the processing of decision evidence, that motor areas represent accumulated evidence throughout decision making and that posterior cingulate cortex may have a central role in processing and maintaining decision evidence.",

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing large-scale population-based whole-genome sequencing (WGS) projects such as the NIH NHLBI TOPMed program and the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program, WGS-based association analysis of complex traits remains a tremendous challenge due to the large number of rare variants, many of which are non-trait-associated neutral variants. External biological knowledge, such as functional annotations based on ENCODE, may be helpful in distinguishing causal rare variants from neutral ones; however, each functional annotation can only provide certain aspects of the biological functions. Our knowledge for selecting informative annotations a priori is limited, and incorporating non-informative annotations will introduce noise and lose power. We propose FunSPU, a versatile and adaptive test that incorporates multiple biological annotations and is adaptive at both the annotation and variant levels and thus maintains high power even in the presence of noninformative annotations. In addition to extensive simulations, we illustrate our proposed test using the TWINSUK cohort (n=1,752) of UK10K WGS data based on six functional annotations: CADD, RegulomeDB, FunSeq, Funseq2, GERP++, and GenoSkyline. We identified genome-wide significant genetic loci on chromosome 19 near gene TOMM40 and APOC4-APOC2 associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which are replicated in the UK10K ALSPAC cohort (n=1,497). These replicated LDL-associated loci were missed by existing rare variant association tests that either ignore external biological information or rely on a single source of biological knowledge. We have implemented the proposed test in an R package \\\"FunSPU\\\".",

    "abstract": "Downy mildews are obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogens that cause devastating plant diseases on economically important crops. Plasmopara viticola is the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew, a major disease in vineyards worldwide. We sequenced the genome of Pl. viticola with PacBio long reads and obtained a new 92.94 Mb assembly with high continuity (359 scaffolds for a N50 of 706.5 kb) due to a better resolution of repeat regions. This assembly presented a high level of gene completeness, recovering 1,592 genes encoding secreted proteins involved in plant-pathogen interactions. Pl. viticola had a two-speed genome architecture, with secreted protein-encoding genes preferentially located in gene-sparse, repeat-rich regions and evolving rapidly, as indicated by pairwise dN/dS values. We also used short reads to assemble the genome of Plasmopara muralis, a closely related species infecting grape ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata). The lineage-specific proteins identified by comparative genomics analysis included a large proportion of RxLR cytoplasmic effectors and, more generally, genes with high dN/dS values. We identified 270 candidate genes under positive selection, including several genes encoding transporters and components of the RNA machinery potentially involved in host specialization. Finally, the Pl. viticola genome assembly generated here will allow the development of robust population genomics approaches for investigating the mechanisms involved in adaptation to biotic and abiotic selective pressures in this species.\\n\\nDATA AVAILABILITYRaw reads and genome assemblies have been deposited in GenBank (BioProjects PRJNA329579 for Pl. viticola and PRJNA448661 for Pl. muralis).

We developed an experimental system to separate interaction stages and single macrophage cells infected with C. albicans from uninfected cells and assessed transcriptional variability in the host and fungus. Macrophages displayed an initial up-regulation of pathways involved in phagocytosis and proinflammatory response after C. albicans exposure that declined during later time points. Phagocytosed C. albicans shifted expression programs to survive the nutrient poor phagosome and remodeled the cell wall. The transcriptomes of single infected macrophages and phagocytosed C. albicans revealed a tightly coordinated shift in gene expression co-stages and revealed expression bimodality and differential splicing that may drive infection outcome.

Currently used antifungals suffer from inefficiency, toxic side effects and developing drug-resistance. Additionally, over the last two decades no new classes of antifungals have been approved, emphasizing the urgent need for developing a novel generation of antifungals. Here we investigate the antifungal activity of a series of chemically synthesized Hydroxytyrosol (HT) analogues. HT is one of the major phenolic compounds in olive oil, shown to possess radical-scavenging antioxidant, antiproliferative, proapoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities. No previous report has studied HT analogues as antifungals. We show that specific analogues have broad and strong antifungal activity, significantly stronger than the parent compound HT. Using A. nidulans as an in vivo cellular model system, we show that antifungal HT analogues have an unprecedented efficiency in fungal plasma membrane destruction. Importantly, antifungal HT analogues did not show toxicity in a mammalian cell line, whereas no resistance to HT analogues was obtained by standard mutagenesis. Our results open the way for the development of a novel, efficient and safer class of antifungals.",

    "abstract": "Auditory stimulus reconstruction is a technique that finds the best approximation of the acoustic stimulus from the population of evoked neural activity. Reconstructing speech from the human auditory cortex creates the possibility of a speech neuroprosthetic to establish a direct communication with the brain and has been shown to be possible in both overt and covert conditions. However, the low quality of the reconstructed speech has severely limited the utility of this method for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we combined the recent advances in deep learning with the latest innovations in speech synthesis technologies to reconstruct closed-set intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex. We investigated the dependence of reconstruction accuracy on linear and nonlinear (deep neural network) regression methods and the acoustic representation that is used as the target of reconstruction, including auditory spectrogram and speech synthesis parameters. In addition, we compared the reconstruction accuracy from low and high neural frequency ranges. Our results show that a deep neural network model that directly estimates the parameters of a speech synthesizer from all neural frequencies achieves the highest subjective and objective scores on a digit recognition task, improving the intelligibility by 65% over the baseline method which used linear regression to reconstruct the auditory spectrogram. These results demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning and speech synthesis algorithms for designing the next generation of speech BCI systems, which not only can restore communications for paralyzed patients but also have the potential to transform human-computer interaction technologies.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWhite matter fibre development in childhood involves dynamic changes to microstructural organisation driven by increasing axon diameter, density, and myelination. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies that have quantified advanced diffusion metrics to identify regions of accelerated fibre maturation, particularly across the early pubertal period. We applied a novel longitudinal fixel-based analysis (FBA) framework, in order to estimate microscopic and macroscopic white matter changes over time.\\n\\nMethodsDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired for 59 typically developing children (27 female) aged 9 - 13 years at two time-points approximately 16 months apart (time-point 1: 10.4 {+/-} 0.4 years, time-point 2: 11.7 {+/-} 0.5 years). Whole brain FBA was performed using the connectivity-based fixel enhancement method, to assess longitudinal changes in fibre microscopic density and macroscopic morphological measures, and how these changes are affected by sex, pubertal stage, and pubertal progression. Follow-up analyses were performed in sub-regions of the corpus callosum to confirm the main findings using a Bayesian repeated measures approach.\\n\\nResultsThere was a statistically significant increase in fibre density over time localised to medial and posterior commissural and association fibres, including the forceps major and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus. Increases in fibre cross-section were substantially more widespread. The rate of fibre development was not associated with age or sex. In addition, there was no significant relationship between pubertal stage or progression and longitudinal fibre development over time. Follow-up Bayesian analyses were performed to confirm the findings, which supported the null effect of the longitudinal pubertal comparison.\\n\\nConclusionUsing a novel longitudinal fixel-based analysis framework, we demonstrate that white matter fibre density and fibre cross-section increased within a 16-month scan rescan period in specific regions. The observed increases might reflect increasing axonal diameter or axon count. Pubertal stage or progression did not influence the rate of fibre development in the early stages of puberty. Future work should focus on quantifying these measures across a wider age range to capture the full spectrum of fibre development across the pubertal period.",

    "abstract": "Motion detection represents one of the critical tasks of the visual system and has motivated a large body of research. However, is remain unclear precisely why the response of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to simple artificial stimuli does not predict their response to complex naturalistic stimuli. To explore this topic, we use Motion Clouds (MC), which are synthetic textures that preserve properties of natural images and are merely parameterized, in particular by modulating the spatiotemporal spectrum complexity of the stimulus by adjusting the frequency bandwidths. By stimulating the retina of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus with MC we show that the RGCs respond to increasingly complex stimuli by narrowing their adjustment curves in response to movement. At the level of the population, complex stimuli produce a sparser code while preserving movement information; therefore, the stimuli are encoded more efficiently. Interestingly, these properties were observed throughout different populations of RGCs. Thus, our results reveal that the response at the level of RGCs is modulated by the naturalness of the stimulus - in particular for motion - which suggests that the tuning to the statistics of natural images already emerges at the level of the retina.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive bacillus that under conditions of environmental stress, such as low nutrients, can convert from a vegetative bacillus to a highly durable spore that enables long-term survival. The sporulation process is regulated by a sequential cascade of dedicated transcription factors but requires key nutrients to complete, one of which is iron. Iron acquisition by the iron-scavenging siderophore petrobactin is the only such system known to be required for vegetative growth of B. anthracis in iron-depleted conditions, e.g., in the host. However, the extent to which petrobactin is involved in spore formation is unknown. This work shows that efficient in vitro sporulation of B. anthracis requires petrobactin, that the petrobactin biosynthesis operon (asbA-F) is induced prior to sporulation, and that petrobactin itself is associated with spores. Petrobactin is also required for both oxidative stress protection during late stage growth and wild-type levels of sporulation in sporulation medium. When considered with the petrobactin-dependent sporulation in bovine blood also described in this work, these effects on in vitro growth and sporulation suggest that petrobactin is required for B. anthracis transmission via the spore during natural infections in addition to its key functions during active anthrax infections.\\n\\nImportanceBacillus anthracis causes the disease anthrax, which is transmitted via its dormant, spore phase. However, converting from bacilli to spore is a complex, energetically costly process that requires many nutrients including iron. B. anthracis requires the siderophore petrobactin to scavenge iron from host environments. We show that in the Sterne strain, petrobactin is required also for efficient sporulation, even when ample iron is available. The petrobactin biosynthesis operon is expressed during sporulation, and petrobactin is biosynthesized during growth in high iron sporulation medium but instead of being exported, the petrobactin remains intracellular to protect against oxidative stress and improve sporulation. It is also required for full growth and sporulation in blood (bovine), an essential step for anthrax transmission between mammalian hosts.",

    "abstract": "Human visual recognition activates a dense network of overlapping feedforward and recurrent neuronal processes, making it hard to disentangle processing in the feedforward from the feedback direction. Here, we used ultra-rapid serial visual presentation to suppress sustained activity that blurs the boundaries of processing steps, enabling us to resolve two distinct stages of processing with MEG multivariate pattern classification. The first processing stage was the rapid activation cascade of the bottom-up sweep, which terminated early as visual stimuli were presented at progressively faster rates. The second stage was the emergence of categorical information with peak latency that shifted later in time with progressively faster stimulus presentations, indexing time-consuming recurrent processing. Using MEG-fMRI fusion with representational similarity, we localized recurrent signals in early visual cortex. Together, our findings segregated an initial bottom-up sweep from subsequent feedback processing, and revealed the neural signature of increased recurrent processing demands for challenging viewing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Infection is a common cause for an outpatient visit for young children. Pivalate-conjugated antibiotics (PCAs) are often used for these patients in Japan. However, a few case reports have shown that PCAs can provoke hypoglycemia in children, but no larger study has shown that PCAs increase the risk of hypoglycemia. The current study was performed as a retrospective review of children aged 1 month to 5 years old with at least once prescription of PCAs or other beta-lactam antibiotics from January 2011 to December 2013, using a medical and pharmacy claims database. Hypoglycemia was defined based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision code or prescription of 10% or 20% glucose injection, and the incidence of hypoglycemic events was investigated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the risk of hypoglycemia with PCAs compared with control antibiotics. The study cohort contained 179,594 eligible patients (male: 52.2%, mean age: 3.2 years). The numbers of prescriptions were 454,153 and 417,287 for PCAs and control antibiotics, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that PCAs were associated with hypoglycemia (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.24, P < 0.01), and the risk of hypoglycemia was also significantly increased with use of PCAs for [&le;]7 days (adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.24, P < 0.01). These results suggest that prescription of PCAs to young children should be avoided, even for a short time period.",

    "abstract": "This article reports on the results of the EU PacTVET project, which explored the use of Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) to provide a better understanding on the development solution for the impact of climate change on human health in the region. It describes the findings of a 2014-2018 project on the use of vocational education to provide development solutions in the Pacific with an emphasis on climate change and health. An exploratory design was used to investigate how vocational education developed solutions for climate change and health in the 15 Pacific - African Caribbean and Pacific (P-ACP) countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Information collected via personal communication with relevant stakeholders, qualitative interviews, documents review, and survey (n=48) of youths and young women in Fiji. Data analysis was performed using thematic analytical strategy and frequency analysis. The study found that vocational education plays a significant role in building the capacity of people to become more sustainable and resilient in their life now and in the future. Also, getting an accredited qualification on health resilience and/or job in the health sector may help them to respond effectively and efficiently in the event of climate change and/or disasters caused by natural hazards. The same factors were explored quantitatively using descriptive analytical strategy, and concluded TVET education, to have a positive influence on climate change and health. As a result, vocational education could provide development solutions for health adaptation in the Pacific. These results indicate global actions for vocational education, that would perfect the course of resilience for these 15 P-ACP in the Pacific and alike in the U.S.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (phylogroup Kp1), one of the most problematic pathogens associated with antibiotic resistance worldwide, is phylogenetically closely related to K. quasipneumoniae [subsp. quasipneumoniae (Kp2) and subsp. similipneumoniae (Kp4)], K. variicola (Kp3) and two unnamed phylogroups (Kp5 and Kp6). Together, Kp1 to Kp6 make-up the K. pneumoniae complex. Currently, the phylogroups can be reliably identified only by gene sequencing. Misidentification using standard methods is common and the clinical significance of K. pneumoniae complex members is therefore imprecisely defined. Here, we evaluated the potential of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to discriminate K. pneumoniae complex members. We report for the first time the existence of mass spectrometry biomarkers associated with the phylogroups, with a sensitivity and specificity ranging between 80-100% and 97-100%, respectively. Strains within phylogroups Kp1, Kp2, Kp4 and Kp5 each shared two specific peaks not observed in other phylogroups. Kp3 strains shared a peak that was only observed otherwise in Kp5. Finally, Kp6 had a diagnostic peak shared only with Kp1. Kp3 and Kp6 could therefore be identified by exclusion criteria (lacking Kp5 and Kp1-specific peaks, respectively). Further, ranked Pearson correlation clustering of spectra grouped strains according to their phylogroup. These results call for incorporation of spectra of all K. pneumoniae complex members into reference MALDI-TOF spectra databases, in which they are currently lacking. This advance may allow for simple and precise identification of K. pneumoniae and closely related species, opening the way to a better understanding of their epidemiology, ecology and pathogenesis.",
