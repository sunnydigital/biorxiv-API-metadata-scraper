    "abstract": "Taxonomy assignment of freshwater microbial communities is limited by the minimally curated phylogenies used for large taxonomy databases. Here we introduce TaxAss, a taxonomy assignment workflow that classifies 16S rRNA gene amplicon data using two taxonomy reference databases: a large comprehensive database and a small ecosystem-specific database rigorously curated by scientists within a field. We applied TaxAss to five different freshwater datasets using the comprehensive Silva database and the freshwater-specific FreshTrain database. TaxAss increased the percent of the dataset classified compared to using only Silva, especially at fine-resolution family-species taxa levels, while across the freshwater test-datasets classifications increased by as much as 11-40 percent of total reads. A similar increase in classifications was not observed in a control mouse gut dataset, which was not expected to contain freshwater bacteria. TaxAss also maintained taxonomic richness compared to using only the FreshTrain across all taxa-levels from phylum to species. Without TaxAss, most organisms not represented in the FreshTrain were unclassified, but at fine taxa levels incorrect classifications became significant. We validated TaxAss using simulated amplicon data with known taxonomy and found that 96-99% of test sequences were correctly classified at fine resolution. TaxAss splits a datasets sequences into two groups based on their percent identity to reference sequences in the ecosystem-specific database. Sequences with high similarity to sequences in the ecosystem-specific database are classified using that database, and the others are classified using the comprehensive database. TaxAss is free and open source, and available at www.github.com/McMahonLab/TaxAss.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial communities drive ecosystem processes, but microbial community composition analyses using 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets are limited by the lack of fine-resolution taxonomy classifications. Coarse taxonomic groupings at phylum, class, and order level lump ecologically distinct organisms together. To avoid this, many researchers define operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustered sequences, sequence variants, or unique sequences. These fine-resolution groupings are more ecologically relevant, but OTU definitions are dataset-dependent and cannot be compared between datasets. Microbial ecologists studying freshwater have curated a small, ecosystem-specific taxonomy database to provide consistent and up-to-date terminology. We created TaxAss, a workflow that leverages this database to assign taxonomy. We found that TaxAss improves fine-resolution taxonomic classifications (family, genus and species). Fine taxonomic groupings are more ecologically relevant, so they provide an alternative to OTU-based analyses that is consistent and comparable between datasets.",

    "abstract": "Methionine availability during overall amino acid limitation metabolically reprograms cells to support proliferation, the underlying basis for which remains unclear. Here, we construct the organization of this methionine mediated anabolic program, using yeast. Combining comparative transcriptome analysis, biochemical and metabolic flux based approaches, we discover that methionine rewires overall metabolic outputs by increasing the activity of three key regulatory nodes. These are: the pentose phosphate pathway coupled with reductive biosynthesis, and overall transamination capacity, including the synthesis of glutamate/glutamine. These provides the cofactors or substrates that enhance subsequent rate-limiting reactions in the synthesis of costly amino acids, and nucleotides, which are also induced in a methionine dependent manner. This thereby results in a biochemical cascade establishing an overall anabolic program. For this methionine mediated anabolic program leading to proliferation, cells co-opt a \\\"starvation stress response\\\" regulator, Gcn4p. Collectively, our data suggest a hierarchical metabolic framework explaining how methionine mediates an anabolic switch.",

    "abstract": "At least two distinct processes have been identified by which motor commands are adapted according to movement-related feedback: reward based learning and sensory error based learning. In sensory error based learning, mappings between sensory targets and motor commands are recalibrated according to sensory error feedback. In reward based learning, motor commands are associated with subjective value, such that successful actions are reinforced. We designed two tasks to isolate reward and sensory error based motor adaptation, and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from humans to identify and dissociate the neural correlates of reward and sensory error processing. We designed a visuomotor rotation task to isolate sensory error based learning which was induced by altered visual feedback of hand position. In a reward learning task, we isolated reward based learning induced by binary reward feedback that was decoupled from the visual target. We found that a fronto-central event related potential called the feedback related negativity (FRN) was elicited specifically by reward feedback but not sensory error feedback. A more posterior component called the P300 was evoked by feedback in both tasks. In the visuomotor rotation task, P300 amplitude was increased by sensory error induced by perturbed visual feedback, and was correlated with learning rate. In the reward learning task, P300 amplitude was increased by reward relative to non reward and by surprise regardless of feedback valence. We propose that during motor adaptation, the FRN might specifically mark reward prediction error while the P300 might reflect processing which is modulated more generally by prediction error.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyWe studied the event related potentials evoked by feedback stimuli during motor adaptation tasks that isolate reward and sensory error learning mechanisms. We found that the feedback related negativity was specifically elicited by reward feedback, while the P300 was observed in both tasks. These results reveal neural processes associated with different learning mechanisms and elucidate which classes of errors, from a computational standpoint, elicit the FRN and P300.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBisPin is a new multiprocess bisulfite-treated short DNA read mapper written in Python 2.7. It performs alignments using BFAST, leveraging its multithreading functionality and thorough hash-based indexing strategy. BisPin is feature rich and supports directional, nondirectional, PBAT, and hairpin construction strategies. BisPin approaches read mapping by converting the Cs to Ts and the Gs to As in both the reads and the reference genome. BisPin uses fast rescoring to disambiguate ambiguously aligned reads for a superior amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers. The performance of BisPin was evaluated on both real and simulated data in comparison to other read mappers.\\n\\nBFAST-Gap is a modified version of BFAST meant for Ion Torrent reads. It uses a parameterized logistic function to determine the weights of the gap open and extension penalties based on the homopolymer run length of the DNA read. This is because the Ion Torrent sequencing technology can overcall and undercall homopolymer runs. BisPin works with both BFAST-Gap and BFAST. BFAST-Gap is compatible with indexes built with BFAST. There are few mappers that specifically address Ion Torrent data. BFAST-Gap works with Illumina reads as well.\\n\\nResultsBisPin with BFAST consistently had a higher amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers on real data using a variety of construction strategies. Using a hairpin validation strategy, BisPin was superior using the maximum score, and it mapped 73% of reads correctly.\\n\\nBisPin with BFAST-Gap on Ion Torrent reads with a logistic gap open penalty function improved mapping accuracy with real and simulated data. On simulated bisulfite Ion Torrent data, the area under the curve was improved by approximately seven, and on one real data set, the uniquely mapped percent was improved by seven percent. BFAST-Gap performed better than TMAP on simulated regular Ion Torrent reads, and TMAP is designed for Ion Torrent reads. Other read mappers had worse performance.\\n\\nConclusionsBisPin and BFAST-Gap have consistently good accuracy with a variety of data. BisPin is feature-rich. This makes BisPin and BFAST-Gap useful additions to read mapping software.",

We traced the lineages deriving from each blastomere in two-cell mouse embryos and observed inequivalent contributions to the embryonic and abembryonic poles in 72% of the blastocysts evaluated. Rainbow-seq on four- and eight-cell embryos with lineage tracing triggered at two-cell stage exhibited remarkable transcriptome-wide differences between the two cell lineages at both stages, including genes involved in negative regulation of transcription and signaling.

The evolutionary history of these genes is still under debate due to ambiguous definitions of homologous relationships among vertebrates. Thus, the goal of this study was to unravel the evolution of the GDF1 and GDF3 genes of vertebrates, emphasizing the understanding of homologous relationships and their evolutionary origin. Surprisingly, our results revealed that the GDF1 and GDF3 genes found in amphibians and mammals are the products of independent duplication events of an ancestral gene in the ancestor of each of these lineages. The main implication of this result is that the GDF1 and GDF3 genes of amphibians and mammals are not 1:1 orthologs. In other words, genes that participate in fundamental processes during early development have been reinvented two independent times during the evolutionary history of tetrapods.",

    "abstract": "In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quorum sensing (QS) is a social trait that is exploitable by non-cooperating cheats. Previously it has been shown that by linking QS to the production of both public and private goods, cheats can be prevented from invading populations of cooperators and this has been termed  a metabolic incentive to cooperate. We hypothesized P. aeruginosa could evolve novel cheating strategies to circumvent private goods metabolism by rewiring its combinatorial response to two QS signals (3O-C12-HSL and C4-HSL). We performed a selection experiment that cycled P. aeruginosa between public and private goods growth media and evolved an isolate which rewired its control of cooperative protease expression from a synergistic (AND-gate) response to dual signal input, to a 3O-C12-HSL only response. We show that this isolate circumvents metabolic incentives to cooperate and acts as a combinatorial signaling cheat, with a higher fitness in competition with its ancestor. Our results show three important principles; first, combinatorial QS allows for diverse social strategies to emerge; second, that restrictions levied by private goods are not sufficient to explain the maintenance of cooperation in natural populations and third that modifying combinatorial QS responses could result in important physiological outcomes in bacterial populations.",

    "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM), the brief retention of past visual information, supports a range of cognitive functions (Fukuda, Vogel, Mayr, & Awh, 2010; Johnson et al., 2013). The resource that supports VWM is limited, raising the question of how the brain allocates this limited resource to different objects. This question is even more interesting in ecological settings, in which objects are not equally important. In a psychophysical experiment, participants remembered the location of four targets with different probabilities of being tested after a delay. We then measured their memory accuracy of one of the targets. We found that participants allocated more resource to memoranda with higher priority, but underallocated resource to high- and overallocated to low-priority targets relative to the true probe probabilities. These results are well explained by a computational model in which resource is allocated to minimize expected estimation error. We replicated this finding in a second experiment in which participants bet on their memory fidelity after making the location estimate. The results of this experiment show that people 1) use information about memory quality and 2) minimize error even with an incentivized, alternative resource allocation strategy. Humans may mitigate the behavioral effects of a limited VWM through knowledge of memory fidelity and strategic resource allocation.",

Recent developments in deep learning can yield superior accuracy, but typical evaluation metrics for nucleus segmentation do not satisfactorily capture error modes that are relevant in cellular images. Besides, large image data sets with ground truth for evaluation have been limiting. We present an evaluation framework to measure accuracy, types of errors, and computational efficiency; and use it to compare two deep learning strategies (U-Net and DeepCell) alongside a classical approach implemented in CellProfiler. We publicly release a set of 23,165 manually annotated nuclei and source code to reproduce experiments. Our results show that U-Net outperforms both pixel-wise classification networks and classical algorithms. Also, our evaluation framework shows that deep learning improves accuracy and reduces the number of biologically relevant errors by half.",

We develop a weakly supervised deep learning model for classification of aortic valve malformations using up to 4,000 unlabeled cardiac MRI sequences. Instead of requiring highly curated training data, weak supervision relies on noisy heuristics defined by domain experts to programmatically generate large-scale, imperfect training labels. For aortic valve classification, models trained with imperfect labels substantially outperform a supervised model trained on hand-labeled MRIs. In an orthogonal validation experiment using health outcomes data, our model identifies individuals with a 1.8-fold increase in risk of a major adverse cardiac event.

This mechanism explains the decline in clinical predictive power with age and the lower discovery power of familial studies of heritability and genome-wide association studies. It also explains the relatively constant-with-age heritability found for late-onset diseases of lower prevalence, exemplified by cancers.\\n\\nConclusionsFor late-onset polygenic diseases showing high cumulative incidence together with high initial heritability, rather than using relatively old age-matched cohorts, study cohorts combining the youngest possible cases with the oldest possible controls may significantly improve the discovery power of genome-wide association studies.",

    "abstract": "How the diversity of organisms competing for or sharing resources influences community production is an important question in ecology but has rarely been explored in natural microbial communities. These generally contain large numbers of species making it difficult to disentangle how the effects of different interactions scale with diversity. Here, we show that changing diversity affects measures of community function in relatively simple communities but that increasing richness beyond a threshold has little detectable effect. We generated self-assembled communities with a wide range of diversity by growth of cells from serially diluted seawater on brown algal leachate. We subsequently isolated the most abundant taxa from these communities via dilution-to-extinction in order to compare productivity functions of the entire community to those of individual taxa. To parse the effect of different types of organismal interactions, we developed relative total function (RTF) as an index for positive or negative effects of diversity on community function. Our analysis identified three overall regimes with increasing diversity. At low richness (<12 taxa), potential positive and negative effects of interactions are both weak, while at moderate richness (12-20 taxa), community resource uptake increases but the carbon use efficiency decreases. Finally, beyond 20 taxa, there was no net change in community function indicating a saturation of potential interactions. These data suggest that although more diverse communities had overall greater access to resources, individual taxa within these communities had lower resource availability and reduced carbon use efficiency, indicating that competition due to niche overlap increases with diversity but that these interactions saturate at a specific threshold.",

    "abstract": "Defective viral genomes of the copy-back type (cbDVGs) are the primary initiators of the antiviral immune response during infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of RSV cbDVGs. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced a specific cbDVG based on variations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a common site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs generated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome are critical determinants of the location of cbDVG generation and, therefore, this is not a stochastic process. Most importantly, these findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome.\n\nAuthor summaryCopy-back defective viral genomes (cbDVGs) regulate infection and pathogenesis of Mononegavirales. cbDVG are believed to arise from random errors that occur during virus replication and the predominant hypothesis is that the viral polymerase is the main driver of cbDVG generation. Here we describe a specific genomic sequence in the RSV genome that is necessary for the generation of a large proportion of the cbDVG population present during infection. We identified specific nucleotides that when modified altered cbDVG generation at this position, and we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced cbDVGs based on mutations in this sequence. These data demonstrate that the generation of RSV cbDVGs is regulated by specific viral sequences and that these sequences can be manipulated to alter the content and quality of cbDVG generated during infection.",

We have measured protein levels in HEPG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells for genes in the cell cycle pathway, DNA repair pathway and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) previously shown to have altered expression by CKI. We have also examined energy metabolism by measuring [ADT]/[ATP] ratio (cell energy charge), lactate production and glucose consumption. Our results demonstrate that CKI can suppress protein levels for cell cycle regulatory proteins and DNA repair while increasing the level of DSBs. We also show that energy metabolism is reduced based on reduced glucose consumption and reduced cellular energy charge. Our results validate these pathways as important targets for CKI. We also examined the effect of the major alkaloid component of CKI, oxymatrine and determined that it had no effect on DSBs, a small effect on the cell cycle and increased the cell energy charge. Our results indicate that CKI likely acts through the effect of multiple compounds on multiple targets where the observed phenotype is the integration of these effects and synergistic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is a potent neurotoxin that disrupts synaptic neurotransmission. We report that Synaptotagmin I (SytI), a key regulator of Ca2+-evoked neurotransmitter release, has two high-affinity Pb2+ binding sites that belong to its cytosolic C2A and C2B domains. The crystal structures of Pb2+-complexed C2 domains revealed that protein-bound Pb2+ ions have holodirected coordination geometries and all-oxygen coordination spheres. The on-rate constants of Pb2+ binding to the C2 domains of SytI are comparable to those of Ca2+ and are diffusion-limited. In contrast, the off-rate constants are at least two orders of magnitude smaller, indicating that Pb2+ can serve as both thermodynamic and kinetic trap for the C2 domains. We demonstrate, using NMR spectroscopy, that population of these sites by Pb2+ ions inhibits further Ca2+ binding despite the existing coordination vacancies. Our work offers a unique insight into the bioinorganic chemistry of Pb(II) and suggests a mechanism by which low concentrations of Pb2+ ions can interfere with the Ca2+-dependent function of SytI in the cell.",

    "abstract": "The presence of forward and reverse traveling wave modes on the basilar membrane has important implications to how the cochlea functions as a filter, transducer, and amplifier of sound. The presence and parameters of traveling waves are of particular importance to interpreting otoacoustic emissions (OAE). OAE are vibrations that propagate out of the cochlea and are measureable as sounds emitted from the tympanic membrane. The interpretation of OAE is a powerful research and clinical diagnostic tool, but OAE use has not reached full potential because the mechanisms of their generation and propagation are not fully understood. Of particular interest and deliberation is whether the emissions propagate as a fluid compression wave or a structural traveling wave. In this study a mechanical probe was used to simulate an OAE generation site and optical imaging was used to measure displacement of the inner hair cell stereocilia of the gerbil cochlea. Inner hair cell stereocilia displacement measurements were made in the radial dimension as a function of their longitudinal location along the length of the basilar membrane in response to a transverse stimulation from the probe. The analysis of the spatial frequency response of the inner hair cell stereocilia at frequencies near the characteristic frequency (CF) of the measurement location suggests that a traveling wave propagates in the cochlear partition simultaneously basal and apical (forward and reverse) from the probe location. The traveling wave velocity was estimated to be 5.9m/s - 8m/s in the base (near CF of 29kHz - 40kHz) and 1.9m/s - 2.4m/s in the second turn (near CF of 2kHz - 3kHz). These results suggest that the cochlear partition is capable of supporting both forward and reverse traveling wave modes generated by a source driving the basilar membrane. This suggests that traveling waves in the cochlear partition contribute to OAE propagation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntermediate filament cytoskeletal networks simultaneously support mechanical integrity and influence signal transduction pathways. Marked remodeling of the keratin intermediate filament network accompanies collective cellular morphogenetic movements that occur during early embryonic development in the frog Xenopus laevis. While this reorganization of keratin is initiated by force transduction on cell-cell contacts mediated by C-cadherin, the mechanism by which keratin filament reorganization occurs remains poorly understood. In this work we demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins regulate keratin reorganization dynamics in embryonic mesendoderm cells from Xenopus gastrula. 14-3-3 co-localizes with keratin filaments near cell-cell junctions in migrating mesendoderm. Co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses indicate Keratin 19 is a target of 14-3-3 in the whole embryo and, more specifically, mesendoderm tissue. Inhibition of 14-3-3 results in both the decreased exchange of keratin subunits into filaments and blocks keratin filament recruitment toward cell-cell contacts. Synthetically coupling 14-3-3 to Keratin 19 through a unique fusion construct conversely induces the localization of this keratin population to the region of cell-cell contacts. Taken together, these findings indicate that 14-3-3 acts on keratin intermediate filaments and is involved in their reorganization to sites of cell adhesion.",

    "abstract": "To function properly, mitochondria utilize products of 37 and >1,000 genes encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, respectively, which should be compatible with each other. Discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic ancestry could contribute to phenotypic variation in admixed populations. Here we explored potential mito-nuclear incompatibility in six admixed human populations from the Americas: African Americans, African Caribbeans, Colombians, Mexicans, Peruvians, and Puerto Ricans. For individuals in these populations, we determined nuclear genome proportions derived from Africans, Europeans, and Native Americans, the geographic origins of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as well as mtDNA copy number in lymphoblastoid cell lines. By comparing nuclear vs. mitochondrial ancestry in admixed populations, we show that, first, mtDNA copy number decreases with increasing discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ancestry, in agreement with mito-nuclear incompatibility. The direction of this effect is consistent across mtDNA haplogroups of different geographic origins. This observation suggests suboptimal regulation of mtDNA replication when its components are encoded by nuclear and mtDNA genes with different ancestry. Second, while most populations analyzed exhibit no such trend, in Puerto Ricans and African Americans we find a significant enrichment of ancestry at nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes towards the source populations contributing the most prevalent mtDNA haplogroups (Native American and African, respectively). This likely reflects compensatory effects of selection in recovering mito-nuclear interactions optimized in the source populations. Our results provide the first evidence of mito-nuclear effects in human admixed populations and we discuss its implications for human health and disease.",

In line with this, nadp-me1 plants show a weaker response of primary and lateral root length and stomatal opening to the presence of ABA.\\n\\nThe results suggest that NADP-ME1 plays a specialized role, linked to ABA signalling during the seed development as well as in the response to saline and osmotic stress.",

A similar reduction in genetic diversity of protein-coding genes (gene diversity) was found in exome sequences of three Neandertals. Reduced gene diversity, and particularly in genes involved in immunity, may have important functional consequences. In fact, it has been suggested that reduced diversity in immune genes may have contributed to Neandertal extinction. We therefore explored gene diversity in different human groups and at different time points on the Neandertal lineage with a particular focus on the diversity of genes involved in innate immunity and genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).\\n\\nWe find that the two Neandertals and the Denisovan have similar gene diversity, both significantly lower than any present-day human. This is true across gene categories, with no gene set showing an excess decrease in diversity compared to the genome-wide average. Innate immune-related genes show a similar reduction in diversity to other genes, both in present-day and archaic humans. There is also no observable decrease in gene diversity over time in Neandertals, suggesting that there may have been no ongoing reduction in gene diversity in later Neandertals, although this needs confirmation with a larger sample size. In both archaic and present-day humans, genes with the highest levels of diversity are enriched for MHC-related functions.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as epigenetic dynamic modifications, plays a pivotal role in invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Here, we report that WDR5, the core subunit of histone H3 K4 methyltransferase complexes, is crucial in coordinating EMT and regulating epigenetic changes that drive metastasis. We show that silencing of WDR5 in BC up-regulates an epithelial signature in triple negative and luminal B like patients by transcriptional repression of mesenchymal genes and reduction of the metastatic properties of these cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that this regulation is mediated by inhibition of the TGF{beta} signaling both at the transcriptional and post-translational level, suggesting an active role of WDR5 in guiding tumor plasticity upon oncogenic insults, regardless of the pathological BC subtypes.\\n\\nWe therefore suggest that WDR5 inhibition could be a successful pharmacologic approach to inhibit EMT and sensitize breast cancer cells to chemotherapy.",

Absence of ILC2s leads to utero-placental abnormalities, including poor vascular remodelling, increased Il1b and decreased Il4, Il5, and Il13 gene expression, and reduced alternative activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Placentas exhibit signs of adaptation to stress, including larger maternal blood spaces and increased expression of nutrient transporter genes. Endotoxin induces the expansion of IL-1{beta}-producing uterine DCs and, in response, more uterine ILC2s produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. In a protective feedback mechanism, these cytokines suppress IL-1{beta}-producing DCs, in line with a protective role of uILC2s against endotoxin-induced abortion.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer metastases primarily localize in the bone where they induce a unique osteoblastic response. Elevated Notch activity is associated with high-grade disease and metastasis. To address how Notch affects prostate cancer bone lesions, we manipulated Notch expression in mouse tibia xenografts and monitored tumor growth, lesion phenotype, and the bone microenvironment. Prostate cancer cell lines that induce mixed osteoblastic lesions in bone expressed 5-6 times more Notch3, than tumor cells that produce osteolytic lesions. Expression of active Notch3 (NICD3) in osteolytic tumors reduced osteolytic lesion area and enhanced osteoblastogenesis, while loss of Notch3 in osteoblastic tumors enhanced osteolytic lesion area and decreased osteoblastogensis. This was accompanied by a respective decrease and increase in the number of active osteoclasts and osteoblasts at the tumor-bone interface, without any effect on tumor proliferation. Conditioned medium from NICD3-expressing cells enhanced osteoblast differentiation and proliferation in vitro, while simultaneously inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. MMP-3 was specifically elevated and secreted by NICD3-expressing tumors, and inhibition of MMP-3 rescued the NICD3-induced osteoblastic phenotypes. Clinical osteoblastic bone metastasis samples had higher levels of Notch3 and MMP-3 compared to patient matched visceral metastases or osteolytic metastasis samples. We identified a Notch3-MMP-3 axis in human prostate cancer bone metastases that contributes to osteoblastic lesion formation by blocking osteoclast differentiation, while also contributing to osteoblastogenesis. These studies define a new role for Notch3 in manipulating the tumor microenvironment in bone metastases.",

Here, we demonstrate that the cell surface protein CD38 is a key human NK cell functional receptor through a role in immune synapse formation. CD38 expression marks a mature subset of human NK cells with a high functional capacity. NK cells expressing high levels of CD38 display enhanced killing and IFN-{gamma} secretion in response to influenza virus-infected and tumor cells. Inhibition of CD38 enzymatic activity does not influence NK cell function, but blockade of CD38 and its ligand CD31 abrogates killing and IFN-{gamma} expression in response to influenza-infected cells. Blockade of CD38 on NK cells similarly inhibits killing of tumor cells. CD38 localizes and accumulates at the immune synapse between NK cells and their targets, and blocking CD38 severely abrogates the ability of NK cells to form conjugates and immune synapses with target cells. Thus, CD38 plays a critical role in NK cell immune synapse formation. These findings open new avenues in immunotherapeutic development for cancer and infection by revealing a critical role for CD38 in NK cell function.",

    "abstract": "Gamma oscillations facilitate information processing by shaping the excitatory input/output of neuronal populations, and their suppression by strong excitatory drive may stem from inhibitory-based gain control of network excitation. Individual variations in the gamma suppression may therefore reflect efficiency of gain control and subjective sensitivity to everyday sensory events. To test this prediction, we assessed the link between self-reported sensory sensitivity and changes in magneto-encephalographic gamma oscillations as a function of motion velocity of high-contrast visual gratings. The induced gamma oscillations increased in frequency and decreased in power with increasing stimulation intensity. As expected, weaker suppression of the gamma response correlated with sensory hypersensitivity. Robustness of this result was confirmed by its replication in the two samples: neurotypical subjects and people with autism, who had generally higher sensory sensitivity. We conclude that intensity-related suppression of gamma response is a promising biomarker of homeostatic control of the excitation-inhibition balance in the visual cortex.",

Consistent with this link between desynchronization and engagement, we found that rewards had a long-lasting desynchronizing effect. To determine whether engagement-related changes in cortical state depended on the sensory modality, we trained mice on visual and auditory task versions and found that desynchronization was similar in both and more pronounced in somatomotor than either sensory cortex.

To shed light on molecular and neurobiological mechanisms mediating brood parasitic behavior, brain gene expression patterns between two brood parasitic species and one closely related non-parasitic Icterid (blackbird) species were compared. Our analyses focused on gene expression changes specifically in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region known to play a critical role in maternal behavior across vertebrates. Using comparative transcriptomic approaches, we identified gene expression patterns associated with brood parasitism and evaluated two alternative explanations for the evolution of brood parasitism: reduced expression of parental-related genes in the POA versus retention of juvenile (neotenic) gene expression. While we did not find evidence for large scale gene downregulation, expression patterns did reflect substantial evidence for neotenic POA gene expression in parasitic birds. Differentially expressed genes with previously established roles in parental care were identified. Targeted examination of these selected candidate genes in additional hypothalamic regions revealed species differences in gene expression patterns is not POA-specific. Together, these results provide new insights into neurogenomics underlying maternal behavior loss in avian brood parasites.",

Two of the most pervasive global change drivers are drought and nutrient enrichment. However, the responses of soil organisms to interacting global change drivers remain widely unknown. We tested the interactive effects of extreme drought and fertilization on soil biota ranging from microbes to invertebrates across seasons. We expected drought to reduce the activity of soil organisms and fertilization to induce positive bottom-up effects via increased plant productivity. Furthermore, we hypothesized fertilization to reinforce drought effects through enhanced plant growth, resulting in even dryer soil conditions. Our results revealed that drought had detrimental effects on soil invertebrate feeding activity and simplified nematode community structure, whereas soil microbial activity and biomass were unaffected. Microbial biomass increased in response to fertilization, whereas invertebrate feeding activity substantially declined. Notably, these effects were consistent across seasons. The dissimilar responses suggest that soil biota differ vastly in their vulnerability to global change drivers. As decomposition and nutrient cycling are driven by the interdependent concurrence of microbial and faunal activity, this may imply far-reaching consequences for crucial ecosystem processes in a changing world.",

However, the relationship between group size and individual fitness has been difficult to establish for long-lived species where the number of groups studied is typically quite low. Here we present evidence for optimal group size that maximizes female fitness in a population of geladas (Theropithecus gelada). Drawing on 14 years of demographic data, we found that females in small groups experienced the highest death rates, while females in mid-sized units exhibited the highest reproductive performance. This group-size effect on female reproductive performance was largely explained by variation in infant mortality (and, in particular, by infanticide from immigrant males) but not by variation in reproductive rates. Taken together, females in mid-sized units are projected to attain optimal fitness due to conspecific infanticide and, potentially, predation. Our findings provide insight into how and why group size shapes fitness in long-lived species.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine nitration is a hallmark of oxidative stress related disease states, commonly detected as anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. The precise reactive oxygen sources, mechanisms of nitration as well as the modified target proteins and functional consequences, however, remain often unclear. Here we explore protein tyrosine nitration under basal conditions and find surprisingly physiologically nitrated proteins. Upon purifying a prominent physiologically nitrotyrosine immunopositive in hearts from mouse, rat and pig, we identify it as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Mechanistically, LDHs degree of basal nitration depended on two canonical sources, NO synthase (NOS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), respectively. When validating the nitrated amino acid by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we, surprisingly, located LDH nitration not to a tyrosine but the C-terminal tryptophan, Trp324. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Trp324 nitration restricts the interaction of the active site loop with the C-terminal -helix essential for activity. This prediction was confirmed by enzyme kinetics revealing an apparent lower Vmax of nitrated LDH, although yet unidentified concurrent oxidative modifications may contribute. Protein nitration is, thus, not a by definition disease marker but reflects also physiological signaling by eNOS/NO, MPO/nitrite and possibly other pathways. The commonly used assay of anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is apparently cross-reactive to nitrotryptophan requiring a reevaluation of the protein nitration literature. In the case of LDH, nitration of Trp324 is aggravated under cardiac metabolic stress conditions and functionally limits maximal enzyme activity. Trp324-nitrated LDH may serve both as a previously not recognized disease biomarker and possibly mechanistic lead to understand the metabolic changes under these conditions.",

Here we develop a robust, defined, keratinocyte differentiation system, and use a multi-dimensional genomics approach to interrogate the contributions of the morphogens and lineage selector to chromatin dynamics during early surface ectoderm commitment. In stark contrast to other master regulators6-9, we find using p63 gain and loss of function hESC lines, that p63 effects major transcriptional changes only after morphogenetic action. Morphogens alter chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, establishing an epigenetic landscape for p63 to modify. In turn, p63 closes chromatin accessibility and promotes the accumulation of repressive H3K27me3 histone modifications at sites distal to where it binds. Surprisingly, cohesin HiChIP10 visualization of genome-wide chromosome conformation reveals that both p63 and the morphogens contribute to dynamic long-range genomic interactions that increase the probability of negative transcriptional regulation at p63 target loci. p63-regulated accessibility, not H3K27me3 deposition, appears to drive early transcriptional changes. We illustrate morphogen-selector interactions by studying p63 negative feedback regulation of TFAP2Ci11, whereby disruption of the single p63 binding site results in a loss of p63-mediated transcriptional control and dramatic increases in TFAP2C and p63 expression. Our study reveals the unexpected dependency of p63 on morphogenetic signaling to control long-range chromatin interactions during tissue specification and provides novel insights into how master regulators specify diverse morphological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of protein aggregates is a major cause of Parkinsons disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is one of the most common causes of dementia. Transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans worms expressing the human synaptic protein -synuclein show inclusions of aggregated protein and replicate the defining pathological hallmarks of PD. It is however not known how PD progression and pathology differs among individual genetic backgrounds. Here, we compared gene expression patterns, and investigated the phenotypic consequences of transgenic -synuclein expression in five different C. elegans genetic backgrounds. Transcriptome analysis indicates that the effects of -synuclein expression on pathways associated with nutrient storage, lipid transportation and ion exchange depend on the genetic background. The gene expression changes we observe suggest that a range of phenotypes will be affected by -synuclein expression. We experimentally confirm this, showing that the transgenic lines generally show delayed development, reduced lifespan, and an increased rate of matricidal hatching. These phenotypic effects coincide with the core changes in gene expression, linking developmental arrest, mobility, metabolic and cellular repair mechanisms to -synuclein expression. Together, our results show both genotype-specific effects and core alterations in global gene expression and in phenotype in response to -synuclein. We conclude that the PD effects are substantially modified by the genetic background, illustrating that genetic background mechanisms should be elucidated to understand individual variation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) colonize intestinal epithelium by generating characteristic attaching and effacing (AE) lesions. They are lysogenized by prophage that encode Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), which is responsible for severe clinical manifestations. As a lysogen, prophage genes leading to lytic growth and stx2 expression are repressed, whereas induction of the bacterial SOS response in response to DNA damage leads to lytic phage growth and Stx2 production both in vitro and in germ-free or streptomycin-treated mice.\\n\\nSome commensal bacteria diminish prophage induction and concomitant Stx2 production in vitro, whereas it has been proposed that phage-susceptible commensals may amplify Stx2 production by facilitating successive cycles of infection in vivo. We tested the role of phage induction in both Stx production and lethal disease in microbiome-replete mice, using our mouse model encompassing the murine pathogen Citrobacterrodentium lysogenized with the Stx2-encoding phage {Phi}stx2dact. This strain generates EHEC-like AE lesions on the murine intestine and causes lethal Stx-mediated disease. We found that lethal mouse infection did not require that {Phi}stx2dact infect or lysogenize commensal bacteria. In addition, we detected circularized phage genomes, potentially in the early stage of replication, in feces of infected mice, confirming that prophage induction occurs during infection of microbiota-replete mice. Further, C. rodentium ({Phi}stx2dact) mutants that do not respond to DNA damage or express stx produced neither high levels of Stx2 in vitro or lethal infection in vivo, confirming that SOS induction and concomitant expression of phage-encoded stx genes are required for disease. In contrast, C. rodentium ({Phi}stx2dact) mutants incapable of prophage genome excision or of packaging phage genomes retained the ability to produce Stx in vitro, as well as to cause lethal disease in mice. Thus, in a microbiome-replete EHEC infection model, lytic induction of Stx-encoding prophage is essential for lethal disease, but actual phage production is not.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEnterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a food-borne pathogen that produces Shiga toxin, is associated with serious disease outbreaks worldwide, including over 390 food poisoning outbreaks in the U.S. in the last two decades. Humans acquire EHEC by ingesting contaminated food or water, or through contact with animals or their environment. Infection and toxin production may result in localized hemorrhagic colitis, but may progress to life-threatening systemic hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), the leading cause of kidney failure in children. Treatment for EHEC or HUS remains elusive, as antibiotics have been shown to exacerbate disease.\\n\\nShiga toxin genes reside on a dormant bacterial virus present in the EHEC genome, but are expressed when the virus is induced to leave its dormant state and begin to replicate. Extensive virus replication has been thought necessary to produce sufficient toxin to cause disease.\\n\\nUsing viral and bacterial mutants in our EHEC disease mouse model, we showed that whereas an inducing signal needed to begin viral replication was essential for lethal disease, virus production was not: sufficient Shiga toxin was produced to cause lethal mouse disease, even without viral replication. Future analyses of EHEC-infected human samples will determine whether this same phenomenon applies, potentially directing intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImpulsivity increases the risk for obesity and weight gain. However, the precise role of impulsivity in the aetiology of overeating behavior and obesity is currently unknown. Here we examined the relationships between personality-related measures of impulsivity, Uncontrolled Eating, BMI, and longitudinal weight changes. Additionally, we analyzed the associations between general impulsivity domains and brain cortical thickness to elucidate brain vulnerability factors related to weight gain.\n\nMethodsStudents in their first year of university - a risky period for weight gain - completed questionnaire measures of impulsivity and eating behavior at the beginning (N = 2318) of the school year. We also collected their weight at the end of the term (N = 1197). Impulsivity was divided into factors stress reactivity, reward sensitivity and lack of self-control. Using structural equation models, we tested the plausibility of a hierarchical relationship, in which impulsivity traits were associated with Uncontrolled Eating, which in turn predicted BMI and weight change. 71 participants underwent T1-weighted MRI to investigate the correlation between impulsivity and cortical thickness.\n\nResultsImpulsivity traits showed positive correlations with Uncontrolled Eating. Higher scores in Uncontrolled Eating were in turn associated with higher BMI. None of the impulsivity-related measurements nor Uncontrolled Eating were correlated with longitudinal weight gain. Higher stress sensitivity was associated with increased cortical thickness in the superior temporal gyrus. Lack of self-control was positively associated with increased thickness in the superior medial frontal gyrus. Finally, higher reward sensitivity was associated with lower thickness in the inferior frontal gyrus.\n\nConclusionThe present study provides a comprehensive characterization of the relationships between different facets of impulsivity and obesity. We show that differences in impulsivity domains might be associated with BMI via Uncontrolled Eating. Our results might inform future clinical strategies aimed at fostering self-control abilities to prevent and/or treat unhealthy weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Auditory cortex is required for sound localisation, but how neural firing in auditory cortex underlies our perception of sources in space remains unknown. We measured spatial receptive fields in animals actively attending to spatial location while they performed a relative localisation task using stimuli that varied in the spatial cues that they provided. Manipulating the availability of binaural and spectral localisation cues had mild effects on the ferrets performance and little impact on the spatial tuning of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1). Consistent with a representation of space, a subpopulation of neurons encoded spatial position across localisation cue types. Spatial receptive fields measured in the presence of a competing sound source were sharper than those measured in a single-source configuration. Together these observations suggest that A1 encodes the location of auditory objects as opposed to spatial cue values. We compared our data to predictions generated from two theories about how space is represented in auditory cortex: The two-channel model, where location is encoded by the relative activity in each hemisphere, and the labelled-line model where location is represented by the activity pattern of individual cells. The representation of sound location in A1 was mainly contralateral but peak firing rates were distributed across the hemifield consistent with a labelled line model in each hemisphere representing contralateral space. Comparing reconstructions of sound location from neural activity, we found that a labelled line architecture far outperformed two channel systems. Reconstruction ability increased with increasing channel number, saturating at around 20 channels.\\n\\nSignificance statementOur perception of a sound scene is one of distinct sound sources each of which can be localised, yet auditory space must be computed from sound location cues that arise principally by comparing the sound at the two ears. Here we ask: (1) do individual neurons in auditory cortex represent space, or sound localisation cues? (2) How is neural activity  read out for spatial perception? We recorded from auditory cortex in ferrets performing a localisation task and describe a subpopulation of neurons that represent space across localisation cues. Our data are consistent with auditory space being read out using the pattern of activity across neurons (a labelled line) rather than by averaging activity within each hemisphere (a two-channel model).",

    "abstract": "Genome-level data can provide researchers with unprecedented precision to examine the causes and genetic consequences of population declines, and to apply these results to conservation management. Here we present a high-quality, long-read, de novo genome assembly for one of the worlds most endangered bird species, the Alala. As the only remaining native crow species in Hawaii, the Alala survived solely in a captive breeding program from 2002 until 2016, at which point a long-term reintroduction program was initiated. The high-quality genome assembly was generated to lay the foundation for both comparative genomics studies, and the development of population-level genomic tools that will aid conservation and recovery efforts. We illustrate how the quality of this assembly places it amongst the very best avian genomes assembled to date, comparable to intensively studied model systems. We describe the genome architecture in terms of repetitive elements and runs of homozygosity, and we show that compared with more outbred species, the Alala genome is substantially more homozygous. We also provide annotations for a subset of immunity genes that are likely to be important for conservation applications, and we discuss how this genome is currently being used as a roadmap for downstream conservation applications.",

    "abstract": "DNA is an emerging storage medium for digital data but its adoption is hampered by limitations of phosphoramidite chemistry, which was developed for single-base accuracy required for biological functionality. Here, we establish a de novo enzymatic DNA synthesis strategy designed from the bottom-up for information storage. We harness a template-independent DNA polymerase for controlled synthesis of sequences with user-defined information content. We demonstrate retrieval of 144-bits, including addressing, from perfectly synthesized DNA strands using batch-processed Illumina and real-time Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We then develop a codec for data retrieval from populations of diverse but imperfectly synthesized DNA strands, each with a ~30% error tolerance. With this codec, we experimentally validate a kilobyte-scale design which stores 1 bit per nucleotide. Simulations of the codec support reliable and robust storage of information for large-scale systems. This work paves the way for alternative synthesis and sequencing strategies to advance information storage in DNA.",

    "abstract": "The Sec secretion pathway is found across all domains of life. A critical feature of Sec secreted proteins is the signal peptide, a short peptide with distinct physicochemical properties located at the N-terminus of the protein. Previous work indicates signal peptides are biased towards translationally inefficient codons, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation driven by selection to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the protein secretion mechanisms. We investigate codon usage in the signal peptides of E. coli using the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), the tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI), and the ribosomal overhead cost formulation of the stochastic evolutionary model of protein production rates (ROC-SEMPPR). Comparisons between signal peptides and 5-end of cytoplasmic proteins using CAI and tAI are consistent with a preference for inefficient codons in signal peptides. Simulations reveal these differences are due to amino acid usage and gene expression - we find these differences disappear when accounting for both factors. In contrast, ROC-SEMPPR, a mechanistic population genetics model capable of separating the effects of selection and mutation bias, shows codon usage bias (CUB) of the signal peptides is indistinguishable from the 5-ends of cytoplasmic proteins. Additionally, we find CUB at the 5-ends is weaker than later segments of the gene. Results illustrate the value in using models grounded in population genetics to interpret genetic data. We show failure to account for mutation bias and the effects of gene expression on the efficacy of selection against translation inefficiency can lead to a misinterpretation of codon usage patterns.",
