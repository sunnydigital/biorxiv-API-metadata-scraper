    "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly isolated from nosocomial infections. Analysis of the genome of the clinical Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate K279a indicates that it encodes a diffusible signal factor (DSF)-dependent cell-cell signaling mechanism that is highly similar to the system previously described in phytopathogens from the genera Xanthomonas and Xylella. Here we demonstrate that in S. maltophilia strain K279a, DSF signaling regulates factors contributing to virulence, biofilm formation and motility of this important opportunistic pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular RNA has been proposed to mediate communication between cells and organisms however relatively little is understood regarding how specific sequences are selected for export. Here we describe a specific Argonaute protein (exWAGO) that is secreted in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri, at multiple copies per EV. Phylogenetic and gene expression analyses demonstrate exWAGO orthologues are highly conserved and abundantly expressed in related parasites but highly diverged in free-living genus Caenorhabditis. We show that the most abundant small RNAs released from the nematode parasite are not microRNAs as previously thought, but rather secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are produced by RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases. The siRNAs that are released in EVs have distinct evolutionary properties compared to those resident in free-living or parasitic nematodes. Immunoprecipitation of exWAGO demonstrates that it specifically associates with siRNAs from transposons and newly evolved repetitive elements that are packaged in EVs and released into the host environment. Together this work demonstrates molecular and evolutionary selectivity in the small RNA sequences that are released in EVs into the host environment and identifies a novel Argonaute protein as the mediator of this.",

    "abstract": "Endothelin receptors (ETA and ETB) are class A GPCRs activated by vasoactive peptide endothelins, and are involved in blood pressure regulation. ETB-selective signaling induces vasorelaxation, and thus selective ETB agonists are expected to be utilized for improved anti-tumour drug delivery and neuroprotection. The effectiveness of a highly ETB-selective endothelin analogue, IRL1620, has been investigated in clinical trials. Here, we report the crystal structures of human ETB receptor in complex with ETB-selective agonists, endohelin-3 and IRL1620. The 2.0 [A]-resolution structure of the endothelin-3-bound receptor revealed that the disruption of water-mediated interactions between W6.48 and D2.50, which are highly conserved among class A GPCRs, is critical for receptor activation. These hydrogen-bonding interactions are partially preserved in the IRL1620-bound structure, and a functional analysis revealed the partial agonistic effect of IRL1620. The current findings clarify the detailed molecular mechanism for the coupling between the orthosteric pocket and the G-protein binding, and the partial agonistic effect of IRL1620, thus paving the way for the design of improved agonistic drugs targeting ETB.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous, but genomic analyses have identified candidate susceptibility genes. We present a CRISPR gene editing strategy to insert a protein tag and premature termination sites creating an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) knockout resource for functional studies of 10 ASD-relevant genes (AFF2/FMR2, ANOS1, ASTN2, ATRX, CACNA1C, CHD8, DLGAP2, KCNQ2, SCN2A, TENM1). Neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2)-directed differentiation of iPSCs allowed production of cortical excitatory neurons, and mutant proteins were not detectable. RNAseq revealed convergence of several neuronal networks. Using both patch-clamp and multi-electrode array approaches, the electrophysiological deficits measured were distinct for different mutations. However, they culminated in a consistent reduction in synaptic activity, including reduced spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic current frequencies in AFF2/FMR2-, ASTN2-, ATRX-, KCNQ2- and SCN2A-null neurons. Despite ASD susceptibility genes belonging to different gene ontologies, isogenic stem cell resources can reveal common functional phenotypes, such as reduced functional connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Cell walls are highly complex structures that are modified during plant growth and development. For example, the development of phloem and xylem vascular cells, which participate in the transport of sugars and water as well as support, can be influenced by cell-specific cell wall composition. Here, we used synchrotron radiation-based infrared (SR-FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy to analyze the cell wall composition of wild-type and double mutant sweet11-1sweet12-1, which impairs sugar transport, Arabidopsis floral stem vascular tissue. The SR-FTIR spectra showed that in addition to modified xylem cell wall composition, phloem cell walls in the double mutant line were characterized by modified hemicellulose composition. Moreover, combining Raman spectroscopy with a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) method identified combinations of Raman shifts that could distinguish xylem vessels and fibers. Additionally, the disruption of SWEET11 and SWEET12 genes impacts xylem cell wall composition in a cell-specific manner, with changes in hemicelluloses and cellulose observed at the xylem vessel interface. These results suggest that the facilitated transport of sugars by transporters that exist between vascular parenchyma cells and conducting cells is important to ensuring correct phloem and xylem cell wall composition.\\n\\nHighlightCombining vibrational spectroscopy techniques and multivariate analysis shows that the disruption of SWEET genes impacts phloem cell wall composition and that the effect on xylem cell wall composition is cell-specific.",
