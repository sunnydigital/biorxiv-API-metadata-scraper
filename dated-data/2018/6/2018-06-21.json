    "abstract": "Secondary contact is the reestablishment of gene flow between sister populations that have diverged. For instance, at the end of the Quaternary glaciations in Europe, secondary contact occurred during the northward expansion of the populations which had found refugia in the southern peninsulas. With the advent of multi-locus markers, secondary contact can be investigated using various molecular signatures including gradients of allele frequency, admixture clines, and local increase of genetic differentiation. We use coalescent simulations to investigate if molecular data provide enough information to distinguish between secondary contact following range expansion and an alternative evolutionary scenario consisting of a barrier to gene flow in an isolation-by-distance model. We find that an excess of Linkage Disequilibrium and of genetic diversity at the suture zone is a unique signature of secondary contact. We also find that the directionality index {Psi}, which was proposed to study range expansion, is informative to distinguish between the two hypotheses. However, although evidence for secondary contact is usually conveyed by statistics related to admixture coefficients, we find that they can be confounded by isolation-by-distance. We recommend to account for the spatial repartition of individuals when investigating secondary contact in order to better reflect the complex spatio-temporal evolution of populations and species.",

    "abstract": "Most breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis and treatment options beyond radiation and cytotoxic drugs, which have severe side effects, and hormonal treatments, which are or become ineffective for many patients, are urgently needed. This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), which had been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance.\\n\\nResults from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Healths \\\"Up For A Challenge\\\" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids via alpha-cyclodextrins (CD) as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of {beta}1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells).\\n\\nBeta-cyclodextrins ({beta}CD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller CDs also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-CD to be twice as effective as HP{beta}CD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.\\n\\nIf the previous successful animal studies with {beta}CDs are replicated with the safer and more effective CDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with CDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPCD, but women with triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively.",

    "abstract": "Convergent evolution describes the process of different populations acquiring similar phenotypes or genotypes. Complex organisms with large genomes only rarely and only under very strong selection converge to the same genotype. In contrast, independent virus populations with very small genomes often acquire identical mutations. Here we test the hypothesis of whether convergence in early HIV-1 infection is common enough to serve as an indicator for selection. To this end, we measure the number of convergent mutations in a well-studied dataset of full-length HIV-1 env genes sampled from HIV-1 infected individuals during early infection. We compare this data to a neutral model and find an excess of convergent mutations. Convergent mutations are not evenly distributed across the env gene, but more likely to occur in gp41, which suggests that convergent mutations provide a selective advantage and hence are positively selected. In contrast, mutations that are only found in an HIV-1 population of a single individual are significantly affected by purifying selection. Our analysis suggests that comparisons between convergent and private mutations with neutral models allow us to identify positive and negative selection in small viral genomes. Our results also show that selection significantly shapes HIV-1 populations even before the onset of the adaptive immune system.",

This investigation sheds new insight into dynamic relationship of cells with their surrounding environment in tumors and 3D multicellular cultures.\\n\\nNanotechnology has revolutionized the field of cancer biology and has opened new avenues towards understanding nanomechanical variations in rapidly growing tumors. Over the last decade Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) has played an important role in understanding nanomechanical properties of various cancer cell lines. This study is focused on Lewis Lung Carcinoma Cell (LLC) tumors as 3D multicellular spheroid (MS). Such multicellular structures have enabled investigation of various components of tumors in-vitro. To better comprehend mechanical properties of cells and its surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), depth dependent indentation measurements were conducted with Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Force-vs-indentation curves were used to create stiffness profiles as function of depth. Here studies were focused on outer most layer i.e. proliferation zone of the spheroid. AFM investigations of sample a MS revealed three nanomechanical topographies, Type A- high modulus due to collagen stress fibers, Type B- high stiffness at cell membrane & ECM interface and Type C - increased modulus due to cell lying deep inside matrix at the a depth of 1.35 microns. Various nanomechanical heterogeneities revealed in this investigation can shed new light in developing correct dosage regime for various tumor dissolving drugs and designing more controlled artificial extracellular matrix systems for replicating tissue growth in-vitro.\\n\\nShort Statistical SummaryThis article describes nanomechanical characteristics of the cells embedded in extracellular matrix in a multicellular spheroid.

    "abstract": "The microbial diversity and function of terrestrial lichens has been well studied, but knowledge about the non-photosynthetic bacteria associated with marine lichens is still scarce. 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing was used to assess the culture-independent bacterial diversity in the strictly marine cyanolichen species Lichina pygmaea and Lichina confinis, and the maritime chlorolichen species Xanthoria aureola which occupy different areas on the littoral zone. Inland terrestrial cyanolichens from Austria were also analysed as for the marine lichens to examine further the impact of habitat/lichen species on the associated bacterial communities. The L. confinis and L. pygmaea communities were significantly different from those of the maritime Xanthoria aureola lichen found higher up on the littoral zone and these latter communities were more similar to those of the inland terrestrial lichens. The strictly marine lichens were dominated by the Bacteroidetes phylum accounting for 50% of the sequences, whereas Alphaproteobacteria, notably Sphingomonas, dominated the maritime and the inland terrestrial lichens. Bacterial communities associated with the two Lichina species were significantly different sharing only 33 core OTUs, half of which were affiliated to the Bacteroidetes genera Rubricoccus, Tunicatimonas and Lewinella, suggesting an important role of these species in the marine Lichina lichen symbiosis. Marine cyanolichens showed a higher abundance of OTUs likely affiliated to moderately thermophilic and/or radiation resistant bacteria belonging to the Phyla Chloroflexi, Thermi, and the families Rhodothermaceae and Rubrobacteraceae when compared to those of inland terrestrial lichens. This most likely reflects the exposed and highly variable conditions to which they are subjected daily.",

Recent studies in visual perception have shown that this recency bias persists even when past events contain no information about the future. Reasons for this suboptimal behaviour are not well understood and the internal model that leads people to exhibit recency bias is unknown. Here we use a well-known orientation estimation task to frame the human recency bias in terms of incremental Bayesian inference. We show that the only Bayesian model capable of explaining the recency bias relies on a weighted mixture of past states. Furthermore, we suggest that this mixture model is a consequence of participants failure to infer a model for data in visual short term memory, and reflects the nature of the internal representations used in the task.",

    "abstract": "To detect functional somatic mutations in tumor samples, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is often used for its reliability and relative low cost. RNA-seq, while generally used to measure gene expression, can potentially also be used for identification of somatic mutations. However there has been little systematic evaluation of the utility of RNA-seq for identifying somatic mutations. Here, we develop and evaluate a pipeline for processing RNA-seq data from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors in order to identify somatic mutations. The pipeline entails the use of the STAR aligner 2-pass procedure jointly with MuTect2 from GATK to detect somatic variants. Variants identified from RNA-seq data were evaluated by comparison against the COSMIC and dbSNP databases, and also compared to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing. We also estimated the putative functional impact of coding variants in the most frequently mutated genes in GBM. Interestingly, variants identified by RNA-seq alone showed better representation of GBM-related mutations cataloged by COSMIC. RNA-seq-only data substantially outperformed the ability of WES to reveal potentially new somatic mutations in known GBM-related pathways, and allowed us to build a high-quality set of somatic mutations common to exome and RNA-seq calls. Using RNA-seq data in parallel with WES data to detect somatic mutations in cancer genomes can thus broaden the scope of discoveries and lend additional support to somatic variants identified by exome sequencing alone.",

Adaptive stimulus selection methods seek to select stimuli that are maximally informative about the PF given data observed so far in an experiment and thereby reduce the number of trials required to estimate the PF. Here we develop new adaptive stimulus selection methods for flexible PF models in tasks with two or more alternatives. We model the PF with a multinomial logistic regression mixture model that incorporates realistic aspects of psychophysical behavior, including lapses and multiple alternatives for the response. We propose an information-theoretic criterion for stimulus selection and develop computationally efficient methods for inference and stimulus selection based on semi-adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We apply these methods to data from macaque monkeys performing a multi-alternative motion discrimination task, and show in simulated experiments that our method can achieve a substantial speed-up over random designs. These advances will reduce the data needed to build accurate models of multi-alternative PFs and can be extended to high-dimensional PFs that would be infeasible to characterize with standard methods.",

However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fishes. Although progesterone activates ray-finned fish MRs, progesterone does not activate human, amphibian or alligator MRs, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR. Both elephant shark MR and human MR are expressed in the brain, heart, ovary, testis and other non-epithelial tissues, indicating that MR expression in diverse tissues evolved in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Our data suggest that progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in elephant shark ovary and testis.",

However, distinguishing genes related to their ecological specialism from other sources of selection and more random changes is a challenge. Here we describe the genome of Drosophila montana, the most extremely cold-adapted Drosophila species. We describe the genome, which is similar in size and gene content to most Drosophila species. We look for evidence of accelerated divergence from a previously sequenced relative, and do not find strong evidence for divergent selection on coding sequence variation. We use branch tests to identify genes showing accelerated divergence in contrasts between cold- and warm adapted species and identify about 250 genes that show differences, possibly driven by a lower synonymous substitution rate in cold-adapted species. Divergent genes are involved in a variety of functions, including cuticular and olfactory processes. We also re-sequenced three populations of D. montana representing its ecological and geographic range. Outlier loci were more likely to be found on the X chromosome and there was a greater than expected overlap between population outliers and those genes implicated in cold adaptation between Drosophila species, implying some continuity of selective process at these different evolutionary scales.",

Tactile signals relayed during physical contact between males and females before and during mating appear to be important for mate choice and reproductive isolation in some animals. However, compared to our understanding of visual, auditory, and chemical signals, we know little about the importance of tactile signals in mating decisions. Among North American damselflies in the genus Enallagma (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) species-specific tactile stimulation contributes to reproductive isolation between species and may also be important for intraspecific mate choice. We quantified several mechanosensory sensilla phenotypes on the female thorax among multiple sympatric and allopatric populations of two Enallagma species that occasionally interbreed in nature. Although each species differed in features of sensilla distribution within the thoracic plates, we found no strong evidence of reproductive character displacement among the sensilla traits we measured in regions of sympatry. However, substantial variation of sensilla traits was observed within populations of both species. Our results suggest that species-specific placement of female mechanoreceptors appears sufficient for species recognition, but mechanosensor variation among females within species may be important for mate choice.",

Here we report that reduction of the earliest born neurons of the cerebellum, excitatory cerebellar nuclei neurons (eCN), results in a subsequent reduction in growth of the cerebellar cortex due to an accompanying loss of their presynaptic target Purkinje cells. Conditional knockout of the homeobox genes En1 and En2 (En1/2) in the rhombic lip-derived eCN and granule cell precursors leads to embryonic loss of a subset of medial eCN and cell non-autonomous and location specific loss of Purkinje cells, with subsequent proportional scaling down of cortex growth. We propose that subsets of eCN dictate the survival of their specific Purkinje cell partners, and in turn sonic hedgehog secreted by Purkinje cells scales the expansion of granule cells and interneurons to produce functional local circuits and the proper folded morphology of the cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "During clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME), membrane scission is achieved by the concerted action of dynamin and its interacting partners. Essential interactions occur between the proline/arginine-rich domain of dynamin (dynPRD) and the Src-homology domain 3 (SH3) of various proteins including amphiphysins. Here we show that multiple SH3 domains must bind simultaneously to dynPRD through three adjacent motifs for dynamins efficient recruitment and function. First, we show in dynamin triple knock-out cells that mutant dynamins modified in a single motif, including the central amphiphysin SH3 (amphSH3) binding motif, are partially capable of rescuing CME. However, mutating two motifs largely prevents that ability. To support this observation, we designed divalent dynPRD-derived peptides. These ligands bind multimers of amphSH3 with >100-fold higher affinity than monovalent ones in vitro. Accordingly, dialyzing living cells with these divalent peptides through a patch-clamp pipette blocks CME 2 to 3 times more effectively than with monovalent ones. Finally, the frequency of endocytic events decreases with competing peptides or hypomorphic rescue mutants but the kinetics of dynamin recruitment is unaffected. This suggests that PRD-SH3 interactions act upstream of dynamin accumulation at the neck of nascent vesicles. We conclude from these data that dynamin drives vesicle scission via multivalent interactions in vivo.",

Analytical steps include quality control, adapter trimming, host decontamination, metagenomic classification, read assembly, and alignment to reference genomes.\n\nResultsWe present a modular and user-extensible pipeline called Sunbeam that performs these steps in a consistent and reproducible fashion. It can be installed in a single step, does not require administrative access to the host computer system, and can work with most cluster computing frameworks. We also introduce Komplexity, a software tool to eliminate potentially problematic, low-complexity nucleotide sequences from metagenomic data. Unique components of the Sunbeam pipeline include direct analysis of data from NCBI SRA and an easy-to-use extension framework that enables users to add custom processing or analysis steps directly to the workflow. The pipeline and its extension framework are well documented, in routine use, and regularly updated.\n\nConclusionsSunbeam provides a foundation to build more in-depth analyses and to enable comparisons in metagenomic sequencing experiments by removing problematic low complexity reads and standardizing post-processing and analytical steps.

Assembly is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should reflect these processes.\nC_LIO_LIThe goal of this study was to test evidence for these selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory.\nC_LIO_LITo create a null expectation, we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three data sets were used: (1) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with 2 local food-webs; (2) the 50 lakes of the Adirondacks; and (3) the arthropod community from Florida Keys classic defaunation experiment.\nC_LIO_LIContrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model. Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties, motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that -- for the commonly used metrics we considered -- local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions. Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e., spandrels), and may potentially be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Speciation genomic studies aim to interpret patterns of genome-wide variation in light of the processes that give rise to new species. However, interpreting the genomic  landscape of speciation is difficult, because many evolutionary processes can impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first chromosome-level assembly for the group, we use whole-genome sequencing and simulations to shed light on the processes that have shaped the genomic landscape during a recent radiation of monkeyflowers. After inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the nine taxa in this radiation, we show that highly similar diversity ({pi}) and differentiation (FST) landscapes have emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was strongly predicted by the local density of functional elements and the recombination rate, suggesting that the landscapes have been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the varying divergence times between pairs of taxa, we show that the correlations between FST and genome features arose almost immediately after a population split and have become stronger over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest that background selection (i.e., selection against deleterious mutations) alone is too subtle to generate the observed patterns, but scenarios that involve positive selection and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative explanations. Finally, tests for introgression among these taxa reveal widespread evidence of heterogeneous selection against gene flow during this radiation. Thus, combined with existing evidence for adaptation in this system, we conclude that the correlation in FST among these taxa informs us about the genomic basis of adaptation and speciation in this system.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhat can patterns of genome-wide variation tell us about the speciation process? The answer to this question depends upon our ability to infer the evolutionary processes underlying these patterns. This, however, is difficult, because many processes can leave similar footprints, but some have nothing to do with speciation per se. For example, many studies have found highly heterogeneous levels of genetic differentiation when comparing the genomes of emerging species. These patterns are often referred to as differentiation  landscapes because they appear as a rugged topography of  peaks and  valleys as one scans across the genome. It has often been argued that selection against deleterious mutations, a process referred to as background selection, is primarily responsible for shaping differentiation landscapes early in speciation. If this hypothesis is correct, then it is unlikely that patterns of differentiation will reveal much about the genomic basis of speciation. However, using genome sequences from nine emerging species of monkeyflower coupled with simulations of genomic divergence, we show that it is unlikely that background selection is the primary architect of these landscapes. Rather, differentiation landscapes have probably been shaped by adaptation and gene flow, which are processes that are central to our understanding of speciation. Therefore, our work has important implications for our understanding of what patterns of differentiation can tell us about the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation.",

As a result, alignment software such as the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is optimized for speed and and is often executed in parallel on the cloud. However, there are other less demanding steps that can also be optimized and significantly increase the speed especially when using many threads. We demonstrate this using a Unique-molecular-identifier (UMI) RNA sequencing pipeline consisting of 3 steps: split, align, and merge. Optimization of all three steps yields a 40% increase in speed when executed using a single thread. However, when executed using 16 threads, we observe a 4-fold improvement over the original parallel imple-mentation and more than an 8-fold improvement over the original single-threaded implementation. In contrast, optimizing only the alignment step results in just a 13% improvement over the original parallel workflow using 16 threads.",

Although K13 resembles BTB- and Kelch/propeller-containing proteins involved in ubiquitin ligase complexes, its functional sites remain uncharacterized. Using evolutionary and structural information, we searched for the most conserved K13 sites across Apicomplexa species evolution to identify sub-regions of K13 that are likely functional. An amino acid electropositive  patch in the K13 propeller domain has a dense concentration of extraordinarily conserved positions located at a shallow pocket, suggesting a role as binding surface. When applied to experimentally-characterized BTB-Kelch proteins, our strategy successfully identifies the validated substrate-binding residues within their own propeller shallow pocket. Another patch of slowly evolving sites is identified in the K13 BTB domain which partially overlaps the surface that binds to Cullin proteins in BTB-Cullin complexes. We provide candidate binding sites in K13 propeller and BTB domains for functional follow-up studies.",

We have also examined energy metabolism by measuring [ADT]/[ATP] ratio (cell energy charge), lactate production and glucose consumption. Our results demonstrate that CKI can suppress protein levels for cell cycle regulatory proteins and DNA repair while increasing the level of DSBs. We also show that energy metabolism is reduced based on reduced glucose consumption and reduced cellular energy charge. Our results validate these pathways as important targets for CKI. We also examined the effect of the major alkaloid component of CKI, oxymatrine and determined that it had no effect on DSBs, a small effect on the cell cycle and increased the cell energy charge. Our results indicate that CKI likely acts through the effect of multiple compounds on multiple targets where the observed phenotype is the integration of these effects and synergistic interactions.",

Among the various mathematical optimization methods, the gradient descent method is the most naive. Adjustment of learning rate is necessary for quick convergence, which is normally done manually with gradient descent. Many optimizers have been developed to control the learning rate and increase convergence speed. Generally, these optimizers adjust the learning rate automatically in response to learning status. These optimizers were gradually improved by incorporating the effective aspects of earlier methods. In this study, we developed a new optimizer: YamAdam. Our optimizer is based on Adam, which utilizes the first and second moments of previous gradients. In addition to the moment estimation system, we incorporated an advantageous part of AdaDelta, namely a unit correction system, into YamAdam. According to benchmark tests on some common datasets, our optimizer showed similar or faster convergent performance compared to the existing methods.

    "abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several hundred susceptibility loci for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). One critical, but unresolved, issue concerns the extent to which the mechanisms through which these diverse signals influencing T2D predisposition converge on a limited set of biological processes. However, the causal variants identified by GWAS mostly fall into non-coding sequence, complicating the task of defining the effector transcripts through which they operate. Here, we describe implementation of an analytical pipeline to address this question. First, we integrate multiple sources of genetic, genomic, and biological data to assign positional candidacy scores to the genes that map to T2D GWAS signals. Second, we introduce genes with high scores as seeds within a network optimization algorithm (the asymmetric prize-collecting Steiner Tree approach) which uses external, experimentally-confirmed protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to generate high confidence subnetworks. Third, we use GWAS data to test the T2D-association enrichment of the \\\"non-seed\\\" proteins introduced into the network, as a measure of the overall functional connectivity of the network. We find: (a) non-seed proteins in the T2D protein-interaction network so generated (comprising 705 nodes) are enriched for association to T2D (p=0.0014) but not control traits; (b) stronger T2D-enrichment for islets than other tissues when we use RNA expression data to generate tissue-specific PPI networks; and (c) enhanced enrichment (p=3.9xl0-5) when we combine analysis of the islet-specific PPI network with a focus on the subset of T2D GWAS loci which act through defective insulin secretion. These analyses reveal a pattern of non-random functional connectivity between causal candidate genes atT2D GWAS loci, and highlight the products of genes including YWHAG, SMAD4 or CDK2 as contributors to T2D-relevant islet dysfunction. The approach we describe can be applied to other complex genetic and genomic data sets, facilitating integration of diverse data types into disease-associated networks.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe were interested in the following question: as we discover more and more genetic variants associated with a complex disease, such as type 2 diabetes, will the biological pathways implicated by those variants proliferate, or will the biology converge onto a more limited set of aetiological processes? To address this, we first took the 1895 genes that map to ~100 type 2 diabetes association signals, and pruned these to a set of 451 for which combined genetic, genomic and biological evidence assigned the strongest candidacy with respect to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. We then sought to maximally connect these genes within a curated protein-protein interaction network. We found that proteins brought into the resulting diabetes interaction network were themselves enriched for diabetes association signals as compared to appropriate control proteins. Furthermore, when we used tissue-specific RNA abundance data to filter the generic protein-protein network, we found that the enrichment for type 2 diabetes association signals was enhanced within a network filtered for pancreatic islet expression, particularly when we selected the subset of diabetes association signals acting through reduced insulin secretion. Our data demonstrate convergence of the biological processes involved in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis and highlight novel contributors.",

Naive CD8+ T cells express CD62L and do not express CD44 (CD62LhiCD44lo), clones of T cells activated during the primary immune response lose CD62L and express CD44 (CD62LloCD44hi).

We proved that surface expression of CD44 in not the only condition for T lymphocyte to acquire the functional properties of memory T-cells.

    "abstract": "Considering the recognized role of thyroid hormones on the cardiovascular system during health and disease, we hypothesized that type 2 deiodinase (D2) activity, the main activation pathway of thyroxine (T4)-to-triiodothyronine (T3), could be an important site to modulate thyroid hormone status, which would then constitute a possible target for {beta}-adrenergic blocking agents in a myocardial infarction (MI) model induced by left coronary occlusion in rats. Despite a sustained and dramatic fall in serum T4 concentrations (60-70%), the serum T3 concentration fell only transiently in the first week post-infarction (53%) and returned to control levels at 8 and 12 weeks after surgery compared to Sham group (P<0.05). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) D2 activity (fmoles T4/min.mg ptn) was dramatically increased by approximately 77% in the 8th week and approximately 100% in the 12th week in the MI group compared to that of the Sham group (P<0.05). Beta-blocker treatment (propranolol given in the drinking water, 0.5 g/L) maintained a low T3 state in MI animals, dampening both BAT D2 activity (44% reduction) and serum T3 (66% reduction in serum T3) compared to that of the non-treated MI group 12 weeks after surgery (P<0.05). Propranolol improved cardiac function (assessed by echocardiogram) in MI group compared to MI-non treated one by 40 and 57 % 1 and 12 weeks after treatment respectively (P<0.05). Our data suggest that the beta-adrenergic pathway may contribute to BAT D2 hyperactivity and T3 normalization after MI in rats. Propranolol treatment maintains low T3 state and improves cardiac function additionally.",

    "abstract": "Most crop simulation models require the use of Genotype Specific Parameters (GSPs) which provide the Genotype component of GxExM interactions. Estimation of GSPs is the most difficult aspect of most modelling exercises because it requires expensive and time-consuming field experiments. GSPs could also be estimated using multi-year and multi locational data from breeder evaluation experiments. This research was set up with the following objectives: i) to determine GSPs of 10 newly released maize varieties for the Nigerian Savannas using data from both calibration experiments and by using existing data from breeder varietal evaluation trials; ii) to compare the accuracy of the GSPs generated using experimental and breeder data; and iii) to evaluate CERES-Maize model to simulate grain and tissue nitrogen contents. For experimental evaluation, 8 different experiments were conducted during the rainy and dry seasons of 2016 across the Nigerian Savanna. Breeder evaluation data was also collected for 2 years and 7 locations. The calibrated GSPs were evaluated using data from a 4 year experiment conducted under varying nitrogen rates (0, 60 and 120kg N ha-1). For the model calibration using experimental data, calculated model efficiency (EF) values ranged between 0.86-0.92 and coefficient of determination (d-index) between 0.92-0.98. Calibration of time-series data produced nRMSE below 7% while all prediction deviations were below 10% of the mean. For breeder experiments, EF (0.52-0.81) and d-index (0.46-0.83) ranges were lower. Prediction deviations were below 17% of the means for all measured variables. Model evaluation using both experimental and breeder trials resulted in good agreement (low RMSE, high EF and d-index values) between observed and simulated grain yields, and tissue and grain nitrogen contents. We conclude that higher calibration accuracy of CERES-Maize model is achieved from detailed experiments. If unavailable, data from breeder experimental trials collected from many locations and planting dates can be used with lower but acceptable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Permanent ice coverage and the low primary production in the mostly ice-covered Central Arctic ocean basins result in significantly lower biomass and density of macrobenthos in the abyssal plains compared to the continental slopes. However, little is known on bathymetric and regional effects on macrobenthos diversity. This study synthesizes new and available macrobenthos data to provide a baseline for future studies of the effects of Arctic change on macrofauna community composition in the Arctic basins. Samples taken during three expeditions (in 1993, 2012 and 2015) at 37 stations on the slope of the Barents and Laptev Seas and in the abyssal of the Nansen and Amundsen Basins in the depth range from 38 m to 4381 m were used for a quantitative analysis of species composition, abundance and biomass. Benthic communities clustered in five depth ranges across the slope and basin. A parabolic pattern of species diversity change with depth was found, with the diversity maximum for macrofauna at the shelf edge at depths of 100-300 m. This deviates from the typical species richness peak at mid-slope depths of 1500-3000 m in temperate oceans. Due to the limited availability of standardized benthos data, it remains difficult to assess the massive sea ice retreat observed in the past decade has affected benthic community composition. The polychaete Ymerana pteropoda and the bryozoan Nolella sp. were found for the first time in the deep Nansen and Amundsen Basins, as a potential first sign of increasing productivity and carbon flux with the thinning ice.",

    "abstract": "The replicability of findings drawn from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data have increasingly been called into question. Concerns have been raised that historically, sample sizes have been insufficient to produce adequate power, leading to unreliable results. Recently, Turner and colleagues demonstrated that even with large sample sizes, the replicability of fMRI can be worryingly low. However, their datasets featured low amounts of data at the individual-level. Here, I demonstrate that replicability depends critically on sufficient individual-level sampling. I show that fMRI can have strong replicability even at modest sample sizes when individuals are adequately sampled, but that inadequate individual-level sampling leads to poor replicability. These data indicate that fMRI replicability cannot be judged solely on sample size, and that adequate sampling at the individual-level is a critical design consideration.",

    "abstract": "RNA-guided engineered nucleases derived from a prokaryotic adaptive immune system known as CRISPR-Cas represent a promising platform for gene deletion and editing. As a therapeutic approach, direct delivery of Cas9 protein and guide RNA could circumvent the safety problems associated with plasmid delivery and therefore represents an attractive tool for genome engineering. Gene deletion or editing in adipose tissue to enhance its energy expenditure, fat oxidation and secretion of bioactive factors through a \\\"browning\\\" process presents a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate metabolic disease. Here, we developed novel CRISPR delivery particles, denoted CriPs, composed of nano-size complexes of Cas9 protein and single guide (sg)RNA, coated with an amphipathic peptide called Endo-Porter that mediates entry into cells. Efficient CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene deletion of ectopically expressed Green fluorescent protein (GFP) by CriPs was achieved in multiple cell types including a macrophage cell line, primary macrophages and primary pre-adipocytes. Significant GFP loss was also observed in peritoneal exudate cells with minimum systemic toxicity in GFP expressing mice following intraperitoneal injection of CriPs containing sgRNA targeting Gfp. Furthermore, the disruption of the Nrip1 gene in white adipocytes by CriPs enhanced adipocyte \\\"browning\\\" with a marked increase of UCP1 expression. Deletion of Nrip1 by CriPs did not produce detectable off-target effects. Thus CriPs represent a novel CRISPR delivery system for Cas9 and sgRNA that is effective for ablating targeted gene products in cultured cells and in vivo, and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease.",

Mycetoma is caused by bacterial infections (actinomycetoma) such as Streptomyces somaliensis and Nocardiae or true fungi (eumycetoma) such as Madurella mycetomatis. Until date, treatments fail to cure the infection and the available marketed drugs are expensive and toxic upon prolonged usage. Moreover, no vaccine was prepared yet against mycetoma.\\n\\nThe aim of this study is to predict effective epitope-based vaccine against fructose-bisphosphate aldolase enzymes of M. mycetomatis using immunoinformatics approaches.\\n\\nMethods and MaterialsFructose-bisphosphate aldolase of Madurella mycetomatis Sequence was retrieved from NCBI. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the nominees epitopes in Immune Epitope Database for B-cell, T-cell MHC class II & I.

    "abstract": "Several studies in cancer research have suggested that cognitive dysfunction following chemotherapy, referred to in lay terms as \\\"chemobrain\\\", is a serious problem. At present, the changes in integrative brain function that underlie such dysfunction remains poorly understood. Recent developments in neuroimaging suggest that patterns of functional connectivity can provide a broadly applicable neuromarker of cognitive performance and other psychometric measures. The current study used multivariate analysis methods to identify patterns of disruption in resting state functional connectivity of the brain due to chemotherapy and the degree to which the disruptions can be linked to behavioral measures of distress and cognitive performance. Sixty two women (22 healthy control, 18 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 22 treated without chemotherapy) were evaluated with neurocognitive measures followed by self-report questionnaires and open eyes resting-state fMRI scanning at three time points: diagnosis (M0, pre-adjuvant treatment), at least 1 month (M1), and 7 months (M7) after treatment. The results indicated deficits in cognitive health of breast cancer patients immediately after chemotherapy that improved over time. This psychological trajectory was paralleled by a disruption and later recovery of resting-state functional connectivity, mostly in the parietal and frontal brain regions. The functional connectivity alteration pattern seems to be a separable treatment symptom from the decreased cognitive health. More targeted support for patients should be developed to ameliorate these multi-faceted side effects of chemotherapy treatment on neural functioning and cognitive health.",

Chronic environmental stress and elevated glucocorticoids (GC), the major stress hormones, are associated with increased risk of AD, and have been shown to trigger intracellular Tau accumulation and downstream Tau-dependent neuronal dysfunction. However, the mechanisms through which stress and GC disrupt Tau clearance and degradation in neurons remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Tau undergoes degradation via endolysosomal sorting in a pathway requiring the small GTPase Rab35 and the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Furthermore, we find that GC impair Tau degradation by decreasing Rab35 levels, and that AAV-mediated expression of Rab35 in the hippocampus rescues GC-induced Tau accumulation and related neurostructural deficits. These studies indicate that the Rab35/ESCRT pathway is essential for Tau clearance and part of the mechanism through which GC precipitate brain pathology.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq datasets can contain millions of intron reads per sequenced library that are typically removed from downstream analysis. Only reads overlapping annotated exons are considered to be informative since mature mRNA is assumed to be the major component sequenced, especially when examining poly(A) RNA samples. In this paper, we demonstrate that intron reads are informative and that pre-mRNA is the major source of intron signal. Making use of pre-mRNA signal, our index method combines differential expression analyses from intron and exon counts to categorise changes observed in each count set, giving additional genes with evidence of transcriptional changes when compared to a classic approach. Considering the importance of intron retention in some biological systems, another novel method, superintronic, looks for evidence of intron retention after accounting for the presence of pre-mRNA signal. The results presented here overcomes deficiencies and biases in previous works related to intron reads by exploring multiple sources for intron reads simultaneously using a data-driven approach, and provides a broad overview into how intron reads can be utilised in relation to multiple aspects of transcriptional biology.",

    "abstract": "Gaining a better understanding on how selection and neutral processes affect genomic diversity is essential to gain better insights into the mechanisms driving adaptation and speciation. However, the evolutionary processes affecting variation at a genomic scale have not been investigated in most vertebrate lineages. Previous studies have been limited to a small number of model species, mostly mammals, and no studies have investigated genomic variation in non avian reptiles. Here we present the first population genomics survey using whole genome re sequencing in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis). This species has emerged as a model for the study of genomic evolution in squamates. We quantified how demography, recombination and selection have led to the current genetic diversity of the green anole by using whole-genome resequencing of five genetic clusters covering the entire species range. The differentiation of green anoles populations is consistent with a northward expansion from South Florida followed by genetic isolation and subsequent gene flow among adjacent genetic clusters. Dispersal out-of-Florida was accompanied by a drastic population bottleneck followed by a rapid population expansion. This event was accompanied by male-biased dispersal and/or selective sweeps on the X chromosome. We show that the combined effect of background selection and recombination rates is the main contributor to the genomic landscape of differentiation in the anole genome. We further demonstrate that recombination rates are positively correlated with GC content at third codon position (GC3) and confirm the importance of biased gene conversion in shaping genome wide patterns of diversity in reptiles.",

These local field oscillations have been shown to correlate with behavioural states but it remains unclear how these oscillations relate to spatial behaviour and the spatial firing pattern of individual neurons. To investigate this, we recorded entorhinal cortical neurons in the human brain during spatial memory tasks performed in virtual environments. We observed a spatial modulation of the phase of action potentials relative to the local field potentials. In addition, the spike phase modulation displayed correlation with the movement of the avatar, displayed discrete phase tuning at the cellular level, rotated phase between electrodes, and expressed spatially coherent phase maps that scaled with the virtual environment. Using surrogate data, we demonstrated that spike phase coherence is dependent on the spatial phase dynamics of gamma oscillations. We argue that the spatial coordination of spike generation with gamma rhythm underlies the emergence of grid cell activity in the entorhinal cortex. These results shed a new light on the intricate interlacing between the spiking activity of neurons and local field oscillations in the brain.",

    "abstract": "In order to elucidate the influence of genetic factors on phenotype variation, non-additive genetic interactions (i.e., epistasis) have to be taken into account. However, there is a lack of methods that can reliably detect such interactions, especially for quantitative traits. Random Forest was previously recognized as a powerful tool to identify the genetic variants that regulate trait variation, mainly due to its ability to take epistasis into account. However, although it can account for interactions, it does not specifically detect them. Therefore, we propose three approaches that extract interactions from a Random Forest by testing for specific signatures that arise from interactions, which we termed paired selection frequency, split asymmetry, and selection asymmetry. Since they complement each other for different epistasis types, an ensemble method that combines the three approaches was also created. We evaluated our approaches on multiple simulated scenarios and two different real datasets from different Saccharomyces cerevisiae crosses. We compared them to the commonly used exhaustive pair-wise linear model approach, as well as several two-stage approaches, where loci are pre-selected prior to interaction testing. The Random Forest-based methods presented here generally outperformed the other methods at identifying meaningful genetic interactions both in simulated and real data. Further examination of the results for the simulated and real datasets established how interactions are extracted from the Random Forest, and explained the performance differences between the methods. Thus, the approaches presented here extend the applicability of Random Forest for the genetic mapping of biological traits.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe genetic mechanisms underlying biological traits are often complex, involving the effects of multiple genetic variants. Interactions between these variants, also called epistasis, are also common. The machine learning algorithm Random Forest can be used to study genotype-phenotype relationships, by using genetic variants to predict the phenotype. One of Random Forests strengths is its ability to implicitly model interactions. However, Random Forest does not give any information about which predictors specifically interact, i.e. which variants are in epistasis.\\n\\nHere, we developed three approaches that identify interactions in a Random Forest. We demonstrated their ability to detect genetic interactions using simulations and real data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our Random Forest-based methods generally outperformed several other commonly used approaches at detecting epistasis.\\n\\nThis study contributes to the long-standing problem of extracting information about the underlying model from a Random Forest. Since Random Forest has many applications outside of genetic association, this work represents a valuable contribution to not only genotype-phenotype mapping research, but also other scientific applications where interactions between predictors in a Random Forest might be of interest.",

    "abstract": "The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cellular processes captured the attention of many researchers, since their dysregulation is shown to affect the cancer disease landscape by sustaining proliferative signaling, evading program cell death, and inhibiting growth suppressors. Thus, miRNAs have been considered important diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for several types of tumors. Machine learning algorithms have proven to be able to exploit the information contained in thousands of miRNAs to accurately predict and classify cancer types. Nevertheless, extracting the most relevant miRNA expressions is fundamental to allow human experts to validate and make sense of the results obtained by automatic algorithms. We propose a novel feature selection approach, able to identify the most important miRNAs for tumor classification, based on consensus on feature relevance from high-accuracy classifiers of different typologies. The proposed methodology is tested on a real-world dataset featuring 8,129 patients, 29 different types of tumors, and 1,046 miRNAs per patient, taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A new miRNA signature is suggested, containing the 100 most important oncogenic miRNAs identified by the presented approach. Such a signature is proved to be sufficient to identify all 29 types of cancer considered in the study, with results nearly identical to those obtained using all 1,046 features in the original dataset. Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the medical literature is performed to find references to the most important biomarkers extracted by the methodology. Besides known oncomarkers, 15 new miRNAs previously not ranked as important biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in cancer pathologies are uncovered. Such miRNAs, considered relevant by the machine learning algorithms, but still relatively unexplored by specialized literature, could provide further insights in the biology of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes the fatty acids of the host as the carbon source. While the metabolism of odd chain fatty acids produces propionyl-CoA. Methylcitrate cycle is essential for Mycobacteria to utilize the propionyl-CoA to persist and grow on these fatty acids. In M. smegmatis, methylcitrate synthase, methylcitrate dehydratase, and methylisocitrate lyase involved in methylcitrate cycle were respectively encoded by prpC, prpD, and prpB in operon prpDBC. In this study, we found that the nitrogen regulator GlnR directly binds to the promoter region of prpDBC operon and inhibits its transcription. The typical binding sequence of GlnR was identified by bioinformatics analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The GlnR-binding motif was seperated by 164 bp with the binding site of PrpR which was a pathway-specific transcriptional activator of methylcitrate cycle. Moreover, the affinity constant of GlnR was much stronger than that of PrpR to prpDBC. The deletion of glnR resulted in poor growth in propionate or cholesterol medium comparing with wild-type strain. The {Delta}glnR mutant strain also showed a higher survival in macrophages. These results illustrated that the nitrogen regulator GlnR regulated methylcitrate cycle through directly repressing the transcription of prpDBC operon. The finding reveals an unprecedented link between nitrogen metabolism and methylcitrate pathway, and provides a potential application for controlling populations of pathogenic mycobacteria.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNutrients are crucial for the survival and pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The success of this pathogen survival in macrophage due to its ability to assimilate fatty acids and cholesterol from host. The cholesterol and fatty acids are catabolized via {beta}-oxidation to generate propionyl-CoA, which is then mainly metabolized via the methylcitrate cycle. The assimilation of propionyl-CoA needs to be tightly regulated to prevent its accumulation and alleviate toxicity in cell. Here, we identified a new regulator GlnR (the nitrogen transcriptional regulator) that repressed the transcription of prp operon involved in methylcitrate cycle in M. smegmatis. In this study, we found a typical GlnR binding box in prp operon, and the affinity is much stronger than that of PrpR which is known as a pathway-specific transcriptional activator of methylcitrate cycle. In addition, deletion of glnR obviously affect the growth of mutant in propionate or cholesterol medium, and show a better viability in macrophage. The findings not only provide the insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying crosstalk of nitrogen metabolism and carbon metabolism, but also reveal a potential application for controlling populations of pathogenic mycobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. MRSA resists nearly all {beta}-lactam antibiotics that have a bactericidal activity and a signal inducer effect. However, studies have yet to clarify whether the inducer effect of empirically used {beta}-lactams stimulates MRSA pathogenicity in vivo. Here, we showed that a new cluster of tandem lipoprotein genes (tlpps) was upregulated in MRSA in response to the subinhibitory concentrations of {beta}-lactam induction. The increased Tlpps significantly altered immune responses by macrophages with high IL-6 and TNF levels. The deletion of the tlpps mutant (N315{Delta}tlpps) significantly decreased the proinflammatory cytokine levels in vitro and in vivo. The bacterial loads of N315{Delta}tlpps in the mouse kidney were also reduced compared with those of the wild type N315. The {beta}-lactam-treated MRSA exacerbated cutaneous infections with increased lesion size, extended illness, and flake-like abscess-formation compared with those of the nontreatment. The {beta}-lactam antibiotics that promoted the MRSA pathogenicity were SarA dependent, and the increasing expression of tlpps after {beta}-lactam treatment was directly controlled by the global regulator SarA. Overall, our findings suggested that {beta}-lactams should be used carefully because it might lead to a worse outcome of MRSA infection than inaction in the treatment.\\n\\nAuthor summary{beta}-lactams are widely used in practice to treat infectious diseases, however, {beta}-lactams worsening the outcome of a certain disease is poorly understood. In this study, we have identified a new cluster of tandem lipoprotein genes (tlpps) that is upregulated in the major clinically prevalent MRSA clones in response to the subinhibitory concentrations of {beta}-lactams induction. The major highlight in this work is that {beta}-lactams induce SarA expression, and then SarA directly binds to the tlpp cluster promoter region and upregulates the tlpp expression in MRSA. Moreover, the {beta}-lactam stimulated Tlpps are important virulence factors that enhance MRSA pathogenicity. The deletion of the tlpps mutant significantly decreases the proinflammatory cytokine levels in vitro and in vivo. The {beta}-lactam induced Tlpps enhance the host inflammatory responses by triggering the expression of IL-6 and TNF, thereby promoting bacterial colonization and abscess formation. These data elucidate that {beta}-lactams can worsen the outcome of MRSA infection through the induction of tlpps that are controlled by the global regulator SarA.",

    "abstract": "Zombi pea (Vigna vexillata (L.) A. Rich) is an underutilized crop belonging to the genus Vigna. Two domesticated forms of zombi pea are cultivated as crop plants; seed and tuber forms. The cultivated seed form is present in Africa, while the cultivated tuber form is present in a very limited part of Asia. Genetics of domestication have been investigated in most of cultivated Vigna crops by means of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. In this study, we investigated genetics of domestication in zombi pea by QTL analysis using an F2 population of 139 plants derived from a cross between cultivated tuber form of V. vexillata (JP235863) and wild V. vexillata (AusTRCF66514). A linkage map with 11 linkage groups was constructed from this F2 population using 145 SSR, 117 RAD-seq and 2 morphological markers. Many highly segregation distorted markers were found on LGs 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Most of the distorted markers were clustered together and all the markers on LG8 were highly distorted markers. Comparing this V. vexillata linkage map with a previous linkage map of V. vexillata and linkage maps of other four Vigna species demonstrated several macro translocations in V. vexillata. QTL analysis for 22 domestication-related traits was investigated by inclusive composite interval mapping in which 37 QTLs were identified for 18 traits; no QTL was detected for 4 traits. Number of QTLs detected in each trait ranged from 1 to 5 with an average of only 2.3. Tuber traits were controlled by five QTLs with similar effect locating on different linkage groups. Large-effect QTLs (PVE > 20%) were on LG4 (pod length), LG5 (leaf size and seed thickness), and LG7 (for seed-related traits). Comparison of domestication-related QTLs of the zombi pea with those of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), azuki bean (Vigna angularis), mungbean (Vigna radiata) and rice bean (Vigna umbellata) revealed that there was conservation of some QTLs for seed size, pod size and leaf size between zombi pea and cowpea and that QTLs associated with seed size (weight, length, width and thickness) in each species were clustered on same linkage.",

In particular, previous genetic studies of patients with nephrotic syndrome identified mutations in Nup107 that impaired the expression or the localization of its direct partner at nuclear pores, Nup133. In the present study, we characterized the zebrafish nup133 orthologous gene and its expression pattern during larval development. Morpholino-mediated gene knockdown revealed that Nup133 depletion in zebrafish larvae leads to the formation of kidney cysts, a phenotype that can be rescued by co-injection of wild type mRNA. Analysis of different markers for tubular and glomerular development shows that the overall kidney development is not affected by nup133 knockdown. On the other hand, we demonstrate that nup133 is essential for the organization and functional integrity of the pronephric glomerular filtration barrier, as its downregulation results in proteinuria and moderate foot process effacement, mimicking some of the abnormalities typically featured by patients with nephrotic syndrome. These data indicate that nup133 is a new gene required for proper glomerular structure and function in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of behavioural traits of Caenorhabditis elegans is an important method for understanding neuromuscular functions and diseases. Since C. elegans is a small and translucent animal which conducts a variety of complex movement patterns many different imaging and tracking protocols are used for different behavioural traits. Thus a unified multi-purpose imaging and tracking system for multiple behavioural assays would be favourable to improve statistical strength and comparability. Here we present a novel worm tracking toolbox based on the FIM (Frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) based Imaging Method) system incorporating a variety of different behavioural assays into a single imaging and tracking setup.\\n\\nFirst, we apply the FTIR-based imaging method to C. elegans, thus we are able to improve the overall image quality compared to state of the art recording techniques. This method is easy to use and can be utilised to image animals during crawling on agar and trashing in water. Second, we extended the existing FIMTrack software to extract skeleton-based posture and motion features of multiple worms with very high accuracy in a comparatively large field-of-view. Third, we integrated a variety of different assays into this system. We carried out chemotaxis assays both with attractant and repellent chemicals. A novel electrotaxis dome compatible with FIM allows locomotion analyses that are not corrupted by random aberrations in unrestricted movement. Additionally, the FIM based worm tracker is able to analyse thrashing behaviour of multiple worms automatically with a high accuracy. Finally we demonstrate the capacity of the FIM based worm tracker to observe GFP signals in C. elegans worms. We tested our new C. elegans tracking suite with mutant strains of the ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) cascade. We identified intermediate chemosensory phenotypes in Ufm1 cascade mutants which were previously undetected.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes mRNA genes as well as non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (sn/snoRNAs). In metazoans, RNAPII transcription of sn/snoRNAs is facilitated by a number of specialized complexes, but no such complexes have been discovered in yeast. It has thus been proposed that yeast sn/snoRNA promoters use the same complement of factors as mRNA promoters, but the extent to which key regulators of mRNA genes act at sn/snoRNA genes in yeast is unclear. Here, we investigated a potential role for the Mediator complex, essential for mRNA gene transcription, in the transcription of sn/snoRNA genes. We found that the complete Mediator complex maps to most sn/snoRNA gene regulatory regions and that loss of Mediator function results in a robust reduction in RNAPII and TFIIB occupancy at sn/snoRNA genes. Furthermore, deletion of subunits of the activator-interacting Mediator tail module does not affect Mediator recruitment to, or transcription of, sn/snoRNAs. Taken together, our analyses indicate that Mediator promotes PIC formation and transcription at sn/snoRNA genes, expanding the role of this critical regulator beyond its known functions in mRNA gene transcription and demonstrating further mechanistic similarity between the transcription of mRNA and sn/snoRNA genes.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal ECM caused serious body wide diseases and elastin is one of the important ECM components. But its systemic function still has not yet been thoroughly illustrated due to limitations related to novel research technologies. To uncover the functions of elastin, a new method for body-wide organ transcriptome profiling, combined with single-cell mass cytometry of the blood, was developed. A body-wide organ transcriptomic (BOT) map was created by performing RNA-seq of 17 organs from both Loxl1 knockout (KO) and wide type (WT) mice. The BOT results showed a systematic up-regulation of genes related to immune response and proliferation process in multiple tissues of the KO mice; histological and immune staining also confirmed the hyperplasia and infiltration of local immune cells in the vagina, small intestine, and liver tissues of KO mice. Furthermore, using 32 markers, CYTOF mass cytometry analysis of the immune cell subpopulations from the peripheral blood revealed apparent systemic immune changes in the KO mice; data showed an activated NK cells and T cells with a higher expression of CD44 and CD38, and a suppressed B cells, macrophages and neutrophils with lower expressions of CD62L, CD44 and IL6. More interestingly, these findings also correlated well with the data obtained from cancer patient databases; tumor patients had higher mutation frequency of Loxl1, and the Loxl1-mutant tumor patients had up-regulated immune process, cell proliferation and decreased survival rate. Thus, this research provided a powerful strategy to screen body-wide organ functions of a particular gene; the findings also illustrated the important biological roles of elastin on multiple organ cells and systemic immunity. These strategy and discoveries are both of important value for the understanding of ECM biology and multi-organ cancer pathology.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers in the western countries because of a lack of early diagnostic markers and efficient therapeutics. At the time of diagnosis, more than 80% of patients have metastasis or locally advanced cancer and are therefore not eligible for surgical resection. Pancreatic cancer cell also harbour a high resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine that is one of the main palliative treatment for PDAC.\\n\\nTGF-{beta} possesses both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic activities in pancreatic cancer. TGF-{beta} signalling pathway plays complex role during carcinogenesis by initially inhibiting epithelial growth and later promoting the progression of advanced tumors and thus emerged as tumor suppressor pathway. TGF-{beta} binds to its receptor TGF-{beta}RII and activates different pathways: canonical pathway involving the Smad proteins and alternative pathways such as MAPKs. Smad4 is mutated in 50-80% of PDAC. Mutations of TGF-{beta}RII also occurs (5-10%). In order to decipher the role of TGF-{beta} in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance, we decided to characterize the knocking down of TGF-{beta}RII that is the first actor of TGF-{beta} signalling. We developed pancreatic cancer cell lines stably invalidated for TGF-{beta}RII and studied the impact on biological properties of pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. We show that TGF-{beta}RII silencing alters tumor growth and migration as well as resistance to. TGF-{beta}RII silencing also leads to S727 STAT3 and S-63 c-Jun phosphorylation, decrease of MRP3 and increase of MRP4 ABC transporter expression and induction of a partial EMT phenotype.\\n\\nIn the future, the better understanding TGF-{beta} signaling pathways and underlying cellular mechanisms in chemoresistance to gemcitabine may bring new therapeutic tools to clinicians.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infects over 600 species of plant. It is present in numerous environments throughout the world and causes significant damage to many agricultural crops. Fragmentation and lack of gene flow between populations may lead to population sub-structure. Within discrete recombining populations, positive selection may lead to a  selective sweep. This is characterised by an increase in frequency of a favourable allele leading to reduction in genotypic diversity in a localised genomic region due to the phenomenon of genetic hitchhiking.\\n\\nWe aimed to assess whether isolates of S. sclerotiorum from around the world formed genotypic clusters associated with geographical origin and to determine whether signatures of population-specific positive selection could be detected. To do this, we sequenced the genomes of 25 isolates of S. sclerotiorum collected from four different continents - Australia, Africa (north and south), Europe and North America (Canada and the northen United States) and conducted SNP based analyses of population structure and selective sweeps.\\n\\nAmong the 25 isolates, there was evidence for four population clusters. One of these consisted of 11 isolates from Canada, the USA and France (population 1), another consisted of five isolates from Australia and one from Morocco (population 2). A further cluster was made up of Australian isolates, and the single South African isolate appeared to be from a separate population. We found that there was evidence of distinct selective sweeps between population 1 and population 2. Many of these sweeps overlapped genes involved in transcriptional regulation, such as transcription factors. It is possible that distinct populations of S. sclerotiorum from differing global environments have undergone selective sweeps at different genomic loci. This study lays the foundation for further work into investigation of the differing selective pressures that S. sclerotiorum populations are subjected to on a global scale.",

To our knowledge this is the first study of this scale. Clustering resulted in 707,311 clusters of which 224,442 ranged in size from 2 to 2,894 sequences. The resulting clusters allowed us to ask the question: Is a set of proteins conserved across all Proteobacteria? We chose four essential proteins, the chaperonin GroEL, DNA dependent RNA polymerase subunits beta and beta (RpoB/RpoB), and DNA polymerase I (PolA), representing fundamental cellular functions, and examined their distribution in the clusters. We found these proteins to be remarkably conserved. Although the groEL gene was universally conserved in all the organisms in the study, the protein was not represented in all the deduced proteomes. The genes for RpoB and RpoB were missing from two genomes and merged in 88 genomes, and the sequences were sufficiently divergent that they formed separate clusters for 18 RpoB proteins (seven clusters) and 14 RpoB proteins (three clusters). For PolA, 52 organisms lacked an identifiable sequence, and seven sequences were sufficiently divergent that they formed five separate clusters. Interestingly, organisms lacking an identifiable PolA and those with divergent RpoB/RpoB were almost all endosymbionts. Furthermore, we present a range of examples of annotation issues that caused the deduced proteins to be incorrectly represented in the proteome. These annotation issues represent a significant obstacle for high throughput analyses.",

Here, we develop the first genomic resources and reproducible workflows for two threatened members of the reef-building coral genus Acropora. We generated genomic sequence data from multiple samples of the Caribbean A. cervicornis (staghorn coral) and A. palmata (elkhorn coral), and predicted millions of nucleotide variants among these two species and the Pacific A. digitifera. A subset of predicted nucleotide variants were verified using restriction length polymorphism assays and proved useful in distinguishing the two Caribbean Acroporids and the hybrid they form (\\\"A. prolifera\\\"). Nucleotide variants are freely available from the Galaxy server (usegalaxy.org), and can be analyzed there with computational tools and stored workflows that require only an internet browser. We describe these data and some of the analysis tools, concentrating on fixed differences between A. cervicornis and A. palmata. In particular, we found that fixed amino acid differences between these two species were enriched in proteins associated with development, cellular stress response and the hosts interactions with associated microbes, for instance in the Wnt pathway, ABC transporters and superoxide dismutase. Identified candidate genes may underlie functional differences in the way these threatened species respond to changing environments.

    "abstract": "Due to its economic importance to in poultry industry, the biology and pathogenesis of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been investigated extensively. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in IBV entry are not well characterized. In this study, systematic approaches were used to dissect IBV entry process in various susceptible cells. First, we observed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV attachment. Second, low pH in intracyplasmic vesicles was required for virus entry. By using the specific clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor or knock down of clathrin heavy chain (CHC), we demonstrated that IBV mainly utilized the CME for its entry. Furthermore, GTPase dynamin1 was involved in virus containing vesicle scission and internalization. Surprisingly, CME adaptor Eps15 had no effect on IBV internalization. Third, the penetration of IBV into cells led to active cytoskeleton rearrangement. After internalization, virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track, as evidenced by co-localization of R18 labeled IBV with vehicle markers Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1 along with the infection time course. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. VCP, a protein helps early endosome maturation, was involved virus trafficking. Finally, by using the dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion with late endosome/lysosome membranes was induced between 2-3 h.p.i.. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that IBV virions attach to lipid rafts and are internalized into cells via CME, move along with early/late endosomes-lysosomes, finally fuse with late endosome-lysosome membranes, release virus genome into cytoplasm. This study provides comprehensive images of IBV attachment-internalization-trafficking-fusion steps.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEIBV, the avian coronavirus isolated in 1937, infects chicken and causes economic loss in poultry industry. It has been reported that the entry of IBV requires low pH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IBV internalization and trafficking remain to be clarified. Therefore, we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to dissect the entry mechanisms of IBV in susceptible cells. Our results showed IBV entry was significantly inhibited when clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) was blocked by chemical inhibitor or depletion of clathrin protein. Moreover, by using R18-labeled IBV, we found that IBV particles attached to lipid rafts, led to actin rearrangement, and moved along with the entire endosomal system. R18/DiOC labeling method showed that IBV fused with late endosomes or lysosomes. This is the first report to describe the entire entry process of IBV, allowing for a better understanding of the infection process of group III avian coronavirus.",

    "abstract": "Individuals constantly encounter feedback from others and process this feedback in various ways to maintain positive situational state self-esteem (SSE) in relation to semantic-based or trait self-esteem (TSE). Individuals may utilize a data-driven, or episodic-based process that encodes positive, but not negative, self-relevant information automatically, or employ a semantic-driven process that manipulates encoded negative feedback post-hoc. Its unclear, however, how these processes work either alone or in concert while individuals receive positive and negative feedback to modulate feedback encoding and subsequent SSE. Utilizing neural regions associated with semantic self-oriented and basic encoding processes (mPFC and PCC respectively), and time-frequency and Granger causality analyses to assess mPFC and PCC interactions, this study examined how encoding of positive and negative self-relevant feedback modulated individuals post-task SSE in relation to their TSE while continuous EEG was recorded. Among those with higher levels of TSE, the encoding of positive or negative feedback was not associated with SSE. Rather, higher SSE was associated with mPFC activity to all feedback and higher TSE. The relationship between TSE and SSE was moderated by mPFC-PCC communication such that increases in mPFC-PCC communication led to SSE levels that were consistent with TSE levels. Furthermore, Granger causality analyses indicated that individuals exhibited higher SSE to the extent mPFC influenced PCC in response to positive and negative feedback. Findings highlight the dynamic interplay between semantic self-oriented and basic encoding processes that modulate SSE in relation to TSE, to maintain more positive global selfperceptions in the moment and over time.",

    "abstract": "Corals access inorganic seawater nutrients through their autotrophic endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, but also capture planktonic prey through heterotrophic feeding. Correlating NanoSIMS and TEM imaging, we visualize and quantify the subcellular fate of autotrophic and heterotrophic C and N in the coral Stylophora pistillata using stable isotopes. Six scenarios were compared after 6h: autotrophic pulse (13C-bicarbonate, 15N-nitrate) in either unfed or regularly fed corals, and heterotrophic pulse (13C-, 15N-labelled brine shrimps) in regularly fed corals; each at ambient and elevated temperature. Host assimilation of photosynthates was similar under fed and unfed conditions, but symbionts assimilated 10% more C in fed corals. Photoautotrophic C was primarily channelled into host lipid bodies, whereas heterotrophic C and N were generally co-allocated to the tissue. Food-derived label was detected in some subcellular structures associated with the remobilisation of host lipid stores. While heterotrophic input generally exceeded autotrophic input, it was more negatively affected by elevated temperature. The reduced input from both feeding modes at elevated temperature was accompanied by a shift in the partitioning of C and N, benefiting epidermis and symbiont. This study provides a unique view on the nutrient partitioning in corals and highlights the tight connection of nutrient fluxes in symbiotic partners.",

For the first time we present a statistical model showing that a simple diversity-disturbance relationship can be used to explain dynamic changes in high diversity biofilm communities. This simple model reveals that succession in these systems is guided towards either a low diversity, generalist-dominated biofilm or a high diversity, cooperative-specialist biofilm, depending on the level of endogenous disturbance measured within the community.

    "abstract": "The specificity of the antibody response against Zika virus (ZIKV) is not well-characterized. This is due, in part, to the antigenic similarity between ZIKV and closely related dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. Since these and other similar viruses co-circulate, are spread by the same mosquito species, and can cause similar acute clinical syndromes, it is difficult to disentangle ZIKV-specific antibody responses from responses to closely-related arboviruses in humans. Here we use high-density peptide microarrays to profile anti-ZIKV antibody reactivity in pregnant and non-pregnant macaque monkeys with known exposure histories and compare these results to reactivity following DENV infection. We also compare cross-reactive binding of ZIKV-immune sera to the full proteomes of 28 arboviruses. We independently confirm a purported ZIKV-specific IgG antibody response targeting ZIKV nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B) that was recently reported in ZIKV-infected people and we show that antibody reactivity in pregnant animals can be detected as late as 127 days post-infection (dpi). However, we also show that these responses wane over time, sometimes rapidly, and in one case the response was elicited following DENV infection in a previously ZIKV-exposed animal. These results suggest epidemiologic studies assessing seroprevalence of ZIKV immunity using linear epitope-based strategies will remain challenging to interpret due to susceptibility to false positive results. However, the method used here demonstrates the potential for rapid profiling of proteome-wide antibody responses to a myriad of neglected diseases simultaneously and may be especially useful for distinguishing antibody reactivity among closely related pathogens.\\n\\nAuthor summaryZIKV has emerged as a vector-borne pathogen capable of causing serious illness in infected adults and congenital birth defects. The vulnerability of communities to future ZIKV outbreaks will depend, in part, on the prevalence and longevity of protective immunity, thought to be mediated principally by antibodies. We currently lack diagnostic assays able to differentiate ZIKV-specific antibodies from antibodies produced following infection with closely related DENV, and we do not know how long anti-ZIKV responses are detectable. Here we profile antibodies recognizing linear epitopes throughout the entire ZIKV polyprotein, and we profile cross-reactivity with the proteomes of other co-endemic arboviruses. We show that while ZIKV-specific antibody binding can be detected, these responses are generally weak and ephemeral, and false positives may arise through DENV infection. This may complicate efforts to discern ZIKV infection and to determine ZIKV seroprevalence using linear epitope-based assays. The method used in this study, however, has promise as a tool for profiling antibody responses for a broad array of neglected tropical diseases and other pathogens and in distinguishing serology of closely-related viruses.",

    "abstract": "Many previous studies on visual search have reported inter-trial effects, that is, observers respond faster when some target property, such as a defining feature or dimension, or the response associated with the target repeats versus changes across consecutive trial episodes. However, what processes drive these inter-trial effects is still controversial. Here, we investigated this question using a combination of Bayesian modeling of belief updating and evidence accumulation modeling in perceptual decision-making. In three visual singleton ( pop-out) search experiments, we explored how the probability of the response-critical states of the search display (e.g., target presence/absence) and the repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension (color/ orientation) affect reaction time distributions. The results replicated the mean reaction time (RT) inter-trial and dimension repetition/switch effects that have been reported in previous studies. Going beyond this, to uncover the underlying mechanisms, we used the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) and the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate (LATER) model to explain the RT distributions in terms of decision bias (starting point) and information processing speed (evidence accumulation rate). We further investigated how these different aspects of the decision-making process are affected by different properties of stimulus history, giving rise to dissociable inter-trial effects. We approached this question by (i) combining each perceptual decision making model (DDM or LATER) with different updating models, each specifying a plausible rule for updating of either the starting point or the rate, based on stimulus history, and (ii) comparing every possible combination of trial-wise updating mechanism and perceptual decision model in a factorial model comparison. Consistently across experiments, we found that the (recent) history of the response-critical property influences the initial decision bias, while repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension affects the accumulation rate, likely reflecting an implicit  top-down modulation process. This provides strong evidence of a disassociation between response- and dimension-based inter-trial effects.",

However, a logical design method of the dietary ingestion pattern controlling the postprandial blood glucose 2 level has not yet been established. We constructed a mathematical model of blood glucose control by oral glucose ingestion in 3 healthy human subjects, used the model to predict an optimal glucose ingestion pattern, and showed that the optimal ingestion pattern minimized the peak value of blood glucose level. Subjects orally ingested 3 doses of glucose by bolus or over 2 hours, and blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide and incretins were measured for 4 hours. We constructed an ordinary differential equation model that reproduced the time course data of the blood glucose and blood hormone levels. Using the model, we predicted that intermittent ingestion 30 minutes apart was the optimal glucose ingestion patterns that minimized the peak value of blood glucose level. We confirmed with subjects that this intermittent pattern decreased the peak value of blood glucose level. This approach could be applied to design optimal dietary ingestion patterns.\\n\\nIn BriefAs a forward problem, we measured blood glucose and hormones in three human subjects after oral glucose ingestion and constructed a mathematical model of blood glucose control.

To address this challenge in mice and embryonic stem (ES) cells, we targeted the lineage-specific otic gene Fbxo2 with a multicistronic reporter cassette (Venus/Hygro/CreER = VHC). In otic organoids derived from ES cells, Fbxo2VHC specifically delineates otic progenitors and inner ear sensory epithelia. In mice, Venus expression and CreER activity reveal a cochlear developmental gradient, label the prosensory lineage, show enrichment in a subset of type I vestibular hair cells, and expose strong expression in adult cerebellar granule cells. We provide a toolbox of multiple spectrally distinct reporter combinations to the community for studies that require use of fluorescent reporters, hygromycin selection, and conditional Cre-mediated recombination.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTA multifunctional Fbxo2-targeted reporter in mice and stem cells was developed and characterized as a resource for inner ear studies, along with a toolbox of plasmids to facilitate the use of this technique for other users.",

Here we show transcriptional and anatomical contributions of compartmentalized epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) in tactile sensory unit formation in the hair follicle (HF). EpSCs in the follicle upper-bulge, where mechanosensory lanceolate complexes (LCs) innervate, express a unique set of extracellular matrix (ECM) and neurogenesis-related genes. These EpSCs deposit an ECM protein EGFL6 into the collar matrix, a novel ECM that tightly ensheathes LCs. EGFL6 is required for the proper patterning, touch responses, and v integrin-enrichment of LCs. By maintaining a quiescent original EpSC niche, the old bulge, EpSCs provide anatomically stable HF-LC interfaces, irrespective of the stage of follicle regeneration cycle. Thus, compartmentalized EpSCs provide a niche linking the HF and the nervous system throughout the hair cycle.",

We confirm that the T. solium genome in the cysticercus stage is epigenetically modified by DNA methylation in a pattern similar to that of other invertebrate genomes, i.e., sparsely or moderately methylated. We also observed an enrichment of non-CpG methylation in defined genetic elements of the T. solium genome. Furthermore, an integrative analysis of both the transcriptome and the DNA methylome indicated a strong correlation between these two datasets, suggesting that gene expression might be tightly regulated by DNA methylation. Importantly, our data suggested that DNA methylation might play an important role in repressing key parasitism-related genes, including genes encoding excretion-secretion proteins, thereby raising the possibility of targeting DNA methylation processes as a useful strategy in therapeutics of cysticercosis.\\n\\nConclusionOur study will provide a foundation for future studies to explore this key epigenetic modification in development of Cysticercus cellulosae and in human cysticercus disease.",

Many smoking-associated signals have been detected in the blood methylome, but the extent to which these changes are widespread to metabolically relevant tissues, and impact gene expression or cardio-metabolic health, remains unclear.\\n\\nWe investigated smoking-associated DNA methylation and gene expression variation in adipose tissue from 542 healthy female twins with available well-characterized cardio-metabolic phenotype profiles. We identified 42 smoking-methylation and 42 smoking-expression signals, where five genes (AHRR, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYTL1, F2RL3) were both hypo-methylated and up-regulated in smokers. We replicated and validated a proportion of the signals in blood, adipose, skin, and lung tissue datasets, identifying tissue-shared effects. Smoking leaves systemic imprints on DNA methylation after smoking cessation, with stronger but shorter-lived effects on gene expression. We tested for associations between the observed smoking signals and several adiposity phenotypes that constitute cardio-metabolic disease risk. Visceral fat and android/gynoid ratio were associated with methylation at smoking-markers with functional impacts on expression, such as CYP1A1, and in signals shared across tissues, such as NOTCH1. At smoking-signals BHLHE40 and AHRR DNA methylation and gene expression levels in current smokers were predictive of future gain in visceral fat upon smoking cessation.\\n\\nOur results provide the first comprehensive characterization of coordinated DNA methylation and gene expression markers of smoking in adipose tissue, a subset of which link to human cardio-metabolic health and may give insights into the wide ranging risk effects of smoking across the body.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTobacco smoking is the strongest environmental risk factor for human disease. Here, we investigate how smoking systemically changes methylome and transcriptome signatures in multiple tissues in the human body. We observe strong and coordinated epigenetic and gene expression changes in adipose tissue, some of which are mirrored in blood, skin, and lung tissue. Smoking leaves a strong short-lived impact on gene expression levels, while methylation changes are long-lasting after smoking cessation. We investigated if these changes observed in a metabolically-relevant (adipose) tissue had impacts on human disease, and observed strong associations with cardio-metabolic disease traits. Some of the smoking signals could predict future gain in obesity and cardio-metabolic disease risk in current smokers who subsequently go on to quit smoking.
