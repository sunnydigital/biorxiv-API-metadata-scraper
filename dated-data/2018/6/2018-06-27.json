    "abstract": "Dmc1 catalyzes homology search and strand exchange during meiotic recombination in budding yeast and many other organisms including humans. Here we reconstitute Dmc1 recombination in vitro using six purified proteins including Dmc1 and its accessory proteins RPA, Rad51, Rdh54/Tid1, Mei5-Sae3, and Hop2-Mnd1 to promote D-loop formation between ssDNA and dsDNA substrates. Each accessory protein contributed to Dmc1s activity, with the combination of all six proteins yielding optimal activity. The ssDNA binding protein RPA plays multiple roles in stimulating Dmc1s activity including by overcoming inhibitory effects of ssDNA secondary structure on D-loop reactions, and by stabilizing and elongating D-loops. In addition, we demonstrate that RPA limits inhibitory interactions of Hop2-Mnd1 and Rdh54/Tid1 that otherwise occur during assembly of Dmc1-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments. Finally, we report interactions between the proteins employed in the biochemical reconstitution including a direct interaction between Rad51 and Dmc1 that is enhanced by Mei5-Sae3.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHuman immunodeficiency virus and protein energy malnutrition are still prevalent in Nigeria and the occurrence of the two conditions together confers a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the current categories of malnutrition amongst under 5 children in Lagos, document their HIV status and determine any peculiarities in the clinical features, haematological and some biochemical profile in these children.\\n\\nMethodsThe study was a prospective crossectional study conducted at the Paediatric department of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and the Massey Street Childrens Hospital over a 6 month period. All the subjects had anthropometry, HIV testing, full blood count and serum proteins done. The factors associated with HIV status were determined with the logistic regression analysis.\\n\\nResultsTwo hundred and fourteen (214) malnourished children [&le;]5 years were recruited into the study and 25(11.7%) were HIV positive. One hundred and five (49.1%) of the participants had moderate malnutrition while 25.2% had severe forms of malnutrition. Fever, cough and diarrhea were the commonest symptoms. Severe wasting, oral thrush, dermatoses and splenomegaly were seen more commonly in the HIV positive subjects. The haematological indices were comparable in the two groups, however, the total protein was significantly higher in the HIV positive subjects compared to the negative group (p=0.042). Multivariate analysis showed that the total protein (p=0.001) and platelet count (p=0.016) could significantly predict the occurrence of HIV in the malnourished children\\n\\nConclusionThe presence of severe wasting, oral thrush, diarrhea, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and high total proteins in malnourished children should heighten the suspicion of possible underlying associated HIV infection. This study reinforces the recommendation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that all malnourished children should have mandatory HIV screening.",

    "abstract": "The significanceF of the relationship between the nervous and immune systems with respect to disease course is increasingly apparent. Immune cells in the liver and spleen are responsible for the development of acute liver injury, yet the regulatory mechanisms of the interactions remain elusive. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is released from the sensory nervous system, regulates innate immune activation via receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), a subunit of the CGRP receptor. Here, we show that RAMP1 in Kupffer cells (KCs) plays a critical role in the etiology of immune-mediated hepatitis. RAMP1-deficient mice with concanavalin A (ConA)-mediated hepatitis, characterized by severe liver injury accompanied by infiltration of immune cells and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by KCs and splenic T cells, showed poor survival. Removing KCs ameliorated liver damage, while depleting T cells or splenectomy led to partial amelioration. Adoptive transfer of splenic T cells from RAMP1-deficient mice led to a modest increase in liver injury. Co-culture of KCs with splenic T cells led to increased cytokine expression by both cells in a RAMP1-dependent manner. Thus, immune-mediated hepatitis develops via crosstalk between immune cells. RAMP1 in KCs is a key regulator of immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Teredinidae is a family of highly adapted wood-feeding and wood-boring bivalves, commonly known as shipworms, whose evolution is linked to the acquisition of cellulolytic gammaproteobacterial symbionts harbored in bacteriocytes within the gills. In the present work we applied metagenomics to characterize microbiomes of the gills and digestive tract of Neoteredo reynei, a mangrove-adapted shipworm species found over a large range of the Brazilian coast. Comparative metagenomics grouped the symbiotic gammaproteobacterial community of gills of different N. reynei specimens, indicating closely related bacterial types are shared, while intestine and digestive glands presented related, and more diverse microbiomes that did not overlap with gills. Annotation of assembled metagenomic contigs revealed that the symbiotic community of N. reynei gills was a hotspot of woody-polysaccharides degrading hydrolase genes, and Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs), while in contrast, the digestive tract microbiomes seems to play little role in wood digestion and secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Metagenome binning recovered the nearly complete genome sequences of two symbiotic Teredinibacter strains from the gills, a representative of Teredinibacter turnerae \\\"clade I\\\" strain, and a yet to be cultivated Teredinibacter sp. type. These Teredinibacter genomes, as well as unbinned gill-derived gammaproteobacteria contigs, code for novelty including an endo-{beta}-1,4-xylanase/acetylxylan esterase multi-catalytic carbohydrate-active enzyme, and a trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase (trans-AT PKS) gene cluster with the gene cassette for generating {beta}-branching on complex polyketides. Multivariate analyzes have shown that the secondary metabolome encoded on the genomes of Teredinibacter representatives, including the genomes binned from N. reynei gills metagenomes, stand out within the Cellvibrionaceae family by size, and enrichments for polyketide, nonribosomal peptide and hybrid BGCs. Results grouped here add to the growing characterization of shipworm symbiotic microbiomes and indicate that the N. reynei gill gammaproteobacterial community is a prolific source of biotechnologically relevant enzymes for wood-digestion and bioactive compounds production.",

    "abstract": "Histological brain slices are widely used in neuroscience to study anatomical organization of neural circuits. Since data from many brains are collected, mapping the slices to a reference atlas is often the first step in interpreting results. Most existing methods rely on an initial reconstruction of the volume before registering it to a reference atlas. Because these slices are prone to distortion during sectioning process and often sectioned with nonstandard angles, reconstruction is challenging and often inaccurate. We propose a framework that maps each slice to its corresponding plane in the atlas to build a plane-wise mapping and then perform 2D nonrigid registration to build pixel-wise mapping. We use the L2 norm of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) of two patches as the similarity metric for both steps, and a Markov Random Field formulation that incorporates tissue coherency to compute the nonrigid registration. To fix significantly distorted regions that are misshaped or much smaller than the control grids, we trained a context-aggregation network to segment and warp them to their corresponding regions with thin plate spline. We have shown that our method generates results comparable to an expert neuroscientist and is significantly better than reconstruction-first approaches.",

However, raw gene expression values have to be normalized for nuisance biological variation and technical covariates, and different normalization strategies can lead to dramatically different results in the downstream study.\n\nResultsWe describe a generalization of SVD-based reconstruction for which the common techniques of whitening, rank-k approximation, and removing the top k principle components are special cases. Our simple three-parameter transformation, DataRemix, can be tuned to reweight the contribution of hidden factors and reveal otherwise hidden biological signals. In particular, we demonstrate that the method can effectively prioritize biological signals over noise without leveraging external dataset-specific knowledge, and can outperform normalization methods that make explicit use of known technical factors. We also show that DataRemix can be efficiently optimized via Thompson Sampling approach, which makes it feasible for computationally expensive objectives such as eQTL analysis. Finally we reanalyze the Depression Gene Networks (DGN) dataset, and we highlight new trans-eQTL networks which were not reported in the initial study.\n\nAvailabilityDataRemix is an R package which is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/wgmao/DataRemix).\n\nContactmchikina@pitt.edu",

Furthermore, the isolation and representation of the softest, slowest deformation coordinates provide opportunities for the development of mechanical models of enzyme function. The eigenvector decomposition, therefore, must be accurate, reliable as well as rapid to be generally reported upon. We obtain the eigenmodes of a 1.2[A] 34kDa PDB entry using either exclusively heavy atoms or partly or fully reduced atomic sets; Cartesian or internal coordinates; interatomic force fields derived either from a full Cartesian potential, a reduced atomic potential or a Gaussian distance-dependent potential; and independently developed software. These varied technologies are similar in that each maintains proper stereochemistry either by use of dihedral degrees of freedom which freezes bond lengths and bond angles, or by use of a full atomic potential that includes realistic bond length and angle restraints. We find that the shapes of the slowest eigenvectors are nearly identical, not merely similar.",

    "abstract": "To model the diffusion MRI signal in brain white matter, general assumptions have been made about the microstructural properties of axonal fiber bundles, such as the axonal shape and the fiber orientation dispersion. In particular, axons are modeled by perfectly circular cylinders with no diameter variation within each axon, and their directions obey a specific orientation distribution. However, these assumptions have not been validated by histology in 3-dimensional high-resolution neural tissue. Here, we reconstructed sequential scanning electron microscopy images in mouse brain corpus callosum, and introduced a semi-automatic random-walker (RaW) based algorithm to rapidly segment individual intra-axonal spaces and myelin sheaths of myelinated axons. Confirmed with a conventional machine-learning-based interactive segmentation method, our semi-automatic algorithm is reliable and less time-consuming. Based on the segmentation, we calculated histological estimates of size-related (e.g., inner axonal diameter, g-ratio) and orientation-related (e.g., Fiber orientation distribution and its rotational invariants, dispersion angle) quantities, and simulated how these quantities would be observed in actual diffusion MRI experiments by considering diffusion time-dependence. The reported dispersion angle is consistent with previous 2-dimensional histology studies and diffusion MRI measurements, though the reported diameter is larger than those in other mouse brain studies. Our results show that the orientation-related metrics have negligible diffusion time-dependence; however, inner axonal diameters demonstrate a non-trivial time-dependence at diffusion times typical for clinical and preclinical use. In other words, the fiber dispersion estimated by diffusion MRI modeling is relatively independent, while the \\\"apparent\\\" axonal size estimated by axonal diameter mapping potentially depends on experimental MRI settings.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is the hallmark of glaucoma. Axonal injury is thought to precede RGC loss in glaucoma, and thus studies using an optic nerve (ON) crush model have been widely used to investigate mechanisms of cell death that are common to both conditions. Prior work has focused on the involvement of caspases in RGC death, but little is known about the contribution of other forms of cell death such as necrosis. In this study we show that receptor interacting protein (RIP) kinase-mediated necrosis normally plays a role in RGC death and acts in concert with caspase-dependent apoptosis. The expression of RIP3, a key activator of RIP1 kinase, as well as caspase activity, increased following ON injury. Caspase inhibition alone failed to provide substantial protection to injured RGCs and unexpectedly exacerbated necrosis. In contrast, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of RIP kinases in combination with caspase blockade delayed both apoptotic and necrotic RGC death, although RGCs still continued to die. Furthermore, inhibition of RIP1 kinase promoted a moderate level of axon regeneration that was only minimal affected by caspase inhibition. In conclusion, multiple approaches are required for effective RGC death prevention and axonal regeneration. Further studies are needed to elucidate more effective long term strategies that can lead to sustained neuroprotection and regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Informational masking (IM) can greatly reduce speech intelligibility, but the neural mechanisms underlying IM are not understood. Binaural differences between target and masker can improve speech perception. In general, improvement in masked speech intelligibility due to provision of spatial cues is called spatial release from masking. Here, we focused on an aspect of spatial release from masking, specifically, the role of spatial attention. We hypothesized that in a situation with IM background sound 1) attention to speech recruits lateral frontal cortex (LFCx), and 2) LFCx activity varies with direction of spatial attention. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we assessed LFCx activity bilaterally in normal-hearing listeners. In experiment 1, two talkers were simultaneously presented. Listeners either attended to the target talker (speech task) or they listened passively to an unintelligible, scrambled version of the acoustic mixture (control task). Target and masker differed in pitch and interaural time difference (ITD). Relative to the passive control, LFCx activity increased during attentive listening. Experiment 2 measured how LFCx activity varied with ITD, by testing listeners on the speech task in experiment 1, except that talkers either were spatially separated by ITD or co-located. Results show that directing of auditory attention activates LFCx bilaterally. Moreover, right LFCx is recruited more strongly in the spatially separated as compared with co-located configurations. Findings hint that LFCx function contributes to spatial release from masking in situations with IM.",

The eye lens changes shape in order to fine focus light to transmit a clear image, and thus lens organ function is tied to its biomechanical properties, presenting an opportunity to study Tpm functions in tissue mechanics. The major mouse lens Tpm is Tpm3.5 (TM5NM5), a previously unstudied isoform. Decreased levels of Tpm3.5 lead to softer and less mechanically resilient lenses that are unable to resume their original shape after compression. While cell organization and morphology appear unaffected, Tmod1 dissociates from the membrane in Tpm3.5-deficient lens fiber cells resulting in reorganization of the spectrin-F-actin and -actinin-F-actin networks at the membrane. These rearranged F-actin networks appear to be less able to support mechanical load and resilience leading to an overall change in tissue mechanical properties. This is the first in vivo evidence that Tpm is essential for cell biomechanical stability in a load-bearing non-muscle tissue and indicates that Tpm3.5 protects mechanically stable, load-bearing F-actin in vivo.\\n\\nSummaryTropomyosin 3.5 stabilizes F-actin in eye lens fiber cells and promotes normal tissue biomechanical properties.

Sampling where the organism is absent consumes resources, and offers relatively low-quality information which are often difficult to model using standard statistical methods. In adaptive sampling, a probabilistic sampling method is employed first, and additional effort is allocated in the vicinity of sites where some measured index variable - assumed to be proportional to local population size - exceeds an a priori threshold. We applied this principle to the spatial capture-recapture (SCR) analytical framework in a Bayesian hierarchical model incorporating capture-recapture (CR) and index information from unsampled sites to estimate density. We assessed the adaptively sampled SCR model (AS-SCR) by simulating CR data and compared performance with a standard SCR baseline (F-SCR), adaptive SCR discarding index information (AS-SCR-), and standard SCR applied at a simple random sample of sites. Under AS-SCR, we observed minimal bias and comparable variance with respect to parameter estimates provided by the standard F-SCR model and sampling implementation, but with substantially reduced effort and significant cost saving potential. This represents the first application of adaptive sampling to SCR.",

    "abstract": "Plant-derived lignans, consumed daily by most individuals, are inversely associated with breast cancer; however, their bioactivity is only exerted following gut bacterial conversion to enterolignans. Here, we dissect a four-species bacterial consortium sufficient for all four chemical reactions in this pathway. Comparative genomics and heterologous expression experiments identified the first enzyme in the pathway. Transcriptional profiling (RNAseq) independently identified the same gene and linked a single genomic locus to each of the remaining biotransformations. Remarkably, we detected the complete bacterial lignan metabolism pathway in the majority of human gut microbiomes. Together, these results are an important step towards a molecular genetic understanding of the gut bacterial bioactivation of lignans and other plant secondary metabolites to downstream metabolites relevant to human disease.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryBess et al. provide a first step towards elucidating the molecular genetic basis for the cooperative gut bacterial bioactivation of plant lignans, consumed daily by most individuals, to phytoestrogenic enterolignans.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies demonstrate that Astrotactin (ASTN1) provides a neuronal receptor for glial-guided CNS migration. Here we report that ASTN1 binds N-cadherin (CDH2) and that the ASTN1:CDH2 interaction supports cell-cell adhesion. To test the function of ASTN1:CDH2 binding in glial-guided neuronal migration, we generated a conditional loss of Cdh2 in cerebellar granule cells and in glia. Granule cell migration was slowed in cerebellar slice cultures after a conditional loss of neuronal Cdh2, and more severe migration defects occurred after a conditional loss of glial Cdh2. Expression of a mutant form of ASTN1 that does not bind CDH2, in granule cells, also slowed migration. Moreover, in vitro chimeras of granule cells and glia showed impaired neuron-glia attachment in the absence of glial, but not neuronal, Cdh2. Thus, cis and trans bindings of ASTN1 to neuronal and glial CDH2 form an asymmetric neuron-glial bridge complex that promotes glial-guided neuronal migration.",

    "abstract": "The genetic architecture of most human complex traits is highly polygenic, motivating efforts to detect polygenic selection involving a large number of loci. In contrast to previous work relying on top GWAS loci, we developed a method that uses genome-wide association statistics and linkage disequilibrium patterns to estimate the genome-wide genetic component of population differentiation of a complex trait along a continuous gradient, enabling powerful inference of polygenic selection. We analyzed 43 UK Biobank traits and focused on PC1 and North-South and East-West birth coordinates across 337K unrelated British-ancestry samples, for which our method produced close to unbiased estimates of genetic components of population differentiation and high power to detect polygenic selection in simulations across different trait architectures. For PC1, we identified signals of polygenic selection for height (74.5{+/-}16.7% of 9.3% total correlation with PC1 attributable to genome-wide genetic effects; P = 8.4x10-6) and red hair pigmentation (95.9{+/-}24.7% of total correlation with PC1 attributable to genome-wide genetic effects; P = 1.1x10-4); the bulk of the signal remained when removing genome-wide significant loci, even though red hair pigmentation includes loci of large effect. We also detected polygenic selection for height, systolic blood pressure, BMI and basal metabolic rate along North-South birth coordinate, and height and systolic blood pressure along East-West birth coordinate. Our method detects polygenic selection in modern human populations with very subtle population structure and elucidates the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic components of trait population differences.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a major staple food cereal for millions of people worldwide. The sorghum genome, like other species, accumulates deleterious mutations, likely impacting its fitness. Though selection keeps deleterious mutations rare, their complete removal from the genome is impeded due to lack of recombination, drift, and their coupling with favorable loci. To study how deleterious mutations impact agronomic phenotypes, we identified putative deleterious mutations among ~5.5M segregating variants of 229 diverse sorghum lines. We provide the whole-genome estimate of the deleterious burden in sorghum, showing that about 33% of nonsynonymous substitutions are putatively deleterious. The pattern of mutation burden varies appreciably among racial groups; the caudatum shows higher mutation burden while the guinea has lower burden. Across racial groups, the mutation burden correlated negatively with biomass, plant height, Specific Leaf Area (SLA), and tissue starch content, suggesting deleterious burden decreases trait fitness. Putatively deleterious variants explain roughly half of the genetic variance. However, there is only moderate improvement in total heritable variance explained for biomass (7.6%) and plant height (5.2%). There is no advantage in total heritable variance for SLA and starch. The contribution of putatively deleterious variants to phenotypic diversity therefore appears to be dependent on the genetic architecture of traits. Overall, our results suggest that including putatively deleterious variants in models do not significantly improve breeding accuracy because of extensive linkage. However, knowledge of deleterious variants could be leveraged for sorghum breeding through genome editing.",

    "abstract": "In prokaryotic genomes, the number of genes that belong to distinct functional classes shows apparent universal scaling with the total number of genes [1-5] (Fig. 1). This scaling can be approximated with a power law, where the scaling power can be sublinear, near-linear or super-linear. Scaling laws are robust under various statistical tests [4], across different databases and for different gene classifications [1-5]. Several models aimed at explaining the observed scaling laws have been proposed, primarily, based on the specifics of the respective biological functions [1, 5-8]. However, a coherent theory to explain the emergence of scaling within the framework of population genetics is lacking. We employ a simple mathematical model for prokaryotic genome evolution [9] which, together with the analysis of 34 clusters of closely related microbial genomes [10], allows us to identify the underlying forces that dictate genome content evolution. In addition to the scaling of the number of genes in different functional classes, we explore gene contents divergence to characterize the evolutionary processes acting upon genomes [11]. We find that evolution of the gene content is dominated by two factors that are specific to a functional class, namely, selection landscape and genome plasticity. Selection landscape quantifies the fitness cost that is associated with deletion of a gene in a given functional class or the advantage of successful incorporation of an additional gene. Genome plasticity, that can be considered a measure of evolvability, reflects both the availability of the genes of a given functional class in the external gene pool that is accessible to the evolving microbial population, and the ability of microbial genomes to accommodate these genes. The selection landscape determines the gene loss rate, and genome plasticity is the principal determinant of the gene gain rate.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/357400_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (39K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6df3e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a69e8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f36a80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d519c9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Scaling laws for all functional classes of the COGs.

    "abstract": "Protein Zero (P0) is the major structural protein in peripheral myelin and mutations in the Myelin Protein Zero (Mpz) gene produce wide ranging hereditary neuropathy phenotypes. To gain insight in the mechanisms underlying a particularly severe form, congenital hypomyelination (CH), we targeted mouse Mpz to encode P0Q215X, a nonsense mutation associated with the disease, that we show escapes nonsense mediated decay and is expressed in CH patient nerves. The knock-in mice express low levels of the resulting truncated protein, producing a milder phenotype when compared to patients, allowing to dissect the subtle pathogenic mechanisms occurring in otherwise very compromised peripheral myelin. We find that P0Q215X does not elicit an unfolded protein response, which is a key mechanism for other pathogenic MPZ mutations, but is instead aberrantly trafficked to non-myelin plasma membranes and induces defects in radial sorting of axons by Schwann cells (SC). We show that the loss of the C-terminal YAML motif is responsible for P0 mislocalisation, as its addition is able to restore correct P0Q215X trafficking in vitro. Lastly, we show that P0Q215X acts through dose-dependent gain of abnormal function, as wildtype P0 is unable to rescue the hypomyelination phenotype. Collectively, these data indicate that alterations at the premyelinating stage, linked to altered targeting of P0, may be responsible for CH, and that different types of gain of abnormal function produce the diverse neuropathy phenotypes associated with MPZ, supporting future allele-specific therapeutic silencing strategies.",

    "abstract": "Forward genetics remains a powerful method for revealing the genes underpinning organismal form and function, and for revealing how these genes are tied together in gene networks. In maize, forward genetics has been tremendously successful, but the size and complexity of the maize genome made identifying mutant genes an often arduous process with traditional methods. The next generation sequencing revolution has allowed for the gene cloning process to be significantly accelerated in many organisms, even when genomes are large and complex. Here, we describe a bulked-segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-Seq) protocol for cloning mutant genes in maize. Our simple strategy can be used to quickly identify a mapping interval and candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole genome sequencing of pooled F2 individuals. We employed this strategy to identify narrow odd dwarf as an enhancer of teosinte branched1, and to identify a new allele of defective kernel1. Our method provides a quick, simple way to clone genes in maize.\\n\\nReferences numbers for supporting data:figshare and NCBI SRA links to follow",

    "abstract": "Identifying rare coding variants associated with albuminuria may open new avenues for preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease which are highly prevalent in patients with diabetes. Efforts to identify genetic susceptibility variants for albuminuria have so far been limited with the majority of studies focusing on common variants.\\n\\nWe performed an exome-wide association study to identify coding variants in a two phase (discovery and replication) approach, totaling to 33,985 individuals of European ancestry (15,872 with and 18,113 without diabetes) and further testing in Greenlanders (n = 2,605). We identify a rare (MAF: 0.8%) missense (A1690V) variant in CUBN (rs141640975, {beta}=0.27, p=1.3 x 10-11) associated with albuminuria as a continuous measure in the combined European meta-analyses. Presence of each rare allele of the variant was associated with a 6.4% increase in albuminuria. The rare CUBN variant had 3 times stronger effect in individuals with diabetes compared to those without (pinteraction: 5.4 x 10-4, {beta}DM: 0.69, {beta}nonDM: 0.20) in the discovery meta-analyses. Geneaggregate tests based on rare and common variants identify three additional genes associated with albuminuria (HES1, CDC73, and GRM5) after multiple testing correction (P_bonferroni<2.7 x 10-6).\\n\\nThe current study identifies a rare coding variant in the CUBN locus and other potential genes associated with albuminuria in individuals with and without diabetes. These genes have been implicated in renal and cardiovascular dysfunction. These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of albuminuria and highlight novel target genes and pathways for prevention of diabetes-related kidney disease.\\n\\nSignificance statementIncreased albuminuria is a key manifestation of major health burdens, including chronic kidney disease and/or cardiovascular disease. Although being partially heritable, there is a lack of knowledge on rare genetic variants that contribute to albuminuria. The current study describes the discovery and validation, of a new rare gene mutation (~1%) in the CUBN gene which associates with increased albuminuria. Its effect multiplies 3 folds among diabetes cases compared to non diabetic individuals. The study further uncovers 3 additional genes modulating albuminuria levels in humans. Thus the current study findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of albuminuria and highlight novel genes/pathways for prevention of diabetes related kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of apoptosis is a tightly-coordinated process and caspases are its chief regulators. Of special importance are the executioner caspases, caspase-3/7, the activation of which irreversibly sets the cell on the path of death. Dysregulation of apoptosis, particularly an increased rate of cell death lies at the root of numerous human diseases. Although several peptide-based inhibitors targeting the homologous active site region of caspases have been developed, owing to their non-specific activity and poor pharmacological properties their use has largely been restricted. Thus, we sought to identify FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed as novel allosteric inhibitors of caspase-3/7. In this study, we virtually screened a catalog of FDA-approved drugs targeting an allosteric pocket located at the dimerization interface of caspase-3/7. From among the top-scoring hits we short-listed five compounds for experimental validation. Our enzymatic assays using recombinant caspase-3 suggested that four out of the five drugs effectively inhibited caspase-3 enzymatic activity in vitro with IC50 values ranging ~10-55 M. Structural analysis of the docking poses show the four compounds forming specific non-covalent interactions at the allosteric pocket suggesting that these molecules could disrupt the adjacently-located active site. In summary, we report the identification of four novel non-peptide allosteric inhibitors of caspase-3/7 from among FDA-approved drugs.",
