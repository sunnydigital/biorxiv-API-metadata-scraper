    "abstract": "In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, synthesis of isoprenoids from glycolytic intermediates is essential for survival. The antimalarial fosmidomycin (FSM) inhibits isoprenoid synthesis. In P. falciparum, we identify a loss-of-function mutation in HAD2 (PF3D7_1226300) as necessary for FSM resistance. Enzymatic characterization reveals that HAD2, a member of the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (HAD) superfamily, is a phosphatase. Harnessing a growth defect in resistant parasites, we select for suppression of HAD2-mediated FSM resistance and uncover hypomorphic suppressor mutations in the locus encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK9). Metabolic profiling demonstrates that FSM resistance is achieved via increased steady-state levels of MEP pathway and glycolytic intermediates and confirms reduced PFK9 function in the suppressed strains. We identify HAD2 as a novel regulator of malaria parasite metabolism and drug sensitivity and uncover PFK9 as a novel site of genetic metabolic plasticity in the parasite. Our study informs the biological functions of an evolutionarily conserved family of metabolic regulators and reveals a previously undescribed strategy by which malaria parasites adapt to cellular metabolic dysregulation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEUnique and essential aspects of parasite metabolism are excellent targets for development of new antimalarials. An improved understanding of parasite metabolism and drug resistance mechanisms are urgently needed. The antibiotic fosmidomycin targets the synthesis of essential isoprenoid compounds from glucose and is a candidate for antimalarial development. Our study identifies a novel mechanism of drug resistance and further describes a family of metabolic regulators in the parasite. Using a novel forward genetic approach, we also uncover mutations that suppress drug resistance in the glycolytic enzyme PFK9. Thus, we identify an unexpected genetic mechanism of adaptation to metabolic insult that influences parasite fitness and tolerance to antimalarials.",

    "abstract": "Experiments show that evolutionary fitness landscapes can have a rich combinatorial structure due to epistasis. For some landscapes, this structure can produce a computational constraint that prevents evolution from finding local fitness optima - thus overturning the traditional assumption that local fitness peaks can always be reached quickly if no other evolutionary forces challenge natural selection. Here, I introduce a distinction between easy landscapes of traditional theory where local fitness peaks can be found in a moderate number of steps and hard landscapes where finding local optima requires an infeasible amount of time. Hard examples exist even among landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis; on these semi-smooth fitness landscapes, strong selection weak mutation dynamics cannot find the unique peak in polynomial time. More generally, on hard rugged fitness landscapes that include reciprocal sign epistasis, no evolutionary dynamics - even ones that do not follow adaptive paths - can find a local fitness optimum quickly. Moreover, on hard landscapes, the fitness advantage of nearby mutants cannot drop off exponentially fast but has to follow a power-law that long term evolution experiments have associated with unbounded growth in fitness. Thus, the constraint of computational complexity enables open-ended evolution on finite landscapes. Knowing this constraint allows us to use the tools of theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization to characterize the fitness landscapes that we expect to see in nature. I present candidates for hard landscapes at scales from single genes, to microbes, to complex organisms with costly learning (Baldwin effect) or maintained cooperation (Hankshaw effect). Just how ubiquitous hard landscapes (and the corresponding ultimate constraint on evolution) are in nature becomes an open empirical question.",

    "abstract": "It is often unavoidable to combine data from different sequencing centers or sequencing platforms when compiling datasets with a large number of individuals. However, the different data are likely to contain specific systematic errors that will appear as SNPs. Here, we devise a method to detect systematic errors in combined datasets. To measure quality differences between individual genomes, we study pairs of variants that reside on different chromosomes and co-occur in individuals. The abundance of these pairs of variants in different genomes is then used to detect systematic errors due to batch effects. Applying our method to the 1000 Genomes dataset, we find that coding regions are enriched for errors, where about 1% of the higher-frequency variants are predicted to be erroneous, whereas errors outside of coding regions are much rarer (<0.001%). As expected, predicted errors are less often found than other variants in a dataset that was generated with a different sequencing technology, indicating that many of the candidates are indeed errors. However, predicted 1000 Genomes errors are also found in other large datasets; our observation is thus not specific to the 1000 Genomes dataset. Our results show that batch effects can be turned into a virtue by using the resulting variation in large scale datasets to detect systematic errors.",

CODEX iteratively visualizes antibody binding events using DNA barcodes, fluorescent dNTP analogs, and an insitu polymerization-based indexing procedure. An algorithmic pipeline for single-cell antigen quantification in tightly packed tissues was developed and used to overlay well-known morphological features with de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue architecture at a single-cell and cellular neighborhood levels. We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals with systemic autoimmune disease (MRL/lpr), extensive and previously uncharacterized splenic cell interaction dynamics in the healthy versus diseased state was observed. The fidelity of multiplexed spatial cytometry demonstrated here allows for quantitative systemic characterization of tissue architecture in normal and clinically aberrant samples.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial opportunistic pathogens are feared for their difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections and for causing morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Here, we study how such a versatile opportunist, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, adapts to conditions inside and outside its model host Caenorhabditis elegans, and use phenotypic and genotypic screens to identify the mechanistic basis of virulence evolution. We found that virulence significantly dropped in unstructured environments both in the presence and absence of the host, but remained unchanged in spatially structured environments. Reduction of virulence was either driven by a substantial decline in the production of siderophores (in treatments without hosts) or toxins and proteases (in treatments with hosts). Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones revealed positive selection and parallel evolution across replicates, and showed an accumulation of mutations in regulator genes controlling virulence factor expression. Our study identifies the spatial structure of the non-host environment as a key driver of virulence evolution in an opportunistic pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Proteins that fold cotranslationally may do so in a restricted configurational space, due to the volume occupied by the ribosome. How does this environment, coupled with the close proximity of the ribosome, affect the folding pathway of a protein? Previous studies have shown that the cotranslational folding process for many proteins, including small, single domains, is directly affected by the ribosome. Here, we investigate the cotranslational folding of an all-b immunoglobulin domain, titin I27. Using an arrest peptide-based assay and structural studies by cryo-EM, we show that I27 folds in the mouth of the ribosome exit tunnel. Simulations that use a kinetic model for the force-dependence of escape from arrest, accurately predict the fraction of folded protein as a function of length. We used these simulations to probe the folding pathway on and off the ribosome. Our simulations - which also reproduce experiments on mutant forms of I27 - show that I27 folds, while still sequestered in the mouth of the ribosome exit tunnel, by essentially the same pathway as free I27, with only subtle shifts of critical contacts from the C to the N terminus.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMost proteins need to fold into a specific three-dimensional structure in order to function. The mechanism by which isolated proteins fold has been thoroughly studied by experiment and theory. However, in the cell proteins do not fold in isolation, but are synthesized as linear chains by the ribosome during translation. It is therefore natural to ask at which point during synthesis proteins fold, and whether this differs from the folding of isolated protein molecules. By studying folding of a well characterized protein domain, titin I27, stalled at different points during translation, we show that it already folds in the mouth of the ribosome exit tunnel, and that the mechanism is almost identical to that of the isolated protein.",

    "abstract": "Crohns disease (CD) is highly heterogeneous, due in large part to variability in cellular processes that underlie the natural history of CD, thereby confounding effective therapy. There is a critical need to advance understanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive CD heterogeneity. In this study, small RNA-sequencing and microRNA profiling in the colon revealed two distinct molecular subtypes, each with different clinical associations, in both adult and treatment-naive pediatric CD patients. Notably, we found that microRNA-31 (miR-31) expression by itself can stratify patients into these two subtypes. Through detailed analysis of several colonic mucosa cell types from adult patients, we found that differential levels of miR-31 are particularly pronounced in epithelial cells. We generated patient crypt-derived epithelial colonoids and showed that miR-31 expression differences preserved in this ex-vivo system. In adult patients, low colonic miR-31 expression levels at the time of surgery are associated with post-operative recurrence of ileal disease. In pediatric patients, lower miR-31 expression at the time of diagnosis is associated with the future development of fibrostenotic ileal CD requiring surgery. These findings represent an important step forward in designing more effective clinical trials and developing personalized therapies for CD.",

We recently showed that the activity of PSM3, the most toxic member, stems from the formation of cross- fibrils, which are at variance with the cross-{beta} fibrils linked with eukaryotic amyloid pathologies. Here, we show that PSM1 and PSM4, involved in biofilm structuring, form canonical cross-{beta} amyloid fibrils wherein {beta}-sheets tightly mate through steric zipper interfaces, conferring high stability. Contrastingly, a truncated PSM3 has antibacterial activity, forms reversible fibrils, and reveals two polymorphic and atypical {beta}-rich fibril architectures. These architectures are radically different from both the cross- fibrils formed by full-length PSM3, and from the canonical cross-{beta} fibrils. Our results point to structural plasticity being at the basis of the functional diversity exhibited by S. aureus PSMs.",

    "abstract": "--The coalescent process describes how changes in the size of a population influence the genealogical patterns of sequences sampled from that population. The estimation of population size changes from genealogies that are reconstructed from these sequence samples, is an important problem in many biological fields. Often, population size is characterised by a piecewise-constant function, with each piece serving as a population size parameter to be estimated. Estimation quality depends on both the statistical coalescent inference method employed, and on the experimental protocol, which controls variables such as the sampling of sequences through time and space, or the transformation of model parameters. While there is an extensive literature devoted to coalescent inference methodology, there is surprisingly little work on experimental design. The research that does exist is largely simulation based, precluding the development of provable or general design theorems. We examine three key design problems: temporal sampling of sequences under the skyline demographic coalescent model, spatio-temporal sampling for the structured coalescent model, and time discretisation for sequentially Markovian coalescent models. In all cases we prove that (i) working in the logarithm of the parameters to be inferred (e.g. population size), and (ii) distributing informative coalescent events uniformly among these log-parameters, is uniquely robust.  Robust means that the total and maximum uncertainty of our estimates are minimised, and are also insensitive to their unknown (true) parameter values. Given its persistence among models, this formally derived two-point theorem may form the basis of an experimental design paradigm for coalescent inference.",

    "abstract": "Faces play important roles in the social lives of humans. In addition to real faces, people also encounter numerous cartoon faces in daily life. These cartoon faces convey basic emotional states through facial expressions. Using a behavioral research methodology and event-related potentials (ERPs), we conducted a facial expression recognition experiment with 17 university students to compare the processing of cartoon faces with that of real faces. This study used face type (real vs. cartoon) and participant gender (male vs. female) as independent variables. Reaction time, recognition accuracy, and the amplitudes and latencies of emotion processing-related ERP components such as N170, vertex positive potential (VPP), and late positive potential (LPP) were used as dependent variables. The ERP results revealed that cartoon faces caused larger N170 and VPP amplitudes as well as a briefer N170 latency than did real faces; that real faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did cartoon faces; and that angry faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did happy faces. In addition, the results showed a significant difference in the brain regions associated with face processing as reflected in a right hemispheric advantage. The behavioral results showed that the reaction times for happy faces were shorter than those for angry faces; that females showed a higher facial expression recognition accuracy than did males; and that males showed a higher recognition accuracy for angry faces than happy faces. These results demonstrate differences in facial expression recognition and neurological processing between cartoon faces and real faces among adults. Cartoon faces showed a higher processing intensity and speed than real faces during the early processing stage. However, more attentional resources were allocated for real faces during the late processing stage.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e. TF regulon) is becoming a widely-used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and datasets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are: (i) manually curated repositories, (ii) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (iii) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (iv) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression datasets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations, and thereby downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark datasets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions among 1,541 TFs, and evaluated how the different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity changes. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies with a confidence score, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.",

The 2009 pandemic was caused by a reassortment of the human-avian-swine virus with eight RNA segments responsible for all virus proteins. Segment 7 codifies for matrix proteins M1 and M2. These proteins exhibited low mutation rate because the matrix is fundamental for virion encapsidation and ion channel formation. However, hemagglutinin (HA) segment 4 is one of the most important segments for virulence and hence, is more studied. Brazil had many influenza virus infection cases just before 2009 and from 2011 to 2015, particularly in the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State. Two hundred samples obtained during the pandemic were used for amplification and sequencing of the viral genome; a total of 19 M and 17 HA amplified segments were sequenced. Sequencing of the M fragment showed that RS has a virus origin different from that in Eastern Asia, Western Europe, USA, and Central America (Mexico and Nicaragua). All the sequences showed amantadine resistance (S31N) and one was out of the phylogenetic tree (Brazil/RS-3335/2009) due to high mutation rate. RS-3335 was the only sample obtained from a patient who died. Many migratory birds that flock to RS are from Europe, Asia, and USA, which could explain this rate of mutation. Insertions and deletions were found in the M1 protein in these samples. The HA sequences showed worldwide spread and less diversity than the M sequences in this study. The most divergent sample was Brazil/RS-3093/2009 that showed mutations in the sialic acid ligation site.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules are non-membranous assemblies of mRNA and protein that form in response to a variety of stressors. Genetic, pathologic, biophysical and cell biological studies have implicated disturbances in the dynamics of membrane-less organelles, such as stress granules, as a pathobiological component of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)1-12. This confluence of evidence has inspired the hypothesis that these diseases reflect an underlying disturbance in the dynamics and material properties of stress granules; however, this concept has remained largely untestable in available models of stress granule assembly, which require the confounding variable of exogenous stressors. Here we demonstrate the development and use of a light-inducible stress granule system, termed OptoGranules, which permits discrete, experimental control of the dynamics and material properties of stress granules in living cells in the absence of exogenous stressors. The nucleator in this system is Opto-G3BP1, a light-sensitive chimeric protein assembled from the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and RNA-binding domain of G3BP1 combined with the light-sensitive oligomerization domain of Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) photolyase homology region (PHR). Upon stimulation with blue light, Opto-G3BP1 initiates the rapid assembly of dynamic, cytoplasmic, liquid granules that are composed of canonical stress granule components, including G3BP1, PABP, TIA1, TIAR, eIF4G, eIF3{eta}, ataxin 2, GLE1, TDP-43 and polyadenylated RNA. With this system, we demonstrate that persistent or repetitive assembly of stress granules is cytotoxic and is accompanied by the evolution of stress granules to neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions that recapitulate the pathology of ALS-FTD.",

    "abstract": "Extrasynaptic actions of glutamate are limited by high-affinity transporters on perisynaptic astroglial processes (PAPs), which helps to maintain point-to-point transmission in excitatory circuits. Memory formation in the brain is associated with synaptic remodelling, but how this remodelling affects PAPs and therefore extrasynaptic glutamate actions is poorly understood. Here we used advanced imaging methods, in situ and in vivo, to find that a classical synaptic memory mechanism, long-term potentiation (LTP), triggers withdrawal of PAPs from potentiated synapses. Optical glutamate sensors combined with patch-clamp and 3D molecular localisation reveal that LTP induction thus prompts a spatial retreat of glial glutamate transporters, boosting glutamate spillover and NMDA receptor-mediated inter-synaptic cross-talk. The LTP-triggered PAP withdrawal involves NKCC1 transporters and the actin-controlling protein cofilin but does not depend on major Ca2+-dependent cascades in astrocytes. We have therefore uncovered a mechanism by which synaptic potentiation could alter signal handling by multiple nearby connections.",

    "abstract": "Environmental and socioeconomic risk factors associated with West Nile Virus cases were investigated in the Northern San Joaquin Valley region of California, a largely rural area. The study included human West Nile Virus (WNV) cases from the years 2011-2015 in the three county area of San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Merced Counties, and examined whether factors were associated with WNV using census tracts as the unit of analysis. Environmental factors included temperature, precipitation, mosquitoes positive for WNV, and habitat. Socioeconomic variables included age, education, housing age, home vacancies, median income, population density, ethnicity, and language spoken. Chi-squared independence tests were used to examine whether each variable was associated with WNV in each county, and then also used for the three counties combined. Logistic regression was used for a three-county combined analysis, to examine which environmental and socioeconomic variables were most likely associated with WNV cases. The chi-squared tests found that the variables associated with WNV varied in each of the three counties. The chi-squared tests for data combined from the three counties found that WNV cases were significantly associated with mosquitoes positive for WNV, urban habitat, higher home vacancies, higher population density, higher education, and ethnicity. Logistic regression analysis revealed that overall, the environmental factors precipitation, mean temperature, and WNV positive mosquitoes were the strongest predictors of WNV cases. Results support efforts of mosquito control districts, which aim for source reduction of mosquito breeding sites. In addition, findings suggest that residents with higher income and education may be more aware of WNV and its symptoms, and more likely to request testing from physicians. Lower income and education residents may not be aware of WNV. Public health education might increase its prevention messages about vector-borne disease in the various languages of the region, which would contribute overall to public health in the region.",

    "abstract": "While reward associative learning has been studied extensively across different species, punishment avoidance learning has received far less attention. Of particular interest is how the two types of learning change perceptual processing of the learned stimuli. We designed a task that required participants to learn the association of emotionally neutral images with reward, punishment, and no incentive value outcomes through trial-and-error. During learning, participants received monetary reward, neutral outcomes or avoided punishment by correctly identifying corresponding images. Results showed an early bias in favor of learning reward associations, in the form of higher accuracy and fewer trials needed to reach learning criterion. We subsequently assessed electrophysiological learning effects with a task in which participants viewed the stimuli with no feedback or reinforcement. Critically, we found modulation of two early event-related potential components for reward images: the frontocentral P2 (170 - 230 ms) and the anterior N2/Early Anterior Positivity (N2/EAP; 210 - 310 ms). We suggest that reward associations may change stimuli detection and incentive salience as indexed by P2 and N2/EAP. We also reported, on an exploratory basis, a late negativity with frontopolar distribution enhanced by punishment images.",

    "abstract": "The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a major threat to amphibian populations. Here we asked if the prevalence of Bd differs between amphibian species and whether it is related to local environmental factors in breeding habitats as well as landscape variables measured at three scales (500, 2000 and 5000 m radius) in southernmost Sweden. We sampled 947 anurans from six species in 31 ponds. Canopy cover, pond perimeter, pH and temperature were treated as local scale pond characteristics. Number of surrounding ponds, area of arable land, area of mature forest and number of resident people were treated as landscape variables. Bufo bufo and Rana temporaria had a prevalence of 0.5-1.0% which differed strongly from the other four species (Bombina bombina, Bufotes variabilis, Epidalea calamita, Rana arvalis) showing 13-64% prevalence. Bd prevalence in these four species was higher in ponds with higher pH, surrounded by a landscape with less mature forest and few wetlands. Our results show that the infection dynamics of Bd are complex and depend on local pond characteristics, host community composition and the spatial scale under investigation. Information on environmental factors associated with Bd and species differences in susceptibility may mitigate further spread of the disease through public information and guide conservational action plans, especially for the most threatened species.",

    "abstract": "Calcium (Ca) absorption from the intestinal tract is promoted by active vitamin D (1,25D3). Vitamin D not only promotes Ca homeostasis, but it also inhibits bone resorption and promotes osteogenesis, thus playing a role in the maintenance of normal bone metabolism. Because 1,25D3 plays an important role in osteogenesis, vitamin D formulations, such as alfacalcidol (ALF) and eldecalcitol (ELD), are used for treating osteoporosis. While it is known that, in contrast to ALF, ELD is an active ligand that directly acts on bone, the reason for its superior osteogenesis effects is unknown. Cyp27b1-knockout mice (Cyp27b1-/- mice) are congenitally deficient in 1,25D3 and exhibit marked hypocalcemia and high parathyroid hormone levels, resulting in osteodystrophy involving bone hypocalcification and growth plate cartilage hypertrophy. However, because the vitamin D receptor is expressed normally in Cyp27b1-/- mice, they respond normally to 1,25D3. Accordingly, in Cyp27b1-/- mice, the pharmacological effects of exogenously administered active vitamin D derivatives can be analyzed without being affected by 1,25D3. We used Cyp27b1-/- mice to characterize and clarify the superior osteogenic effects of ELD on the bone in comparison with ALF. The results indicated that compared to ALF, ELD strongly induces ECaC2, calbindin-D9k, and CYP24A1 in the duodenum, promoting Ca absorption and decreasing the plasma concentration of 1,25D3, resulting in improved osteogenesis. Because bone morphological measurements demonstrated that ELD has stronger effects on bone calcification, trabecular formation, and cancellous bone density than ALF, ELD appears to be a more effective therapeutic agent for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, in which cancellous bone density decreases markedly. By using Cyp27b1-/- mice, this study was the first to succeed in clarifying the osteogenic effect of ELD without any influence of endogenous 1,25D3. Furthermore, ELD more strongly enhanced bone mineralization, trabecular proliferation, and cancellous bone density than did ALF. Thus, ELD is expected to show an effect on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in which cancellous bone mineral density decreases markedly.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions can generate major ecological disturbances, such as changes in species diversity and structure of communities. It is believed that the multicolored Asian ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Col, Coccinellidae), recognized as one of the most invasive insects in the world, has reduced native coccinellids populations in several areas and is considered as a threat for biodiversity at large. A significant trait, favoring its invasiveness and its dominance over indigenous ladybeetles, is intraguild predation (IGP). IGP has advantageous adaptive value for individuals, removing competitors, potential predators and providing an alternative nutritive resource, when main resources are scarce. Previous research demonstrated that this invasive ladybeetle is highly susceptible to the reduced-risk insecticide novaluron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor, whereas the North American indigenous competitor, Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer (Col, Coccinellidae), is not. Our study explores the adaptive value of IGP for each of the two coccinellids after preying on each others larvae, previously treated with insecticide. Our first hypothesis is that the invasive ladybeetle, susceptible to the insecticide, should lose the adaptive value of IGP, while the native predator not. Our second hypothesis is that the adaptive value of IGP for the invasive predator will be recovered over time, as a result of neutralisation of the insecticide by the intraguild prey (native species). The results support both hypotheses, and show that an insecticide can completely remove the adaptive value of IGP for the invader, while it does not change for the indigenous ladybeetle. Moreover, the study demonstrates that if the intraguild prey (non-susceptible to the insecticide) undergoes molt after being exposed to the insecticide, the adaptive value for the intraguild predator is restored.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common chronic conditions of childhood. Like many common chronic human illnesses, JIA likely involves complex interactions between genes and the environment, mediated by the epigenome. Such interactions are best understood through multi-dimensional genomic maps that identify critical genetic and epigenetic components of the disease. However, constructing such maps in a cost-effective way is challenging, and this challenge is further complicated by the challenge of obtaining biospecimens from pediatric patients at time of disease diagnosis, prior to therapy, as well as the limited quantity of biospecimen that can be obtained from children,particularly those who are unwell. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of creating multi-dimensional genomic maps for JIA from limited sample numbers.\\n\\nMethodsTo accomplish our aims, we used an approach similar to that used in the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, which used only 2 replicates for each component of the genomic maps. We used genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing, whole genome sequencing on the Illumina 10x platform, RNA sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing for informative histone marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) to construct a multi-dimensional map of JIA neutrophils, a cell we have shown to be important in the pathobiology of JIA.\\n\\nResultsThe epigenomes of JIA neutrophils display numerous differences from those from healthy children. DNA methylation changes, however, had only a weak effect on differential gene expression. In contrast, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, commonly associated with enhancer functions, strongly correlated with gene expression. Furthermore, although unique/novel enhancer marks were associated with insertion-deletion events (indels) identified on whole genome sequencing, we saw no strong association between epigenetic changes and underlying genetic variation. The initiation of treatment in JIA is associated with a re-ordering of both DNA methylation and histone modifications, demonstrating the plasticity of the epigenome in this setting.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings, generated from a small number of patient samples, demonstrate how multidimensional genomic studies may yield new understandings of biology of JIA and provide insight into how therapy alters gene expression patterns.",

To reveal the effects of plant density on the performance of invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides under different nutrient conditions, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in which A. philoxeroides was planted at three densities (low, medium and high) under three nutrient levels (low, medium and high). The results showed that both planting density and nutrient levels had significant effects on the growth of the plant. The biomass of individual plant and all plants in one pot under medium nutrient level were the highest while the photosynthetic rate and total chlorophyll content were the highest at the high nutrient level. Under different nutrient levels, the photosynthetic rate was the highest at medium planting density. The biomass of single plant decreased with the increase of population density, while the total biomass in the whole pot increased with the increase of density.

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly and envelopment are coordinated by a complex protein interaction network that includes most of the viral structural and nonstructural proteins. While the nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) is known to be important for viral particle production, the specific function of NS4A in this process is not well understood. We performed mutagenesis of the C-terminal acidic domain of NS4A and found that mutation of several of these amino acids prevented the formation of the viral envelope, and therefore the production of infectious virions, without affecting viral RNA replication. In an overexpression system, we found that NS4A interacted with several viral proteins known to coordinate envelopment, including the viral E1 glycoprotein. One of the NS4A C-terminal mutations, Y45F, disrupted the interaction of NS4A with E1. Specifically, NS4A interacted with the first hydrophobic region of E1, a region previously described as regulating viral particle production. Supernatants from HCV NS4A Y45F transfected cells had significantly reduced levels of HCV RNA, however they contained equivalent levels of Core protein. Interestingly, the Core protein secreted from these cells formed high order oligomers with a density matching the infectious virus secreted from WT cells. These results suggest that this Y45F mutation in NS4A causes secretion of low density Core particles devoid of genomic HCV RNA. These results corroborate previous findings showing that mutation of the first hydrophobic region of E1 also causes secretion of Core complexes lacking RNA, and therefore suggest that the interaction between NS4A and E1 is involved in the incorporation of viral RNA into infectious HCV particles. Our findings define a new role for NS4A in the HCV lifecycle and help elucidate the protein interactions necessary for production of infectious virus.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRNA viruses, which encompass both established and emerging pathogens, pose significant public health challenges. Viruses in the family Flavivirdae, including Dengue virus, Zika virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV), continue to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. One HCV protein, NS4A, has known functions in several steps of the viral lifecycle, however, how it contributes to viral particle production is not understood. Here, we investigated the role of one region of NS4A, the C-terminal acidic domain, in regulating the viral lifecycle. We found that some of the amino acids within this domain are important for viral envelopment to make infectious particles, specifically through interaction with the E1 glycoprotein. NS4A interacts with the first hydrophobic domain of E1. Disruption of this interaction prevents the production of infectious virus particles and instead results in release of low density Core protein complexes that lack HCV RNA into the cellular supernatant. Overall, our results reveal that NS4A is important for late stages of the HCV lifecycle and suggest that the interaction between NS4A and E1 may regulate the incorporation of viral RNA into the virion for the formation of infectious HCV particles.",

    "abstract": "With relatively few known specific transcription factors to control the abundance of specific mRNAs, Plasmodium parasites also regulate the stability and turnover of transcripts to provide more comprehensive gene regulation. Plasmodium transmission stages impose translational repression on specific transcripts in part to accomplish this. However, few proteins are known to participate in this process, and those that are characterized primarily affect female gametocytes. We have identified and characterized PyCCR4-1, a putative deadenylase, which plays a role in the development and activation of male gametocytes, regulates the abundance of specific mRNAs in gametocytes, and ultimately increases the efficiency of host-to-vector transmission. We find that when pyccr4-1 is deleted or its protein made catalytically inactive, there is a loss in the initial coordination of male gametocyte maturation and a reduction of parasite infectivity of the mosquito. Expression of only the N-terminal CAF1 domain of the essential CAF1 deadenylase, which prevents PyCCR4-1 association with the complex, leads to a similar phenotype. Comparative RNA-seq revealed that PyCCR4-1 affects transcripts important for transmission-related functions that are associated with male or female gametocytes, some of which directly associate with the immunoprecipitated complex. Finally, circular RT-PCR of one of the bound, dysregulated transcripts showed that PyCCR4-1 does not have gross changes in UTR or poly(A) tail length. We conclude that general and transmission-specialized members of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex play critical and intertwined roles in gametocyte maturation and transmission.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMalaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted during an infectious blood meal by anopheline mosquitoes. Transmission of the sexual stages of the parasite to mosquitoes requires the proper regulation of specific mRNAs. While much work has been done to characterize regulation of mRNAs in female gametocytes, little has been done to assess this regulation in male gametocytes. Here, we demonstrate that PyCCR4-1, a member of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT RNA metabolic complex, acts upon transcripts both directly and indirectly in both male and female parasites, and results in a reduction of male gametocytemia. In gametocytes lacking PyCCR4-1, as well as those expressing a catalytically dead variant, the initial coordinated wave of male gametocyte activation is lost, and these parasites are less able to productively infect mosquitoes. We find that PyCCR4-1 requires its association with PyCAF1 and by proxy, the rest of the complex, in order to perform its functions based upon experiments in both Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium falciparum. We also find that the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex is directly binding some of these transcripts and is likely acting both directly and indirectly to modulate transcript abundance. These findings demonstrate that the combined effects of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex upon specific mRNAs are important for both male and female gametocytes, and that this regulation is required for efficient transmission to the mosquito vector.",

    "abstract": "Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis world-wide, yet host factors that restrict NoV replication are not well understood. Here, we use a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) genome-wide screening to identify host genes that can inhibit murine norovirus (MNoV) replication in either mouse or human cells. Our screens identified with high confidence 57 genes that can inhibit MNoV infection when overexpressed. A significant number of these genes are in interferon and immune regulation signaling networks, but surprising, the majority of the genes identified are not associated with innate or adaptive immunity nor with any antiviral activity. Confirmatory studies of eight of the genes in validate the initial screening data. Mechanistic studies on TRIM7 demonstrated a conserved role of the molecule in mouse and human cells in restricting MNoV in a step of infection after viral entry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that two isoforms of TRIM7 have differential antiviral activity. Taken together these data provide a resource for understanding norovirus biology and demonstrate a robust methodology for identifying new antiviral molecules across cell types and species.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNorovirus is one of the leading causes of foodborne illness world-wide. Despite its prevalence, our understanding of norovirus biology is limited due to the difficulty in growing human norovirus in vitro and a lack of an animal model. Murine norovirus (MNoV) is a model norovirus system because MNoV replicates robustly in cell culture and in mice. To identify host genes that can restrict norovirus replication when overexpressed we performed genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens to induce gene overexpression at the native locus through recruitment of transcriptional activators to individual gene promoters. We found 57 genes could block murine norovirus replication in either mouse or human cells. Several of these genes are associated with classical immune signaling pathways, while many of the molecules we identified have not been previously associated with antiviral activity. Our data is a resource for those studying norovirus and we provide a robust approach to identify novel antiviral genes.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual organization is the process of grouping scene elements into whole entities. A classic example is contour integration, in which separate line segments are perceived as continuous contours. Uncertainty in such grouping arises from scene ambiguity and sensory noise. Some classic Gestalt principles of contour integration, and more broadly, of perceptual organization, have been re-framed in terms of Bayesian inference, whereby the observer computes the probability that the whole entity is present. Previous studies that proposed a Bayesian interpretation of perceptual organization, however, have ignored sensory uncertainty, despite the fact that accounting for the current level of perceptual uncertainty is one the main signatures of Bayesian decision making. Crucially, trial-by-trial manipulation of sensory uncertainty is a key test to whether humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in contour integration, as opposed to using some manifestly non-Bayesian heuristic. We distinguish between these hypotheses in a simplified form of contour integration, namely judging whether two line segments separated by an occluder are collinear. We manipulate sensory uncertainty by varying retinal eccentricity. A Bayes-optimal observer would take the level of sensory uncertainty into account - in a very specific way - in deciding whether a measured offset between the line segments is due to non-collinearity or to sensory noise. We find that people deviate slightly but systematically from Bayesian optimality, while still performing \"probabilistic computation\" in the sense that they take into account sensory uncertainty via a heuristic rule. Our work contributes to an understanding of the role of sensory uncertainty in higher-order perception.\n\nAuthor summaryOur percept of the world is governed not only by the sensory information we have access to, but also by the way we interpret this information. When presented with a visual scene, our visual system undergoes a process of grouping visual elements together to form coherent entities so that we can interpret the scene more readily and meaningfully. For example, when looking at a pile of autumn leaves, one can still perceive and identify a whole leaf even when it is partially covered by another leaf. While Gestalt psychologists have long described perceptual organization with a set of qualitative laws, recent studies offered a statistically-optimal - Bayesian, in statistical jargon - interpretation of this process, whereby the observer chooses the scene configuration with the highest probability given the available sensory inputs. However, these studies drew their conclusions without considering a key actor in this kind of statistically-optimal computations, that is the role of sensory uncertainty. One can easily imagine that our decision on whether two contours belong to the same leaf or different leaves is likely going to change when we move from viewing the pile of leaves at a great distance (high sensory uncertainty), to viewing very closely (low sensory uncertainty). Our study examines whether and how people incorporate uncertainty into contour integration, an elementary form of perceptual organization, by varying sensory uncertainty from trial to trial in a simple contour integration task. We found that people indeed take into account sensory uncertainty, however in a way that subtly deviates from optimal behavior.",

    "abstract": "Robustly predicting outcome for cancer patients from gene expression is an important challenge on the road to better personalized treatment. Network-based outcome predictors (NOPs), which considers the cellular wiring diagram in the classification, hold much promise to improve performance, stability and interpretability of identified marker genes. Problematically, reports on the efficacy of NOPs are conflicting and for instance suggest that utilizing random networks performs on par to networks that describe biologically relevant interactions. In this paper we turn the prediction problem around: instead of using a given biological network in the NOP, we aim to identify the network of genes that truly improves outcome prediction. To this end, we propose SyNet, a gene network constructed ab initio from synergistic gene pairs derived from survival-labelled gene expression data. To obtain SyNet, we evaluate synergy for all 69 million pairwise combinations of genes resulting in a network that is specific to the dataset and phenotype under study and can be used to in a NOP model. We evaluated SyNet and 11 other networks on a compendium dataset of >4000 survival-labelled breast cancer samples. For this purpose, we used cross-study validation which more closely emulates real world application of these outcome predictors. We find that SyNet is the only network that truly improves performance, stability and interpretability in several existing NOPs. We show that SyNet overlaps significantly with existing gene networks, and can be confidently predicted (~85% AUC) from graph-topological descriptions of these networks, in particular the breast tissue-specific network. Due to its data-driven nature, SyNet is not biased to well-studied genes and thus facilitates post-hoc interpretation. We find that SyNet is highly enriched for known breast cancer genes and genes related to e.g. histological grade and tamoxifen resistance, suggestive of a role in determining breast cancer outcome.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCancer is caused by disrupted activity of several pathways. Therefore, outcome predictors analyze patients expression profiles from perspective of gene groups collected from interactomes (e.g. protein interaction networks). These Network based Outcome Predictors (NOPs) hold potential to facilitate identification of dysregulated pathways and delivering improved prognosis. Nonetheless, recent studies revealed that compared to classical models, neither performance nor consistency can be improved using NOPs.\\n\\nWe argue that NOPs can only perform well under guidance of suitable networks. The commonly used networks may miss associations specially for under-studied genes. Additionally, these networks are often generic with low resemblance to perturbations that arise in cancer.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we exploit ~4100 samples and infer a disease specific network called SyNet linking synergistic gene pairs that collectively show predictivity beyond individual performance of genes.\\n\\nUsing identical datasets, we show that a NOP yields superior performance merely by considering groups of genes in SyNet. Further, NOP performance severely reduces if SyNet nodes are shuffled, confirming relevance of SyNet links.\\n\\nDue to simplicity of our approach, this framework can be used for any phenotype of interest. Our findings represent the value of network-based models and crucial role of interactome in their performance.",

    "abstract": "Short AbstractIs it better to be left- or right-handed? The answer depends on whether the goal is making a handshake or winning a boxing match. The need for coordination favors the handedness of the majority, but being different could also provide an advantage. The same rules could apply to microbial colonies and cancer tumors. Like humans, cells often have handedness (chirality) that reflects the lack of mirror symmetry in their shapes or movement patterns. We find that cells gain a substantial fitness advantage by either increasing the magnitude of their chirality or switching to the opposite handedness. Selection for specific chirality is mediated by the formation of bulges along the colony edge in regions where cells with different chiralities meet.\\n\\nLong AbstractChirality in shape and motility can evolve rapidly in microbes and cancer cells. To determine how chirality affects cell fitness, we developed a model of chiral growth in compact aggregates such as microbial colonies and solid tumors. Our model recapitulates previous experimental findings and shows that mutant cells can invade by increasing their chirality or switching their handedness. The invasion results either in a takeover or stable coexistence between the mutant and the ancestor depending on their relative chirality. For large chiralities, the coexistence is accompanied by strong intermixing between the cells, while spatial segregation occurs otherwise. We show that the competition within the aggregate is mediated by bulges in regions where the cells with different chiralities meet. The two-way coupling between aggregate shape and natural selection is described by the chiral Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation coupled to the Burgers equation with multiplicative noise. We solve for the key features of this theory to explain the origin of selection on chirality. Overall, our work suggests that chirality could be an important ecological trait that mediates competition, invasion, and spatial structure in cellular populations.",

    "abstract": "Southwestern Angola is a region characterized by contact between indigenous foragers and incoming food-producers, involving genetic and cultural exchanges between peoples speaking Kxa, Khoe-Kwadi and Bantu languages. Although present-day Bantu-speakers share a patrilocal residence pattern and matrilineal principle of clan and group membership, a highly stratified social setting divides dominant pastoralists from marginalized groups that subsist on alternative strategies and have previously been though to have pre-Bantu origins. Here, we compare new high-resolution sequence data from 2.3 Mb of the non-recombining Y chromosome (NRY) from 170 individuals with previously reported mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA), to investigate the population history of seven representative southwestern Angolan groups (Himba, Kuvale, Kwisi, Kwepe, Twa, Tjimba, !Xun) and to study the causes and consequences of sex-biased processes in their genetic variation. We found no clear link between the formerly Kwadi-speaking Kwepe and pre-Bantu eastern African migrants, and no pre-Bantu NRY lineages among Bantu-speaking groups, except for small amounts of \\\"Khoisan\\\" introgression. We therefore propose that irrespective of their subsistence strategies, all Bantu-speaking groups of the area share a male Bantu origin. Additionally, we show that in Bantu-speaking groups, the levels of among-group and between-group variation are higher for mtDNA than for NRY. These results, together with our previous demonstration that the matriclanic systems of southwestern Angolan Bantu groups are genealogically consistent, suggest that matrilineality strongly enhances both female population sizes and interpopulation mtDNA variation.",

    "abstract": "Ants, being ubiquitous, aggressive, and top predators, play a predominant role in terrestrial ecosystems. Jumping spiders are another prominent invertebrate predator that are present in similar habitats as that of ants. Most jumping spiders are thought to avoid ants, yet little is known if they discriminate among them. In this study we examined the response of jumping spider genus Plexippus towards three different ant species (Oecophylla smaragdina, the weaver ants; Camponotus sericeus the golden-back carpenter ants, and Leptogenys processionalis, the procession ants). In a behavioral assay that excluded tactile and chemical cues, we tested if spiders distinguish the three ants by visual cues alone. We recorded and analysed behaviors such as  look,  approach,  stalk,  attack, and  avoidance by spiders towards ants. Our results show that the three ants differ in their color, movement and aggressive behavior. Spiders gave  short looks to live ants, suggesting movement is important in detecting ants. Furthermore, spiders gave significantly more  long looks to procession and golden-back ants compared to weaver ants. Spiders approached, stalked and attacked procession ants more compared to weaver ants. Numerous jumping spiders and ants overlap in their habitat, and it is advantageous to selectively avoid some ants over others. Our results suggests that jumping spiders can indeed distinguish ants that co-occur in their habitat by visual cues alone, however, the precise nature of visual cues warrants further studies.",

Vidal-Gadea et al. claimed that C. elegans are magneto-sensitive, exploiting the magnetic field to guide their burrowing behavior [1]. Our attempts to replicate their findings were unsuccessful [2], which Vidal-Gadea attributed to the satiety of the animals and the environment in which they were raised. Here, we report our repeated experiments, having adopted several suggestions proposed by Vidal-Gadea et al. [3]. We find that shortening the length of the behavioral assay and raising the animals in a Faraday cage does not result in magnetotactic behavior.

    "abstract": "The regulation of transcription factor activity dynamically changes across cellular conditions and disease subtypes. The identification of biological modulators contributing to context-specific gene regulation is one of the challenging tasks in systems biology, which is necessary to understand and control cellular responses across different genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. Previous approaches for identifying biological modulators from gene expression data were restricted to the capturing of a particular type of a three-way dependency among a regulator, its target gene, and a modulator; these methods cannot describe the complex regulation structure, such as when multiple regulators, their target genes, and modulators are functionally related. Here, we propose a statistical method for identifying biological modulators by capturing multivariate local dependencies, based on energy statistics, which is a class of statistics based on distances. Subsequently, our method assigns a measure of statistical significance to each candidate modulator through a permutation test. We compared our approach with that of a leading competitor for identifying modulators, and illustrated its performance through both simulations and real data analysis. Our method, entitled genome-wide identification of modulators using local energy statistical test (GIMLET), is implemented with R ([&ge;] 3.2.2) and is available from github (https://github.com/tshimam/GIMLET).",

A novel combinatorial strategy was developed for identification of multivariate biomarker signatures, resulting in 484 mutually exclusive models out of which 448 did not contain the present biomarker MUCIN-16. The top-ranking model consisted of 14 proteins and had a AUC=0.95, PPV=1.0, sensitivity=0.99 and specificity=1.0 for detection of stage III-IV ovarian cancer in the discovery data, and an AUC=0.89, PPV=0.93, sensitivity=0.89 and specificity=0.95 in the replication data. The novel plasma protein signature could be used to improve the diagnosis of women with adnexal ovarian mass or in screening to identify women that should be referred to specialized examination.",

We discover two critical transition periods: surface ectoderm initiation and keratinocyte maturation, and identify TFAP2C and p63 as lineage initiation and maturation factors, respectively. Surprisingly, we find that TFAP2C, and not p63, is sufficient to initiate surface ectoderm differentiation, with TFAP2C-initiated progenitor cells capable of maturing into functional keratinocytes. Mechanistically, TFAP2C primes the surface ectoderm chromatin landscape and induces p63 expression and binding sites, thus allowing maturation factor p63 to positively auto-regulate its expression and close a subset of the TFAP2C-initiated early program. Our work provides a general framework to infer TF networks controlling chromatin transitions that will facilitate future regenerative medicine advances.",

However, these approaches are often impracticable, for example in clinical therapeutic genome editing in situ or gene drives in which environmentally-compatible control is paramount. With this in mind, we have developed heritable Cas9-mediated mammalian genome editing that is acutely controlled by the cheap lysine derivative, Lys(Boc) (BOC). Genetic code expansion permitted non-physiological BOC incorporation such that Cas9 (Cas9BOC) was expressed in a full-length, active form in cultured somatic cells only after BOC exposure. Stringently BOC-dependent, heritable editing of transgenic and native genomic loci occurred when Cas9BOC was expressed at the onset of mouse embryonic development from cRNA or Cas9BOC transgenic females. The tightly controlled Cas9 editing system reported here promises to have broad applications and is a first step towards purposed, spatiotemporal gene drive regulation over large geographical ranges.",

    "abstract": "Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized layers of extracellular matrix (ECM) mainly composed of Laminin, type IV Collagen, Perlecan and Nidogen/entactin (NDG). While the essential and evolutionary conserved functions of Laminin, Collagen and Perlecan are well documented in Drosophila and other species, the proposed role of NDG as the major ECM linker molecule has been challenged by several in vivo studies revealing that NDG is dispensable for viability and BM formation. Here, we report the characterization of the single Ndg gene in Drosophila. Embryonic Ndg expression differed from that of other BM components and was primarily observed in mesodermal tissues and the chordotonal organs, whereas NDG protein localized to all BMs. While loss of Laminin strongly affected BM-localization of NDG, Ndg null mutants exhibited no overt changes in the distribution of BM core components. However, loss of NDG led to ultrastructural BM defects compromising barrier function and stability in vivo. Although Ndg mutants were viable, loss of NDG led to decreased fecundity in flies as well as impaired crawling behavior and reduced response to vibrational stimuli in larvae. Further morphological analysis revealed accompanying defects in the larval peripheral nervous system especially in the chordotonal organs and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where Ndg genetically interacted with the Leukocyte-antigen-related-like (Lar) receptor gene to regulate NMJ extension and synaptic differentiation. Taken together, our analysis suggests that NDG is not essential for BM assembly but mediates BM stability and ECM-dependent neural plasticity during Drosophila development.\\n\\nSummary StatementIn this study we characterize Drosophila Nidogen/Entactin (Ndg) mutants revealing that loss of Ndg impairs basement membrane (BM) stability and permeability as well as proper function of the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "DYRK1A is a major causative gene in Down syndrome (DS). Reduced incidence of solid tumors and vascular anomalies in DS patients suggests a role of DYRK1A in angiogenesis, but in vivo evidence is lacking. Here, we used zebrafish dyrk1aa mutant embryos to understand DYRK1A function in the cerebral vasculature formation. Zebrafish dyrk1aa mutants exhibited cerebral hemorrhage and defects in angiogenesis of central arteries in the developing hindbrain. Such phenotypes were rescued by wild-type dyrk1aa mRNA, but not by a kinase-dead form, indicating the importance of DYRK1A kinase activity. Chemical screening using a bioactive small molecule library identified a calcium chelator, EGTA, as one of the hits that most robustly rescued the hemorrhage. Vascular defects of mutants were also rescued by independent modulation of calcium signaling by FK506. Furthermore, the transcriptomic analyses supported the alterations of calcium signaling networks in dyrk1aa mutants. Together, our results suggest that dyrk1aa plays an essential role in angiogenesis and in maintenance of the developing cerebral vasculature via regulation of calcium signaling, which may have therapeutic potential for DYRK1A-related vascular diseases.",

However, development of optimal strains with high product titers, rates, and yields required for industrial production is laborious and expensive. To accelerate the strain engineering process, we have recently introduced a modular cell design concept that enables rapid generation of optimal production strains by systematically assembling a modular cell with an exchangeable production module(s) to produce target molecules efficiently. In this study, we formulated the modular cell design concept as a general multiobjective optimization problem with flexible design objectives derived from mass action. We developed algorithms and an associated software package, named ModCell2 to implement the design. We demonstrated that ModCell2 can systematically identify genetic modifications to design modular cells that can couple with a variety of production modules and exhibit a minimal tradeoff among modularity, performance, and robustness. Analysis of the modular cell designs revealed both intuitive and complex metabolic architectures enabling modular production of these molecules. We envision ModCell2 provides a powerful tool to guide modular cell engineering and sheds light on modular design principles of biological systems.",

Many optimizers have been developed to control the learning rate and increase convergence speed. Generally, these optimizers adjust the learning rate automatically in response to learning status. These optimizers were gradually improved by incorporating the effective aspects of earlier methods. In this study, we developed a new optimizer: YamAdam. Our optimizer is based on Adam, which utilizes the first and second moments of previous gradients. In addition to the moment estimation system, we incorporated an advantageous part of AdaDelta, namely a unit correction system, into YamAdam.

    "abstract": "An upcoming clinical trial at the Moffitt Cancer Center for women with stage 2/3 ER+breast cancer combines an aromatase inhibitor and a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, and aims to lower a preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) that correlates with relapse-free survival. PEPI is fundamentally a static index, measured at the end of neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. We develop a mathematical model of the essential components of the PEPI score in order to identify successful combination therapy regimens that minimize both tumor burden and metastatic potential, based on time-dependent trade-offs in the system. We consider two molecular traits, CCR7 and PD-L1 which correlate with treatment response and increased metastatic risk. We use a matrix game model with the four phenotypic strategies to examine the frequency-dependent interactions of cancer cells. This game was embedded into an ecological model of tumor population growth dynamics. The resulting model predicts both evolutionary and ecological dynamics that track with changes in the PEPI score. We consider various treatment regimens based on combinations of the two therapies with drug holidays. By considering the trade off between tumor burden and metastatic potential, the optimal therapy plan was found to be a 1 month kick start of the immune checkpoint inhibitor followed by five months of continuous combination therapy. Relative to a protocol with both therapeutics given together from the start, this delayed regimen results in transient sub-optimal tumor regression while maintaining a phenotypic constitution that is more amenable to fast tumor regression for the final five months of therapy. The mathematical model provides a useful abstraction of clinical intuition, enabling hypothesis generation and testing of clinical assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise to precisely classify human ancestry and the genetic causes of complex diseases. I have constructed an unsupervised machine learning paradigm that examines the whole genome as a hyper-dense, nonlinear, multidimensional feature space. The AI system culminates in 26 neural network neurons each sensitive to a specific heritage that can identify an individuals component genetic heritages with a top-5 error of <0.5%. Importantly, I observed some populations previously thought to belong to single stratum are composed of multiple strata - for instance Japan is defined as a uniform population using previous methods. I found that the Japanese individuals segregate to two very distinct populations. This work represents an essential step towards understanding the genetic background of patients to enable precision medicine causal disease gene identification.",

    "abstract": "Sericulture is an important cottage industry of Assam producing natural silk of both Mulberry and Non-Mulberry silk. The sericulture industry is closely associated with the Assamese traditions and rituals. In non-mulberry silk, Muga silkworm which is endemic to North-East India only produce exquisite silks of golden color. Rearing of Muga silkworm is one of the important aspects to producing silk of high quality. The quality of the primary host plant i.e. Som (Persea bombycina Kost.) greatly affects the quality of cocoon and silk produced by these industries. Therefore, planting and growing a disease-free plant has its own importance in sericulture. However, Som is very susceptible to different foliar diseases caused by fungi, which can reduce the yield of leaf from 13.8 - 41.6% annually. Therefore, a comprehensive mycofloral study of the host plant is important to forecast the future diseases and design different disease management procedures. This study has been done for a period of two years from 2014 - 2016 in Goalpara district of Assam and overall mycoflora of pedosphere (rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere), phyllosphere and aerosphere were identified and correlated with the seasonal variation. The rhizosphere, air, and phylloplane was dominated by Rhizopus stolonifer (22.13%; 15.08; 24.01) while Aspergillus niger (12.63%) was the dominant flora of non-rhizosphere. Seasonal variation was found to play an important role in shaping the mycofloral community structure in soil and phyllosphere. In summer, soil was majorly dominated by Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Curvularia lunata while Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus clavatus, Penicillium chrysogenum dominated the winter soil. In phyllosphere, the Chatuwa and Jaruwa, the winter generations were mainly dominated by Rhizopus stolonifer. While as the environmental temperature gradually increased with relative humidity in Aheruwa, Bhodia, Kotia and Jethuwa generation there was a shift in diversity with a gradual increase in occurance of Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus. Pestaloptiopsis disseminata one of the major pathogen of Som was found highest in aerosphere followed by phyllosphere and it was only dominated in Aheruwa generation. It was found that occurrence of P. disseminata were high when the temperature ranges between 25{degrees} - 28{degrees} with 70 -80% of relative humidity. This study provides a deep insight into the fungal diversity of host plant Som with respect to pedosphere, aerosphere, and phyllosphere and this knowledge can be used to better select the plantation area and design different disease management strategies to sustain and proliferate the industry for socio-economic development and to conserve its cultural essence.",

    "abstract": "Cortical D2 dopamine receptor (Drd2) have mostly been examined in the context of cognitive function regulation and neurotransmission modulation of medial prefrontal cortex by principal neurons and parvalbumin positive, fast-spiking, interneurons in schizophrenia. Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors co-expression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough reexamination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "The collection of eye gaze information during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is important for monitoring variations in attention and task compliance, particularly for naturalistic viewing paradigms (e.g., movies). However, the complexity and setup requirements of current in-scanner eye-tracking solutions can preclude many researchers from accessing such information. Predictive eye estimation regression (PEER) is a previously developed support vector regression-based method for retrospectively estimating eye gaze from the fMRI signal in the eyes orbit using a 1.5-minute calibration scan. Here, we provide confirmatory validation of the PEER methods ability to infer eye gaze on a TR-by-TR basis during movie viewing, using simultaneously acquired eye tracking data in five individuals (median angular deviation < 2{degrees}). Then, we examine variations in the predictive validity of PEER models across individuals in a subset of data (n=448) from the Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network Biobank, identifying head motion as a primary determinant. Finally, we accurately classify which of two movies is being watched based on the predicted eye gaze patterns (area under the curve = .90 {+/-} .02) and map the neural correlates of eye movements derived from PEER. PEER is a freely available and easy-to-use tool for determining eye fixations during naturalistic viewing.",

    "abstract": "Endophenotype refers to a measurable and heritable component between genetics and diagnosis and exists in both individuals with a diagnosis and their unaffected siblings. We aimed to identify a pattern of endophenotype consisted of multiple connections. We enrolled adult male individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) endophenotype (i.e., individuals with ASD and their unaffected siblings) and individuals without ASD endophenotype (i.e., pairs of typical development (TD) siblings) and utilized a machine learning approach to classify people with and without endophenotypes, based on resting-state functional connections (FCs). A sparse logistic regression successfully classified people as to the endophenotype (area under the curve=0.78, classification accuracy=75%), suggesting the existence of endophenotype pattern. A binomial test identified that nine FCs were consistently selected as inputs for the classifier. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with these nine FCs predicted severity of communication impairment among individuals with ASD (r=0.68, p=0.021). In addition, two of the nine FCs were statistically significantly correlated with the severity of communication impairment (r=0.81, p=0.0026 and r=-0.60, p=0.049). The current findings suggest that an ASD endophenotype pattern exists in FCs with a multivariate manner and is associated with clinical ASD phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Predicting preterm birth is uncertain, and numerous scientists are searching for non-invasive methods to improve its predictability. Current researches are based on the analysis of ElectroHysteroGram (EHG) records, which contain information about the electrophysiological properties of the uterine muscle and uterine contractions. Since pregnancy is a long process, we decided to also characterize, for the first time, non-contraction intervals (dummy intervals) of the uterine records, i.e., EHG signals accompanied by a simultaneously recorded external tocogram measuring mechanical uterine activity (TOCO signal). For this purpose, we developed a new set of uterine records, TPEHGT DS, containing preterm and term uterine records of pregnant women, and uterine records of non-pregnant women. We quantitatively characterized contraction intervals (contractions) and dummy intervals of the uterine records of the TPEHGT DS in terms of the normalized power spectra of the EHG and TOCO signals, and developed a new method for predicting preterm birth. The results on the characterization revealed that the peak amplitudes of the normalized power spectra of the EHG and TOCO signals of the contraction and dummy intervals in the frequency band 1.0-2.2 Hz, describing the electrical and mechanical activity of the uterus due to the maternal heart (maternal heart rate), are high only during term pregnancies, when the delivery is still far away; and they are low when the delivery is close. However, these peak amplitudes are also low during preterm pregnancies, when the delivery is still supposed to be far away (thus suggesting the danger of preterm birth); and they are also low or barely present for non-pregnant women. We propose the values of the peak amplitudes of the normalized power spectra due to the influence of the maternal heart, in an electro-mechanical sense, in the frequency band 1.0-2.2 Hz as a new biophysical marker for the preliminary, or early, assessment of the danger of preterm birth. The classification of preterm and term, contraction and dummy intervals of the TPEHGT DS, for the task of the automatic prediction of preterm birth, using sample entropy, the median frequency of the power spectra, and the peak amplitude of the normalized power spectra, revealed that the dummy intervals provide quite comparable and slightly higher classification performances than these features obtained from the contraction intervals. This result suggests a novel and simple clinical technique, not necessarily to seek contraction intervals but using the dummy intervals, for the early assessment of the danger of preterm birth. Using the publicly available TPEHG DB database to predict preterm birth in terms of classifying between preterm and term EHG records, the proposed method outperformed all currently existing methods. The achieved classification accuracy was 100% for early records, recorded around the 23rd week of pregnancy; and 96.33%, the area under the curve of 99.44%, for all records of the database. Since the proposed method is capable of using the dummy intervals with high classification accuracy, it is also suitable for clinical use very early during pregnancy, around the 23rd week of pregnancy, when contractions may or may not be present.",

Their effects on dispersal are thought to be complex, depending on the characteristics of the structure and the intensity of the traffic using it. In addition, individual factors, such as age, may strongly affect dispersal decisions and success when individuals are confronted with transport infrastructure. Despite the importance of this topic for wildlife conservation, few studies have investigated the effect of transport infrastructure on individuals dispersal decisions before and after sexual maturity. We examined the effects on two kinds of infrastructure, gravel tracks and paved roads, on the dispersal of an endangered amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata). We used capture-recapture data collected during a five-year period on a large, spatially structured population of B. variegata. Our study revealed that emigration rates increased with an individuals age, while dispersal distance decreased. It also showed that both tracks and roads had negative effects on dispersal. The negative effect of roads was stronger than that of tracks. We additionally found that the effect of tracks on dispersal slightly decreased with a toads age. In contrast, the negative effect of roads was severe and relatively similar across age classes.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disorder that affects approximately 70,000 people worldwide. It is caused by mutation-induced defects in synthesis, folding, processing, or function of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator protein (CFTR), a chloride-selective ion channel required for the proper functioning of secretory epithelia in tissues such as the lung, pancreas, and skin. The most common cause of CF is the single-residue deletion of F508 (F508del), a mutation present in one or both alleles in 90% of patients that induces severe folding defects and results in greatly reduced expression of the protein. Despite its medical importance, high-resolution mechanistic information about CFTR folding is lacking. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation with a native-centric force field to examine the folding and assembly of both full-length CFTR and the isolated first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1). We observed that the protein was capable of substantial misfolding on both the intradomain and interdomain scale due to entropically favorable kinetic traps that exist on CFTRs folding free energy surface. These results suggest that even wild type CFTR, in the absence of any disease-related mutations, has suboptimal folding efficiency. We speculate that such entropically-driven misfolding also occurs in disease-prone mutants such as F508del and contributes to the proteins poor in vivo activity.",

Several state-of-the-art network-based analyses have been proposed for mechanical understanding of genetic variants in neurogenetic disorders. However, these methods were mainly designed for modeling and analyzing single networks that do not interact with or depend on other networks, and thus cannot capture the properties between interdependent systems in brain-specific tissues, circuits, and regions which are connected each other and affect behavior and cognitive processes.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel and efficient framework, called a \\\"Network of Networks\\\" (NoN) approach, to infer the interconnectivity structure between multiple networks where the response and the predictor variables are topological information matrices of given networks. We also propose Graph-Oriented SParsE Learning (GOSPEL), a new sparse structural learning algorithm for network graph data to identify a subset of the topological information matrices of the predictors related to the response. We demonstrate on simulated data that GOSPEL outperforms existing kernel-based algorithms in terms of F-measure. On real data from human brain region-specific functional networks associated with the autism risk genes, we show that the NoN model provides insights on the autism-associated interconnectivity structure between functional interaction networks and a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of autism across diverse regions of the brain.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur software is available from https://github.com/infinite-point/GOSPEL.\\n\\nContactkawakubo@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp, shimamura@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Several peptides in clinical use are derived from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). In these systems multiple NRPS subunits interact with each other in a specific linear order mediated by docking domains (DDs) to synthesize well-defined peptide products. In contrast to these classical NRPSs, the subunits of rhabdopeptide/xenortide producing NRPSs can act iteratively and in different order resulting in libraries of peptide products. In order to define the structural and thermodynamic basis for their unusual interaction patterns, we determined the structures of all N-terminal DDs (NDDs) as well as of an NDD-CDD complex and characterized all putative DD interactions thermodynamically for one such system. Key amino acid residues for DD interactions were identified that upon their exchange not only changed the DD affinity but also resulted in rationally predictable changes in peptide production. A simple set of  recognition rules for DD interactions was identified that also operates in other megasynthase complexes.",

    "abstract": "Inelastic behaviors, such as softening, a progressive decrease in modulus before failure, occur in tendon andare important aspect in degeneration and tendinopathy. These in elastic behaviors are generally attributed to two potential mechanisms: plastic deformation and damage. However, it is not clear which is primarily responsible.In this study, we evaluated these potential mechanisms of tendon in elasticity by using a recently developed reactive in elasticity model (RIE), which is a structurally-inspired continuum mechanics frame work that models tissue in elasticity based on the molecular bond kinetics. Using RIE, we formulated two material models, one specific toplastic deformation and the other to damage. The models were independently fit to published experimental tensiletests of rat tail tendons. We quantified the inelastic effects and compared the performance of the two models infitting the mechanical response during loading, relaxation, unloading, and reloading phases. Additionally, we validated the models by using the resulting fit parameters to predict an independent set of experimental stress-straincurves from ramp-to-failure tests. Overall, the models were both successful in fitting the experiments and predicting the validation data. However, the results did not strongly favor one mechanism over the other. As a result, to distinguish between plastic deformation and damage, different experimental protocols will be needed. Nevertheless, these findings suggest the potential of RIE as a comprehensive framework for studying tendon inelastic behaviors.",

Here, we present AccuNGS, a novel in vivo sequencing approach that detects variants as rare as 1:10,000. Applying it to 46 clinical samples taken from early infections of the human-infecting viruses HIV, RSV and CMV, revealed large differences in within-host genetic diversity among virus populations. Haplotype reconstruction revealed that increased diversity was mostly driven by multiple transmitted/founder viruses in HIV and CMV samples. Conversely, we detected an abundance of defective virus genomes (DVGs) in RSV samples, including hyper-edited genomes, nonsense mutations and single point deletions. Higher proportions of DVGs correlated with increased viral loads, suggesting increased cellular co-infection rates, which enable DVG persistence. AccuNGS establishes a general platform that allows detecting DVGs, and in general, rare variants that drive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) is a large dodecameric enzyme with six active sites that exhibits allostery: its catalytic rate is modulated by the binding of various substrates at distal points from the active sites. A recently developed method, bond-to-bond propensity analysis, has proven capable of predicting allosteric sites in a wide range of proteins using an energy-weighted atomistic graph obtained from the protein structure and given knowledge only of the location of the active site. Bond-to-bond propensity establishes if energy fluctuations at given bonds have significant effects on any other bond in the protein, by considering their propagation through the protein graph. In this work, we use bond-to-bond propensity analysis to study different aspects of ATCase activity using three different protein structures and sources of fluctuations. First, we predict key residues and bonds involved in the transition between inactive (T) and active (R) states of ATCase by analysing allosteric substrate binding as a source of energy perturbations in the protein graph. Our computational results also indicate that the effect of multiple allosteric binding is non linear: a switching effect is observed after a particular number and arrangement of substrates is bound suggesting a form of long range communication between the distantly arranged allosteric sites. Second, cooperativity is explored by considering a bisubstrate analogue as the source of energy fluctuations at the active site, also leading to the identification of highly significant residues to the T{leftrightarrow}R transition that enhance cooperativity across active sites. Finally, the inactive (T) structure is shown to exhibit a strong, non linear communication between the allosteric sites and the interface between catalytic subunits, rather than the active site. Bond-to-bond propensity thus offers an alternative route to explain allosteric and cooperative effects in terms of detailed atomistic changes to individual bonds within the protein, rather than through phenomenological, global thermodynamic arguments.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is a central mechanism in ecology and evolution. Dispersal evolution is driven by a trade-off between costs and benefits, which is influenced by inter-individual variability and local environmental conditions (context-dependent dispersal). Many studies have investigated how dispersal decisions may be influenced by environmental factors, including density, predation, and interspecific competition. Yet few have attempted to examine how habitat disturbance may affect the dispersal process in spatially structured populations. In early successional species, one might expect individuals to adjust their dispersal decisions based on two main factors that potentially have an influence on reproductive success: patch size and the level of patch disturbance. In this study, we examined how these two factors affect breeding success and dispersal decisions in an early successional amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata). To this end, we used capture-recapture data collected on a spatially structured population occupying 28 breeding patches. We took advantage of recent developments in multievent capture-recapture models to detect signs of context-dependent dispersal. The results revealed that the probability of successful reproduction and the number of newly metamorphosed individuals increased with both the size and the proportion of disturbance of a patch. In addition, our results showed that the factors affecting breeding success also influenced breeding dispersal probability. Large patch size negatively influenced emigration probability; in contrast, it positively influenced immigration probability. Equally, higher disturbance (in terms of the proportion of the patchs surface area disturbed each year) had a strong negative influence on emigration probability and slightly positively affected immigration probability. These findings strongly suggest that individuals make context-dependent dispersal decisions, adjusted to maximize future fitness prospects in a patch, allowing them to better cope with rapid changes in environmental conditions resulting from the ecological succession process. This opens new areas of potential research into the role of dispersal in organism specialization along an ecological succession gradient.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria take up carbohydrates by membrane-integral sugar specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase systems (PTS). Although PTS is at the heart of bacterial carbon uptake and centrally involved in regulation of carbon metabolism, little is known about localization and putative oligomerization of the permease subunits (EII) of PTS. Here, we analyzed localization of the fructose specific PtsF and the glucose specific PtsG transporters from C. glutamicum using widefield and single molecule localization microscopy. PtsG and PtsF form membrane embedded clusters that localize in a punctate pattern within the cell membrane. The size, number and fluorescence of the observed clusters changes upon presence or absence of the transported substrate. In presence of the transport substrate clusters significantly increased in size. Photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) data revealed that, in presence of different carbon sources, the number of EII protein events per cluster remain the same, however the density of PTS molecules within a cluster reduces. Our work reveals a simple mechanism for efficient membrane occupancy regulation. Clusters of PTS EII transporters are densely packed in absence of a suitable substrate. In presence of a transport substrate the EII proteins in individual clusters occupy larger membrane areas, thereby decreasing protein density in individual clusters. This mechanism allows for efficient use of the limited membrane space under varying growth conditions without need of protein removal and re-synthesis.\\n\\nImportanceThe carbohydrate transport system PTS is centrally involved in the regulation of sugar metabolism. Although much is known about the regulatory interaction, the genetic control and the structure/function relationship of the individual PTS components, we know almost nothing about the spatio-temporal organization of the PTS proteins within the cell. We find dynamic clustering of PTS permeases in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Using single molecule resolution photo-activated localization microscopy we could show that PTS EII protein cluster are dynamically changing protein density upon substrate availability. Our findings imply a novel strategy of regulating limited membrane space efficiently. Furthermore, these data will provide important insights in modelling carbohydrate fluxes in cells, since current models assume a homogeneous distribution of PTS permeases within the membrane.",

Further, we found that the relationship between state anxiety prior to the MRI session and the effect of fc-NF was moderated by GABA concentrations in the PFC and anterior cingulate cortex.\n\nTo conclude, we were able to show that fc-NF can be used in adolescent females to shape neural and emotional/metacognitive measures underlying emotion regulation.

    "abstract": "Balancing exploration and exploitation is a fundamental aspect of decision-making. It remains unknown whether people are close to optimal in striking this balance, and if not, how exactly their behavior deviates from optimality. Many existing paradigms are not ideally suited to answer this question, as they contain complexities such as non-stationary environments, stochasticity under exploitation, and reward distributions that are unknown to participants. Here, we introduce a task without such complexities, in which the optimal policy is to start off exploring and to switch to exploitation at most once in each sequence of decisions. The behavior of 49 laboratory and 143 online participants deviated both qualitatively and quantitatively from the optimal policy, even when allowing for bias and decision noise. Instead, people seem to follow a suboptimal rule in which they switch from exploration to exploitation when the highest reward so far exceeds a certain threshold. Moreover, we show that this threshold decreases approximately linearly with the proportion of the sequence that remains, suggesting a novel temporal ratio law. Finally, we find evidence for \\\"sequence-level\\\" variability which is shared across all decisions in the same sequence. Our results provide a new perspective on the explore-exploit dilemma, and emphasize the importance of examining sequence-level strategies and their variability when studying sequential decision-making.",

Microbes such as methanotrophs can assist in methane mitigation. To understand the metabolic capabilities of methanotrophs, a complete genome-scale metabolic model of an obligate methanotroph, Methylococcus capsulatus str. Bath was reconstructed. The model contains 535 genes, 898 reactions and 784 unique metabolites and is named iMC535. The predictive potential of the model was validated using previously-reported experimental data. The model predicted the Entner-Duodoroff (ED) pathway to be essential for the growth of this bacterium, whereas the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway was found non-essential. The performance of the model was simulated on various carbon and nitrogen sources and found that M. capsulatus can grow on amino acids. The analysis of network topology of the model identified that six amino acids were in the top-ranked metabolic hubs. Using flux balance analysis (FBA), 29% of the metabolic genes were predicted to be essential, and 76 double knockout combinations involving 92 unique genes were predicted to be lethal. In conclusion, we have reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of a unique methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus str. Bath. The model will serve as a knowledge-base for deeper understanding, as a platform for exploring the metabolic potential, and as a tool to engineer this bacterium for methane mitigation and industrial applications.",

As explicit solutions to the CME, in the form of so-called propagators, are oftentimes not readily available, various approximations have been proposed. A recently developed analytical method is based on a separation of scales that assumes significant differences in the lifetimes of mRNA and protein in the network, allowing for the efficient approximation of propagators from asymptotic expansions for the corresponding generating functions. Here, we showcase the applicability of that method to simulated data from a  telegraph model for gene expression that is extended with an autoregulatory mechanism. We demonstrate that the resulting approximate propagators can be applied successfully for Bayesian parameter inference in the non-regulated model; moreover, we show that, in the extended autoregulated model, autoactivation or autorepression may be refuted under certain assumptions on the model parameters. Our results indicate that the method showcased here may allow for successful parameter inference and model identification from longitudinal single cell data.",

Despite these efforts, little is known about the extent to which environmental stressors accelerate mutation rates and influence the genetic load of populations. Moreover, most studies have focused on point mutations rather than large-scale deletions and duplications (copy number variations or \\\"CNVs\\\"). We estimated mutation rates in Daphnia pulex exposed to low levels of environmental stressors as well as the effect of selection on de novo mutations. We conducted a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment in which selection was minimized, coupled with an experiment in which a population was propagated under competitive conditions in a benign environment. After an average of 103 generations of MA propagation, we sequenced 60 genomes and found significantly accelerated rates of deletions and duplications in MA lines exposed to ecologically relevant concentrations of metals. Whereas control lines had gene deletion and duplication rates comparable to other multicellular eukaryotes (1.8 x 10-6 per gene per generation), a mixture of nickel and copper increased rates fourfold. The realized mutation rate under selection was reduced to 0.4x that of control MA lines, providing evidence that CNVs contribute to mutational load. Our CNV breakpoint analysis revealed that nonhomologous recombination associated with regions of DNA fragility is the primary source of CNVs, plausibly linking metal-induced DNA strand breaks with higher CNV rates. Our findings suggest that environmental stress, in particular multiple stressors, can have profound effects on large-scale mutation rates and mutational load of populations.",

    "abstract": "In the groundbreaking paper that eventually led to the 2014 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine, Hafting et al. (2005) reported that when rats forage for chocolate crumbs in a large open field, some neurons in their entorhinal cortex, called grid cells, exhibit crystalline-like responses to animal position, i.e. grids. Among several key findings documented in this article, the authors noted for the first time that the grids of different neurons can be tilted relative to each other, particularly if these neurons are far apart. In support of this claim, the researchers illustrated two neuronal subpopulations with a 7-10{degrees} difference in their grid orientations. Since these data are available online, we were able to reexamine these findings. Here we report several clarifications to the original observations of Hafting et al. First, we show that the relationship between the entorhinal grids is more complex than a single rotation: for the neuronal subpopulations analyzed by Hafting et al., one axis of the hexagonal grid is indeed tilted, but the other axes are not. Second, we show that local ensembles of entorhinal neurons are preferentially tuned to certain directions defined by the grid; this effect is unclear when single neurons are analyzed in isolation. Third, we argue that rat navigation traces are patterned instead of being random. For example, the orientation of the vector field representing average velocity appears to match the orientation of the neuronal grid. Overall, our observations indicate that additional insights into the function of entorhinal grids could be provided by ensemble-level analyses and thorough examination of the connection between the navigation behavior and neuronal patterns.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWhile our examination of the online dataset from Hafting et al. generally confirms their original findings, several clarifications should be made.\\nC_LIO_LIFor the two neuronal subpopulations, where Hafting et al. reported a 7-10{degrees} relative tilt between the grids, only one of the grid axes is tilted, whereas the others are not.\\nC_LIO_LIWhen spatial response fields are plotted for neuronal subpopulations instead of single neurons, it is clear that each subpopulation exhibits spatially periodic bands aligned with one of the grid axes.\\nC_LIO_LINavigation traces are not random and appear to match the orientation and periodicity of the neuronal grid.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "QuestionsCommunity weighted mean (CWM) approach analyses the relationship species attributes (like traits or Ellenberg-type indicator values) to sample attributes (environmental variables). Recently it has been shown to suffer from inflated Type I error rate if tested by standard parametric or (row-based) permutation test. Results of many published studies are likely influenced, reporting overly optimistic relationships that are in fact merely a numerical artefact. Can we evaluate results of which studies are likely to be influenced and how much?\\n\\nMethodsI suggest that hypotheses commonly tested by CWM approach are classified into three categories, which differ by assumption they make about the link of species composition to either species or sample attributes. I used a set of simulated and one simple real dataset to show how is the inflated Type I error rate influenced by data characteristics.\\n\\nResultsFor hypotheses assuming the link of species composition to species attributes, CWM approach with standard test returns correct Type I error rate. However, for the other two categories (assuming link of species composition to sample attributes or not assuming any link) it returns inflated Type I error rate and requires alternative tests to control for it (column-based and max test, respectively). Inflation index is negatively related to the beta diversity of species composition and positively to the strength of species composition-sample attributes relationship and the number of samples in the dataset. Inflation index is also influenced by modifying species composition matrix (by transformation or removal of species). The relationship of CWM with intrinsic species attributes is a case of spurious correlation and can be tested by column-based (modified) permutation test.\\n\\nConclusionsThe concept of three hypothesis categories offers a simple tool to evaluate whether given study reports correct or inflated Type I error rate, and how inflated the rate can be.",

    "abstract": "Consumer genomics databases reached the scale of millions of individuals. Recently, law enforcement investigators have started to exploit some of these databases to find distant familial relatives, which can lead to a complete re-identification. Here, we leveraged genomic data of 600,000 individuals tested with consumer genomics to investigate the power of such long-range familial searches. We project that half of the searches with European-descent individuals will result with a third cousin or closer match and will provide a search space small enough to permit re-identification using common demographic identifiers. Moreover, in the near future, virtually any European-descent US person could be implicated by this technique. We propose a potential mitigation strategy based on cryptographic signature that can resolve the issue and discuss policy implications to human subject research.",

    "abstract": "Despite their discovery over 25 years ago, the Marine Group II Euryarchaea (MGII) have remained a difficult group of organisms to study, lacking cultured isolates and genome references. The MGII have been identified in marine samples from around the world and evidence supports a photoheterotrophic lifestyle combining phototrophy via proteorhodopsins with the remineralization of high molecular weight organic matter. Divided between two clades, the MGII have distinct ecological patterns that are not understood based on the limited number of available genomes. Here, I present the comparative genomic analysis of 250 MGII genomes, providing the most detailed view of these mesophilic archaea to-date. This analysis identified 17 distinct subclades including nine subclades that previously lacked reference genomes. The metabolic potential and distribution of the MGII genera revealed distinct roles in the environment, identifying algal-saccharide-degrading coastal subclades, protein-degrading oligotrophic surface ocean subclades, and mesopelagic subclades lacking proteorhodopsins common in all other subclades. This study redefines the MGII and provides an avenue for understanding the role these organisms play in the cycling of organic matter throughout the water column.",

    "abstract": "Following a transection injury to the axon, neurons from a number of species have the ability to undergo spontaneous repair via fusion of the two separated axonal fragments. In the nematode C. elegans, this highly efficient regenerative axonal fusion is mediated by Epithelial Fusion Failure-1 (EFF-1), a fusogenic protein that functions at the membrane to merge the two axonal fragments. Identifying modulators of axonal fusion and EFF-1 is the next step towards harnessing this process for clinical applications. Here, we present evidence that the small GTPase RAB-5 acts to inhibit axonal fusion, a function achieved via endocytosis of EFF-1 within the injured neuron. Consequently, we find that perturbing RAB-5 activity increases the capacity of the neuron to undergo axonal fusion, through enhanced membranous localization of EFF-1 and the production of extracellular EFF-1-containing vesicles. These findings identify RAB-5 as a novel regulator of axonal fusion and the first regulator of EFF-1 in neurons.",
