    "abstract": "Predictive coding (PC) has been suggested as one of the main mechanisms used by brains to interact with complex environments. PC theories posit top-down prediction signals, which are compared with actual outcomes, yielding in turn prediction-error signals, which are used, bottom-up, to modify the ensuing predictions. However, disentangling prediction from prediction-error signals has been challenging. Critically, while many studies found indirect evidence for predictive coding in the form of prediction-error signals, direct evidence for the prediction signal is mostly lacking. Here we provide clear evidence, obtained from intracranial cortical recordings in human surgical patients, that the human lateral prefrontal cortex generates prediction signals while anticipating an event. Patients listened to task-irrelevant sequences of repetitive tones including infrequent predictable or unpredictable pitch deviants. The amplitude of high frequency broadband (HFB) neural activity was decreased prior to the onset of expected relative to unexpected deviants in the frontal cortex only, and its amplitude was sensitive to the increasing likelihood of deviants following longer trains of standards in the unpredictable condition. Single trial HFB amplitudes predicted deviations and correlated with post-stimulus response to deviations. These results provide direct evidence for frontal cortex prediction signals independent of prediction-error signals.",

    "abstract": "The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is comprised of lineages that exhibit varying degrees of specificity on about 50 grass hosts, including rice, wheat and barley. Reliable diagnostic tools are essential given that the pathogen has a propensity to jump to new hosts and spread to new geographic regions. Of particular concern is wheat blast, which has suddenly appeared in Bangladesh in 2016 before spreading to neighboring India. In these Asian countries, wheat blast strains are now co-occurring with the destructive rice blast pathogen raising the possibility of genetic exchange between these destructive pathogens. We assessed the recently described MoT3 diagnostic assay and found that it did not distinguish between wheat and rice blast isolates from Bangladesh. The assay is based on primers matching the WB12 sequence corresponding to a fragment of the M. oryzae MGG_02337 gene annotated as a short chain dehydrogenase. These primers could not reliably distinguish between wheat and rice blast isolates from Bangladesh based on DNA amplification experiments performed in separate laboratories in Bangladesh and in the UK. In addition, comparative genomics of the WB12 sequence revealed a complex underlying genetic structure with related sequences across M. oryzae strains and in both rice and wheat blast isolates. We, therefore, caution against the indiscriminate use of this assay to identify wheat blast.",

    "abstract": "SummaryFor many next-generation sequencing pipelines, the most computationally intensive step is the alignment of reads to a reference sequence. As a result, alignment software such as the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is optimized for speed and and is often executed in parallel on the cloud. However, there are other less demanding steps that can also be optimized and significantly increase the speed especially when using many threads. We demonstrate this using a Unique-molecular-identifier (UMI) RNA sequencing pipeline consisting of 3 steps: split, align, and merge. Optimization of all three steps yields a 40% increase in speed when executed using a single thread. However, when executed using 16 threads, we observe a 4-fold improvement over the original parallel imple-mentation and more than an 8-fold improvement over the original single-threaded implementation. In contrast, optimizing only the alignment step results in just a 13% improvement over the original parallel workflow using 16 threads.",

Molecular simulations can potentially provide powerful insights into the nature of these relationships. The analysis of structures and molecular trajectories of nucleic acids can be non-trivial because it requires processing very high-dimensional data that are not easy to visualize and interpret.\\n\\nHere we introduce Barnaba, a Python library aimed at facilitating the analysis of nucleic acids structures and molecular simulations. The software consists of a variety of analysis tools that allow the user to i) calculate distances between three-dimensional structures using different metrics, ii) back-calculate experimental data from three-dimensional structures, iii) perform cluster analysis and dimensionality reductions, iv) search three-dimensional motifs in PDB structures and trajectories and v) construct elastic network models (ENM) for nucleic acids and nucleic acids-protein complexes.\\n\\nIn addition, Barnaba makes it possible to calculate torsion angles, pucker conformations and to detect base-pairing/base-stacking interactions. Barnaba produces graphics that conveniently visualize both extended secondary structure and dynamics for a set of molecular conformations. The software is available as a command-line tool as well as a library, and supports a variety of 1le formats such as PDB, dcd and xtc 1les.

    "abstract": "Localized electroporation has evolved as an effective technology for the delivery of foreign molecules into adherent cells, and more recently, for the sampling of cytosolic content from a small population of cells. Unlike bulk electroporation, where the electric field is poorly controlled, localized electroporation benefits from the spatial localization of the electric field on a small areal fraction of the cell membrane, resulting in efficient molecular transport and high cell-viability. Although there have been numerous experimental reports, a mechanistic understanding of the different parameters involved in localized electroporation is lacking. In this work, we developed a multiphysics model that a) predicts the electro-pore distribution in response to the local transmembrane potential and b) calculates the molecular transport into and out of the cell based on the predicted pore-sizes. Using the model, we identify that cell membrane tension plays a crucial role in enhancing both the amount and the uniformity of molecular transport, particularly for large proteins and plasmids. We qualitatively validate the model predictions by delivering large molecules (fluorescent-tagged bovine serum albumin and mCherry encoding plasmid) and by sampling an exogeneous protein (tdTomato) in an engineered cell line. The findings presented here should inform the future design of microfluidic devices for localized electroporation based sampling, eventually paving the way for temporal, single-cell analysis.",

Using evolutionary and structural information, we searched for the most conserved K13 sites across Apicomplexa species evolution to identify sub-regions of K13 that are likely functional. An amino acid electropositive  patch in the K13 propeller domain has a dense concentration of extraordinarily conserved positions located at a shallow pocket, suggesting a role as binding surface. When applied to experimentally-characterized BTB-Kelch proteins, our strategy successfully identifies the validated substrate-binding residues within their own propeller shallow pocket. Another patch of slowly evolving sites is identified in the K13 BTB domain which partially overlaps the surface that binds to Cullin proteins in BTB-Cullin complexes.

    "abstract": "[11C]PBR28 is a positron emission tomography radioligand used to estimate the expression of 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO is expressed on glial cells and can function as a marker for immune activation. Since TSPO is expressed throughout the brain, no true reference region exists. For this reason, an arterial input function is required for accurate quantification of [11C]PBR28 binding and the most common outcome measure is the total distribution volume (VT). Notably, VT reflects both specific binding and non-displaceable binding (VND). Therefore, estimates of specific binding, such as binding potentials (e.g., BPND) and specific distribution volume (VS) should theoretically be more sensitive to underlying differences in TSPO expression. It is unknown, however, if unbiased and accurate estimates of these measures are obtainable for [11C]PBR28.\\n\\nThe Simultaneous Estimation (SIME) method uses time-activity-curves from multiple brain regions with the aim to obtain a brain-wide estimate of VND, which can subsequently be used to improve the estimation of BPND and VS. In this study we evaluated the accuracy of SIME-derived VND, and the reliability of resulting estimates of specific binding for [11C]PBR28, using a combination of simulation experiments and in vivo studies in healthy humans.\\n\\nThe simulation experiments showed that VND values estimated using SIME were both precise and accurate. Data from a pharmacological competition challenge showed that SIME provided VND values that were on average 19% lower than those obtained using the Lassen plot, but similar to values obtained using the Likelihood-Estimation of Occupancy technique. Test-retest data showed that SIME-derived VS values exhibited good reliability and precision, while larger variability was observed in SIME-derived BPND values.\\n\\nThe results support the use of SIME for quantifying specific binding of [11C]PB28, and suggest that VS can be used in preference to, or as a complement to the conventional outcome measure VT. Additional studies in patient cohorts are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Collective behavior, such as shoaling in teleost fish, is driven by the perceptual recognition of conspecific animals. Because social interactions are mutual, it has been difficult to disentangle the exact sensory cues that trigger affiliation in the first place from those that are emitted by receptive and responsive shoal mates. Here we overcome this challenge in a virtual reality assay in zebrafish. We discovered that simple visual features of conspecific biological motion provide an irresistible shoaling cue. Individual juvenile fish interact with circular black dots projected onto a screen, to the same extent as they do with real conspecifics, provided these virtual objects mimic the characteristic kinetics of zebrafish swim bouts. Other naturalistic cues previously implicated in shoaling, such as fish-like shape, pigmentation pattern, or non-visual sensory modalities are not required. During growth, the animals stimulus preferences shift gradually, matching self-like kinetics, even in fish raised in isolation. Virtual group interactions and our multi-agent model implementation of this perceptual mechanism demonstrate sufficiency of kinetic cues to drive assortative shoaling, a phenomenon commonly observed in field studies. Coordinated behavior can emerge from autonomous interactions, such as collective odor avoidance in Drosophila, or from reciprocal interactions, such as the codified turn-taking in wren duet singing. We found that individual zebrafish shoal autonomously without evidence for a reciprocal choreography. Our results reveal individual-level, innate perceptual rules of engagement in mutual affiliation and provide experimental access to the neural mechanisms of social recognition. (239/250 words max)\\n\\nSignificance StatementSocial affiliation is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but fundamental sensory cues driving group formation remain elusive. During swarm behavior, for example, individuals dynamically exchange sensory cues with their neighbors, presenting an intertwined choreography opaque to formal analysis of causal stimulus-response relationships. Using a virtual interaction assay for psychophysical analysis, we solved this issue and identify biological motion as the irresistible trigger of social affiliation in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Given that many species form groups including shoals, flocks and herds, perceptual mechanisms of social recognition and their underlying neural circuits are likely shared across vertebrates. The identification of fundamental affiliation-inducing cues is a prerequisite for relating individual-level sensory-motor transformations to collective behavior. (112/120 words max)",

In this work, we have combined facile nuclear sub-fractionation approaches with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to improve detection and quantification of nuclear proteins in human cells and tissues. Nuclei are isolated and subjected to a series of extraction conditions that enrich for nucleoplasm, euchromatin, heterochromatin and nuclear-membrane associated proteins. Using this approach, we can measure peptides from over 70% of the expressed nuclear proteome. As we are physically separating chromatin compartments prior to analysis, proteins can be assigned into functional chromatin environments to illuminate systems-wide nuclear protein dynamics. The integrity of nuclear sub-compartments were validated with immunofluorescence, which confirms the presence of key markers during chromatin extraction. We then apply this method to study the nuclear proteome-wide response to pharmacological degradation of the BET bromodomain proteins. BET degradation leads to widespread changes in chromatin composition, and we discover global HDAC1/2-mediated remodeling of chromatin previously bound by BET bromodomains. In summary, we have developed a technology for reproducible, comprehensive characterization of the nuclear proteome to observe the systems-wide nuclear protein dynamics.",

The bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing results poses a challenge because it involves many different complex steps. SqueezeMeta is a full automatic pipeline for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support allowing the co-assembly of related metagenomes and the retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features several unique characteristics: Co-assembly procedure or co-assembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps inform about the consistency of contigs and bins. Also, the results are stored in a mySQL database, where they can be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere using a flexible web interface allowing the easy creation of complex queries.\\n\\nWe illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, allowing to retrieve several millions of genes and several hundreds of genomic bins.\\n\\nOne of the motivations in the development of SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable to run in small desktop computers, thus being amenable to all users and all settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer, illustrating the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run without high-performance computing infrastructure. SqueezeMeta is a complete system covering all steps in the analysis of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, capable to work even in scarcity of computational resources. It is therefore adequate for in-situ, real time analysis of metagenomes produced by nanopore sequencing.\\n\\nSqueezeMeta can be downloaded from https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta",

Here we describe redox-induced changes to the structure, dynamics, and function of HSP27 and its conserved -crystallin domain, and provide the first structural characterization of a small heat-shock protein monomer. While HSP27 assembles into oligomers, we show that the transiently populated monomers released upon reduction are highly active chaperones in vitro, but are kinetically unstable and susceptible to uncontrolled aggregation. By using relaxation dispersion and high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we reveal that the pair of {beta}-strands that mediate dimerization become partially disordered in the monomer. Strikingly, we note that numerous HSP27 mutations associated with inherited neuropathies cluster to this unstructured region. The high degree of sequence conservation in the -crystallin domain amongst mammalian sHSPs suggests that partially unfolded monomers may be a general, functional feature of these molecular chaperones.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the nucleus is central in oocytes, not defining the future embryo axis. Nucleus centring depends on an F-actin mediated pressure gradient. In Fmn2-/- oocytes, lacking the F-actin nucleator Formin 2, the nucleus is off-centre and can be centred by re-expressing Formin 2. Here, we addressed the biological significance of nucleus positioning in mammalian oocytes. Using a dedicated computational 3D imaging approach, we observed nuclear architecture alterations in mouse Fmn2-/- oocytes. RNA sequencing of control versus Fmn2-/- oocytes detected 2285 mis-regulated genes. Rescue experiments showed that the process of nuclear positioning impacts nuclear architecture and gene expression. Using signal processing methods coupled to biophysical modelling allowing the extraction of in vivo mechanical properties of the nuclear envelope, we showed that F-actin-mediated activity promotes nuclear envelope shape fluctuations and chromatin motion. We thus propose a mechano-transduction model whereby nucleus positioning via microfilaments modulates oocyte transcriptome, essential for further embryo development.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropic signaling pathways must somehow engender specific cellular responses. In the Drosophila mesoderm, Ras pathway signaling specifies muscle founder cells from among the broader population of myoblasts. For somatic muscles, this is an inductive process mediated by the ETS-domain downstream Ras effectors Pointed and Aop (Yan). We demonstrate here that for the circular visceral muscles, despite superficial similarities, a significantly different specification mechanism is at work. Not only is visceral founder cell specification not dependent on Pointed or Aop, but Ras pathway signaling in its entirety can be bypassed. Our results show that de-repression, not activation, is the predominant role of Ras signaling in the visceral mesoderm and that accordingly, Ras signaling is not required in the absence of repression. The key repressor acts downstream of the transcription factor Lameduck and is likely a member of the ETS transcription factor family. Our findings fit with a growing body of data that point to a complex interplay between the Ras pathway, ETS transcription factors, and enhancer binding as a critical mechanism for determining unique responses to Ras signaling.\\n\\nSUMMARYA fundamentally different mechanism is shown for how Ras signaling governs cell fate specification in the Drosophila somatic versus visceral mesoderms, providing insight into how signaling specificity is achieved.",

    "abstract": "Functional axon regeneration requires regenerating neurons to restore appropriate synaptic connectivity and circuit function. To model this process, we developed a single-neuron assay in C. elegans that links axon regeneration and synapse reformation with recovery of relevant behavior. After axon injury to the DA9 neuron, regeneration restores synapses to their pre-injury location. Surprisingly, presynapses also accumulate in the dendrite. Both axonal and dendritic synapses are functional. Dendritic synapses result in information misrouting that suppresses behavioral recovery. Formation of dendritic synapses is specifically dependent on dynein-mediated transport and jnk-1. However, even when information transfer is corrected, axonal synapses fail to adequately transmit information. Our study reveals unexpected plasticity during functional regeneration. Regeneration of the axon is not sufficient for the reformation of correct neuronal circuits after injury. Rather, synapse reformation and function are also key variables, and manipulation of circuit reformation improves behavioral recovery.",

    "abstract": "A mismatch between top-down expectations and incoming sensory information is thought to be associated with hallucinations across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. In Parkinsons disease with visual hallucinations, abnormal activity within the default network, and its pattern of connectivity with early visual regions, has been identified as a potential pathological source of the internally generated expectations that override incoming sensory input. In the context of attention deficits and visual dysfunction, mental imagery and perceptual expectancies generated across the default network are suggested to exert excessive influence over earlier visual regions, leading to aberrant perceptual experiences. Whilst converging neuroimaging evidence has identified unconstrained default network activity in Parkinsons disease with hallucinations, to date there has been a lack of behavioural evidence to confirm the consequences of an over-engaged default mode network - therefore the contributions it might make to hallucination phenomenology remain speculative. To address this, we administered a validated thought-sampling task to 38 Parkinsons disease patients (18 with hallucinations; 20 without) and 40 controls, to test the hypothesis that individuals with hallucinations experience an increased frequency of mind-wandering - a form of spontaneous cognition strongly associated with mental imagery and default network activity. The neural correlates of mind-wandering frequency were examined in relation to resting-state functional connectivity. Our results showed that patients with hallucinations exhibited significantly higher mind-wandering frequencies compared to non-hallucinators, who in turn had reduced levels of mind-wandering relative to controls. Inter-network connectivity and seed-to-voxel analyses confirmed that increased mind-wandering in the hallucinating vs. non-hallucinating group was associated with greater coupling between the primary visual cortex and dorsal default network. Taken together, both elevated mind-wandering and increased default-visual network coupling emerged as a distinguishing feature of the hallucinatory phenotype. We propose that the finding of increased mind-wandering reflects unconstrained spontaneous thought and mental imagery, which in turn furnish the content of visual hallucinations. Our findings suggest that primary visual cortex to dorsal default network coupling may provide a neural substrate by which regions of the default network exert disproportionate influence over ongoing visual perception. These findings refine current models of visual hallucinations by identifying a specific cognitive phenomenon and neural substrate consistent with the top-down influences over perception that have been implicated in visual hallucinations.",

Experiments in unicellular organisms support the notion that transcriptional heterogeneity can be used to facilitate adaptability to environmental changes and have identified conserved chromatin-associated factors that modulate levels of transcriptional noise. Herein, we show destabilisation of pluripotency-associated gene regulatory networks through increased transcriptional heterogeneity of mouse embryonic stem cells in which paradigmatic histone acetyl-transferase, and candidate noise modulator, Kat2a (yeast orthologue Gcn5) has been inhibited. Functionally, network destabilisation associates with reduced pluripotency and accelerated mesendodermal differentiation, with increased probability of transitions into lineage commitment. Thus, we functionally link transcriptional heterogeneity to cell fate transitions through manipulation of the histone acetylation landscape of mouse embryonic stem cells and establish a general paradigm that could be exploited in other normal and malignant stem cell fate transitions.",

Here we show that the complex dendritic trees of PVD somatosensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans are patterned by distinct pathways downstream of the DMA-1 leucine rich transmembrane (LRR-TM) receptor. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor tiam-1/GEF and act-4/Actin function with the DMA-1/LRR-TM to pattern 4{degrees} higher order branches by localizing F-actin to the distal ends of developing dendrites. Biochemical experiments show that DMA-1/LRR-TM is part of a biochemical complex with TIAM-1/GEF and ACT-4/Actin. Surprisingly, TIAM-1/GEF appears to function independently of Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. Additionally, another pathway dependent on HPO-30/Claudin and TIAM-1/GEF is required for formation of 2{degrees} and 3{degrees} branches. Collectively, our experiments suggest that the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor on PVD dendrites may control aspects of dendrite patterning by directly modulating F-actin dynamics, independently of TIAM-1/GEF enzymatic activity.",

This situation has a historical explanation. In cases of human, mouse, fly, worm and other model organisms there have been large sustained multinational genome sequencing efforts and analysis consortia such as the 1,000 genomes, ENCODE, modENCODE, GTEx and others. These resulted in development and proliferation of common tools, workflows, and data standards. This is not the case in microbiology. After the development of highly parallel sequencing methodologies in mid-2000s bacterial genomes no longer required initiatives of such scale. The flipside of this is the extreme heterogeneity of approaches to many well established microbial genomic analysis problems such as genome assembly. While competition amongst different methods is good, we argue that the quality of data analyses will improve if cutting edge tools are more accessible and microbiologists become more computationally savvy.

Responsive and nominally non-responsive cells contained significant information about sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions, and network modeling indicated that nominally non-responsive cells are important for task performance. Sensory input was more accurately represented in frontal cortex than auditory cortex, via ensembles of nominally non-responsive cells coordinating the behavioral meaning of spike timings on correct but not error trials.

How such extraordinary polymorphism arose and is maintained is controversial. One possibility is heterozygote advantage which can in principle maintain any number of alleles but biologically explicit models based on this mechanism have so far failed to reliably predict the coexistence of significantly more than ten alleles. We present an eco-evolutionary model showing that evolution can in a self-organising process result in the emergence of more than 100 alleles maintained by heterozygote advantage. Thus, our model shows that heterozygote advantage is a much more potent force in explaining the extraordinary polymorphism found at MHC loci than currently recognised. Our model applies more generally and can explain polymorphism at any gene involved in multiple functions important for survival.",

The two predictive techniques behind the proposed ensemble methodology, named ARGONet, utilize (1) a dynamic and self-correcting statistical approach to combine flu-related Google search frequencies, information from electronic health records, and historical trends within a given state, as well as (2) a data-driven network-based approach that leverages spatial and temporal synchronicities observed in historical flu activity across states to improve state-level flu activity estimates. The proposed ensemble approach considerably outperforms each individual method and any previously proposed state-specific method for flu tracking, with higher correlations and lower prediction errors.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) are higher in the rural regions of Bangladesh compared to the urban areas or the national average. These two rates could be reduced by increasing use of skilled birth attendance in rural regions of this country. Although the majority of Bangladeshi population lives in rural areas, there has been a little investigation of the practices and determinants of delivery attendance in this region of Bangladesh. This study investigated the practices and determinants of attendance during child-births in rural Bangladesh.\\n\\nMethodsData were collected by the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS 2014). After reporting the distribution of deliveries by types of attendance and distribution of selected factors, logistic regression was applied to calculate the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values.\\n\\nResultsMore than half of the deliveries (53.1%) were conducted by traditional attendants; community skilled attendants were present in only a small number of deliveries. The following factors were positively associated with deliveries by skilled attendants: 25-34 years age group of women (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.8), a higher education level of women (AOR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.7-4.9), or their husbands (AOR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.6-3.7), receiving antenatal care (AOR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.6-2.7), and higher wealth quintiles (AOR of the richest wealth quintile vs the poorest: 3.5; 95% CI: 2.3-5.3). On the other hand, women having a higher parity (i.e., number of pregnancy, [&ge;]2) led to a lower likelihood of delivery by skilled birth attendants. The proportion of deliveries attended by skilled attendants was significantly lower in the other six divisions compared to Khulna.\\n\\nConclusionsSocioeconomic factors should be considered to design future interventions to increase the proportion of deliveries attended by skilled delivery attendants. Awareness programs are required in rural areas to highlight the importance of skilled attendants. Further re-evaluation of the community skilled birth attendants program is required.",

    "abstract": "From mid-2015 to the end of January 2016, 47 cases of microcephaly were observed in the city of Rio de Janeiro, that were not due to other viral infections (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, herpes & cytomegalovirus). These children were conceived from Dec 2014 to April 2015, far too early to be explained by the officially recorded cases from October 2015 onward. Zika must have been rampant in the city from late 2014 onward. In the first half of the paper we study how the geographic spread of microcephaly cases evolved from mid-2015 to January 2016 (and hence Zika 6-9 months earlier). Cases were not evenly spread in proportion to the number of births; they were preferentially located in the northern suburbs apparently following the public transport routes, with virtually no cases in favelas and none in the southern suburbs (Zona Sul). One key difference between the transport systems in the northern and southern suburbs is that the metro & rail system in the north is above ground in the north whereas in the southern part the metro is underground with air-conditioning in carriages and forced ventilation on the platforms. The train system does not extend to Zona Sul.\\n\\nIn the second half of the paper we postulate that the air-conditioning and ventilation prevent mosquitos from biting people who are waiting on platforms in Zona Sul. Agent-based simulations are used to test this hypothesis. After confirming this, we postulate that providing air-conditioning and/or forced ventilation on the rail-metro transport hub in the city center (Centro) would significantly delay the propagation of arboviruses in the city, possibly preventing epidemics. One advantage of this proposal is that it does not require the use of insecticides.",
