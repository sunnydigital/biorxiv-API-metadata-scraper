    "abstract": "Many important gram-negative bacterial pathogens use highly sophisticated type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to establish complex host-pathogen interactions. Bacterial-host cell contact triggers the activation of the T3SS and the subsequent insertion of a translocon pore into the target cell membrane, which serves as a conduit for the passage of effector proteins. Therefore the initial interaction between T3SS-bearing bacteria and host cells is the critical step in the deployment of the protein secretion machine, yet this process remains poorly understood. Here, we use high-throughput cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the T3SS-mediated Salmonella-host cell interface. Our analysis reveals the intact translocon at an unprecedented level of resolution, its deployment in the host cell membrane, and the establishment of an intimate association between the bacteria and the target cells, which is essential for effector translocation. Our studies provide critical data supporting the long postulated direct injection model for effector translocation.",

    "abstract": "Cell elongation in rod-shaped bacteria is mediated by the Rod system, a conserved morphogenic complex that spatially controls cell wall (CW) assembly. In Escherichia coli, alterations in a CW synthase component of the system called PBP2 were identified that overcome other inactivating defects. Rod system activity was stimulated in the suppressors in vivo, and purified synthase complexes with these changes showed more robust CW synthesis in vitro. Polymerization of the actin-like MreB component of the Rod system was also found to be enhanced in cells with the activated synthase. The results suggest an activation pathway governing Rod system function in which PBP2 conformation plays a central role in stimulating both CW glycan polymerization by its partner RodA and the formation of cytoskeletal filaments of MreB to orient CW assembly. An analogous activation pathway involving similar enzymatic components is likely responsible for controlling CW synthesis by the division machinery.",

To this end, we are developing a metagenomics-based life-detection instrument which integrates nucleic acid extraction and nanopore sequencing: The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Genomes (SETG). Our goal is to isolate and sequence nucleic acids from extant or preserved life on Mars in order to determine if a particular genetic sequence (1) is distantly-related to life on Earth indicating a shared-ancestry due to lithological exchange, or (2) is unrelated to life on Earth suggesting a convergent origin of life on Mars. In this study, we validate prior work on nucleic acid extraction from cells deposited in Mars analog soils down to microbial concentrations observed in the driest and coldest regions on Earth. In addition, we report low-input nanopore sequencing results equivalent to 1 ppb life-detection sensitivity achieved by employing carrier sequencing, a method of sequencing sub-nanogram DNA in the background of a genomic carrier.",

    "abstract": "Theories of mental context and memory posit that successful mental context reinstatement enables better retrieval of memories from the same context, at the expense of memories from other contexts. To test this hypothesis, we had participants study lists of words, interleaved with task-irrelevant images from one category (e.g., scenes). Following encoding, participants were cued to mentally reinstate the context associated with a particular list, by thinking about the images that had appeared between the words. We measured context reinstatement with fMRI, and related this to performance on a free recall test that followed immediately afterwards. To increase sensitivity, we used a closed-loop neurofeedback procedure, whereby higher levels of context reinstatement (measured neurally) elicited increased visibility of the images from the studied context onscreen. Our goal was to create a positive feedback loop that amplified small fluctuations in mental context reinstatement, making it easier to experimentally detect a relationship between context reinstatement and recall. As predicted, we found that higher levels of neural context reinstatement were associated with better recall of words from the reinstated context, and worse recall of words from a different context. In a second experiment, we assessed the role of neurofeedback in identifying this brain-behavior relationship by presenting context images again but manipulating whether their visibility depended on neural context reinstatement. When neurofeedback was removed, the relationship between context reinstatement and memory retrieval disappeared. Together, these findings demonstrate a clear effect of context reinstatement on memory recall and suggest that neurofeedback can be a useful tool for characterizing brain-behavior relationships.\\n\\nAbbreviated titleNeurofeedback context",

    "abstract": "Saccades are ballistic eye movements that rapidly shift gaze from one location of visual space to another. Detecting saccades in eye movement recordings is important not only for studying the neural mechanisms underlying sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, but also as a clinical and diagnostic tool. However, automatically detecting saccades can be difficult, particularly when such saccades are generated in coordination with other tracking eye movements, like smooth pursuits, or when the saccade amplitude is close to eye tracker noise levels, like with microsaccades. In such cases, labeling by human experts is required, but this is a tedious task prone to variability and error. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect saccades at human-level performance accuracy. Our algorithm surpasses state of the art according to common performance metrics, and will facilitate studies of neurophysiological processes underlying saccade generation and visual processing.",

    "abstract": "The human visual system supports stable percepts of object color even though the light that reflects from object surfaces varies significantly with the scene illumination. To understand the computations that support stable color perception, we study how estimating a target objects luminous reflectance factor (LRF; a measure of the light reflected from the object under a standard illuminant) depends on variation in key properties of naturalistic scenes. Specifically, we study how variation in target object reflectance, illumination spectra, and the reflectance of back-ground objects in a scene impact estimation of a target objects LRF. To do this, we applied supervised statistical learning methods to the simulated excitations of human cone photoreceptors, obtained from labeled naturalistic images. The naturalistic images were rendered with computer graphics. The illumination spectra of the light sources and the reflectance spectra of the surfaces in the scene were generated using statistical models of natural spectral variation. Optimally decoding target object LRF from the responses of a small learned set of task-specific linear receptive fields that operate on a contrast representation of the cone excitations yields estimates that are within 13% of the correct LRF. Our work provides a framework for evaluating how different sources of scene variability limit performance on luminance constancy.",

Prefrontal (PFC) and motor cortex (MC) blood flow was recorded by fNIRS (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) while the human subjects performed the Stroop tasks before and after 30 minutes of exercise or equivalent time of rest (controlling for practice effect of repeating the Stroop task multiple times). It was predicted that PFC blood flow increase after exercise will correlate with increased Stroop interference and decreased cognitive flexibility after an acute bout of aerobic exercise at 70% of maximal Heart Rate (HR). We observed that Stroop interference in aerobic exercise and practice alone (rest) were not significantly (p>0.6) different indicating that exercise did not improve cognition above the learning effect. Increase in blood flow (both neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling) in previously deactivated PFC channels was positively correlated (p<0.05) to increased Stroop interference (worse cognitive speed and accuracy) after an acute bout of aerobic exercise.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDoes moderate intensity aerobic exercise improve cognition?\\nC_LIO_LIDoes prefrontal cortex oxygenation correlate with cognition changes after exercise?\\nC_LI",

However, the neural mechanisms responsible for the improvements are unknown. The literature describes healthy individuals with an increase in alpha power and a decrease in alpha frequency after eight weeks of mindfulness meditation, but it is unknown if changes are similar amongst individuals with PG. Using resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG), we measured the changes in alpha oscillations before and after an eight-week mindfulness meditation intervention (MMi) and a pre/ post-five-minute mindfulness meditation body scan (MMb). For people with PG, we observed an increase in alpha power and decreased alpha peak frequency after the MMi, while the inverse was true for the MMb. The most considerable alpha rhythm changes occurred in the frontal and temporal lobes, areas sensitive to reward and sensory processing in PG. Our observed changes may reflect theories that MMi for PG may improve attentional control as hypothesized by previous research in alpha oscillations and cue-reward processing.",

    "abstract": "Participation in a MRI scan is associated with increased anxiety, thus possibly impacting baseline recording for functional MRI studies. We investigated in 23 healthy individuals without any former MRI experience (scanner-naive) the relations between anxiety, 0.1-Hz BOLD oscillations and heart rate variability (HRV) in two separate resting state sessions (R1, R2). BOLD signals were recorded from precentral gyrus (PCG) and insula in both hemispheres. Phase-locking and time delays were computed in the frequency band 0.07-0.13 Hz. Positive (pTD) and negative time delays (nTD) were found. The pTD characterize descending neural BOLD oscillations spreading from PCG to insula and nTD characterize ascending vascular BOLD oscillations related to blood flow in the middle cerebral artery. HRV power in two low frequency bands 0.06-0.1 Hz and 0.1-0.14 Hz was computed. Based on the drop rate of the anxiety level from R1 to R2, two groups could be identified: one with a strong anxiety decline (large drop group) and one with a moderate decline or even anxiety increase (small drop group). A significant correlation was found only between the left-hemispheric time delay (pTD, nTD) of BOLD oscillations and anxiety drop, with a dominance of nTD in the large drop group. The analysis of within-scanner HRV revealed a pronounced increase of low frequency power between both resting states, dominant in the band 0.06-0.1 Hz in the large drop group and in the band 0.1-0.14 Hz in the small drop group. These results suggest different mechanisms related to anxiety processing in healthy individuals. One mechanism (large drop group) could embrace an increase of blood circulation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (vascular BOLD) and another (small drop group) translates to rhythmic central commands (neural BOLD) in the frequency band 0.1-0.14 Hz.",

Targeted validation was performed in vitro across two bladder cancer cell lines. The top gene candidate was validated in a publicly available bladder cancer dataset containing 340 bladder cancer patients with treatment, protein, and survival information.\\n\\nResults and limitationsThe cisplatin resistance screen suggested the mismatch repair pathway through the loss of MSH2 and MLH1 contribute to cisplatin resistance. Bladder cancer cells depleted of MSH2 are resistant to cisplatin in vitro, in part due to a reduction in apoptosis. These cells maintain sensitivity to the cisplatin-analog, oxaliplatin. Bladder tumors with low protein levels of MSH2 have poorer overall survival when treated with cisplatin- or carboplatin-based therapy.\\n\\nConclusionsWe generated in vitro and clinical support that bladder cancer cell lines and tumors with low levels of MSH2 are more resistant to cisplatin-based therapy. Further studies are warranted to determine the ability of MSH2 protein levels to serve as a prospective biomarker of chemotherapy response in bladder cancer.\\n\\nPatient summaryWe report the first evidence that the protein level of MSH2 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance observed in bladder cancer.

    "abstract": "Newly emerged wheat blast disease is a serious threat to global wheat production. Wheat blast is caused by a distinct, exceptionally diverse lineage of the fungus causing rice blast disease. To understand genetic diversity in wheat-infecting strains, we report a near-finished reference genome of a recent field isolate generated using long read sequencing and a novel scaffolding approach with long-distance paired genomic sequences. The genome assemblage includes seven core chromosomes and sequences from a dispensable mini-chromosome that harbors effector genes normally found on the ends of core chromosomes in other strains. No mini-chromosomes were observed in an early field strain, and two mini-chromosomes from another field isolate each contain different effector homologous genes and core chromosome end sequences. The mini-chromosome is highly repetitive and is enriched in transposons occurring most frequently at core chromosome ends. Additionally, transposons in mini-chromosomes lack the characteristic signature for inactivation by repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation genome defenses. Our results, collectively, indicate that dispensable mini-chromosomes and non-dispensable core chromosomes undergo divergent evolutionary trajectories, and mini-chromosomes and core chromosome ends are coupled as a mobile, fast-evolving effector compartment in the wheat pathogen genome.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe emerging blast disease on wheat is proving even harder to control than the ancient, still-problematic rice blast disease. Potential wheat resistance identified using strains isolated soon after disease emergence are no longer effective in controlling recent aggressive field isolates from wheat in South America and South Asia. We report that recent wheat pathogens can contain one or two highly-variable conditionally-dispensable mini-chromosomes, each with an amalgamation of effector sequences that are duplicated or absent from pathogen core chromosome ends. Well-studied effectors found on different core chromosomes in rice pathogens appear side-by-side in wheat pathogen mini-chromosomes. The rice pathogen often overcomes deployed resistance genes by deleting triggering effector genes. Localization of effectors on mini-chromosomes, which are unstably transmitted during growth, would accelerate pathogen adaptation in the field.",

However, we show here that ITK, a positive regulator of TCR signaling, negatively tunes CD8+ T cell HP, metabolism, and effector function. Under lymphopenic environments, Itk-/- CD8+ T cells exhibit significant increase in T cell-intrinsic HP, which requires mTOR activity and can be driven by T cell-T cell interaction. TCR signals through ITK tune IL-7-mediated CD8+ T cell metabolism and HP in a mTOR-dependent manner. The lack of ITK also resulted in enhanced effector cell fate programming, antigen sensitivity and anti-tumor immunity by HP cells. Thus, TCR signaling via ITK, is a negative tuner of CD8+ T cell homeostasis, metabolism and effector function, and may be a target for clinical benefit in cancer therapy.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryTCR signal strength had been long-thought to be proportional to T cell proliferation and effector function, here we demonstrate a counterintuitive role of the TCR signaling through ITK in negatively tuning proliferation under lymphopenic conditions via regulating mTOR activity, T cell metabolism, proliferation, and effector function.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) must not only bind to their target but must also be free from 'developability issues', such as poor stability or high levels of aggregation. While small molecule drug discovery benefits from Lipinski's rule of five to guide the selection of molecules with appropriate biophysical properties, there is currently no in silico analog for antibody design. Here, we model the variable domain structures of a large set of post-Phase I clinical-stage antibody therapeutics (CSTs), and calculate an array of metrics to estimate their typical properties. In each case, we contextualize the CST distribution against a snapshot of the human antibody gene repertoire. We describe guideline values for five metrics thought to be implicated in poor developability: the total length of the Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs), the extent and magnitude of surface hydrophobicity, positive charge and negative charge in the CDRs, and asymmetry in the net heavy and light chain surface charges. The guideline cut-offs for each property were derived from the values seen in CSTs, and a flagging system is proposed to identify nonconforming candidates. On two mAb drug discovery sets, we were able to selectively highlight sequences with developability issues. We make available the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP), an open-source computational tool that builds downloadable homology models of variable domain sequences, tests them against our five developability guidelines, and reports potential sequence liabilities and canonical forms.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWhen listening to speech, the brain tracks the speech envelope. It is possible to reconstruct this envelope from EEG recordings. However, in people who hear using a cochlear implant (CI), the artifacts caused by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve contaminate the EEG. This causes the decoder to produce an artifact-dominated reconstruction, which does not reflect the neural signal processing. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a method for assessing the neural tracking of speech envelope in CI users.\\n\\nApproachTo obtain EEG recordings free of stimulus artifacts, the electrical stimulation is periodically in-terrupted. During these stimulation gaps, artifact-free EEG can be sampled and used to train a linear envelope decoder. Different recording conditions were used to characterize the artifacts and their influence on the envelope reconstruction.\\n\\nMain resultsThe present study demonstrates for the first time that neural tracking of the speech envelope can be measured in response to ongoing electrical stimulation. The responses were validated to be truly neural and not affected by stimulus artifact.\\n\\nSignificanceBesides applications in audiology and neuroscience, the characterization and elimination of stimulus artifacts will enable future EEG studies involving continuous speech in CI users. Measures of neural tracking of the speech envelope reflect interesting properties of the listeners perception of speech, such as speech intelligibility or attentional state. Successful decoding of neural envelope tracking will open new possibilities to investigate the neural mechanisms of speech perception with a CI.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) are involved in uric acid excretion in humans and mice. Despite evidence suggesting that chicken renal proximal tubular epithelial cells participate in uric acid secretion, the roles of BCRP and MRP4 in chickens remain unclear. This study evaluated the relationship between chicken BCRP and MRP4 expression and renal function in the liver, kidneys, and intestines. Sixty 20-day-old Isa brown laying hens were randomly divided into four groups: a control group (NC) and groups provided with sulfonamide-treated drinking water (SD), a diet supplemented with fishmeal (FM), and an intraperitoneal injection of uric acid (IU). Serum uric acid, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were significantly higher in the SD and IU groups than in the NC group. BCRP and MRP4 levels in the SD and IU groups were significantly increased in the kidneys and ileum and decreased in the liver. In the FM group, BCRP and MRP4 were significantly increased in the kidneys and slightly increased in the ileum. These results demonstrate that chicken BCRP and MRP4 are involved in renal and intestinal uric acid excretion. When renal function is impaired, serum uric acid increased and BCRP and MRP4 in the liver, kidneys, and ileum exhibit compensatory increases; when renal function is normal, serum uric acid changes have no effect on ileum BCRP and MRP4 expression. Therefore, this study may provide the references to the uric acid regulation in human.",

    "abstract": "The degree to which supra-threshold hearing deficits affect speech recognition in noise is poorly understood. To clarify the role of hearing sensitivity in different stimulus frequency ranges, and to test the contribution of low- and high-pass speech information to broadband speech recognition, we collected speech reception threshold (SRTs) for low-pass (LP < 1.5 kHz), high-pass (HP > 1.6 kHz) and broadband (BB) speech-in-noise stimuli in 34 listeners. Two noise types with similar long-term spectra were considered: stationary (SSN) and temporally modulated noise (ICRA5-250). Irrespective of the tested listener group (i.e., young normal-hearing, older normal- or impaired-hearing), the BB SRT performance was strongly related to the LP SRT. The encoding of LP speech information was different for SSN and ICRA5-250 noise but similar for HP speech, suggesting a single noise-type invariant coding mechanism for HP speech. Masking release was observed for all filtered conditions and related to the ICRA5-250 SRT. Lastly, the role of hearing sensitivity to the SRT was studied using the speech intelligibility index (SII), which failed to predict the SRTs for the filtered speech conditions and for the older normal-hearing listeners. This suggests that supra-threshold hearing deficits are important contributors to the SRT of older normal-hearing listeners.",

    "abstract": "Libraries of highly annotated small molecules have many uses in chemical genetics, drug discovery and drug repurposing. Many such libraries have become available, but few data-driven approaches exist to compare these libraries and design new ones. In this paper, we describe such an approach that makes use of data on binding selectivity, target coverage and induced cellular phenotypes as well as chemical structure and stage of clinical development. We implement the approach as R software and a Web-accessible tool (http://www.smallmoleculesuite.org) that uses incomplete and often confounded public data in combination with user preferences to score and create libraries. Analysis of six kinase inhibitor libraries using our approach reveals dramatic differences among them, leading us to design a new LSP-OptimalKinase library that outperforms all previous collections in terms of target coverage and compact size. We also assemble a mechanism of action library that optimally covers 1852 targets of the liganded genome. Using our tools, individual research groups and companies can quickly analyze private compound collections and public libraries can be progressively improved using the latest data.",
