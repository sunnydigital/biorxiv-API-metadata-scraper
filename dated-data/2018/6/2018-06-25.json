    "abstract": "The existence of a common beauty is a long-standing debate in philosophy and related disciplines. In the last two decades, cognitive neuroscientists have sought to elucidate this issue by exploring the common neural basis of the experience of beauty. Still, empirical evidence for such common neural basis of different forms of beauty is not conclusive. To address this question, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing neuroimaging studies of beauty appreciation of faces and visual art by non-expert adults (49 studies, 982 participants, meta-data are available at https://osf.io/s9xds/). We observed that perceiving these two forms of beauty activated distinct brain regions: while the beauty of faces convergently activated the left ventral striatum, the beauty of visual art convergently activated the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC). However, a conjunction analysis failed to reveal any common brain regions for the beauty of visual art and faces. The implications of these results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity is important to biological processes, including cancer and development. However, proteome heterogeneity is largely unexplored because of the limitations of existing methods for quantifying protein levels in single cells. To alleviate these limitations, we developed Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), and validated its ability to identify distinct human cancer cell types based on their proteomes. We used SCoPE-MS to quantify over a thousand proteins in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled us to deconstruct cell populations and infer protein abundance relationships. Comparison between single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes indicated coordinated mRNA and protein covariation. Yet many genes exhibited functionally concerted and distinct regulatory patterns at the mRNA and the protein levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms contribute to proteome remodeling during lineage specification, especially for developmental genes. SCoPE-MS is broadly applicable to measuring proteome configurations of single cells and linking them to functional phenotypes, such as cell type and differentiation potentials.",

    "abstract": "We investigate whether there is information in gene expression levels in blood that predicts breast cancer metastasis. Our data comes from the NOWAC epidemiological cohort study where blood samples were provided at enrollment. This could be anywhere from years to weeks before any cancer diagnosis. When and if a cancer is diagnosed, it could be so in different ways: at a screening, between screenings, or in the clinic, outside of the screening program. To build predictive models we propose that variable selection should include followup time and stratify by detection method. We show by simulations that this improves the probability of selecting relevant predictor genes. We also demonstrate that it leads to improved predictions and more stable gene signatures in our data. There is some indication that blood gene expression levels hold predictive information about metastasis. With further development such information could be used for early detection of metastatic potential and as such aid in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma exhibits profound intratumoral heterogeneity in blood perfusion, which may cause inconsistent therapy response. Particularly, low perfusion may create hypoxic microenvironment and induce resistant clones. Thus, developing validated imaging approaches that define low perfusion compartments is crucial for clinical management.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 112 newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma patients were prospectively recruited for maximal safe resection. Preoperative MRI included anatomical, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated from DTI and DSC respectively. Using thresholding methods, two low perfusion compartments (ADCH-rCBVL and ADCL-rCBVL) were identified. Volumetric analysis was performed. Lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels were determined from multivoxel spectroscopy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.\\n\\nResultsTwo compartments displayed higher lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels than normal controls (each P < 0.001), suggesting hypoxic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The proportional volume of ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a larger infiltration area (P < 0.001, rho = 0.42). Lower lactate in this compartment was associated with a less invasive phenotype visualized on DTI. Multivariate Cox regression showed higher lactate level in the ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a worse survival (PFS: HR 2.995, P = 0.047; OS: HR 4.974, P = 0.005).\\n\\nConclusionsThe ADCL-rCBVL compartment represent a treatment resistant sub-region associated with glioblastoma invasiveness. This approach was based on clinically available imaging modalities and could thus provide crucial pretreatment information for clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of multi-cellular animals has produced a conspicuous trend toward increased body size. This trend has introduced at least two novel problems: an elevated risk of somatic disorders, such as cancer, and declining evolvability due to reduced population size, lower reproduction rate and extended generation time. Low population size is widely recognized to explain the high mutation rates in animals by limiting the presumed universally negative selection acting on mutation rates. Here, we present evidence from stochastic modeling that the direction and strength of selection acting on mutation rates is highly dependent on the evolution of somatic maintenance, and thus longevity, which modulates the cost of somatic mutations. We argue that this mechanism may have been critical in facilitating animal evolution.",

    "abstract": "The causes and consequences of spatiotemporal variation in mutation rates remains to be explored in nearly all organisms. Here we examine relationships between local mutation rates and replication timing in three bacterial species whose genomes have multiple chromosomes: Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio cholerae, and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Following five evolution experiments with these bacteria conducted in the near-absence of natural selection, the genomes of clones from each lineage were sequenced and analyzed to identify variation in mutation rates and spectra. In lineages lacking mismatch repair, base-substitution mutation rates vary in a mirrored wave-like pattern on opposing replichores of the large chromosome of V. fischeri and V. cholerae, where concurrently replicated regions experience similar base-substitution mutation rates. The base-substitution mutation rates on the small chromosome are less variable in both species but occur at similar rates as the concurrently replicated regions of the large chromosome. Neither nucleotide composition nor frequency of nucleotide motifs differed among regions experiencing high and low base-substitution rates, which along with the inferred ~800 Kb wave period suggests that the source of the periodicity is not sequence-specific but rather a systematic process related to the cell cycle. These results support the notion that base-substitution mutation rates are likely to vary systematically across many bacterial genomes, which exposes certain genes to elevated deleterious mutational load.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the development of algorithms to detect neuronal spiking activity from two-photon calcium imaging data has received much attention. Meanwhile, few researchers have examined the metrics used to assess the similarity of detected spike trains with the ground truth. We highlight the limitations of the two most commonly used metrics, the spike train correlation and success rate, and propose an alternative, which we refer to as CosMIC. Rather than operating on the true and estimated spike trains directly, the proposed metric assesses the similarity of the pulse trains obtained from convolution of the spike trains with a smoothing pulse. The pulse width, which is derived from the statistics of the imaging data, reflects the temporal tolerance of the metric. The final metric score is the size of the commonalities of the pulse trains as a fraction of their average size. Viewed through the lens of set theory, CosMIC resembles a continuous Sorensen-Dice coefficient -- an index commonly used to assess the similarity of discrete, presence/absence data. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed metric to discriminate the precision and recall of spike train estimates. Unlike the spike train correlation, which appears to reward overestimation, the proposed metric score is maximised when the correct number of spikes have been detected. Furthermore, we show that CosMIC is more sensitive to the temporal precision of estimates than the success rate.",

The SPT-window derived from the algorithm was 10.9 and 2.9 minutes longer compared with sleep diary in men and women, respectively. Mean C-statistic to detect the SPT-window compared to polysomnography was 0.86 and 0.83 in clinic-based and healthy sleepers, respectively. We demonstrated the accuracy of our algorithm to detect the SPT-window. The value of this algorithm lies in studies such as UK Biobank where a sleep diary was not used.",

However, whether hippocampal spatial coding resolution can be dynamically controlled within and between environments is unknown. In this work we recorded the firing of hippocampal principal cells in mice navigating virtual reality environments, which differed by the presence of local visual cues (virtual 3D objects). Objects improved spatial coding resolution globally with a higher proportion of place cells, smaller place fields, increased spatial selectivity and stability. Spatial coding resolution was notably enhanced locally near objects and could be rapidly tuned by their manipulations. In the presence of objects, place cells also displayed improved theta phase precession and theta timescale spike coordination. These results suggest that local visual cues can rapidly tune the resolution of the hippocampal mapping system within and between environments.",

However, over half of advanced ER-positive breast cancers are intrinsically resistant to tamoxifen and about 40% will acquire the resistance during the treatment.\\n\\nMethodsIn order to explore mechanisms underlying endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer and to identify new therapeutic opportunities, we created tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines that represent the luminal A or the luminal B. Gene expression patterns revealed by RNA-sequencing in seven tamoxifen-resistant variants were compared with their isogenic parental cells. We further examined those transcriptomic alterations in a publicly available patient cohort.\\n\\nResultsWe show that tamoxifen resistance cannot simply be explained by altered expression of individual genes, common mechanism across all resistant variants, or the appearance of new fusion genes. Instead, the resistant cell lines shared altered gene expression patterns associated with cell cycle, protein modification and metabolism, especially with the cholesterol pathway. In the tamoxifen-resistant T-47D cell variants we observed a striking increase of neutral lipids in lipid droplets as well as an accumulation of free cholesterol in the lysosomes. Tamoxifen-resistant cells were also less prone to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and not vulnerable to compounds targeting the lipid metabolism. However, the cells were sensitive to disulfiram, LCS-1, and dasatinib.\\n\\nConclusionAltogether, our findings highlight a major role of LMP prevention in tamoxifen resistance, and suggest novel drug vulnerabilities associated with this phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Lipid bilayers and lipid-associated proteins play a crucial role in biology. As in vivo studies and manipulation are inherently difficult, several membrane-mimetic systems have been developed to enable investigation of lipidic phases, lipid-protein interactions, membrane protein function and membrane structure in vitro. Controlling the size and shape, or site-specific functionalization is, however, difficult to achieve with established membrane mimetics based on membrane scaffolding proteins, polymers or peptides. In this work, we describe a route to leverage the unique programmability of DNA nanotechnology and create DNA-encircled bilayers (DEBs), which are made of multiple copies of an alkylated oligonucleotide hybridized to a single-stranded minicircle. To stabilize the hydrophobic rim of the lipid bilayer, and to prevent formation of lipid vesicles, we introduced up to 2 alkyl chains per helical that point to the inside of the toroidal DNA ring and interact with the hydrophobic side chains of the encapsulated lipid bilayer. The DEB approach described herein provides unprecedented control of size, and allows the orthogonal functionalizations and arrangement of engineered membrane nanoparticles and will become a valuable tool for biophysical investigation of lipid phases and lipid-associated proteins and complexes including structure determination of membrane proteins and pharmacological screenings of membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm in ecological studies of viruses and their microbial hosts is that the reproductive success of viruses depends on the proliferation of the \\\"predator\\\", i.e., the virus particle. Yet, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, and the virus genome - the actual unit of selection - can persist and proliferate from one cell generation to the next without lysis or the production of new virus particles. Here, we propose a theoretical framework to quantify the invasion fitness of viruses using an epidemiological cell-centric metric that focuses on the proliferation of viral genomes inside cells instead of virus particles outside cells. This cell-centric metric enables direct comparison of viral strategies characterized by obligate killing of hosts (e.g., via lysis), persistence of viral genomes inside hosts (e.g., via lysogeny), and strategies along a continuum between these extremes (e.g., via chronic infections). As a result, we can identify environmental drivers, life history traits, and key feedbacks that govern variation in viral propagation in nonlinear population models. For example, we identify threshold conditions given relatively low densities of susceptible cells and relatively high growth rates of infected cells in which lysogenic and other chronic strategies have higher potential viral reproduction than lytic strategies. Altogether, the theoretical framework helps unify the ongoing study of eco-evolutionary drivers of viral strategies in natural environments.",

Ellagic acid can induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of various cancer cell types in vitro and in vivo. As such, ellagic acid has attracted significant interest as a potential chemotherapeutic compound. One mechanism by which ellagic acid has been proposed to affect cellular physiology is by regulating metabolic pathways. Here we show the dose-dependent effects of ellagic acid on cellular energy production and downstream induction of the apoptotic program in HEK293, HeLa, MCF7, and HepG2 cells. At physiologically relevant doses, eallgic acid has pleiotropic and cell-type specific effects on mitochondrial function. At high doses ellagic acid can also influence glycolytic pathways and induce cell death. Our results demonstrate that ellagic acid can influence mitochondrial function at therapeutically relevant concentrations. The observed effects of ellagic acid on cellular respiration are complex and cell type-specific, which may limit the chemotherapeutic utility of this compound.",

    "abstract": "The impact of infectious disease is often very different in juveniles and adults, but theory has focused on the drivers of stage-dependent defense in hosts rather than the potential for stage-dependent virulence evolution. Stage-structure has the potential to be important to the evolution of pathogens because it exposes parasites to heterogeneous environments in terms of both host characteristics and transmission routes. We develop a stage-structured (juvenile-adult) epidemiological model and examine the evolutionary outcomes of stage-specific virulence under the classic assumption of a transmission-virulence trade-off. We show that selection on virulence against adults remains consistent with the classic theory. However, the evolution of juvenile virulence is sensitive to both demography and transmission pathway with higher virulence against juveniles being favored either when the transmission pathway is assortative (juveniles preferentially interact together) and the juvenile stage is short, or in contrast when the transmission pathway is disassortative and the juvenile stage is long. These results highlight the potentially profound effects of host stage-structure on determining parasite virulence in nature. This new perspective may have broad implications for both understanding and managing disease severity.\n\nImpact summaryUnderstanding the evolution of parasite virulence remains one of the most important questions in evolutionary ecology. Virulence is often very different in young and old hosts, but previous theory has presumed that these differences are attributed to adaptation in host defense rather than parasite adaptation. However, stage-structure within host populations can expose parasites to heterogeneous environments, which may lead to differential selection on parasite virulence (stage-specific virulence). Surprisingly, no study has investigated the effects of hosts stage-structure on the evolution of stage-specific virulence. We present a theoretical analysis to examine when selection can favor higher virulence against juveniles (juvenile-virulence) versus adults (adult-virulence). Our key result is that higher juvenile-virulence is selected for either when the transmission is assortative within age classes and maturation is slow, or when the transmission is disassortative (occurring predominantly between-classes) and maturation is relatively fast. These at first sight contrasting outcomes can be understood as adaptation to the exploitation of the more available host stage. Although the data on assortativity in infectious disease systems is limited, empirical studies for the virulence of Great Island Virus in guillemots (Uria aalge) and for salmon louse in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are consistent with our predictions. Our work provides testable predictions for stage-specific virulence and presents a novel mechanism that may explain variation in virulence in nature. There are also management implications for conservation, public health, vaccination programs, and farming to understanding the drivers of stage dependent virulence.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTaxonomic classification is at the core of environmental DNA analysis. When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, phylogenetic placement (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree. This is useful whenever precision is sought (e.g. in diagnostics). However,likelihood-based PP algorithms struggle to scale with the ever-increasing throughput of DNA sequencing.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach, removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers that may be present with non-negligible probability in relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than competing likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads. RAPPAS scales PP for the era of routine metagenomic diagnostics.\\n\\nAvailabilityProgram and sources freely available for download at gite.lirmm.fr/linard/RAPPAS.\\n\\nContactbenjamin.linard@lirmm.fr",

The lipid kinases and phosphatases regulating PIP3 levels are described but mechanisms controlling their activity remain unclear. We report that in Drosophila, phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K) function at the plasma membrane is required for normal PIP3 levels during insulin receptor activation. Depletion of PIP4K increases PIP3 levels and augments sensitivity to insulin through enhanced Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Animals lacking PIP4K show enhanced insulin signalling dependent phenotypes in vivo and are resistant to the metabolic consequences of a high-sugar diet, highlighting the importance of PIP4K in normal metabolism and development. Thus, PIP4KS are key regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase signalling with implications for growth factor dependent processes including tumour growth, T-cell activation and metabolism.",

Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short- and long-term memory interactions (STM, LTM) for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multi-area spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parieto-temporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain and update multi-modal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multi-modal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an \\\"index\\\" in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby reactivate the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern-completes the associated un-cued item via PFC. The PFC-STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive thereby gradually over-writing older representations.",

    "abstract": "Insect specific viruses (ISVs) of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti have been demonstrated to modulate transmission of arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus by the mosquito. The diversity and composition of the virome of Ae. aegypti, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterised Aedes anphevirus (AeAV), a negative-sense RNA virus from the order Mononegavirales. AeAV identified from Aedes cell lines were infectious to both Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus cells, but not to three mammalian cell lines. To understand the incidence and genetic diversity of AeAV, we assembled 17 coding-complete and two partial genomes of AeAV from available RNA-Seq data. AeAV appears to transmit vertically and be present in laboratory colonies, wild-caught mosquitoes and cell lines worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of AeAV strains indicates that as the Ae. aegypti mosquito has expanded into the Americas and Asia-Pacific, AeAV has evolved into monophyletic African, American and Asia-Pacific lineages. The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis restricts positive-sense RNA viruses in Ae. aegypti. Re-analysis of a small RNA library of Ae. aegypti cells co-infected with AeAV and Wolbachia produces an abundant RNAi response consistent with persistent virus replication. We found Wolbachia enhances replication of AeAV when compared to a tetracycline cleared cell line, and AeAV modestly reduces DENV replication in vitro. The results from our study improve understanding of the diversity and evolution of the virome of Ae. aegypti and adds to previous evidence that shows Wolbachia does not restrict a range of negative strand RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Human endeavors to meet social and economic water needs at national scale might cause negative environmental manifestations and water stress from local to global scale. So, appropriation of Sustainable Development Goals requires a comprehensive monitoring and knowledge base of the water resource availability, utilization and access. Hence, scientific research progression has a significant role to facilitate the implementation of sustainable development goals through assessment and policy implementation from global to local scales. India holds a key position among developing economies with a complex interconnected web of a fast-growing population, coupled with biophysical stress, social deprivation and economic inequality related to water and sanitation. This study addresses some of these challenges related to monitoring and implementation of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 in India. Acknowledging the contribution of society and economy in sustainability paradigm, here we have chosen 28 indicators (clustered into eleven dimensions) under two major groups, concerning biophysical and social development aspects of water and sanitation. We have shown declining level of per capita biophysical water resource and slow to rapidly developing social indicators related to Sustainable Development Goal 6 in India. From past trends, we have calculated probable scenario of biophysical consumption of India up to 2050, which shows at least 1.3 times increase. This cumulative assessment framework contributes a tool to prioritize water resource appropriation, management response and policy implementations to national level sustainability of water and sanitation in India. We also advocate the necessity of restraining threats both at source and consumption process levels in order to ensure national water security for both human and biodiversity, keeping in mind the societal and economic development scenario.",

Plasmopara viticola is the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew, a major disease in vineyards worldwide. We sequenced the genome of Pl. viticola with PacBio long reads and obtained a new 92.94 Mb assembly with high continuity (359 scaffolds for a N50 of 706.5 kb) due to a better resolution of repeat regions. This assembly presented a high level of gene completeness, recovering 1,592 genes encoding secreted proteins involved in plant-pathogen interactions. Pl. viticola had a two-speed genome architecture, with secreted protein-encoding genes preferentially located in gene-sparse, repeat-rich regions and evolving rapidly, as indicated by pairwise dN/dS values. We also used short reads to assemble the genome of Plasmopara muralis, a closely related species infecting grape ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata). The lineage-specific proteins identified by comparative genomics analysis included a large proportion of RxLR cytoplasmic effectors and, more generally, genes with high dN/dS values. We identified 270 candidate genes under positive selection, including several genes encoding transporters and components of the RNA machinery potentially involved in host specialization. Finally, the Pl. viticola genome assembly generated here will allow the development of robust population genomics approaches for investigating the mechanisms involved in adaptation to biotic and abiotic selective pressures in this species.\\n\\nDATA AVAILABILITYRaw reads and genome assemblies have been deposited in GenBank (BioProjects PRJNA329579 for Pl. viticola and PRJNA448661 for Pl. muralis).

In metazoans, RNAPII transcription of sn/snoRNAs is facilitated by a number of specialized complexes, but no such complexes have been discovered in yeast. It has thus been proposed that yeast sn/snoRNA promoters use the same complement of factors as mRNA promoters, but the extent to which key regulators of mRNA genes act at sn/snoRNA genes in yeast is unclear. Here, we investigated a potential role for the Mediator complex, essential for mRNA gene transcription, in the transcription of sn/snoRNA genes. We found that the complete Mediator complex maps to most sn/snoRNA gene regulatory regions and that loss of Mediator function results in a robust reduction in RNAPII and TFIIB occupancy at sn/snoRNA genes. Furthermore, deletion of subunits of the activator-interacting Mediator tail module does not affect Mediator recruitment to, or transcription of, sn/snoRNAs. Taken together, our analyses indicate that Mediator promotes PIC formation and transcription at sn/snoRNA genes, expanding the role of this critical regulator beyond its known functions in mRNA gene transcription and demonstrating further mechanistic similarity between the transcription of mRNA and sn/snoRNA genes.",

Here, we systematically characterized the substrate specificities, localization and interactome of the RhoGEFs/RhoGAPs and revealed their critical role in contextualizing and spatially delimiting Rho signaling. They localize to multiple compartments providing positional information, are extensively interconnected to jointly coordinate their signaling networks and are widely autoinhibited to remain sensitive to local activation. RhoGAPs exhibit lower substrate specificity than RhoGEFs and may contribute to preserving Rho activity gradients. Our approach led us to uncover a multi-RhoGEF complex downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors controlling a Cdc42/RhoA crosstalk. The spatial organization of Rho signaling thus differs from other small GTPases and expands the repertoire of mechanisms governing localized signaling activity.",

In the Drosophila embryo, neural progenitors (neuroblasts; NBs) produce a sequence of unique neurons whose identities depend on the sequential expression of temporal transcription factors (TTFs). The stereotypy and precision of the NB lineages indicate reproducible temporal progression of the TTF timer. To examine the basis of this robustness, we combine theory and experiments. The TTF timer is commonly described as a relay of activators, but its regulatory circuit is also consistent with a repressor-decay timer, in which expression of each TTF begins once its repressor is sufficiently reduced. We find that repressor-decay timers are more robust to parameter variations compared to activator-relay timers. This suggests that the in-vivo TTF sequence progresses primarily by repressor-decay, a prediction that we support experimentally.

Indeed, after reduction of media to -250 mV, only thiol-reactive reagents could restore the initial Eh7 value. Moreover, the growth of L. monocytogenes in anaerobic condition is characterized by a reduction then acidification phases. This suggests a sensor mechanism of environmental Eh7 to convert the metabolism way from the first phase to the second. Finally, the concentration of exofacial thiol still increase strongly during the acidification phase of L. monocytogenes, even after reach the minimal value of Eh7.

Immunophenotyping of adult siblings showed high concordance in memory, but not of recently activated lymphocyte subsets, suggesting genetic regulation of memory lymphocyte frequencies. To explore this possibility further, we screened effector memory (EM)-phenotype T cell frequencies in common independent inbred mice strains. Using two pairs from these strains that differed predominantly in either CD4EM and/or CD8EM frequencies, we constructed bi-parental bone marrow chimeras in F1 recipient mice, and found that memory T cell frequencies in recipient mice were determined by donor genotypes.

    "abstract": "Chronic periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease initiated by a complex microbial biofilm and mediated by the host response causing destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Host recognition of pathogens is mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that bind conserved molecular patterns shared by groups of microorganisms. The oral epithelial cells respond to most periodontopathic bacteria via TLR-2 and TLR-4. Many studies have previously reported the presence of elevated numbers of viable exfoliated epithelial cells (SEC) in the saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis. In addition to the membrane-associated receptors, soluble forms of TLR-2 (sTLR-2) and TLR-4 (sTLR-4) have been identified and are thought to play a regulatory role by binding microbial ligands. sTLR-2 has been shown to arise from ectodomain shedding of the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor and sTLR-4 is thought to be an alternate spliced form. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential value of salivary sTLR-2/4 and the paired epithelial cell-associated TLR-2/4 mRNA as diagnostic markers for chronic periodontitis. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected after obtaining informed consent from 40 individuals in either periodontitis or gingivitis cohorts. The levels of sTLR-2/4 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SEC TLR-2/4 transcripts were quantitated by real time polymerase chain reaction. While levels of sTLR-2 exhibited an inverse correlation, sTLR-4 positively correlated with clinical parameters in the gingivitis cohort. Interestingly, both correlations were lost in the periodontitis cohort indicating a dysregulated host response. On the other hand, while sTLR-2 and the paired SEC associated TLR-2 mRNA exhibited a direct correlation (r2=0.62), that of sTLR4 and SEC TLR-4 mRNA exhibited an inverse correlation (r2=0.53) in the periodontitis cohort. Collectively, assessments of salivary sTLR2 and sTLR4 together with the respective transcripts in SECs could provide clinically relevant markers of disease progression from gingivitis to periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "In infections, biofilm formation is associated with a number of fitness advantages, such as resistance to antibiotics and to clearance by the immune system. Biofilm formation has also been linked to fitness advantages in environments other than in vivo infections; primarily, biofilms are thought to help constituent organisms evade predation and to promote intercellular signaling. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms biofilm infections in lungs, wounds, and on implants and medical devices. However, the tendency toward biofilm formation originated in this bacteriums native environment, primarily plants and soil. Such environments are polymicrobial and often resource-limited. Other researchers have recently shown that the P. aeruginosa extracellular polysaccharide Psl can bind iron. For the lab strain PA01, Psl is also the dominant adhesive and cohesive \\\"glue\\\" holding together multicellular aggregates and biofilms. Here, we perform quantitative time-lapse confocal microscopy and image analysis of early biofilm growth by PA01. We find that aggregates of P. aeruginosa have a growth advantage over single cells of P. aeruginosa in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in low-iron environments. Our results suggest the growth advantage of aggregates is linked to their high Psl content and to the production of an active factor by S. aureus. We posit that the ability of Psl to promote iron acquisition may have been linked to the evolutionary development of the strong biofilm-forming tendencies of P. aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "Allosteric regulation is a well-established phenomenon classically defined as conformational or dynamical change of a small number of allosteric residues of the protein upon allosteric effector binding at a distance. Here, we developed a novel approach to delineate allosteric effects in proteins. In this approach, we applied robust machine learning methods, including Deep Neural Network and Random Forest, on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to distinguish otherwise similar allosteric states of proteins. Using PDZ3 domain of PDS-95 as a model protein, we demonstrated that the allosteric effects could be represented as residue-specific properties through two-dimensional property-residue maps, which we refer as \\\"residue perturbation maps\\\". These maps were constructed through two machine learning methods and could accurately describe how different properties of various residues are affected upon allosteric perturbation on protein. Based on the \\\"residue perturbation maps\\\", we propose allostery as a residue-specific concept, suggesting all residues could be considered as allosteric residues because each residue \\\"senses\\\" the allosteric events through perturbation of its one or multiple attributes in a quantitatively unique way. The \\\"residue perturbation maps\\\" could be used to fingerprint a protein based on the unique patterns of residue perturbations upon binding events, providing a novel way to systematically describe the protein allosteric effects of each residue upon perturbation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAllostery is protein regulation at distance. A perturbation at one site of the protein could distantly affect another site. The residues involved in these sites are considered as allosteric residues. The allostery concept has been widely used to understand protein mechanisms and to design allosteric drugs. It is long believed only a small number of residues are allosteric residues. Here, we argue that all residues in a protein are allosteric residues. Upon the perturbation of the allosteric events, the different properties of each residue are affected at the distinct extend. We used hybrid models including molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning components to reveal that not only many properties of residues are affected upon ligand binding, but also each residue is affected through perturbation of its various properties, which makes the residue distinguishable from other residues. According to our findings in a model protein, we defined a \\\"residue perturbation map\\\" as a two-dimensional map that fingerprint a protein based on the extent of perturbation in different properties of all its residues in a quantitative fashion. This \\\"residue perturbation map\\\" provides a novel way to systematically describe the protein allosteric effects of each residue upon perturbation.",

    "abstract": "A key step in pre-mRNA splicing is the recognition of 3 splicing sites by the U2AF large and small subunits, a process regulated by numerous trans-acting splicing factors. How these trans-acting factors interact with U2AF in vivo is unclear. From a screen for suppressors of the temperature-sensitive (ts) lethality of the C. elegans U2AF large subunit gene uaf-1(n4588) mutants, we identified mutations in the RNA binding motif gene rbm-5, a homolog of the tumor suppressor RBM5. rbm-5 mutations can suppress uaf-1(n4588) ts-lethality by loss of function and neuronal expression of rbm-5 was sufficient to rescue the suppression. Transcriptome analyses indicate that uaf-1(n4588) affected the expression of numerous genes and rbm-5 mutations can partially reverse the abnormal gene expression to levels similar to that of wild type. Though rbm-5 mutations did not obviously affect alternative splicing per se, they can suppress or enhance, in a gene-specific manner, the altered splicing of genes in uaf-1(n4588) mutants. Specifically, the recognition of a weak 3 splice site was more susceptible to the effect of rbm-5. Our findings provide novel in vivo evidence that RBM-5 can modulate UAF-1-dependent RNA splicing and suggest that RBM5 might interact with U2AF large subunit to affect tumor formation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRNA splicing is a critical regulatory step for eukaryotic gene expression and has been involved in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. How RNA splicing factors interact in vivo to affect the splicing and expression of genes is unclear. In studying the temperature-sensitive lethal phenotypes of a mutation affecting the splicing factor U2AF large subunit gene uaf-1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we isolated suppressive mutations in the rbm-5 gene, a homolog of the human tumor suppressor gene RBM5. rbm-5 is broadly expressed in neurons to enhance the lethality of the uaf-1 mutants. We found that the uaf-1 mutation causes aberrant expression of genes in numerous biological pathways, a large portion of which can be corrected by rbm-5 mutations. The abnormal splicing of multiple genes caused by the uaf-1 mutation is either corrected or enhanced by rbm-5 mutations in a gene-specific manner. We propose that RBM-5 interacts with UAF-1 to affect RNA splicing and the tumor suppressor function of RBM5 might involve U2AF-dependent RNA splicing.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens continuously adapt to changing host environments where variation in their virulence and antigenicity is critical to their long-term evolutionary success. The emergence of novel variants is accelerated in microbial mutator strains (mutators) deficient in DNA repair genes, most often from mismatch repair and oxidised-guanine repair systems (MMR and OG respectively). Bacterial MMR/OG mutants are abundant in clinical samples and show increased adaptive potential in experimental infection models, yet the role of mutators in the epidemiology and evolution of infectious disease is not well understood. Here we investigated the role of mutation rate dynamics in the evolution of a broad host range pathogen, Streptococcus iniae, using a set of 80 strains isolated globally over 40 years. We have resolved phylogenetic relationships using non-recombinant core genome variants, measured in vivo mutation rates by fluctuation analysis, identified variation in major MMR/OG genes and their regulatory regions, and phenotyped the major traits determining virulence in streptococci. We found that both mutation rate and MMR/OG genotype are remarkably conserved within phylogenetic clades but significantly differ between major phylogenetic lineages. Further, variation in MMR/OG loci correlates with occurrence of atypical virulence-associated phenotypes, infection in atypical hosts (mammals), and atypical tissue of a vaccinated primary hosts (barramundi bone). These findings suggest that mutators are likely to facilitate adaptations preceding major diversification events, and may promote emergence of variation permitting colonisation of a novel host tissue, novel host taxa (host jumps), and immune-escape in the vaccinated host.",

    "abstract": "Betta splendens is not only a commercially important labyrinth fish but also a nice research model for understanding the biological underpinnings of aggressive behavior. However, the shortage of basic genetic resource severely inhibits investigations on the molecular mechanism in sexual dimorphism of aggressive behavior typicality, which are essential for further behavior-related studies. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the functional genes involved in aggression expression. The scarce marker resource also impedes research progress of population genetics and genomics. In order to enrich genetic data and sequence resources, transcriptomic analysis was conducted for mature B. splendens using a multiple-tissues mixing strategy. A total of 105,505,486 clean reads were obtained and by de novo assembly, 69,836 unigenes were generated. Of which, 35,751 unigenes were annotated in at least one of queried databases. The differential expression analysis resulted in 17,683 transcripts differentially expressed between males and females. Plentiful sex-biased genes involved in aggression exhibition were identified via a screening from Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, such as htr, drd, gabr, cyp11a1, cyp17a1, hsd17b3, dax1, sf-1, hsd17b7, gsdf1 and fem1c. These putative genes would make good starting points for profound mechanical exploration on aggressive behavioral regulation. Moreover, 12,751 simple sequence repeats were detected from 9,617 unigenes for marker development. Nineteen of the 100 randomly selected primer pairs were demonstrated to be polymorphic. The large amount of transcript sequences will considerably increase available genomic information for gene mining and function analysis, and contribute valuable microsatellite marker resources to in-depth studies on molecular genetics and genomics in the future.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial populations have been shown to accumulate deleterious mutations during spatial expansions that overall decrease their fitness and ability to grow. However, it is unclear if and how they can respond to selection in face of this mutation load. We examine here if artificial selection can counteract the negative effects of range expansions. We investigated the molecular evolution of 20 lines (SEL) selected for fast expansions and compared them to 20 lines without artificial selection (CONTROL). We find that all 20 SEL lines have been able to increase their expansion speed relative to the ancestral line, unlike CONTROL lines, showing that enough beneficial mutations are produced during spatial expansions to counteract the negative effect of expansion load. Importantly, SEL and CONTROL lines have similar numbers of mutations indicating that they evolved for the same number of generations and that increased fitness is not due to a purging of deleterious mutations. We find that loss of function (LOF) mutations are better at explaining the increased expansion speed of SEL lines than non-synonymous mutations or a combination of the two. Interestingly, most LOF mutations are found in simple sequence repeats located in genes involved in gene regulation and gene expression. We postulate that such potentially reversible mutations could play a major role in the rapid adaptation of bacteria to changing environmental conditions by shutting down expensive genes and adjusting gene expression.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe investigated if strong artificial selection for fast expansion can counteract the negative effects of range expansion which had been shown to lead to an accumulation of deleterious mutations. This experiments showed that i) an increase in expansion speed could occur if bacteria were selected from the largest protruding sectors, and ii) that artificially selected bacterial lines accumulated about the same number of mutations than simply expanding line suggesting that the observed increased fitness is not due to increased purifying selection where deleterious mutations would have been removed in fast growing lines. We find that loss of function (LOF) mutations are best explaining the observed increased expansion speed in selected lines. These mutations, which are known to play an important role in adaptive processes in bacterial populations, frequently consist in small insertion-deletions in simple sequence repeats, and are thus relatively easily reversible. They could thus act as switches that can reversibly shut down genes. Our results therefore suggest that shutting down expensive genes and adjusting gene expression are important for adaptive processes during range expansion.",

Vibrio parahaemolyticus is found in warm coastal waters and causes gastroenteritis in humans and economically significant disease in shrimps.\\n\\nResultsBased on data from 1,103 genomes, we show that V. parahaemolyticus is divided into four diverse populations, VppUS1, VppUS2, VppX and VppAsia. The first two are largely restricted to the US and Northern Europe, while the others are found worldwide, with VppAsia making up the great majority of isolates in the seas around Asia. Patterns of diversity within and between the populations are consistent with them having arisen by progressive divergence via genetic drift during geographical isolation. However, we find that there is substantial overlap in their current distribution. These observations can be reconciled without requiring genetic barriers to exchange between populations if dispersal between oceans has increased dramatically in the recent past. We found that VppAsia isolates from the US have an average of 1.01% more shared ancestry with VppUS1 and VppUS2 isolates than VppAsia isolates from Asia itself. Based on time calibrated trees of divergence within epidemic lineages, we estimate that recombination affects about 0.017% of the genome per year, implying that the genetic mixture has taken place within the last few decades.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that human activity, such as shipping and aquatic products trade, are responsible for the change of distribution pattern of this marine species.",

    "abstract": "Long read sequencing technology has allowed researchers to create de novo assemblies with impressive continuity[1,2]. This advancement has dramatically increased the number of reference genomes available and hints at the possibility of a future where personal genomes are assembled rather than resequenced. In 2016 Pacific Biosciences released the FALCON-Unzip framework, which can provide long, phased haplotype contigs from de novo assemblies. This phased genome algorithm enhances the accuracy of highly heterozygous organisms and allows researchers to explore questions that require haplotype information such as allele-specific expression and regulation. However, validation of this technique has been limited to small genomes or inbred individuals[3].\\n\\nAs a roadmap to personal genome assembly and phasing, we assess the phasing accuracy of FALCON-Unzip in humans using publicly available data for the Ashkenazi trio from the Genome in a Bottle Consortium[4]. To assess the accuracy of the Unzip algorithm, we assembled the genome of the son using FALCON and FALCON Unzip, genotyped publicly available short read data for the mother and the father, and observed the inheritance pattern of the parental SNPs along the phased genome of the son. We found that 72.8% of haplotype contigs share SNPs with only one parent suggesting that these contigs are correctly phased. Most mis-phased SNPs are random but present in high frequency toward the end of haplotype contigs. Approximately 20.7% of mis-phased haplotype contigs contain clusters of mis-phased SNPs, suggesting that haplotypes were mis-joined by FALCON-Unzip. Mis-joined boundaries in those contigs are located in areas of low SNP density. This research demonstrates that the FALCON-Unzip algorithm can be used to create long and accurate haplotypes for humans and identifies problematic regions that could benefit in future improvement.",

This process relies on the ability of single cells to establish a front-rear polarity, and can occur in absence of external cues. The initiation of migration has been attributed to the spontaneous polarization of cytoskeleton components, while the spatiotemporal evolution of cytoskeletal forces arising from continuous mechanical cell-substrate interaction has yet to be resolved. Here, we establish a one-dimensional microfabricated migration assay that mimics complex in vivo fibrillar environment while being compatible with high-resolution force measurements, quantitative microscopy, and optogenetics. Quantification of morphometric and mechanical parameters reveals a generic stick-slip behavior initiated by contractility-dependent stochastic detachment of adhesive contacts at one side of the cell, which is sufficient to drive directional cell motility in absence of pre-established cytoskeleton polarity or morphogen gradients. A theoretical model validates the crucial role of adhesion dynamics during spontaneous symmetry breaking, proposing that the examined phenomenon can emerge independently of a complex self-polarizing system.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryCells can autonomously break their symmetry through traction force oscillations (mechanical instabilities) that lead to stochastic detachment of adhesion patches on one side of the cell and the subsequent initiation of migration.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration, the ability to restore body parts after an injury or an amputation, is a widespread but highly variable and complex phenomenon in animals. While having fascinating scientists for centuries, fundamental questions about the cellular basis of animal regeneration as well as its evolutionary history remain largely unanswered. We study regeneration of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, an emerging comparative developmental biology model, which, like many other annelids, displays important regenerative abilities. If the posterior part of the body is amputated, P. dumerilii worms are able to regenerate the posteriormost differentiated part of the body and stem cell-rich growth zone that allows to make new segments which replace the amputated ones. We show that posterior regeneration is a rapid process that follows a well reproducible paths and timeline, going through specific stages that we thoroughly defined. Wound healing is achieved by one day post-amputation and a regeneration blastema forms one day later. At this time point, some tissue specification already occurs, and a functional posterior growth zone is re-established as early as three days after amputation. Regeneration is only influenced in a minor manner by worm size and position of the amputation site along the antero-posterior axis of the worm and regenerative abilities persist upon repeated amputations without important alterations of the process. We also show that intense cell proliferation occurs during regeneration and that cell divisions are strictly required for regeneration to normally proceed. Finally, through several 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse and chase experiments, we provide evidence in favor of a local origin of the blastema, whose constituting cells mostly derive from the segment immediately abutting the amputation plane. The detailed characterization of P. dumerilii posterior body regeneration presented in this article provides the foundation for future mechanistic and comparative studies of regeneration in this species.",

Tolerance alleviates the reduction in host fitness due to infection without reducing a pathogens growth, while resistance reduces pathogen growth. We investigated tolerance of wheat to the major fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici in 335 elite wheat cultivars.\nC_LIO_LIWe used a novel digital phenotyping approach that included 11,152 infected leaves and counted 2,069,048 pathogen fruiting bodies.\nC_LIO_LIWe discovered a new component of tolerance that is based on the relationship between the green area remaining on a leaf and the number of pathogen fruiting bodies. We found a negative correlation between tolerance and resistance among intolerant cultivars, presenting the first compelling evidence for a tradeoff between tolerance and resistance to plant pathogens. Surprisingly, the tradeoff arises due to limits in the host resources available to the pathogen and not due to metabolic constraints, contrary to what ecological theory suggests.\nC_LIO_LIThe mechanism underlying this tradeoff may be relevant for many plant diseases in which the amount of host resources available to the pathogen can limit the pathogen population. Our analysis indicates that European wheat breeders may have selected for tolerance instead of resistance to an important pathogen.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In the last decade the use of mixed models has become a pivotal part in the implementation of genome-assisted prediction in plant and animal breeding programs. Exploiting the use genetic correlation among traits through multivariate predictions has been proposed in recent years as a way to boost prediction accuracy and understand pleiotropy and other genetic and ecological phenomena better. Multiple mixed model solvers able to use relationship matrices or deal with marker-based incidence matrices have been released in the last years but multivariate versions are scarse. Such solvers have become quite popular in plant and animal breeding thanks to user-friendly platforms such as R. Among such software one of the most recent and popular is the sommer package. In this short communication we discuss the update of the package that is able to run multivariate mixed models with multiple random effects and different covariance structures at the level of random effects and trait-to-trait covariance along with other functionalities for genetic analysis and field trial analysis to enhance the genome-assisted prediction capabilities of researchers.",

    "abstract": "Cryptic speciation is frequent in the medically important mosquitoes. While most findings have been reported in tropical regions, it is an unexplored topic in countries where mosquito-borne diseases are not endemic, like Spain. The occurrence of recent outbreaks in Europe has increased the awareness on the native and invasive mosquito fauna present in the continent. Therefore, the central question of this study is whether the typological approach is sufficient to identify Spanish mosquitoes. To address this problem, we confronted the results of the morphological identification of 62 adult specimens collected from four different regions of Spain (La Rioja, Navarra, Castellon and the Island of Majorca) with the results obtained through DNA-barcoding. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the COI gene region and compared this with the results of four species delimitation algorithms (ABGD initial partition, ABGD P=0.46%, bPTP and TCS). We report strong evidence for cryptic speciation in Anopheles algeriensis and Aedes vexans and reproductive isolation of the rock pool mosquito Aedes mariae. In addition, we report that the character present in the wings is not efficient to distinguish species Culiseta annulata from Culiseta subochrea, which distribution in the country may be different than previously described.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAim of the study was to compare metabolic response of leg skeletal muscle during functional electrical stimulation-driven unloaded cycling (FES) to that seen during volitional supine cycling.\\n\\nMethodsFourteen healthy volunteers were exposed in random order to supine cycling, either volitional (10-25-50 W, 10 min) or FES assisted (unloaded, 10 min) in a crossover design. Whole body and leg muscle metabolism were assessed by indirect calorimetry with concomitant repeated measurements of femoral venous-arterial differences of blood gases, glucose, lactate and amino acids.\\n\\nResultsUnloaded FES cycling, but not volitional exercise, led to a significant increase in across-leg lactate production (from -1.1{+/-}2.1 to 5.5{+/-}7.4 mmol/min, p<0.001) and mild elevation of arterial lactate (from 1.8{+/-}0.7 to 2.5{+/-}0.8 mM). This occurred without widening of across-leg VA O2 and CO2 gaps. Femoral SvO2 difference was directly proportional to VA difference of lactate (R2= 0.60, p=0.002). Across-leg glucose uptake did not change with either type of exercise. Systemic oxygen consumption increased with FES cycling to similarly to 25W volitional exercise (138{+/-}29% resp. 124{+/-}23% of baseline). There was a net uptake of branched-chain amino acids and net release of Alanine from skeletal muscle, which were unaltered by either type of exercise.\\n\\nConclusionsUnloaded FES cycling, but not volitional exercise causes significant lactate production without hypoxia in skeletal muscle. This phenomenon can be significant in vulnerable patients groups.",

We find that the signals of selection using UKB effect-size estimates for height are strongly attenuated or absent. We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.",

To date, iPSCs have been established all over the world by various gene delivery methods. All methods induced high-quality iPSCs, but epigenetic analysis of abnormalities derived from differences in the gene delivery methods has not yet been performed. Here, we generated genetically matched human iPSCs from menstrual blood cells by using three kinds of vectors, i.e., retrovirus, Sendai virus, and episomal vectors, and compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles among them. Although comparison of aberrant methylation revealed that iPSCs generated by Sendai virus vector have lowest number of aberrant methylation sites among the three vectors, the iPSCs generated by non-integrating methods did not show vector-specific aberrant methylation. However, the differences between the iPSC lines were determined to be the number of random aberrant hyper-methylated regions compared with embryonic stem cells. These random aberrant hyper-methylations might be a cause of the differences in the properties of each of the iPSC lines.",

However, the nature of the cell density-dependent cues that regulate the YAP distribution remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that tight junctions serve as a platform that controls both distribution and activity of LATS1, a kinase that phosphorylates YAP. This CIP effect is mediated by the scaffold function of junctional protein, ZO-2, by promoting LATS1 interaction with YAP in the cytoplasm, and then targeting the tripartite complex to tight junctions. There, LATS1 is activated by angiomotin and NF2, thereby stimulating YAP phosphorylation and its cytoplasmic retention. Our findings delineate novel mechanisms governing CIP, in which ZO-2 utilizes the status of cell-cell cohesion to control the phosphorylation status and therefore inactivation of YAP by LATS1 in the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Genetic predictions of height differ among human populations and these differences are too large to be explained by genetic drift. This observation has been interpreted as evidence of polygenic adaptation. Differences across populations were detected using SNPs genome-wide significantly associated with height, and many studies also found that the signals grew stronger when large numbers of subsignificant SNPs were analyzed. This has led to excitement about the prospect of analyzing large fractions of the genome to detect subtle signals of selection and claims of polygenic adaptation for multiple traits. Polygenic adaptation studies of height have been based on SNP effect size measurements in the GIANT Consortium meta-analysis. Here we repeat the height analyses in the UK Biobank, a much more homogeneously designed study. Our results show that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance are extremely sensitive to biases due to uncorrected population structure.",

Technologies such as high-throughput sequencing enable cheaper data collection at higher speed, but rely on modern data analysis platforms to extract knowledge from these high dimensional datasets.

These pipelines are therefore developed iteratively, continuously modifying analysis parameters before arriving at the final results. To enable reproducible results it is important to record all these modifications and decisions made during the analysis process.\\n\\nWe built a system, walrus, to support reproducible analyses for iteratively developed analysis pipelines. The approach is based on our experiences developing and using deep analysis pipelines to provide insights and recommendations for treatment in an actual breast cancer case. We designed walrus for the single servers or small compute clusters typically available for novel treatments in the clinical setting. walrus leverages software containers to provide reproducible execution environments, and integrates with modern version control systems to capture provenance of data and pipeline parameters.\\n\\nWe have used walrus to analyze a patients primary tumor and adjacent normal tissue, including subsequent metastatic lesions.

    "abstract": "Previous work has elegantly demonstrated that, unlike adult mammalian heart, the neonatal heart is able to regenerate after injury from postnatal day (P) 1 to 7. Recently, macrophages are found to be required in the repair process as depletion of which abolishes endogenous regenerative capability of the neonatal heart. Nevertheless, whether innate immunity alone is sufficient for neonatal heart regeneration is obscure. Here, we investigate a hitherto novel role of FOXP3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) in neonatal heart regeneration. Unlike their wild type counterparts, NOD/SCID mice that are deficient for T-cells but innate immune cells including macrophages fail to regenerate their injured heart as early as P3. In wild type mice, both conventional CD4+ T-cells and Treg are recruited to cardiac muscle within the first week after injury. Treatment with the lytic anti-CD4 antibody that specifically depletes conventional CD4+ T-cells leads to reduced cardiac fibrosis; while treatment with the lytic anti-CD25 antibody that specifically depletes CD4+CD25hiFOXP3+ Treg contributes to increased fibrosis of the neonatal heart after injury. Moreover, adoptive transfer of Treg to NOD/SCID mice results in mitigated fibrosis and increased proliferation and function of cardiac muscle of the neonatal heart after injury. Mechanistically, single cell transcriptomic profiling reveals that Treg are a source of chemokines and cytokines that attract monocytes and macrophages previously known to drive neonatal heart regeneration. Furthermore, Treg directly promote proliferation of both mouse and human cardiomyocytes in a paracrine manner. Our findings uncover an unappreciated mechanism in neonatal heart regeneration; and offer new avenues for developing novel therapeutics targeting Treg-mediated heart regeneration.",

The main outcome measures were: variation in practice and CCG prescribing ratios geographically and over time, including an interrupted time-series; and responses to Freedom of Information requests.\\n\\nResultsThe amount of trimethoprim prescribed, as a proportion of nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim combined, remained stable and high until 2014, then fell gradually to below 50% in 2017; this reduction was more rapid following the introduction of the Quality Premium. There was substantial variation in the speed of change between CCGs. As of April 2017, for the 10 worst CCGs (with the highest trimethoprim ratios): 9 still had trimethoprim as first line treatment for uncomplicated UTI (one CCG had no formulary); none had active work plans to facilitate change in prescribing behaviour away from trimethoprim; and none had implemented an incentive scheme for change in prescribing behaviour. For the 10 best CCGs: 2 still had trimethoprim as first line treatment (all CCGs had a formulary); 5 (out of 7 who answered this question) had active work plans to facilitate change in prescribing behaviour away from trimethoprim; and 5 (out of 10 responding) had implemented an incentive scheme for change in prescribing behaviour. 9 of the best 10 CCGs reported at least one of: formulary change, work plan, or incentive scheme.

    "abstract": "The molecular basis of aging and of aging-associated diseases is being unraveled at an increasing pace. An extended healthspan, and not merely an extension of lifespan, has become the aim of medical practice. However, a precise definition of health and healthspan is not straightforward, and the causal molecular basis of health \\\"per se\\\" is largely unknown. Here, we define health based on the absence of diseases and dysfunctions. Based on an extensive review of the literature, in particular for humans and C. elegans, we compile a list of features of health and of the genes associated with them. Clusters of these genes based on molecular interaction data give rise to maps of healthspan pathways for humans, featuring the themes transcription initiation, proliferation and cholesterol/lipid processing, and for C. elegans, featuring the themes immune response, mitochondrion and biosynthesis based on genetic and compound intervention data, and lipids, biosynthesis and transcription based on WormBase compound intervention data. Overlaying healthspan-related gene expression data (describing effects of metabolic intervention associated with improvements in health) onto the aforementioned healthspan pathway maps, we observe the downregulation of Notch signalling in humans and of proliferation/cell-cycle in C. elegans.

    "abstract": "Human mitochondrial data are currently of great interest for both clinicians and researchers, due to the involvement of mitochondria in a number of physiological and pathological processes. Thanks to new sequencing technologies and modern databases, the huge amount of information about mitochondrial genome variability can be exploited to gain interesting insights into the relationship between DNA variants, phenotypes and diseases. For this reason, we have developed the new HmtVar resource, a variant-focused database which allows to explore a dataset of over 30000 human mitochondrial variants together with their pathogenicity prediction. Mitochondrial variation data, initially gathered from the HmtDB platform, are further integrated with in-house pathogenicity assessments based on well-established variants pathogenicity evaluation criteria, as well as with a set of additional annotations from third-party resources. This approach led to a comprehensive collection of information of crucial importance for human mitochondrial variation studies and investigation of common and rare diseases in which the mitochondrion is involved to some extent.\\n\\nHmtVar is accessible at https://www.hmtvar.uniba.it and its data can be retrieved using either a web interface through the Query page or a state-of-the-art API for programmatic access.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in developing point of care tests to diagnose disease and predict prognosis based upon biomarker signatures of RNA or protein expression levels. Technology to measure the required biomarkers accurately and in a time-frame useful to health care professionals will be easier to develop by minimising the number of biomarkers measured. In this paper we describe the Parallel Regularised Regression Model Search (PReMS) method which is designed to estimate parsimonious prediction models. Given a set of potential biomarkers PReMS searches over many logistic regression models constructed from optimal subsets of the biomarkers, iteratively increasing the model size. Zero centred Gaussian prior distributions are assigned to all regression coefficients to induce shrinkage. The method estimates the optimal shrinkage parameter, optimal model for each model size and the optimal model size. We apply PReMS to six freely available data sets and compare its performance with the LASSO and SCAD algorithms in terms of the number of covariates in the model, model accuracy, as measured by the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and root predicted mean square error, and model calibration. We show that PReMS typically selects models with fewer biomarkers than both the LASSO and SCAD algorithms but has comparable predictive accuracy.\\n\\nAvailability: (PReMS) is freely available as an R package https://github.com/clivehoggart/PReMS",

    "abstract": "TDP-43 proteinopathy is a common feature in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimers disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TDP-43-induced neurotoxicity are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that TDP-43 proteinopathy induces impairment in ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) evidenced by an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and reduction of proteasome activity in neuronal cells. Through kinase inhibitor screening, we identified PTK2 as a suppressor of neurotoxicity induced by UPS impairment. Importantly, PTK2 inhibition significantly reduces ubiquitin aggregates and attenuated TDP-43-induced cytotoxicity in Drosophila model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. We further identified that phosphorylation of p62 at serine 403 (p-p62S403), a key component in the autophagic degradation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, is increased upon TDP-43 overexpression and dependent on activation of PTK2 in neuronal cells. Moreover, expressing a non-phosphorylated form of p62 (p62S403A) significantly represses accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and neurotoxicity induced by TDP-43 overexpression in neuronal cells. In addition, inhibition of TBK1, a kinase which phosphorylates S403 of p62, ameliorates neurotoxicity upon UPS impairment in neuronal cells. Taken together, our data suggest that activation of PTK2-TBK1-p62 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of TDP-43 by regulating neurotoxicity induced by UPS impairment. Therefore, targeting PTK2-TBK1-p62 axis may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 proteinopathy.",

We demonstrate a new function of IFN{gamma} in inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal and cancer cells from different cell types. IFN{gamma} activates JAK-STAT signaling pathway leading to the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as interferon-induced tetratricopeptide repeat 5 (IFIT5). We unveil a new function of IFIT5 complex in degrading precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNA) that include pre-miR-363 from the miR-106a-363 cluster, as well as pre-miR-101 and pre-miR-128 with a similar 5-end structure with pre-miR-363. Noticeably, these suppressive miRNAs have similar functions by targeting EMT transcription factors in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We further demonstrated that IFIT5 plays a critical role in IFN{gamma}-induced cell invasiveness in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Clinically, IFIT5 is highly elevated in high-grade PCa and its expression inversely correlates with these suppressive miRNAs.

Centromere identity is defined epigenetically by the presence of nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. New CENP-A nucleosome assembly occurs at the centromere every cell cycle during G1, but how CENP-A nucleosome assembly is spatially and temporally restricted remains poorly understood. Centromere recruitment of factors required for CENP-A assembly is mediated in part by the three-protein Mis18 complex (Mis18, Mis18{beta}, M18BP1). Here we show that Xenopus M18BP1 localizes to centromeres during metaphase - prior to CENP-A assembly - by binding to CENP-C using a highly conserved SANTA domain. We find that Cdk phosphorylation of M18BP1 is necessary for M18BP1 to bind CENP-C and localize to centromeres in metaphase. Surprisingly, mutations which disrupt the metaphase M18BP1/CENP-C interaction cause defective nuclear localization of M18BP1 in interphase, resulting in defective CENP-A nucleosome assembly. We propose that M18BP1 may identify centromeric sites in metaphase for subsequent CENP-A nucleosome assembly in interphase.",

To achieve this, the EJC core nucleates assembly of a dynamic shell of peripheral proteins that function in diverse post-transcriptional processes. To illuminate consequences of EJC composition change, we purified EJCs from human cells via peripheral proteins RNPS1 and CASC3. We show that EJC originates as an SR-rich mega-dalton sized RNP that contains RNPS1 but lacks CASC3. After mRNP export to the cytoplasm and before translation, the EJC undergoes a remarkable compositional and structural remodeling into an SR-devoid monomeric complex that contains CASC3. Surprisingly, RNPS1 is important for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in general whereas CASC3 is needed for NMD of only select mRNAs. The promotion of switch to CASC3-EJC slows down NMD. Overall, the EJC compositional switch dramatically alters mRNP structure and specifies two distinct phases of EJC-dependent NMD.",

In this study, we examine age-related effects on the function and structural connectivity of this system in fear extinction in adolescence and young adulthood. Younger age was associated with greater amygdala activity and delayed mPFC engagement to learned threat cues as compared to safety cues. Furthermore, greater structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a white matter tract that connects the amygdala and mPFC, mediated the relationship between age and acceleration of mPFC engagement during extinction. These findings suggest that age-related changes in the structure and function of amygdala-mPFC circuitry may underlie the protracted maturation of fear regulatory processes, rendering younger individuals more vulnerable to anxiety disorders, which emerge during development.",

Such knowledge aids in the prediction of others, and it affects choices even when it is unrelated to actual behaviour. In this investigation, we aimed to study the neural representation of positive and negative personal expectations, how these impact subsequent choices, and the effect of mismatches between expectations and encountered behaviour. We employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in combination with a version of the Ultimatum Game (UG) where participants were provided with information about their partners moral traits previous to their fair or unfair offers. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the implication of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the representation of expectations about the partners in the game. Further, these regions also represented the valence of expectations, together with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Importantly, the performance of multivariate classifiers in these clusters correlated with a behavioural choice bias to accept more offers following positive descriptions, highlighting the impact of the valence on the expectations on participants economic decisions. Altogether, our results suggest that expectations based on social information guide future interpersonal decisions and that the neural representation of such expectations in the vmPFC is related to their influence on behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) cultivation is the main source of natural rubber worldwide and has been extended to areas with suboptimal climates and lengthy drought periods; this transition affects growth and latex production. High-density genetic maps with reliable markers support precise mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL), which can help reveal the complex genome of the species, provide tools to enhance molecular breeding, and shorten the breeding cycle. In this study, QTL mapping of the stem diameter, tree height, and number of whorls was performed for a full-sibling population derived from a GT1 and RRIM701 cross. A total of 225 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 186 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to construct a base map with 18 linkage groups and to anchor 671 SNPs from genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to produce a very dense linkage map with small intervals between loci. The final map was composed of 1,079 markers, spanned 3,779.7 cM with an average marker density of 3.5 cM, and showed collinearity between markers from previous studies. Significant variation in phenotypic characteristics was found over a 59-month evaluation period with a total of 38 QTLs being identified through a composite interval mapping method. Linkage group 4 showed the greatest number of QTLs (7), with phenotypic explained values varying from 7.67% to 14.07%. Additionally, we estimated segregation patterns, dominance, and additive effects for each QTL. A total of 53 significant effects for stem diameter were observed, and these effects were mostly related to additivity in the GT1 clone. Associating accurate genome assemblies and genetic maps represents a promising strategy for identifying the genetic basis of phenotypic traits in rubber trees. Then, further research can benefit from the QTLs identified herein, providing a better understanding of the key determinant genes associated with growth of Hevea brasiliensis under limiting water conditions.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous focal synchronization of collective spiking followed by induced traveling waves can occur in the cortical sheet and in cultured planar neuronal networks. In the first case, it is well-known focal epilepsy leading to a seizure and, in the second, this synchronization originates from one of a few steady nucleation sites resulting in a so-called population spike. Assuming functional similarity between the nucleation sites and non-lesional epileptic foci, the major unsolved problem in both cases is that it is unclear whether activation of the focus originates internally (i.e., autonomously relative to interaction with surrounding neuronal tissue) or externally. The internal scenario implies that the focus spatially contains some pacemakers. In turn, several experimental findings indicate a complex spatially non-local activation of epileptic focus. Here, we suggest a generative mechanistic model of planar neuronal network, where the spatial configuration of pacemaker neurons is artificially engineered in order to resolve the above mentioned problem: all pacemakers are placed within a circular central spot. Leaving the global dynamic regime unaffected, this crucially helps to clarify the activation process, visualizing of which is hindered in the natural spatially-uniform configuration. We show in simulations that the nucleation sites (i) can emerge in spatial regions, where pacemakers are completely absent and (ii) can be activated even without direct links from pacemakers. These results demonstrate the principle possibility of external, or remote, activation of a focal source of epileptic activity in the brain. The suggested deterministic model provides the means to study this network phenomenon systematically and reproducibly.",

In our previous study (Lane et al., 2016) we blocked a subset of K+ conductances across LCs, resulting in loss of synchronous activity. In this study, we hypothesized that this same variability of conductances could make LCs vulnerable to desynchronization during neuromodulation. We exposed the LCs to serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) while recording simultaneously from multiple LCs. Both amines had distinct excitatory effects on LC output, but only 5HT caused desynchronized output. We further determined that DA rapidly increased gap junctional conductance. Co-application of both amines induced 5HT-like output, but waveforms remained synchronized. Furthermore, DA prevented desynchronization induced by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), suggesting that dopaminergic modulation of electrical coupling plays a protective role in maintaining network synchrony.",

    "abstract": "The Mammalian phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) family is primarily recognized for its oncogenic properties. Here we found that in Drosophila, loss of prl-1 resulted in CO2-induced brain disorder presented as irreversible wing hold up with enhancement of Ca2+ responses at the neuron synaptic terminals. Overexpression of Prl-1 in the nervous system could rescue the mutant phenotype. We show that Prl-1 is particularly expressed in CO2-responsive neural circuit and the higher brain centers. Ablation of the CO2 olfactory receptor, Gr21a, suppressed the mutant phenotype, suggesting that CO2 acts as a neuropathological substrate in absence of Prl-1. Further studies found that the wing hold up is an obvious consequence upon knockdown of Uex, a magnesium transporter, which directly interacts with Prl-1. Conditional expression of Uex in the nervous system could rescue the phenotype of prl-1 mutants. We demonstrate that Uex acts genetically downstream of Prl-1. Our findings provide important insights into mechanisms of Prl-1 protection against olfactory CO2 stimulation induced brain disorder at the level of detailed neural circuits and functional molecular connections.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), the most common congenital heart defect, is characterized by a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. The pathogenesis of VSD is unknown in most clinical cases. There is a paucity of data relevant to epigenetic changes in VSD. The placenta is a fetal tissue and is a potentially useful surrogate for the evaluation of fetal organ development. To understand epigenetic mechanisms that may play a role in the development of VSD, a genome-wide DNA methylation assay of the placentas of 8 term subjects with isolated VSD and no known or suspected genetic syndromes and 10 normal controls was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay. The study identified a total of 80 highly accurate potential epigenomic markers in 80 genes for the detection of VSD; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) = 1.0 with significant 95% CI (FDR) p-values < 0.05. The biological processes and functions for these differentially methylated genes are known to be associated with heart development or heart disease, including cardiac ventricle development (HEY2, ISL1), heart looping (SRF), cardiac muscle cell differentiation (ACTC1, HEY2), cardiac septum development (ISL1), heart morphogenesis (SRF, HEY2, ISL1, HEYL), Notch signaling pathway (HEY2, HEYL), cardiac chamber development (ISL1), and cardiac muscle tissue development (ACTC1, ISL1). The study also identified eight microRNA genes that have the potential to be biomarkers for the early detection of VSD including miR-191, miR-548F1, miR-148A, miR-423, miR-92B, miR-611, miR-2110, and miR-548H4. To our knowledge this is the first report in which placental analysis has been used for determining the pathogenesis of and predicting CHD.",

    "abstract": "Brain networks exhibit community structure that reconfigures during cognitively demanding tasks. Extant work has emphasized a single class of communities: those that are assortative, or internally dense and externally sparse. Other classes that may play key functional roles in brain function have largely been ignored, leading to an impoverished view in the best case and a mischaracterization in the worst case. Here, we leverage weighted stochastic blockmodeling, a community detection method capable of detecting diverse classes of communities, to study the community structure of functional brain networks while subjects either rest or perform cognitively demanding tasks. We find evidence that the resting brain is largely assortative, although higher order association areas exhibit non-assortative organization, forming cores and peripheries. Surprisingly, this assortative structure breaks down during tasks and is supplanted by core, periphery, and disassortative communities. Using measures derived from the community structure, we show that it is possible to classify an individuals task state with an accuracy that is well above average. Finally, we show that inter-individual differences in the composition of assortative and non-assortative communities is correlated with subject performance on in-scanner cognitive tasks. These findings offer a new perspective on the community organization of functional brain networks and its relation to cognition.",

    "abstract": "The question as to whether there is a lag between brain and body mass evolution was ostensibly solved two decades ago by Deaner & Nunn (1999) who used phylogenetic methods to show that there was no evidence to suggest that changes in brain size lagged behind changes in body size. However, their assumption that body size would always change ahead of brain size is open to question. In addition, many of their datapoints are confounded by grade shift effects. A reanalysis of their data controlling for these confounds shows that there is in fact a strong lag effect, but that the direction of the lag is the reverse of that originally assumed: brain size typically changes first, and does so under selection from changes in group size. The data suggest that it takes about 2.0 million years for body size to converge back onto the conventional allometric relationship with brain size. In the meantime, species that have increased brain size are likely to incur a significant energy cost that must be met from elsewhere. I show that they seem to do so by changing to a more nutrient-rich diet.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are modulators of endogenous stress responses and are important pharmaceuticals for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The gastrointestinal epithelium is a significant tissue target of Glucocorticoids; perturbation of epithelial barrier function during the endogenous stress response plays a major role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. Epithelial permeability and barrier function are mediated by the tight junction protein complex, with a network of molecular/cellular interactions occurring between the actin cytoskeleton, RhoGTPase, Akt/PI3K and growth factor receptor, and inflammatory cytokine signaling, influencing the establishment of a  partial EMT phenotype. To improve our understanding of GC-responsive gene expression in a gastrointestinal epithelial context, we tested polarized Caco-2 monolayer cultures during at 30-day timecourse, with 15-days of continuous Dexamethasone exposure. Trans-epithelial resistance (TEER) was recorded to provide a physiological quantification of barrier function during the timecourse treatments. Presence of intracellular glucocorticoid hormone activates the human glucocorticoid receptor (GCR, human NR3C1 gene) transcription factor, resulting in transcriptional activation and repression of various GCR-responsive genes. We tested for differential gene expression with a multiplexed panel of 250 gene expression panel using the Nanostring nCounter(R) system. Gene panel selection was based on membership of genes in canonical KEGG pathways for tight-junction, adherens junction, focal adhesion, actin cytoskeleton regulation, and colorectal cancer. Our TEER results confirm, as previously reported, that long-term Dexamethasone exposure results in decreased permeability in Caco-2 monolayers ~day 20-25. Culture age and Dexamethasone exposure both contributed to differential gene expression for cell-cell junction, protein kinases, survival and cancer associated genes, reported here in the context of their corresponding KEGG pathway representations. The findings give evidence for GC and time-associated patterns of transcriptional response and provide further insight into long-term glucocorticoid-associated physiological effects on the gastrointestinal epithelia. Future research utilizing more advanced cell culture methods will use this data-set as a reference.",

    "abstract": "Lysophophatidic acid (LPA), a biologically active phospholipid that is ubiquitously present in tissues and organs, provokes cellular responses such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration via activation of G-protein coupled receptors. These receptors activate a broad range of intracellular signaling cascades to mediate these responses. Using microfluidic chambers that generate and maintain stable gradients, we observed that chemotaxis of fibroblasts to LPA has higher directional fidelity than chemotaxis provoked by the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) ligand platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Unlike fast moving amoeboid cells, mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts do not require PI3K for chemotaxis to a GPCR ligand. In addition, the Arp2/3 complex is not required for fibroblast GPCR-based chemotaxis in either 2D or 3D environments. Our data indicate that combinatorial regulation of myosin II involving global activation by RhoA/ROCK and local inhibition of myosin II at the leading edge by PKC results in highly efficient chemotaxis of fibroblasts to LPA. Based on these observations, we develop a simple mathematical model to explain how dual regulation of myosin II is responsible for enhanced chemotaxis in LPA gradients relative to PDGF. Using pharmacological approaches, we test predictions of this model and modulate the fidelity of LPA and PDGF chemotaxis.",

We performed metagenomic sequencing using both the Illumina MiSeq and the portable Oxford Nanopore MinION to study the feasibility of whole genome sequencing from clinical samples containing chikungunya or dengue virus, two of the most important arboviruses. Direct metagenomic sequencing of nucleic acid extracts from serum and plasma without viral enrichment allowed for virus and coinfection identification, subtype determination and in the majority of cases elucidated complete or near-complete genomes adequate for phylogenetic analysis. This work demonstrates that metagenomic whole genome sequencing is feasible for over 90% and 80% of chikungunya and dengue virus PCR-positive patient samples respectively. It confirms the feasibility of field metagenomic sequencing for these and likely other RNA viruses, highlighting the applicability of this approach to front-line public health.",

    "abstract": "To couple the fidelity of patch-clamp recording with a more high-throughput screening capability, we pioneered a novel approach to single channel recording that we named \\\"optical patch clamp\\\". By using highly-sensitive fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dyes in conjunction with total internal fluorescence microscopy techniques, we monitor Ca2+ flux through individual Ca2+-permeable channels. This approach provides information about channel gating analogous to patch-clamp recording at time resolution of ~ 2 ms, with the additional advantage of being massively parallel, providing simultaneous and independent recording from thousands of channels in native environment. However, manual analysis of the data generated by this technique presents severe challenges as a video recording can include many thousands of frames. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed an image processing and analysis framework called CellSpecks, capable of detecting and fully analyzing the kinetics of ion channels within a video sequence. By using a randomly generated synthetic data, we tested the ability of CellSpecks to rapidly and efficiently detect and analyze the activity of thousands of ion channels, including openings for a few milliseconds. Here, we report the use of CellSpecks for the analysis of experimental data acquired by imaging muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the Alzheimers disease-associated amyloid beta pores with multiconductance levels in the plasma membrane of Xenopus laevis oocytes. We show that CellSpecks can accurately and efficiently generate location maps, create raw and processed fluorescence time-traces, histograms of mean open times, mean close times, open probabilities, durations, and maximum amplitudes, and a  channel chip showing the activity of all channels as a function of time. Although we specifically illustrate the application of CellSpecks for analyzing data from Ca2+ channels, it can be easily customized to analyze other spatially and temporally localized signals.",
