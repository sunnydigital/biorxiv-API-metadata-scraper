    "abstract": "Predictive models of signaling networks are essential tools for understanding cell population heterogeneity and designing rational interventions in disease. However, using network models to predict signaling dynamics heterogeneity is often challenging due to the extensive variability of signaling parameters across cell populations. Here, we describe a Maximum Entropy-based fRamework for Inference of heterogeneity in Dynamics of sIgAling Networks (MERIDIAN). MERIDIAN allows us to estimate the joint probability distribution over signaling parameters that is consistent with experimentally observed cell-to-cell variability in abundances of network species. We apply the developed approach to investigate the heterogeneity in the signaling network activated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leading to phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Using the inferred parameter distribution, we also predict heterogeneity of phosphorylated Akt levels and the distribution of EGF receptor abundance hours after EGF stimulation. We discuss how MERIDIAN can be generalized and applied to problems beyond modeling of heterogeneous signaling dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearch over the last 10 years highlights the increasing importance of hybridization between species as a major force structuring the evolution of genomes and potentially providing raw material for adaptation by natural and/or sexual selection. Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity dxy and Pattersons D. The resulting statistic, the Basic distance fraction (Bdf), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published fd and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on CRAN. The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework.\\n\\nConclusionWe present a new distance based statistic Bdf that avoids the pitfalls of Pattersons D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive effort is typically aversive, evident in peoples tendency to avoid cognitively demanding tasks. The  cost of control hypothesis suggests that engagement of cognitive control systems of the brain makes a task costly and the currency of that cost is a reduction in anticipated rewards. However, prior studies have relied on binary hard versus easy task subtractions to manipulate cognitive effort and so have not tested this hypothesis in \\\"dose-response\\\" fashion. In a sample of 50 participants, we parametrically manipulated the level of effort during fMRI scanning by systematically increasing cognitive control demands during a demand-selection paradigm over six levels. As expected, frontoparietal control network (FPN) activity increased, and reward network activity decreased, as control demands increased across tasks. However, avoidance behavior was not attributable to the change in FPN activity, lending only partial support to the cost of control hypothesis. By contrast, we unexpectedly observed that the deactivation of a task-negative brain network corresponding to the Default Mode Network (DMN) across levels of the cognitive control manipulation predicted the change in avoidance. In summary, we find partial support for the cost of control hypothesis, while highlighting the role of task-negative brain networks in modulating effort avoidance behavior.",

    "abstract": "A key decision in scientific work is whether to build on novel or well-established ideas. Because exploiting new ideas is often harder than more conventional science, novel work can be especially dependent on interactions with colleagues, the training environment, and ready access to potential collaborators. Location may thus influence the tendency to pursue work that is close to the edge of the scientific frontier in the sense that it builds on recent ideas. We calculate for each nation its position relative to the edge of the scientific frontier by measuring its propensity to build on relatively new ideas in biomedical research. Text analysis of 20+ million publications shows that the United States and South Korea have the highest tendencies for novel science. China has become a leader in favoring newer ideas when working with basic science ideas and research tools, but is still slow to adopt new clinical ideas. Many locations remain far behind the leaders in terms of their tendency to work with novel ideas, indicating that the world is far from flat in this regard.",

Glioma cells in a subset of mesenchymal tumors lose their neural lineage identity, express inflammatory genes, and co-exist with marked myeloid infiltration, reminiscent of molecular interactions between glioma and immune cells established in animal models. Additionally, we discovered a tight coupling between lineage resemblance and proliferation among malignantly transformed cells. Glioma cells that resemble oligodendrocyte progenitors, which proliferate in the brain, are often found in the cell cycle. Conversely, glioma cells that resemble astrocytes, neuroblasts, and oligodendrocytes, which are non-proliferative in the brain, are generally non-cycling in tumors.\\n\\nConclusionsThese studies reveal a relationship between cellular identity and proliferation in HGG and distinct population structures that reflects the extent of neural and non-neural lineage resemblance among malignantly transformed cells.",

    "abstract": "Non-parametric and semi-parametric resampling procedures are widely used to perform support estimation in computational biology and bioinformatics. Among the most widely used methods in this class is the standard bootstrap method, which consists of random sampling with replacement. While not requiring assumptions about any particular parametric model for resampling purposes, the bootstrap and related techniques assume that sites are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The i.i.d. assumption can be an over-simplification for many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular, sequential dependence within biomolecular sequences is often an essential biological feature due to biochemical function, evolutionary processes such as recombination, and other factors.\\n\\nTo relax the simplifying i.i.d. assumption, we propose a new non-parametric/semi-parametric sequential resampling technique that generalizes \\\"Heads-or-Tails\\\" mirrored inputs, a simple but clever technique due to Landan and Graur. The generalized procedure takes the form of random walks along either aligned or unaligned biomolecular sequences. We refer to our new method as the SERES (or \\\"SEquential RESampling\\\") method.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the flexibility of the new technique, we apply SERES to two different applications - one involving aligned inputs and the other involving unaligned inputs. Using simulated and empirical data, we show that SERES-based support estimation yields comparable or typically better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for both applications.",

    "abstract": "Ocular neovascular diseases like wet age-related macular degeneration are a major cause of blindness. Novel therapies are greatly needed for these diseases. One appealing antiangiogenic target is reduction-oxidation factor 1-apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ref-1/APE1). This protein can act as a redox-sensitive transcriptional activator for NF-{kappa}B and other pro-angiogenic transcription factors. An existing inhibitor of Ref-1s function, APX3330, previously showed antiangiogenic effects. Here, we developed improved APX3330 derivatives and assessed their antiangiogenic activity. We synthesized APX2009 and APX2014 and demonstrated enhanced inhibition of Ref-1 function in a DNA-binding assay compared to APX3330. Both compounds were antiproliferative against human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs; GI50 APX2009: 1.1 M, APX2014: 110 nM) and macaque choroidal endothelial cells (Rf/6a GI50 APX2009: 26 M, APX2014: 5.0 M). Both compounds significantly reduced the ability of HRECs and Rf/6a cells to form tubes at mid nanomolar concentrations compared to control, and both significantly inhibited HREC and Rf/6a cell migration in a scratch wound assay, reducing NF-{kappa}B activation and downstream targets. Ex vivo, both APX2009 and APX2014 inhibited choroidal sprouting at low micromolar and high nanomolar concentrations respectively. In the laser-induced choroidal neovascularization mouse model, intraperitoneal APX2009 treatment significantly decreased lesion volume by 4-fold compared to vehicle (p < 0.0001, ANOVA with Dunnetts post hoc tests), without obvious intraocular or systemic toxicity. Thus, Ref-1 inhibition with APX2009 and APX2014 blocks ocular angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo, and APX2009 is an effective systemic therapy for CNV in vivo, establishing Ref-1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for ocular neovascularization.",

    "abstract": "Automatic emotion regulation (AER) has received increasing attention. However, the effortless hypothesis of AER has yet to be directly tested and the neural mechanisms supporting AER remain unclear. Here, we addressed these two issues, by simultaneous recording behavioral assessments and functional MRI (fMRI) signals when thirty-one participants were required to watch neutral and disgust pictures in three experimental conditions: Watching, Goal Intention (GI) and Reappraisal by Implementation Intention (RII). RII decreased negative feelings and bilateral amygdala activity without engendering cognitive efforts, evidenced by the reduced self-reported efforts and less prefrontal engagement during RII compared to Watching and GI. These regulation effects should not be explained by emotional habituation, as further experiment did not show significant emotional habituation for the repetition of the same stimuli. Moreover, RII and GI produced similar functional connectivity (FC) of vACC (ventral anterior cingulate cortex) to left insula and right precuneus, corresponding to the common goal pursuit component of both strategies. Furthermore, RII relative to GI exhibited weaker FC in distributed brain networks subserving effortful control (e.g. inferior-superior parietal lobe FC), memory retrieval (e.g. inferior-middle temporal lobes and lingual-putamen FCs), aversive anticipation and emotion-related motor planning (e.g. putamen-operculum and vACC-supramarginal gyrus FCs). These findings suggest that RII downregulates disgust effortlessly, most likely mediated by the reduced online mobilization of neural systems subserving emotion-related coping.",

    "abstract": "Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a fatal disease caused by the systemic aggregation and deposition of transthyretin (TTR), a blood transporter that is mainly produced in the liver. TTR deposits are made of elongated amyloid fibrils that interfere with normal tissue function leading to organ failure. The current standard care for hereditary neuropathic ATTR is liver transplantation or stabilization of the native form of TTR by tafamidis. In our previous work, we explored an additional strategy to halt protein aggregation by capping pre-existing TTR fibrils with structure-based designed peptide inhibitors. Our best peptide inhibitor TabFH2 has shown to be effective at inhibiting not only TTR aggregation but also amyloid seeding driven by fibrils extracted from ATTR patients. Here we evaluate the effects of peptide inhibitors in two Drosophila models of neuropathic ATTR and compared their efficacy with diflunisal, a protein stabilizer currently used off-label for the treatment of ATTR. Our peptide inhibitor TabFH2 was found the most effective treatment, which resulted in motor improvement and the reduction of TTR deposition. Our in vivo study shows that inhibiting TTR deposition by peptide inhibitors may represent a therapeutic strategy for halting the progression of ATTR.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFamilial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a hereditary condition caused by the deposition of transthyretin (TTR) in nerves. Marked by progressive deficit and disability, FAP has no cure and limited therapeutic options. The replacement of the production source of mutant TTR by liver transplantation and the stabilization of native TTR by compounds, current lines of treatment, often fail to halt disease progression. Previously, we discovered that two segments of TTR drive amyloid deposition, and designed structure-based peptide inhibitors. Here we evaluate these peptide inhibitors in FAP models of Drosophila. The most efficient inhibitor resulted in an improvement of locomotor abilities and a reduction of TTR deposition. This study points to peptide inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for FAP.",

    "abstract": "Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a fatal disease caused by the systemic aggregation and deposition of transthyretin (TTR), a blood transporter that is mainly produced in the liver. TTR deposits are made of elongated amyloid fibrils that interfere with normal tissue function leading to organ failure. The current standard care for hereditary neuropathic ATTR is liver transplantation or stabilization of the native form of TTR by tafamidis. In our previous work, we explored an additional strategy to halt protein aggregation by capping pre-existing TTR fibrils with structure-based designed peptide inhibitors. Our best peptide inhibitor TabFH2 has shown to be effective at inhibiting not only TTR aggregation but also amyloid seeding driven by fibrils extracted from ATTR patients. Here we evaluate the effects of peptide inhibitors in two Drosophila models of neuropathic ATTR and compared their efficacy with diflunisal, a protein stabilizer currently used off-label for the treatment of ATTR. Our peptide inhibitor TabFH2 was found the most effective treatment, which resulted in motor improvement and the reduction of TTR deposition. Our in vivo study shows that inhibiting TTR deposition by peptide inhibitors may represent a therapeutic strategy for halting the progression of ATTR.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFamilial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a hereditary condition caused by the deposition of transthyretin (TTR) in nerves. Marked by progressive deficit and disability, FAP has no cure and limited therapeutic options. The replacement of the production source of mutant TTR by liver transplantation and the stabilization of native TTR by compounds, current lines of treatment, often fail to halt disease progression. Previously, we discovered that two segments of TTR drive amyloid deposition, and designed structure-based peptide inhibitors. Here we evaluate these peptide inhibitors in FAP models of Drosophila. The most efficient inhibitor resulted in an improvement of locomotor abilities and a reduction of TTR deposition. This study points to peptide inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for FAP.",

    "abstract": "In this work we consider a recent experimental data set describing heat conduction in living porcine tissues. Understanding this novel data set is important because porcine skin is similar to human skin. Improving our understanding of heat conduction in living skin is relevant to understanding burn injuries, which are common, painful and can require prolonged and expensive treatment. A key feature of skin is that it is layered, with different thermal properties in different layers. Since the experimental data set involves heat conduction in thin living tissues of anesthetised animals, an important experimental constraint is that the temperature within the living tissue is measured at one spatial location within the layered structure. Our aim is to determine whether this data is sufficient to reliably infer the heat conduction parameters in layered skin, and we use a simplified two-layer mathematical model of heat conduction to mimic the generation of experimental data. Using synthetic data generated at one location in the two-layer mathematical model, we explore whether it is possible to infer values of the thermal diffusivity in both layers. After this initial exploration, we then examine how our ability to infer the thermal diffusivities changes when we vary the location at which the experimental data is recorded, as well as considering the situation where we are able to monitor the temperature at two locations within the layered structure. Overall, we find that our ability to parameterise a model of heterogeneous heat conduction with limited experimental data is very sensitive to the location where data is collected. Our modelling results provide guidance about optimal experimental design that could be used to guide future experimental studies.\\n\\nNomenclatureA brief description of all variables used in the document are given in Table 1.\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@121864aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f789c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@76c62corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cca220org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a82158_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_FLOATNOTable 1:C_FLOATNO O_TABLECAPTIONVariable nomenclature and description.\\n\\nC_TABLECAPTION C_TBL",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the general problem of extracting information from spatially explicit genomic data to inform inference of ecologically and geographically realistic population models. We describe methods and apply them to simulations motivated by the demography of the Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii). The tortoise is an example of a long-lived, threatened species for which we have an excellent understanding of range, habitat preference, and certain aspects of demography, but inadequate information on other life history components that are important for conservation management. We use an individual-based model on a discretized geographic landscape with overlapping generations and age and sex-specific dispersal, fecundity, and mortality to develop and test a method that uses genomic data to infer demographic parameters. We do this by seeking parameters that best match a set of spatial statistics of genomes, which we introduce and discuss. We find that for inferring only overall population density and mean migration distance, a simple statistical learning method performs well using simulated training data, inferring parameters to within 10% accuracy. In the process, we introduce spatial analogues of common population genetics statistics, and discuss how and why they are expected to contain signal about the geography of population dynamics that are key for ecological modeling generally and conservation of endangered taxa.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of HIV-1 protein sequences should be governed by a combination of factors including nucleotide mutational probabilities, the genetic code, and fitness. The impact of these factors on protein sequence evolution are interdependent, making it challenging to infer the individual contribution of each factor from phylogenetic analyses alone. We investigated the protein sequence evolution of HIV-1 by determining an experimental fitness landscape of all individual amino acid changes in protease. We compared our experimental results to the frequency of protease variants in a publicly available dataset of 32,163 sequenced isolates from drug-naive individuals. The most common amino acids in sequenced isolates supported robust experimental fitness, indicating that the experimental fitness landscape captured key features of selection acting on protease during viral infections of hosts. Amino acid changes requiring multiple mutations from the likely ancestor were slightly less likely to support robust experimental fitness than single mutations, consistent with the genetic code favoring chemically conservative amino acid changes. Amino acids that were common in sequenced isolates were predominantly accessible by single mutations from the likely protease ancestor. Multiple mutations commonly observed in isolates were accessible by mutational walks with highly fit single mutation intermediates. Our results indicate that the prevalence of multiple base mutations in HIV-1 protease is strongly influenced by mutational sampling.",

XP-8, an endophytic fungus from the bark of Tu-Chung (EucommiaulmoidesOliv), revealed the pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) biosynthetic pathway after precursor feeding measurements and genomic annotation. To verify the pathway more accurately, [13C6]-labeled glucose and [13C6]-labeled phenylalanine were separately fed to the strain as sole substrates and [13C6]-labeled products were detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quantitative time of flight mass spectrometry. As results, [13C6]-labeled phenylalanine was found as [13C6]-cinnamylic acid and p-coumaric acid, and [13C12]-labeled pinoresinol revealed that the pinoresinol benzene ring came from phenylalanine via the phenylpropane pathway.

It was also determined that PMG was not the direct precursor of PDG in the biosynthetic pathway.

    "abstract": "Celiac disease is the most common food-induced enteropathy in humans with a prevalence of approximately 1% world-wide [1]. It is induced by digestion-resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich seed storage proteins, collectively referred to as \\\"gluten,\\\" found in wheat. Related prolamins are present in barley and rye. Both celiac disease and a related condition called non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are increasing in incidence [2] [3]. This has prompted efforts to identify methods of lowering gluten in wheat, one of the most important cereal crops. Here we used BSR-seq (Bulked Segregant RNA-seq) and map-based cloning to identify the genetic lesion underlying a recessive, low prolamin mutation (lys3a) in diploid barley. We confirmed the mutant identity by complementing the lys3a mutant with a transgenic copy of the wild type barley gene and then used TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) [4] to identify induced SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in the three homoeologs of the corresponding wheat gene. Combining inactivating mutations in the three sub-genomes of hexaploid bread wheat in a single wheat line lowered gliadin and low molecular weight glutenin accumulation by 50-60% and increased free and protein-bound lysine by 33%. This is the first report of the combination of mutations in homoeologs of a single gene that reduces gluten in wheat.",

    "abstract": "Many trematode parasites cause infection in humans and are thought to be a major public health problem. Their ecological diversity in different regions provides challenging questions on evolution of these organisms. In this report, we perform transcriptome analysis of the giant intestinal fluke, Fasciolopsis buski, using next generation sequencing technology. Short read sequences derived from polyA containing RNA of this organism were assembled into 30677 unigenes that led to the annotation of 12380 genes. Annotation of the assembled transcripts enabled insight into processes and pathways in the intestinal fluke, such as RNAi pathway and energy metabolism. The expressed kinome of the organism was characterized by identifying all protein kinases. We have also carried out whole genome sequencing and used the sequences to confirm absence of some of the genes, not observed in transcriptome data, such as genes involved in fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Transcriptome data also helped us to identify some of the expressed transposable elements. Though many Long Interspersed elements (LINEs) were identified, only two Short Interspersed Elements (SINEs) were visible. Overall transcriptome and draft genome analysis of F. buski helped us to characterize some its important biological characteristics and provided enormous resources for development of a suitable diagnostic system and anti-parasitic therapeutic molecules.",

    "abstract": "During the period from April 2012 to May 2013, 13 newborns and one child in a paediatric hospital ward in Germany were found to be colonised with a distinct clinical clone of an (extended spectrum {beta}-lactamase) (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella oxytoca. This clone was specific to this hospital and had not been previously isolated in Germany.\\n\\nA source-tracking analysis was carried out to identify the source and transmission pathways of the ESBL-producing K. oxytoca clone. A systematic environmental survey of the ward and an audit of the procedures for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, instruments, incubators, and washing machines was performed. Microbiological samples were obtained from environmental surfaces. Risk factors were analysed for epidemiological linkage.\\n\\nIsolates of an ESBL-producing K. oxytoca were found in the detergent drawer and on the rubber door seal of a washing machine and in two sinks. These strains were typed by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with the isolates from the newborns and their clothing and found to be identical. The retrospective analysis demonstrated that only newborns who had worn clothes that had been washed in the washing machine were colonised with the identical clone. After the washing machine was taken out of use, no further cases were detected over the following 4-year period.\\n\\nWe conclude that washing machines are potential reservoirs and vectors for transmission of Enterobacteriaceae, and likely other bacteria.\\n\\nImportanceWashing machines should be further investigated as possible sites for horizontal gene transfer (ESBL-/carbapenemase-genes) and cross-contamination of clinically important Gram-negative strains. Particularly in the healthcare sector, the knowledge of possible (re-) contamination of laundry (patients clothes, staff uniforms) with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria could help to prevent and control nosocomial infections. To date, the potential of the washing machine as a source and vector of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria causing an outbreak in a clinical setting has not been investigated. This report shows that sampling of washing machines should be included in environmental audits associated with outbreak control management, and conditions for the laundering of baby 64 clothing should be reviewed.",
