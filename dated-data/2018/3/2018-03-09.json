    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic data has the potential to radically redefine our view of cell type identity. Cells that were previously believed to be homogeneous are now clearly distinguishable in terms of their expression phenotype. Methods for automatically characterizing the functional identity of cells, and their associated properties, can be used to uncover processes involved in lineage differentiation as well as sub-typing cancer cells. They can also be used to suggest personalized therapies based on molecular signatures associated with pathology. We develop a new method, called ACTION, to infer the functional identity of cells from their transcriptional profile, classify them based on their dominant function, and reconstruct regulatory networks that are responsible for mediating their identity. Using ACTION, we identify novel Melanoma sub-types with differential survival rates and therapeutic responses, for which we provide biomarkers along with their underlying regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryResting state fMRI has become a ubiquitous tool for measuring connectivity in normal and diseased brains. Current dominant models of connectivity are based on coarse-scale connectivity among brain regions, ignoring fine-scale structure within those regions. We developed a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome that captures both coarse and fine-scale structure of connectivity shared across brains. We showed that this shared fine-scale structure is related to fine-scale distinctions in representation of information, and our model accounts for substantially more shared variance of connectivity compared to previous models. Our model opens new territory -- shared fine-scale structure, a dominant but mostly unexplored component of the human connectome -- for analysis and study.",

This QTL mapping approach tests for genetic loci that influence the mean of the phenotype, termed mean QTL, the variance of the phenotype, termed variance QTL, or some combination of the two, termed mean-variance QTL. It is unique in its ability to correct for variance heterogeneity arising not only from the QTL itself but also from nuisance factors, such as sex, batch, or housing. This package provides functions to conduct genome scans, run permutations to assess the statistical significance, and make informative plots to communicate results.

    "abstract": "Plant distributions can be limited by habitat-biased herbivory, but the proximate causes of such biases are rarely known. Distinguishing plant-centric from herbivore-centric mechanisms driving differential herbivory between habitats is difficult without experimental manipulation of both plants and herbivores. Here we tested alternative hypotheses driving habitat-biased herbivory in bittercress (Cardamine cordifolia), which is more abundant under shade of shrubs and trees (shade) than in nearby meadows (sun) where herbivory is intense from the specialist fly Scaptomyza nigrita. This system has served as a textbook example of habitat-biased herbivory driving a plants distribution across an ecotone, but the proximate mechanisms underlying differential herbivory are still unclear. First, we found that higher S. nigrita herbivory in sun habitats contrasts sharply with their preference to attack plants from shade habitats in laboratory choice experiments. Second, S. nigrita strongly preferred leaves in simulated sun over simulated shade habitats, regardless of plant source habitat. Thus, herbivore preference for brighter, warmer habitats overrides their preference for more palatable shade plants. This promotes the sun-biased herbivore pressure that drives the distribution of bittercress into shade habitats.",

Here we present Mixed effects modeling of Associations of Single Cells (MASC), a novel reverse single cell association strategy for testing whether case-control status influences the membership of single cells in any of multiple cellular subsets while accounting for technical confounds and biological variation. Applying MASC to mass cytometry analyses of CD4+ T cells from blood of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and controls revealed a significantly expanded population of CD4+ T cells, identified as CD27- HLA-DR+ effector memory cells, in RA patients (OR = 1.7; p = 1.1 x 10-3). The frequency of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells was similarly elevated in blood samples from a second RA patient cohort, and CD27- HLA-DR+ cell frequency decreased in RA patients who respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples from RA patients contained [~]5-fold higher frequencies of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells, which comprised [~]10% of synovial CD4+ T cells. We find that CD27- HLA-DR+ cells are abundant producers of IFN-{gamma} and also express perforin and granzyme A at elevated levels. Thus MASC identified the expansion of a unique Th1 skewed effector T cell population with cytotoxic capacity in RA.

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests cortical involvement in the control of human gait. However, the nature of corticospinal interactions remains poorly understood. We performed time-frequency analysis of electrophysiological activity acquired during treadmill and overground walking in 22 healthy, young adults. Participants walked at their preferred speed (4.2, SD 0.4 km h-1), which was matched across both gait conditions. Event-related power, corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were assessed for EEG from bilateral sensorimotor cortices and EMG from the bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Cortical power, CMC and ITC at theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies (4-45 Hz) increased during the double support phase of the gait cycle for both overground and treadmill walking. High beta (21-30 Hz) CMC and ITC of EMG was significantly increased during overground compared to treadmill walking, as well as EEG power in theta band (4-7 Hz). The phase spectra revealed positive time lags at alpha, beta and gamma frequencies, indicating that the EEG response preceded the EMG response. The parallel increases in power, CMC and ITC during double support suggest evoked responses at spinal and cortical populations rather than a modulation of ongoing corticospinal oscillatory interactions. The evoked responses are not consistent with the idea of synchronization of ongoing corticospinal oscillations, but instead suggest coordinated cortical and spinal inputs during the double support phase. Frequency-band dependent differences in power, CMC and ITC between overground and treadmill walking suggest differing neural control for the two gait modalities, emphasizing the task-dependent nature of neural processes during human walking.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe investigated cortical and spinal activity during overground and treadmill walking in healthy adults.

    "abstract": "Reference frame Transformations (RFTs) are crucial components of sensorimotor transformations in the brain. Stochasticity in RFTs has been suggested to add noise to the transformed signal due to variability in transformation parameter estimates (e.g. angle) as well as the stochastic nature of computations in spiking networks of neurons. Here, we varied the RFT angle together with the associated variability and evaluated the behavioral impact in a reaching task that required variability-dependent visual-proprioceptive multi-sensory integration. Crucially, reaches were performed with the head either straight or rolled 30deg to either shoulder and we also applied neck loads of 0 or 1.8kg (left or right) in a 3x3 design, resulting in different combinations of estimated head roll angle magnitude and variance required in RFTs. A novel 3D stochastic model of multi-sensory integration across reference frames was fitted to the data and captured our main behavioral findings: (1) neck load biased head angle estimation across all head roll orientations resulting in systematic shifts in reach errors; (2) Increased neck muscle tone led to increased reach variability, due to signal-dependent noise; (3) both head roll and neck load created larger angular errors in reaches to visual targets away from the body compared to reaches toward the body. These results show that noise in muscle spindles and stochasticity in general have a tangible effect on RFTs underlying reach planning. Since RFTs are omnipresent in the brain, our results could have implication for processes as diverse as motor control, decision making, posture / balance control, and perception.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe show that increasing neck muscle tone systematically biases reach movements. A novel 3D multisensory integration across reference frames model captures the data well and provides evidence that the brain must have online knowledge of full body geometry together with the associated variability to accurately plan reach movements.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer prognosis and response to endocrine therapy strongly depends on the expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR, respectively). Although much is known about ER gene (ESR1) regulation after hormonal stimulation, how it is regulated in hormone-free condition is not fully understood. We used ER-/PR-positive breast cancer cells to investigate the role of PR in ESR1 regulation in the absence of hormones. We show that PR binds to the low-methylated ESR1 promoter and maintains both gene expression and DNA methylation of the ESR1 locus in hormone-deprived breast cancer cells. Depletion of PR reduces ESR1 expression, with a concomitant increase in gene promoter methylation. The high amount of methylation in the ESR1 promoter of PR-depleted cells persists after the stable re-expression of PR and inhibits PR binding to this genomic region. As a consequence, the rescue of PR expression in PR-depleted cells is insufficient to restore ESR1 expression. Consistently, DNA methylation impedes PR binding to consensus progesterone responsive elements. These findings contribute to understanding the complex crosstalk between PR and ER and suggest that the analysis of ESR1 promoter methylation in breast cancer cells can help to design more appropriate targeted therapies for breast cancer patients.",

Competition among bacterial members of the nasopharynx is believed to be mediated by bacteriocins: antimicrobial toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit growth of other bacteria. Bacteriocins are also promising candidates for novel antimicrobials. Here, 14 newly-discovered bacteriocin gene clusters were identified among >6,200 pneumococcal genomes. The molecular epidemiology of the bacteriocin clusters was investigated using a large global and historical pneumococcal dataset. The analyses revealed extraordinary bacteriocin diversity among pneumococci and the majority of bacteriocin clusters were also found in other streptococcal species. Genomic hotspots for the integration of bacteriocin genes were discovered. Experimentally, bacteriocin genes were transcriptionally active when the pneumococcus was under stress and when two strains were competing in broth co-culture. These findings fundamentally expand our understanding of bacteriocins relative to intraspecies and interspecies nasopharyngeal competition.",

    "abstract": "In real-life decision-making, sub-optimal risk-taking seems characteristic of adolescents. Such behavior increases the chance of serious negative, and at times, irreversible outcomes for this population (e.g., road traffic accidents, addictions). We are still lacking conclusive evidence, however, for an inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory for risk-taking. This raises the question whether adolescents are really more risk-prone or when facing a novel risky situation, they behave just as children and adults do. To answer this question, we used the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to assess the risky decision making of 188 individuals ranging in age from 7 to 30. The BART provided useful data for characterizing multiple aspects of risk-taking. Surprisingly, we found that adolescents were not more inclined to take risks than children or young adults. Participants in all age groups were able to adapt their learning processes to the probabilistic environment and improve their performance during the sequential risky choice. There were no age-related differences in risk-taking at any stage of the task. Likewise, neither negative feedback reactivity nor overall task performance distinguished adolescents from the younger and older age groups. Our findings prompt 1) methodological considerations about the validity of the BART and 2) theoretical debate whether the amount of experience on its own may account for age-related changes in real-life risk-taking, since risk-taking in a novel and uncertain situation was invariant across developmental stages.",

    "abstract": "Individual bacterial lineages stably persist for years in the human gut microbiome1-3. However, the potential of these lineages to adapt during colonization of healthy people is not well understood2,4. Here, we assess evolution within individual microbiomes by sequencing the genomes of 602 Bacteroides fragilis isolates cultured from 12 healthy subjects. We find that B. fragilis within-subject populations contain substantial de novo nucleotide and mobile element diversity, which preserve years of within-person evolutionary history. This evolutionary history contains signatures of within-person adaptation to both subject-specific and common selective forces, including parallel mutations in sixteen genes. These sixteen genes are involved in cell-envelope biosynthesis and polysaccharide utilization, as well as yet under-characterized pathways. Notably, one of these genes has been shown to be critical for B. fragilis colonization in mice5, indicating that key genes have not already been optimized for survival in vivo. This lack of optimization, given historical signatures of purifying selection in these genes, suggests that varying selective forces with discordant solutions act upon B. fragilis in vivo. Remarkably, in one subject, two B. fragilis sublineages coexisted at a stable relative frequency over a 1.5-year period despite rapid adaptive dynamics within one of the sublineages. This stable coexistence suggests that competing selective forces can lead to B. fragilis niche-differentiation even within a single person. We conclude that B. fragilis adapts rapidly within the microbiomes of individual healthy people, providing a new route for the discovery of key genes in the microbiome and implications for microbiome stability and manipulation.",

However, this capability has often been compromised by significant sequencing, PCR and DNA preparation error rates. Here, we describe FERMI (Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification) - a novel method designed to eliminate majority of these sequencing and library preparation errors in order to significantly improve rare somatic mutation detection. This method leverages barcoded targeting probes to capture and sequence DNA of interest with single copy resolution. The variant calls from the barcoded sequencing data then further filtered in a position-dependent fashion against an adaptive, context-aware null model in order to distinguish true variants. As a proof of principle, we employ FERMI to probe bone marrow biopsies from leukemia patients, and show that rare mutations and clonal evolution can be tracked throughout cancer treatment, including during historically intractable periods like minimum residual disease. Importantly, FERMI is able to accurately detect nascent clonal expansions within leukemias in a manner that may facilitate the early detection and characterization of cancer relapse.",

It has been shown that following prism exposure, after-effects are not only restricted to the sensorimotor level but extend as well into spatial cognition. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate in healthy individuals whether expansion to spatial cognition is restricted to adaptive processes peculiar to prism adaptation or whether it occurs as well following other forms of adaptive process such as adaptation to a novel dynamic environment during pointing movements. Representational after-effects were assessed by the perceptual line bisection task before and after adaptation to a leftward or a rightward force field. The main results showed that adaptation developed at sensorimotor level but did not produce after-effects in space representation. However appropriate analysis showed that the slower a participant de-adapt to a rightward dynamic perturbation, the stronger the influence on the perceptual midline judgment during the late phase of the bisection task. The discussion highlights the commonalities between prism and dynamic adaptation on the effects on space representation.",

    "abstract": "Frequency-dependent brightness enhancement, where a flickering light can appear twice as bright as an equiluminant constant light, has been reported to exist within the alpha (8 - 12 Hz) band. Could oscillatory neural activity be driving this perceptual effect? Here, in two experiments, human subjects reported which of two flickering stimuli were brighter. Strikingly, 4 Hz stimuli were reported as brighter more than 80% of the time when compared to all other tested frequencies, even though all stimuli were equiluminant and of equal temporal length. Electroencephalography recordings showed that inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) of theta (4 Hz) was: 1) Significantly greater than alpha, contralateral to the flickering stimulus; 2) Enhanced by the presence of a second ipsilateral 4 Hz flickering stimulus; and 3) Uniquely lateralized, unlike the alpha band. Importantly, on trials with two identical stimuli (i.e. 4 Hz vs 4 Hz), the brightness discrimination judgment could be predicted by the hemispheric balance in the amount of 4 Hz ITC. We speculate that the theta rhythm plays a distinct information transfer role, where its ability to share information between hemispheres via entrainment promotes a better processing of visual information to inform a discrimination decision.",

This phenomenon has been attributed to both biological and technical sources, although the extent of the contribution of each remains unclear. Here, we show that the underlying gene presence/absence sparsity patterns are by themselves highly informative. We develop an algorithm, called DECODE, to assess the extent of joint presence/absence of genes across different cells, and to infer a gene dependency network. We show that this network captures biologically-meaningful pathways, cell-type specific modules, and connectivity patterns characteristic of complex networks. We develop a model that uses this network to discriminate biological vs. technical zeros, by exploiting each genes local network neighborhood. For inferred non-biological zeros, we build a predictive model that imputes the missing value of each gene based on activity patterns of its most informative neighbors. We show that our framework accurately infers gene-gene functional dependencies, pinpoints technical zeros, and predicts biologically-meaningful missing values in three diverse datasets.",

    "abstract": "The development of an expanded chemical space for screening is an essential step in the challenge of identifying chemical probes for new, genomic-era protein targets. However, the difficulty of identifying targets for novel compounds leads to the prioritization of synthesis linked to known active scaffolds that bind familiar protein families, slowing the exploration of available chemical space. To change this paradigm, we validated a new pipeline capable of identifying compound-protein interactions even for compounds with no similarity to known drugs. Based on differential mRNA profiles from drug treatments and gene knockdowns across multiple cell types, we show that drugs cause gene regulatory network effects that correlate with those produced by silencing their target protein-coding gene. Applying supervised machine learning to exploit compound-knockdown signature correlations and enriching our predictions using an orthogonal structure-based screen, we achieved top-10/top-100 target prediction accuracies of 26%/41%, respectively, on a validation set 152 FDA-approved drugs and 3104 potential targets. We further predicted targets for 1680 compounds and validated a total of seven novel interactions with four difficult targets, including non-covalent modulators of HRAS and KRAS. We found that drug-target interactions manifest as gene expression correlations between drug treatment and both target gene knockdown and up/down-stream knockdowns. These correlations provide biologically relevant insight on the cell-level impact of disrupting protein interactions, highlighting the complex genetic phenotypes of drug treatments. Our pipeline can accelerate the identification and development of novel chemistries with potential to become drugs by screening for compound-target interactions in the full human interactome.",

    "abstract": "Members of the KLF family of transcription factors can exert both positive and negative effects on axon regeneration in the central nervous system, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. KLF6 and -7 share nearly identical DNA binding domains and stand out as the only known growth-promoting family members. Here we confirm that similar to KLF7, expression of KLF6 declines during postnatal cortical development and that forced re-expression of KLF6 in corticospinal tract neurons of adult female mice enhances axon regeneration after cervical spinal injury. Unlike KLF7, however, these effects were achieved with wildtype KLF6, as opposed constitutively active mutants, thus simplifying the interpretation of mechanistic studies. To clarify the molecular basis of growth promotion, RNA sequencing identified 454 genes whose expression changed upon forced KLF6 expression in cortical neurons. Network analysis of these genes revealed sub-networks of downregulated genes that were highly enriched for synaptic functions, and sub-networks of upregulated genes with functions relevant to axon extension including cytoskeleton remodeling, lipid synthesis and transport, and bioenergetics. The promoter regions of KLF6-sensitive genes showed enrichment for the binding sequence of STAT3, a previously identified regeneration-associated gene. Notably, co-expression of constitutively active STAT3 along with KLF6 in cortical neurons produced synergistic increases in neurite length. Finally, genome-wide ATAC-seq footprinting detected frequent co-binding by the two factors in pro-growth gene networks, indicating co-occupancy as an underlying mechanism for the observed synergy. These findings advance understanding of KLF-stimulated axon growth and indicate functional synergy of KLF6 transcriptional effects with those of STAT3.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe failure of axon regeneration in the CNS limits recovery from damage and disease. These findings show the transcription factor KLF6 to be a potent promoter of axon growth after spinal injury, and more importantly clarify the underlying transcriptional changes. In addition, bioinformatics analysis predicted a functional interaction between KLF6 and a second transcription factor, STAT3, and genome-wide footprinting confirmed frequent co-occupancy. Co-expression of the two factors yielded synergistic elevation of neurite growth in primary neurons. These data point the way toward novel transcriptional interventions to promote CNS regeneration.",

Here, we report an X-ray crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit decoding complex to 3.45 [A] resolution using data obtained at ambient temperature at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). We find that this ambient-temperature structure is largely consistent with existing cryogenic-temperature crystal structures, with key residues of the decoding complex exhibiting similar conformations, including adenosine residues 1492 and 1493. Minor variations were observed, namely an alternate conformation of cytosine 1397 near the mRNA channel and the A-site. Our serial crystallography experiment illustrates the amenability of ribosomal microcrystals to routine structural studies at ambient temperature, thus overcoming a long-standing experimental limitation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe Windover mortuary pond dates to the Early Archaic period (6,800-5,200 years ago) and constitutes one of the earliest archaeological sites with intact and well-preserved human remains in North America. Unlike many prehistoric egalitarian hunter-gatherers, the Windover people may not have practiced a sex-based division of labor, rather they may have shared the load. We explore how mobility and subsistence, as reconstructed from archaeological data, influenced hand and foot bone morphology at Windover.\\n\\nMethodsWe took length and width measurements on four carpal bones, four tarsal bones, and load- bearing tarsal areas (calcaneus load arm, trochlea of the talus). We analyzed lateralization using side differences in raw length and width measurements. For other hypothesis testing, we used log transformed length-width ratios to mitigate the confounding effects of sexual dimorphism and trait size variation; we tested between-sex differences in weight-bearing (rear foot) and shock-absorbing (mid foot) tarsal bones and between-sex differences in carpal bones.\\n\\nResultsWe identified no significant between-sex differences in rear and midfoot areas, suggesting similar biomechanical stresses. We identified no significant between-sex differences in carpal bones but the test was under-powered due to small sample sizes. Finally, despite widespread behavioral evidence on contemporary populations for human hand and foot lateralization, we found no evidence of either handedness or footedness.\\n\\nDiscussionThe lack evidence for footedness was expected due its minimal impact on walking gait but the lack of evidence for handedness was surprising given that ethnographic studies have shown strong handedness in hunter-gatherers during tool and goods manufacture. The reconstructed activity patterns suggested both sexes engaged in heavy load carrying and a shared division of labor. Our results support previous findings--both sexes had stronger weight-bearing bones. While male shock-absorbing bones exhibited a trend towards greater relative width (suggesting greater comparative biomechanical stress), this may simply some lingering hunting behavior with males walking greater distances at higher speeds than females. While there were no significant between-sex differences in carpal bones (supporting a shared work load model), females exhibited greater variation in index values, which may reflect a greater variety of and specialization in tasks compared to males. Because carpals and tarsals are so well- preserved at archaeological sites, we had surmised they might be useful proxies for activity in the absence of well-preserved long bones. Tarsals provide a stronger signal of past activity and may be useful in the absence or, or in addition to, preferred bones. Carpals, however, may not be useful as the effect size of biomechanical stress (in this study at least) is low and would require larger samples than may be possible at archaeological sites.",

    "abstract": "The neuroscientific study of human navigation has been con-strained by the prerequisite of traditional brain imaging studies that re-quire participants to remain stationary. Such imaging approaches neglect a central component that characterizes navigation -the multisensory ex-perience of self-movement. Navigation by active movement through space combines multisensory perception with internally generated self-motion cues. We investigated the spatial micro genesis during free ambulatory exploration of interactive sparse virtual environments using motion cap-ture synchronized to high resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) data as well psychometric and self-report measures. In such environments, map-like allocentric representations must be constructed out of transient, egocentric first-person perspective 3-D spatial information. Considering individual differences of spatial learning ability, we studied if changes in exploration behavior coincide with spatial learning of an environment. To this end, we analyzed the quality of sketch maps (a description of spatial learning) that were produced after repeated learning trials for differently complex maze environments. We observed significant changes in active exploration behavior from the first to the last exploration of a maze: a decrease in time spent in the maze predicted an increase in subsequent sketch map quality. Furthermore, individual differences in spatial abilities as well as differences in the level of experienced immersion revealed an impact on the quality of spatial learning. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to observe behavioral changes associated with spatial learning, opening the way to the study of cortical dynamics of navigation.",

Disrupting the link is associated with diseases such as cancer and muscular dystrophy. Proteolysis of dystroglycan by Matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs) also breaks the mechanical anchor and is amplified in several pathogenic states. We use a combination of biochemical and cell-based assays to show that dystroglycan proteolysis is conformationally regulated by an extracellular, juxtamembrane \\\"proteolysis domain\\\", comprised of tandem Ig-like and SEA-like domains. The intact proteolysis domain is resistant to MMP cleavage, but structurally-disruptive muscular dystrophy-related mutations sensitize dystroglycan to proteolysis. Moreover, increased dystroglycan proteolysis correlates with faster cell migration, linking proteolysis to a disease-relevant cellular phenotype. Intriguingly, previously uncharacterized cancer-associated mutations that map to the proteolysis domain similarly lead to increases in proteolysis and rates of cell migration, potentially revealing a new pathogenic mechanism in cancer.",

    "abstract": "The predominant structural protein in vertebrates is collagen, which plays a key role in extracellular matrix and connective tissue mechanics. Despite its prevalence and physical importance in biology, the mechanical properties of molecular collagen are far from established. The flexibility of its triple helix is unresolved, with descriptions from different experimental techniques ranging from flexible to semirigid. Furthermore, it is unknown how collagen type (homo-vs. heterotrimeric) and source (tissue-derived vs. recombinant) influence flexibility. Using SmarTrace, a chain tracing algorithm we devised, we performed statistical analysis of collagen conformations collected with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the proteins mechanical properties. Our results show that types I, II and III collagens - the key fibrillar varieties - exhibit molecular flexibilities that are very similar. However, collagen conformations are strongly modulated by salt, transitioning from compact to extended as KCl concentration increases, in both neutral and acidic pH. While analysis with a standard worm-like chain model suggests that the persistence length of collagen can attain almost any value within the literature range, closer inspection reveals that this modulation of collagens conformational behaviour is not due to changes in flexibility, but rather arises from the induction of curvature (either intrinsic or induced by interactions with the mica surface). By modifying standard polymer theory to include innate curvature, we show that collagen behaves as an equilibrated curved worm-like chain (cWLC) in two dimensions. Analysis within the cWLC model shows that collagens curvature depends strongly on pH and salt, while its persistence length does not. Thus, we find that triple-helical collagen is well described as semiflexible, irrespective of source, type, pH and salt environment. These results demonstrate that collagen is more flexible than its conventional description as a rigid rod, which may have implications for its cellular processing and secretion.",

Dissecting this complex, highly integrated physiology requires model systems which accurately recapitulate key aspects of human response to exercise, yet permit rapid and unbiased genetic interrogation of relevant pathways. The zebrafish has emerged as a new model for cancer due to its high resolution in vivo imaging and capacity for large-scale, unbiased screening approaches. Here, we have developed a set of tools to study the effects of exercise in a zebrafish model of melanoma. Using a flow chamber, we studied the effects of endurance exercise bouts (3-6 hour/d, 5d/wk for 1 to 3 wks) in both larval and adult zebrafish. The regimen was well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities or changes in survival. When the zebrafish were transplanted with ZMEL1-GFP melanoma cells, we found that endurance exercise over a 2-week period led to a significant decrease in cancer growth in the larval zebrafish. As zebrafish cancer models show strong conservation in human disease, our findings have direct application to understanding the human exercise/cancer relationship.",

Remarkably, supplementing nhr-1(RNAi) animals with either bacterial Acyl-CoA synthetase or the lipid metabolite Acetyl-CoA rescued the phenotype restoring the maintenance and function of the hermaphroditic RS. Our findings uncovered a likely evolutionarily conserved role for nuclear hormone receptors and lipid metabolism in the regulation of stem and progenitor cells required for the long-term maintenance and regeneration of animal reproductive organs, tissues and cells.",

    "abstract": "It has increasingly become clear over the last two decades that proteins can contain both globular domains and intrinsically unfolded regions which both can contribute to function. While equally interesting, the disordered regions are difficult to study because they usually do not crystallize unless bound to partners and are not easily amenable to cryo-electron microscopy studies. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy remains the best technique to capture the structural features of intrinsically mixed folded proteins and describe their dynamics. These studies rely on the successful assignment of the spectrum, task not easy per se given the limited spread of the resonances of the disordered residues. Here, we describe assignment of the spectrum of ataxin-3, the protein responsible for the neurodegenerative Machado-Joseph disease. We used a 42 kDa construct containing a globular N-terminal josephin domain and a C-terminal tail which comprises thirteen polyglutamine repeats within a low-complexity region. We developed a strategy which allowed us to achieve 87% assignment of the spectrum. We show that the C-terminal tail is flexible with extended helical regions and interacts only marginally with the rest of the protein. We could also, for the first time, deduce the structure of the polyglutamine repeats within the context of the full-length protein and show that it has a strong helical propensity stabilized by the preceding region.",

    "abstract": "Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation is a widely used technology for cryopreservation of genetic resources. One challenging limitation of this technology is the cell damage during freezing associated with the intracellular lipid droplets. We exploit a Raman spectroscopy to investigate the freezing of cumulus-oocyte complexes, mature oocytes and early embryos of a domestic cat. All these cells are rich in lipids. The degree of lipid unsaturation, lipid phase transition from liquid-like disordered to solid-like ordered state (main transition) and triglyceride polymorphic state are studied. For all cells examined, the average degree of lipid unsaturation is estimated about 1.3 (with {+/-}20 % deviation) double bonds per acyl chain. The onset of the main lipid phase transition occurs in a temperature range from -10 to +4 {degrees}C and does not depend significantly on the cell type. It is found that lipid droplets in cumulus-oocyte complexes undergo an abrupt lipid crystallization, which not completely correlate with the ordering of lipid molecule acyl chains. In the case of mature oocytes and early embryos obtained in vitro from cumulus-oocyte complexes, the lipid phase transition is broadened. In frozen state lipid droplets inside the cumulus-oocyte complexes have higher content of triglyceride polymorphic {beta} and {beta}' phases ([~]66%) than it is estimated for the mature oocytes and the early embryos ([~]50%). For the first time, to our knowledge, temperature evolution of lipid droplets phase state is examined. Raman spectroscopy is proved as a prospective tool for in situ monitoring of lipid phase state in single embryo/oocyte during freezing.",

    "abstract": "Faithful chromosome segregation depends on the ability of sister kinetochores to attach to spindle microtubules. An outer layer of the kinetochore known as the fibrous corona transiently expands in early mitosis and disassembles upon microtubule capture. Neither the functional importance nor the mechanistic basis for this are known. Here we show that the dynein adaptor Spindly and the RZZ kinetochore complex drive fibrous corona formation in a dynein-independent manner. C-terminal farnesylation and MPS1 kinase activity cause conformational changes of Spindly that promote oligomerization of RZZ:Spindly complexes into a corona-like meshwork in cells and in vitro. Concurrent with corona expansion, Spindly potentiates corona shedding by recruiting dynein via three conserved short linear motifs. Expanded, non-sheddable fibrous coronas engage in extensive, long-lived lateral microtubule interactions that persist to metaphase and result in fused sister kinetochores, formation of merotelic attachments and chromosome segregation errors in anaphase. Thus, dynamic kinetochore size regulation in mitosis is coordinated by a single, Spindly-based mechanism that promotes initial microtubule capture and subsequent correct maturation of attachments.",

We demonstrate that RNAPII transcription across gene promoters represses their function in plants. This repression is characterized by reduced promoter-specific molecular signatures and increased molecular signatures associated with RNAPII elongation. The FACT histone chaperone complex is required for this repression mechanism. Genome-wide mapping of Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) reveals thousands of discrete intragenic TSS positions in FACT mutants. Histone 3 lysine 4 mono-methylation poises exonic sites to initiate RNAPII transcription in FACT mutants. Uncovering the mechanism for intragenic TSS repression through the act of RNAPII elongation has important implications for understanding pervasive RNAPII transcription and the regulation of transcript isoform diversity.",

Ghana is one of the developing African countries where the prevalence of diabetes is increasing. Moreover, many cases remained undiagnosed, when along with per-diabetic cases they can be easily detected. Pre-diabetes condition occurs when blood sugar levels are higher than normal but are not high enough to be classified as diabetes, and it is still reversible.\\n\\nMethodsThis study proposes a novel method to increase diabetes and pre-diabetes detection, and to find new behavioral determinants related in rural Ghana. The screening approach was based on tests performed pro-actively by community nurses using glucometers and mobile phone apps. As a pilot for future policies, those glycemic tests were carried out on 101 subjects from rural communities in Ghana deemed at risk and unaware of their diabetic/pre-diabetic status. A comparison of dietary and lifestyle habits of the screened people was conducted in regards to a cohort of 103 diabetic patients from the same rural communities.\\n\\nResultsThe pilot screening detected 2 diabetic subjects (2% of the cohort) showing WHO diabetic glycemic values, and 20 pre-diabetic subjects (19.8% of the cohort) which showed the effectiveness of the user-friendliness approach. The need of further campaigns on alcohol consumption and physical activities has emerged even for the rural areas.\\n\\nConclusionsPolicies based on prevention screening as reported in the manuscript have the potential to reduce diabetes incidence and its related health-care costs in the country.\\n\\nTrial registrationNoguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research-IRB Study Number: 076/13-14 registered on 20.02.2017",

    "abstract": "Increasing environmental temperatures are predicted to have increasingly severe and deleterious effects on biodiversity. For the most part, the impacts of a warming environment are presumed to be direct, however some predict increasingly severe disease epidemics, primarily from vector-borne pathogens, that will have the capacity to deplete host populations. Data to support this hypothesis are lacking. Here we describe increasing severity of ranavirosis driven by increasing temperature affecting a widely distributed amphibian host. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that increasing environmental temperature leads to increased propagation of ranavirus and, in the latter, increased incidence of host infection and mortality. Also, temperature was shown to be a key determinant of disease dynamics in wild amphibians, raising the odds and severity of disease incidents. The direction of this effect was highly consistent in the context of other interacting variables such as shading around ponds. Projections based on future climate indicate that changes in seasonal weather in the UK will result in the increased incidence of severe cases of ranavirosis in amphibian populations that could affect recruitment. These complementary lines of evidence present a clear case of direct environmental modulation of a host-pathogen interaction and provide information for proposing mitigation actions.",

    "abstract": "Autism is a diagnostic label based on behavior. While the diagnostic criteria attempts to maximize clinical consensus, it also masks a wide degree of heterogeneity between and within individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Understanding this multi-level heterogeneity is of high clinical and translational importance. Here we present organizing principles to frame the work examining multi-level heterogeneity in autism. Theoretical concepts such as  spectrum or  autisms reflect non-mutually exclusive explanations regarding continuous/dimensional or categorical/qualitative variation between and within individuals. However, common practices of small sample size studies and case-control models are suboptimal for tackling heterogeneity. Big data is an important ingredient for furthering our understanding heterogeneity in autism. In addition to being  feature-rich, big data should be both  broad (i.e. large sample size) and  deep (i.e. multiple levels of data collected on the same individuals). These characteristics help ensure the results from a population are more generalizable and facilitate evaluation of the utility of different models of heterogeneity. A models utility can be shown by its ability to explain clinically or mechanistically important phenomena, but also by explaining how variability manifests across different levels of analysis. The directionality for explaining variability across levels can be bottom-up or top-down, and should include the importance of development for characterizing change within individuals. While progress can be made with  supervised models built upon a priori or theoretically predicted distinctions or dimensions of importance, it will become increasingly important to complement such work with unsupervised data-driven discoveries that leverage unknown and multivariate distinctions within big data. Without a better understanding of how to model heterogeneity between autistic people, progress towards the goal of precision medicine may be limited.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding goal of systems neuroscience is to quantitatively describe how the brain integrates cues from multiple modalities over time. Here we develop a closed-loop orienting paradigm in Drosophila to study the algorithms by which stimuli from different modalities are combined during ongoing navigation. We show that flies faced with an attractive visual and an aversive mechanosensory cue exhibit sequential responses, first turning away from the co-localized stimuli before turning back toward them. We also find that the presence of the aversive cue slows flies turns toward the attractive target, suggesting that conflicting unimodal turn commands are summed to produce multisensory turns of intermediate velocity. We then test a series of computational frameworks and find that integration is best described by a model in which multimodal stimuli are continuously and dynamically scaled, converted into turn commands, and then summed to produce ongoing orientation behavior.",

    "abstract": "Animals rely on an internal sense of body position and movement to effectively control motor behavior. This sense of proprioception relies on diverse populations of mechanosensory neurons distributed throughout the body. However, little is known about how proprioceptor neurons collectively encode sensory stimuli. Here, we investigate neural coding of leg proprioception in Drosophila, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of proprioceptors during controlled movements of the fly tibia. We found that the axons of leg proprioceptors are organized into distinct functional projections that contain topographic representations of specific kinematic features. Using subtype-specific genetic driver lines, we show that one group of axons encodes tibia position (flexion/extension), another encodes movement direction, and a third encodes bidirectional movement and vibration frequency. Thus, proprioceptive sensing of a single leg joint is mediated by multiple subtypes of specialized sensory neurons. This architecture may help to maximize information transmission, processing speed, and robustness, which are critical for feedback control of the limbs during locomotion.",

    "abstract": "The significant contribution of structural variants to function, disease, and evolution is widely reported. However, in many cases, the mechanism by which these variants contribute to the phenotype is not well understood. Recent studies reported structural variants that disrupted the three-dimensional genome structure by fusing two topologically associating domains (TADs), such that enhancers from one TAD interacted with genes from the other TAD, and could cause severe developmental disorders. However, no computational method exists for directly scoring and ranking structural variations based on their effect on the three-dimensional structure such as the TAD disruption to guide further studies of their biological function. In this paper, we formally define TAD fusion and provide a combinatorial approach for assigning a score to quantify the level of TAD fusion for each deletion denoted as TAD fusion score. We also show that our method outperforms the approaches which use predicted TADs and overlay the deletion on them to predict TAD fusion. Furthermore, we show that deletions that cause TAD fusion are rare and under negative selection in general population. Finally, we show that our method correctly gives higher scores to deletions reported to cause various disorders (developmental disorder and cancer) in comparison to the deletions reported in the 1000 genomes project.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of ribosome profiling to map actively translating ribosomes has laid the foundation for a diverse range of studies on translational regulation. The data obtained with different variations of this assay is typically manually processed, which has created a need for tools that would streamline and standardize processing steps.\\n\\nWe present Shoelaces, a toolkit for ribosome profiling experiments automating read selection and filtering to obtain genuine translating footprints. Based on periodicity, favoring enrichment over the coding regions, it determines the read lengths corresponding to bona fide ribosome protected fragments. The specific codon under translation (P-site) is determined by automatic offset calculations resulting in sub-codon resolution. Shoelaces provides both a user-friendly graphical interface for interactive visualisation in a genome browser-like fashion and a command line interface for integration into automated pipelines. We process 79 libraries and show that studies typically discard excessive amounts of data in their manual analysis pipelines.\\n\\nShoelaces streamlines ribosome profiling analysis offering automation of the processing, a range of interactive visualization features and export of the data into standard formats. Shoelaces stores all processing steps performed in an XML file that can be used by other groups to exactly reproduce the processing of a given study. We therefore anticipate that Shoelaces can aid researchers by automating what is typically performed manually and contribute to the overall reproducibility of studies.

    "abstract": "Unsaturated fatty acids are found in humans predominantly in the cis configuration. Fatty acids in the trans configuration are primarily the result of human processing (trans fats), but can also be formed endogenously by radical stress. The cis-trans isomerization of fatty acids by free radicals could be connected to several pathologies. Trans fats have been linked to an increased risk of coronary artery disease; however, the reasons for the resulting pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we investigate the effect of a mono trans isomer of arachidonic acid (C20:4-5trans,8cis,11cis,14cis) produced by free radicals in physiological concentration on a model erythrocyte membrane using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of two model lipid bilayers containing arachidonic acid and its 5-trans isomer in 3% mol. were carried out for this purpose. The 5-trans isomer formation in the phospholipids was catalyzed by HOCH2CH2S* radicals, generated from the corresponding thiol by {gamma}-irradiation, in multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) of SAPC. Large unilamellar vesicles were made by the extrusion method (LUVET) as a biomimetic model for cis-trans isomerization. Atomic Force Microscopy and Dynamic Light Scattering were used to measure the average size, morphology, and the z-potential of the liposomes. Both results from MD simulations and experiments are in agreement and indicate that the two model membranes display different physicochemical properties in that the bilayers containing the trans fatty acids were more ordered and more rigid than those containing solely the cis arachidonic acid. Correspondingly, the average size of the liposomes containing trans isomers was smaller than the ones without.",

    "abstract": "Species extinctions undermine ecosystem functioning but species do not disappear at random. Ecosystem dynamics are ruled by a subset of dominant species, but it is not clear how losing several of these key species would affect plant-pollinator interactions. We tested how the experimental loss of the most highly visited generalist plants would affect flower visitor abundances (visitation) and pollinator effectiveness (quantity of pollen-tubes within pistils) in several sites. Significant changes in the plant-pollinator communities were detected. Firstly, visitation decreased after removing 1-2 most visited plants, suggesting that these species mostly facilitate other plants by keeping high flower visitor abundances in the sites. Nevertheless, we recorded within-site variations of these trends, especially among sampled transects and among plant species, suggesting that complex facilitation-competition interactions occur among plants, but that these vary among transects within the same sites. Pollinator effectiveness fluctuated but not in a clear linear way and was not directly linked to changes of flower visitation. This suggests that fluctuations of pollinator effectiveness might be due to destabilization of the pollinators by the removal of key resources. In addition, we detected a constrained flexibility of the foraging of flower visitors because they did not switch among flower shapes and they favoured specific plant traits such as high sugar content, small inflorescences and taller plants. Indeed, these constraints would eventually limit utilisation of new resources after perturbations, possibly undermining the stability of the system. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that the loss of dominant, highly generalist plants alters plant-pollinator interactions with implications for pollination and insect foraging. Therefore, in order to preserve ecosystems, generalist plants should not get lost, because they sustain the complex pattern of interactions between plants and flower visitors.",

    "abstract": "Advances in the timing of reproduction in temperate species are some of the most well documented biotic responses to increasing global temperatures. However, the magnitude and rate of these advances in timing are not equal across all taxonomic groups. These differences can lead to disruption of interspecific relationships if species respond differently to temperature changes. Understanding the relationship between temperature and phenology is a key step in predicting future population trends for species living in seasonal environments. However, experimentally manipulating temperature in the wild is logistically challenging and has consequently rarely been attempted. In this study we experimentally test whether in-nest temperatures in early spring act as a cue for breeding phenology in a population of wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We split nests into three treatments; heated, cooled, and control. In-nest temperature in the heated and cooled boxes was manipulated by an average of {+/-} 0.6 {degrees}C from control temperatures using heating devices and ice packs respectively. We assessed the impact of our experimental manipulation on box occupancy and reproductive timing. We found trends towards earlier phenology in heated nest boxes in addition to a higher occupancy rate in cooled boxes, however neither of these trends was found to be statistically significant. Our ability to distinguish statistical signals was hampered by unexpectedly low occupancy rates across all experimental treatments. Based on the results we cannot say if nocturnal in-nest temperature is an important cue for nest box choice or the timing of laying.",

Recent findings in the field suggest that social-emotional variables can influence such changes. Since body ownership is a mechanism that enables subjects to organise information about the environment and interact efficiently in it, changes in body ownership should have important implications for social power. In the current study, we investigated whether 0.5mg of testosterone, a steroid hormone strongly implicated in the achievement of power and dominance, affected the RHI. Forty-nine females participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment in which the RHI was induced. Compared to placebo, testosterone had no effects on the usual alteration of subjective ownership over the rubber limb or on subjective sense of proprioceptive drift. However, unlike the placebo group, testosterone-treated participants did not display an objective decline in the temperature of their own (hidden) hand following induction of the illusion. These findings suggest that testosterone strengthens implicit but not explicit bodily self-representations. We propose that effective maintenance of implicit body boundaries can be regarded, conceptually, as a primary defensive state facilitating integrity of the self.",

The importance of fast synaptic recruitment, action potential initiation and repolarization, and rapid synchronous GABA release by PV+ cells is well established. In contrast, the functional significance of PV+ cell NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which generate relatively slow postsynaptic currents, is unclear. Underlining their importance, several studies implicate PV+ cell NMDAR disruption in impaired network function and circuit pathologies. Here, we show that dendritic NMDARs underlie supralinear integration of feedback excitation from local pyramidal neurons onto mouse CA1 PV+ cells. Furthermore, by incorporating NMDARs at feedback connections onto PV+ cells in spiking networks, we show that these receptors enable cooperative recruitment of PV+ interneurons, strengthening and stabilising principal cell assemblies. Failure of this phenomenon provides a parsimonious explanation for cognitive and sensory gating deficits in pathologies with impaired PV+ NMDAR signalling.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing networks have been identified in over one hundred bacterial species to date. A subset of these networks regulate group behaviors, such as bioluminescence, virulence, and biofilm formation, by sending and receiving small molecules called homoserine lactones (HSLs). Bioengineers have incorporated quorum sensing pathways into genetic circuits to connect logical operations. However, the development of higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by crosstalk, in which one quorum sensing network responds to HSLs produced by a different network. Here, we report the construction and characterization of a library of ten synthases including some that are expected to produce HSLs that are incompatible with the Lux pathway, and therefore show no crosstalk. We demonstrated their function in a common lab chassis, Escherichia coli BL21, and in two contexts, liquid and solid agar cultures, using decoupled Sender and Receiver pathways. We observed weak or strong stimulation of a Lux Receiver by longer-chain or shorter-chain HSL-generating Senders, respectively. We also considered the under-investigated risk of unintentional release of incompletely deactivated HSLs in biological waste. We found that HSL-enriched media treated with bleach is still bioactive, while autoclaving deactivates LuxR induction. This work represents the most extensive comparison of quorum sensing synthases to date and greatly expands the bacterial signaling toolkit while recommending practices for disposal based on empirical, quantitative evidence.",

These patterns provide insights into the factors that facilitate or constrain the diversity of genetic responses that contribute to adaptive evolution. A first step in studying such factors is to quantify the observed amount of repeatability relative to expectations under a null hypothesis. Here, we formulate a novel metric to quantify the constraints driving the observed amount of repeated adaptation in pairwise contrasts based on the hypergeometric distribution, and then generalize this for simultaneous analysis of multiple lineages. This metric is explicitly based on the probability of observing a given amount of repeatability by chance under an arbitrary null hypothesis, and is readily compared among different species and types of trait. We also formulate a metric to quantify the effective proportion of genes in the genome that have the potential to contribute to adaptation. As an example of how these metrics can be used to draw inferences, we assess the amount of repeatability observed in existing datasets on adaptation to antibiotics in yeast and climate in conifers. This approach provides a method to test a wide range of hypotheses about how different kinds of factors can facilitate or constrain the diversity of genetic responses observed during adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Circular dichroism spectroscopy is a highly sensitive, but low-resolution technique to study the structure of proteins. Combined with molecular modelling or other complementary techniques, CD spectroscopy can provide essential information at higher resolution. To this end, we introduce a new computational method to calculate the electronic circular dichroism spectra of proteins from a structural model or ensemble using the average secondary structure composition and a pre-calculated set of basis spectra. We compared the predictive power of our method to existing algorithms - namely DichroCalc and PDB2CD - and found that it predicts CD spectra more accurately, with a 50% smaller average deviation from the measured CD spectra. Our results indicate that the derived basis sets are robust to experimental errors in the reference spectra and to the choice of the secondary structure classification algorithm. For over 80% of the globular reference proteins, our basis sets accurately predict the experimental spectrum solely from their secondary structure composition. For the remaining 20%, correcting for intensity normalization considerably improves the prediction power. Additionally, we show that the predictions for short peptides and intrinsically disordered proteins strongly benefit from accounting for side-chain contributions and structural flexibility.\n\nTable Of Content Graphics\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1d73forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3aaa8forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193c090org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1474f92org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b920da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "We used super-resolution microscopy to investigate the role of macromolecular telomere structure in chromosome end protection. In murine and human cells with reduced TRF2, we find that ATM-activation at chromosome ends occurs with a structural change from t-loops to linearized chromosome ends through t-loop unfolding. Comparably, we find Aurora B kinase regulates telomere linearity concurrent with ATM activation at telomeres during mitotic arrest. Using a separation of function allele, we find that the TRFH domain of TRF2 regulates t-loop formation while suppressing ATM activity. Notably, we demonstrate that telomere linearity and ATM activation occur separately from telomere fusion via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Further, we show that linear DDR-positive telomeres can remain resistant to fusion, even during an extended G1-arrest when NHEJ is most active. Collectively, these results suggest t-loops act as conformational switches that regulate ATM activation at chromosome ends independent of mechanisms to suppress chromosome end fusion.",

    "abstract": "Although cortical interneurons are apparently well-placed to suppress seizures, several recent reports have highlighted a paradoxical role of parvalbumin-positive perisomatic-targeting (PV+) interneurons in ictogenesis. Here, we use an acute in vivo model of focal cortical seizures in awake behaving mice, together with closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of PV+ interneurons, to investigate their function during seizures. We show that photo-depolarization of PV+ interneurons rapidly switches from an anti-ictal to a pro-ictal effect within a few seconds of seizure initiation. The pro-ictal effect of delayed photostimulation of PV+ interneurons was not shared with dendrite-targeting somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons. We also show that this switch can be prevented by overexpression of the neuronal potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2 in principal cortical neurons. These results suggest that strategies aimed at improving the ability of principal neurons to maintain intracellular chloride levels in the face of excessive network activity can prevent interneurons from contributing to seizure perpetuation.",

    "abstract": "Gamma-band oscillations are implicated in modulation of attention and integration of sensory information. The finding that cross-regional coherence varies with task and performance suggests a role for gamma oscillations in flexible communication among anatomically connected brain areas. How networks become entrained is incompletely understood. Specifically, it is unclear how the spectral and temporal characteristics of network oscillations can be altered on rapid timescales needed for efficient communication. We use closed-loop optogenetic modulation of principal cell excitability to interrogate the dynamical properties of hippocampal oscillations. Gamma frequency and amplitude can be modulated bi-directionally, and dissociated, by phase-advancing or delaying optogenetic feedback to pyramidal cells. Closed-loop modulation alters the synchrony rather than average frequency of action potentials, in principle avoiding disruption of population rate-coding of information. Modulation of phasic excitatory currents in principal neurons is sufficient to manipulate oscillations, suggesting that feed-forward excitation of pyramidal cells has an important role in determining oscillatory dynamics and the ability of networks to couple with one another.",

    "abstract": "Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play increasingly appreciated gene-regulatory roles. Here, we describe a regulatory network centered on four ncRNAs--a long ncRNA, a circular RNA, and two microRNAs--using gene editing in mice to probe the molecular consequences of disrupting key components of this network. The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more efficient than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables the accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671. Thus, several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSA long noncoding RNA, a circular RNA, and two microRNAs form a regulatory network\\n\\nThe Cyrano long noncoding RNA directs potent, multiple-turnover destruction of miR-7\\n\\nUnchecked miR-7 prevents accumulation of Cdr1as circular RNA in cytoplasm of neurons miR-7 prevents this accumulation by enhancing the miR-671-directed slicing of Cdr1as",

    "abstract": "During terminal erythropoiesis, the splicing machinery in differentiating erythroblasts executes a robust intron retention (IR) program that impacts expression of hundreds of genes. We studied IR mechanisms in the SF3B1 splicing factor gene, which expresses ~50% of its transcripts in late erythroblasts as a nuclear isoform that retains intron 4. RNA-seq analysis of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-inhibited cells revealed previously undescribed splice junctions, rare or not detected in normal cells, that connect constitutive exons 4 and 5 to highly conserved cryptic cassette exons within the intron. Minigene splicing reporter assays showed that these cassettes promote IR. Genome-wide analysis of splice junction reads demonstrated that cryptic noncoding cassettes are much more common in large (>1kb) retained introns than they are in small retained introns or in non-retained introns. Functional assays showed that heterologous cassettes can promote retention of intron 4 in the SF3B1 splicing reporter. Although many of these cryptic exons were spliced inefficiently, they exhibited substantial binding of U2AF1 and U2AF2 adjacent to their splice acceptor sites. We propose that these exons function as decoys that engage the intron-terminal splice sites, blocking cross-intron interactions required for excision. Developmental regulation of decoy function underlies a major component of the erythroblast IR program.",

    "abstract": "Online resources enable unfettered access to and analysis of scientific data and are considered crucial for the advancement of modern science. Despite the clear power of online data resources, including web-available databases, proliferation can be problematic due to challenges in sustainability and long-term persistence. As areas of research become increasingly dependent on access to collections of data, an understanding of the scientific communitys capacity to develop and maintain such resources is needed.\\n\\nThe advent of the Internet coincided with expanding adoption of database technologies in the early 1990s, and the molecular biology community was at the forefront of using online databases to broadly disseminate data. The journal Nucleic Acids Research has long published articles dedicated to the description of online databases, as either debut or update articles. Snapshots throughout the entire history of online databases can be found in the pages of Nucleic Acids Research s \\\"Database Issue.\\\" Given the prominence of the Database Issue in the molecular biology and bioinformatics communities and the relative rarity of consistent historical documentation, database articles published in Database Issues provide a particularly unique opportunity for longitudinal analysis.\\n\\nTo take advantage of this opportunity, the study presented here first identifies each unique database described in 3055 Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue articles published between 1991-2016 to gather a rich dataset of databases debuted during this time frame, regardless of current availability. In total, 1727 unique databases were identified and associated descriptive statistics were gathered for each, including year debuted in a Database Issue and the number of all associated Database Issue publications and accompanying citation counts. Additionally, each database identified was assessed for current availability through testing of all associated URLs published. Finally, to assess maintenance, database websites were inspected to determine the last recorded update. The resulting work allows for an examination of the overall historical trends, such as the rate of database proliferation and attrition as well as an evaluation of citation metrics and on-going database maintenance.",
