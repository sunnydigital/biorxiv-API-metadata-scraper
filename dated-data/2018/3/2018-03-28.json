    "abstract": "Mitochondria are essential organelles, found within eukaryotic cells, which contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has traditionally been used in population genetic and biogeographic studies as a maternally-inherited and evolutionary-neutral genetic marker. However, it is now clear that polymorphisms within the mtDNA sequence are routinely non-neutral, and furthermore several studies have suggested that such mtDNA polymorphisms are also sensitive to thermal selection. These observations led to the formulation of the \\\"mitochondrial climatic adaptation\\\" hypothesis, for which all published evidence to date is correlational. Here, we use laboratory-based experimental evolution in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to test whether thermal selection can shift population frequencies of two mtDNA haplogroups whose natural frequencies exhibit clinal associations with latitude along the Australian east-coast. We present experimental evidence that the thermal regime in which the laboratory populations were maintained, drove changes in haplogroup frequencies across generations. Our results strengthen the emerging view that intra-specific mtDNA variants are sensitive to selection, and suggest spatial distributions of mtDNA variants in natural populations of metazoans might reflect adaptation to climatic environments rather than within-population coalescence and diffusion of selectively-neutral haplotypes across populations.\\n\\nImpact SummaryWe applied experimental laboratory evolution to provide the first direct test of the \\\"mitochondrial climatic hypothesis,\\\" which predicts that the variation of mitochondrial genomes across natural distributions of metazoans can be shaped by thermal selection. Our design is the first of its kind when it comes to inferring the role of thermal selection in shaping mtDNA frequencies in nature. We harness two naturally occurring mtDNA haplotypes of Drosophila melanogaster that segregate along the east coast of Australia. One of these haplotypes predominates at sub-tropical northern latitudes and the other in the temperate and cooler south of the country. We then compete these haplotypes against each other in replicated experimental fly populations submitted to one of four different thermal regimes, in either the presence or absence of infection by Wolbachia, a coevolved endosymbiont that also exhibits maternal transmission.\\n\\nWe confirm that when evolving in the laboratory under warmer conditions, a haplotype naturally predominating in subtropical conditions outcompetes a haplotype that predominates at cooler Australian latitudes in the wild. We see this effect on haplotype frequencies in females in populations where latent Wolbachia infections had been purged.\\n\\nOur results also suggest that sex-specificity of mtDNA effects, and co-occurrence of other maternally-inherited microbiotic entities - of which Wolbachia is just one example - are likely to shape the trajectories of mitochondrial genome evolution in the wild.",

    "abstract": "While weight-bearing and resistive exercise modestly increases aBMD, the precise relationship between physical activity and bone microstructure, and strain in humans is not known. Previously, we established a voluntary upper-extremity loading model that assigns a persons target force based on their subject-specific, continuum FE-estimated radius bone strain. Here, our purpose was to quantify the inter-individual variability in radius microstructure and FE-estimated strain explained by site-specific mechanical loading history, and to determine whether variability in strain is captured by aBMD, a clinically relevant measure of bone density and fracture risk. Seventy-two women aged 21-40 were included in this cross-sectional analysis. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) was used to measure macro- and micro-structure in the distal radius. Mean energy equivalent strain in the distal radius was calculated from continuum finite element models generated from clinical resolution CT images of the forearm. Areal BMD was used in a nonlinear regression model to predict FE strain. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to assess the predictive capability of intrinsic (age, height) and modifiable (body mass, grip strength, physical activity) predictors. Fifty-one percent of the variability in FE bone strain was explained by its relationship with aBMD, with higher density predicting lower strains. Age and height explained up to 31.6% of the variance in microstructural parameters. Body mass explained 9.1% and 10.0% of the variance in aBMD and bone strain, respectively, with higher body mass indicative of greater density. Overall, results suggest that meaningful differences in bone structure and strain can be predicted by subject characteristics.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAreal bone mineral density (aBMD) explains 51% of the variability in bone strain.\\nC_LIO_LIAdult bone loading predicts greater cortical porosity and trabecular density.\\nC_LIO_LIGreater body mass predicts greater aBMD and lower bone strain.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The discovery of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) marked a major shift in our understanding of how light is processed by the mammalian brain. These ipRGCs influence multiple functions not directly related to vision such as the synchronization of circadian rhythmicity, pupil constriction, the regulation of alertness and sleep, as well as the modulation of cognition. More recently, it was demonstrated that ipRGCs may also contribute to basic visual functions. The impact of ipRGCs on visual functions, independently of image forming photoreceptors, remains however difficult to isolate, particularly in humans. We previously showed that exposure to intense monochromatic blue light (465nm) induced awareness of light in a forced choice task in three rare totally visually blind individuals without detectable rod and cone function, but who retained non-visual responses to light, very likely via ipRGCs. The neural foundation of such light awareness in the absence of conscious vision is unknown, however. In this study, we characterized the brain activity of these three rare participants using electroencephalography (EEG), and demonstrate that unconsciously perceived light triggers an early and reliable transient desynchronization (i.e. decreased power) of the alpha EEG rhythm (8-14 Hz) over the occipital cortex. These results provide compelling insight into how ipRGC may contribute to transient changes in ongoing brain activity. They suggest that occipital alpha rhythm synchrony, which is typically linked to the visual system, is modulated by ipRGCs photoreception; a process that may contribute to the awareness of light in those blind individuals.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimers disease (AD) exists before dementia is present and that shifts in amyloid beta occur long before clinical symptoms can be detected. Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid {beta}1-42 (A{beta}1-42) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimers disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Topography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individuals CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A{beta}1-42 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status and four analytes are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those predicted with normal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels and that the resulting model also performs reasonably across PET A{beta}1-42 status.\\n\\nThis is the first study to show that a machine learning approach, using plasma protein levels, age and APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status, is able to predict CSF A{beta}1-42 status, the earliest risk indicator for AD, with high accuracy.",

Although several methods have been recently developed, they utilize different characteristics of data and yield varying results in terms of both the number of clusters and actual cluster assignments.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present SAFE-clustering, Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) clustering, a flexible, accurate and robust method for clustering scRNA-Seq data. SAFE-clustering takes as input, results from multiple clustering methods, to build one consensus solution. SAFE-clustering currently embeds four state-of-the-art methods, SC3, CIDR, Seurat and t-SNE + k-means; and ensembles solutions from these four methods using three hypergraph-based partitioning algorithms. Extensive assessment across 12 datasets with the number of clusters ranging from 3 to 14, and the number of single cells ranging from 49 to 32,695 showcases the advantages of SAFE-clustering in terms of both cluster number (18.9 - 50.0% reduction in absolute deviation to the truth) and cluster assignment (on average 28.9% improvement, and up to 34.5% over the best of the four methods, measured by adjusted rand index). Moreover, SAFE-clustering is computationally efficient to accommodate large datasets, taking <10 minutes to process 28,733 cells.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationSAFE-clustering, including source codes and tutorial, is free available on the web at http://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/safe/.\\n\\nContactyunli@med.unc.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "In quantitative analyses of biological processes, one may use many different scales of models (e.g., spatial or non-spatial, deterministic or stochastic, time-varying or at steady-state) or many different approaches to match models to experimental data (e.g., model fitting or parameter uncertainty/sloppiness quantification with different experiment designs). These different analyses can lead to surprisingly different results, even when applied to the same data and the same model. We use a simplified gene regulation model to illustrate many of these concerns, especially for ODE analyses of deterministic processes, chemical master equation and finite state projection analyses of heterogeneous processes, and stochastic simulations. For each analysis, we employ MO_SCPLOWATLABC_SCPLOW and PO_SCPLOWYTHONC_SCPLOW software to consider a time-dependent input signal (e.g., a kinase nuclear translocation) and several model hypotheses, along with simulated single-cell data. We illustrate different approaches (e.g., deterministic and stochastic) to identify the mechanisms and parameters of the same model from the same simulated data. For each approach, we explore how uncertainty in parameter space varies with respect to the chosen analysis approach or specific experiment design. We conclude with a discussion of how our simulated results relate to the integration of experimental and computational investigations to explore signal-activated gene expression models in yeast [1] and human cells [2]{ddagger}.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.10.+e, 87.15.Aa, 05.10.Gg, 05.40.Ca,02.50.-r\\n\\nSubmitted to: Phys.

    "abstract": "Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on \\\"fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia\\\", \\\"fear avoidance beliefs\\\" or \\\"pain anxiety\\\", pain-related fear constructs seemingly differ while the potential overlap of the questionnaires is unclear. Furthermore, the relationship to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Because the neural bases of fearful and anxious states are well described, advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 non-specific chronic low back pain patients to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied Multiple Kernel Learning approach allowed generating models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of potentially harmful activities for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. The results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs by demonstrating evidence of non-overlapping neural predictors within fear processing regions. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.\\n\\nSignificancePain-related fear, often assessed through self-reports such as questionnaires, has shown prognostic value and clinical utility for a variety of musculoskeletal pain disorders. However, it remains difficult to determine a common underlying construct of pain-related fear due to several proposed constructs among questionnaires. The current study describes a novel neuroscientific approach using machine learning of neural patterns within the fear circuit of chronic low back pain patients that has the potential to identify neural commonalities or differences among the various pain-related fear constructs. Ultimately, this approach might afford a deeper understanding of the suggested constructs and might be also applied to other domains where ambiguity exists between different psychological constructs.",

    "abstract": "We directly visualize the topology-mediated interactions between an unwinding site on a supercoiled DNA plasmid and a specific probe molecule designed to bind to this site, as a function of DNA supercoiling and temperature. The visualization relies on containing the DNA molecules within an enclosed array of glass nanopits using the Convex Lens-induced Confinement (CLiC) imaging method. This method traps molecules within the focal plane while excluding signal from out-of-focus probes. Simultaneously, the molecules can freely diffuse within the nanopits, allowing for accurate measurements of exchange rates, unlike other methods which could introduce an artifactual bias in measurements of binding kinetics. We demonstrate that the plasmids structure influences the binding of the fluorescent probes to the unwinding site through the presence, or lack, of other secondary structures. With this method, we observe an increase in the binding rate of the fluorescent probe to the unwinding site with increasing temperature and negative supercoiling. This increase in binding is consistent with the results of our numerical simulations of the probability of site-unwinding. The temperature dependence of the binding rate has allowed us to distinguish the effects of competing higher order DNA structures, such as Z-DNA, in modulating local site-unwinding, and therefore binding.",

    "abstract": "Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges.\\n\\nTherefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package landsepi, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters.\\n\\nThis article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus Puccinia. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThere are many recent examples which demonstrate the evolutionary potential of plant pathogens to overcome the resistances deployed in agricultural landscapes to protect our crops. Increasingly, it is recognised that how resistance is deployed spatially and temporally can impact on rates of pathogen evolution and resistance breakdown. Such deployment strategies are mainly based on the combination of several sources of resistance at different spatiotemporal scales. However, comparison of these strategies in a predictive sense is not an easy task, owing to the logistical difficulties associated with experiments involving the spread of a pathogen at large spatio-temporal scales. Moreover, both the durability of a strategy and the epidemiological protection it provides to crops must be assessed since these evaluation criteria are not necessarily correlated. Surprisingly, no current simulation model allows a thorough comparison of the different options. Here we describe a spatio-temporal model able to simulate a wide range of deployment strategies and resistance sources. This model, implemented in the R package landsepi, facilitates assessment of both epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes across simulated scenarios. In this work, the model is used to investigate the combination of different sources of resistance against fungal diseases such as rusts of cereal crops.",

An attractive treatment option is to use gene therapy to deliver broad-spectrum neuroprotective factors. However, this approach has had limited clinical translation because of the inability to control transgene expression. To address this problem, we generated an adeno-associated virus vector named RPF2 that was engineered to express domains of leukemia inhibitory factor fused to the destabilization domain of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. Fusion proteins containing the destabilization domain are degraded in mammalian cells but can be stabilized with the binding of the drug trimethoprim. Our data show that expression levels of RPF2 are tightly regulated by the dose of trimethoprim, and can be reversed by trimethoprim withdrawal. We further show that stabilized RPF2 can protect photoreceptors and prevent blindness in treated mice.",

After responding to the cue participants were asked to rate their stimulus awareness using Perceptual Awareness Scale and then to report their discrimination decision.\\n\\nThe results showed that participants reported a higher level of stimulus awareness after carrying out responses that were either congruent or incongruent with a response required by a stimulus, compared to the neutral condition. The results suggest that directional motor response (congruent or incongruent with correct response to the stimulus) provides information about the decision process and its outcome increasing reported awareness of a stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cell survival upon cytotoxic drug exposure leads to changes in cell identity, dictated by the epigenome. Several metabolites serve as substrates or co-factors to chromatin-modifying enzymes, suggesting that metabolic changes can underlie change in cell fate. Here, we show that progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to taxane-resistance is characterized by altered methionine metabolism and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) availability, giving rise to DNA hypomethylation in regions enriched for transposable elements (TE). Compensatory redistribution of H3K27me3 forming Large Organized Chromatin domains of lysine (K) modification (LOCK) prevents expression of TE in taxane-resistant cells. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2, the H3K27me3 methyltransferase, alleviates TE repression, leading to the accumulation of dsRNA and activation of the interferon viral mimicry-response, specifically inhibiting the growth of taxane-resistant TNBC. Together, our work delineates a role for metabolic adaptations in redefining the epigenome of taxane-resistant TNBC cells and underlies an epigenetic vulnerability toward pharmacological inhibition of EZH2.",

    "abstract": "In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA associates with numerous protein complexes and RNAs, forming the chromatin landscape. Through a genome-wide study of chromatin-associated proteins in Drosophila cells, five major chromatin types were identified as a refinement of the traditional binary division into hetero- and euchromatin. These five types are defined by distinct but overlapping combinations of proteins and differ in biological and biochemical properties, including transcriptional activity, replication timing and histone modifications. In this work, we assess the evolutionary relationships of chromatin-associated proteins and present an integrated view of the evolution and conservation of the fruit fly D. melanogaster chromatin landscape. We combine homology prediction across a wide range of species with gene age inference methods to determine the origin of each chromatin-associated protein. This provides insight into the emergence of the different chromatin types. Our results indicate that the two euchromatic types, YELLOW and RED, were one single activating type that split early in eukaryotic history. Next, we provide evidence that GREEN-associated proteins are involved in a centromere drive and expanded in a lineage-specific way in D. melanogaster. Our results on BLUE chromatin support the hypothesis that the emergence of Polycomb Group proteins is linked to eukaryotic multicellularity. In light of these results, we discuss how the regulatory complexification of chromatin links to the origins of eukaryotic multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAnalyzing tandem mass spectrometry data to recognize peptides in a sample is the fundamental task in computational proteomics. Traditional peptide identification algorithms perform well when identifying unmodified peptides. However, when peptides have post-translational modifications (PTMs), these methods cannot provide satisfactory results. Recently, Chick et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2016 proposed the spectrum-based and tag-based open search methods, respectively, to identify peptides with PTMs. While the performance of these two methods is promising, the identification results vary greatly with respect to the quality of tandem mass spectra and the number of PTMs in peptides. This motivates us to systematically study the relationship between the performance of open search methods and quality parameters of tandem mass spectrum data, as well as the number of PTMs in peptides.\\n\\nResultsThrough large-scale simulations, we obtain the performance trend when simulated tandem mass spectra are of different quality. We propose an analytical model to describe the relationship between the probability of obtaining correct identifications and the spectrum quality as well as the number of PTMs. Based on the analytical model, we can quantitatively describe the necessary condition to effectively apply open search methods.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource codes of the simulation are available at http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/PST.html.\\n\\nContactboningli@ust.hk or eeyu@ust.hk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

The current disease detection and treatment methods are efficient so this approach focused on the prevention of the disease. Indeed, current solutions are not efficient enough to deal with this situation. As V. cholerae which infects more than a million people each year is usually found in water, a synthetic microbial consortium was designed to detect and kill efficiently the bacteria in water. This work shows that Vibrio harveyi, a non-pathogenic strain to human, can be an efficient detector of V. cholerae. Moreover, it proves that Pichia pastoris, a yeast, can efficiently produce a novel antimicrobial peptide coming from the crocodile Crocodylus siamensis (i.e D-NY15) and that this peptide has a killing action towards V. cholerae. This study also shows that a communication between a prokaryote (Vibrio harveyi) and an eukaryote (Pichia pastoris) may be possible.",

It has been reported that it that it showed various pharmacological actions via anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory actions. The present study undergoes the therapeutic evaluation of curcumin in cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure induced cognitive impairment in zebrafish. Methods: The cognitive impairment was induced by exposure to 25 ml of 200 % CSE; 10 minutes/day, for 7 consecutive days. The pre-treatment of curcumin (10 and 20 mg/kg) and montelukast(20 mg/kg) were exposed in 25 ml drug solution (10 minutes/day for 10 consecutive days). The changes of CSE induced cognitive dysfunction were evaluated by using different test methods such as colour recognition test; partition preference test; horizontal compartment test; and T-Maze tests. Further, the CSE exposure induced changes of biochemical parameters i.e., acetylcholinesterase activity; lipid peroxidation; reduced glutathione; and total protein levels were estimated in the brain of zebrafish. The pre-exposure of curcumin shown to produce the ameliorative effect against CSE induced neurocognitive impairments along with alteration of biochemical changes. Theseresults were comparable to reference control i.e., montelukast pre-treated group. Therefore, the curcumin can be served as newer medicines for immunological reaction associated neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer and multiple sclerosis due to its potential anti-oxidative; anti-inflammatory; immunomodulatory; and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory actions.\\n\\nSUMMARYLoss of memory is a major problem in old age population.

Here, using an integrated analysis of whole exome and phospho-proteome, we show recurrent activating ERBB2 and KRAS somatic mutations are present in 6 and 3 of 44 early-stage rare gallbladder tumors, respectively. In vitro and in vivo cell-based and biochemical assays reveal an essential role of ErbB pathway activation for the survival of gallbladder cells. Interestingly, the genetic and pharmacological dependencies of gallbladder cells are dependent on the KRAS mutant allele status, reminiscent of the clinical algorithm commonly practiced to opt for anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancer. In overall, we present the first evidence that the presence of KRAS (G12V), but not KRAS (G13D) mutation, may preclude gallbladder cancer patients to respond to anti-EGFR treatment, leading to an early adoption of an approved treatment regimen for gallbladder cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Many world fisheries display a declining mean trophic level of catches. This \"fishing down the food web\" is often attributed to reduced densities of high-trophic-level species. We show here that the fishing down pattern can actually emerge from the adaptive harvesting of two- and three-species food webs, where changes in fishing patterns are driven by the relative profitabilities of the harvested species. Shifting fishing patterns from a focus on higher trophic levels to a focus on lower trophic levels can yield abrupt changes in the system, strongly impacting species densities. In predator-prey systems, such regime shifts occur when the predator species is highly valuable relative to the prey, and when the top-down control on the prey is strong. Moreover, we find that when the two species are jointly harvested, high adaptation speeds can reduce the resilience of fisheries. Our results therefore suggest that flexibility in harvesting strategies will not necessarily benefit fisheries but may actually harm their sustainability.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis chromosomes undergo DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can produce crossovers via interhomolog repair. Meiotic recombination frequency is variable along chromosomes and concentrates in narrow hotspots. We mapped crossovers within Arabidopsis thaliana hotspots located within the RAC1 and RPP13 disease resistance genes, using varying haplotypic combinations. We observed a negative non-linear relationship between interhomolog divergence and crossover frequency, consistent with polymorphism suppressing crossover repair of DSBs. Anti-recombinase mutants fancm, recq4a recq4b, figl1 and msh2, or lines with increased HEI10 dosage, are known to show increased crossovers. Surprisingly, RAC1 crossovers were either unchanged or decreased in these genetic backgrounds. We employed deep-sequencing of crossovers to examine recombination topology within RAC1, in wild type, fancm and recq4a recq4b mutant backgrounds. The RAC1 recombination landscape was broadly conserved in anti-recombinase mutants and showed a negative relationship with interhomolog divergence. However, crossovers at the RAC1 5-end were relatively suppressed in recq4a recq4b backgrounds, indicating that local context influences recombination outcomes. Our results demonstrate the importance of interhomolog divergence in shaping recombination within plant disease resistance genes and crossover hotspots.",

    "abstract": "Herpesviruses include many important human pathogens such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus and the oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi-sarcoma associated herpesvirus. Herpes virions contains large icosahedral capsids that have a portal at a unique five-fold vertex, similar to that seen in the tailed bacteriophages. The portal is a molecular motor through which the viral genome enters the capsid during virion morphogenesis. The genome also exits the capsid through the portal-vertex when it is injected through the nuclear-pore into the nucleus of a new host cell to initiate infection. Structural investigations of the herpesvirus portal-vertex have proven challenging, owing to the small size of the tail-like portal-vertex associated tegument (PVAT), and the dense tegument layer that lays between the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope, obscuring the view of the portal-vertex. Here we show the structure of the herpes simplex virus portal-vertex at sub-nanometer resolution, solved by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) and single-particle 3D reconstruction. This led to a number of new discoveries including the presence of two previously unknown portal associated structures that occupy the sites normally taken by the penton and the Ta triplex. Our data revealed that the PVAT is composed of ten copies of the C-terminal domain of pUL25, which are uniquely arranged as two tiers of star-shaped density. Our 3D reconstruction of the portal-vertex also shows that one end of the viral genome extends outside the portal in the manner described for some bacteriophage but not previously seen in any eukaryote viruses. Finally, we show that the viral genome is consistently packed in a highly-ordered left-handed spool to form concentric shells of DNA. Our data provide new insights into the structure of a molecular machine critical to the biology of an important class of human pathogens.",

Their aberrant expression can have oncogenic or tumor suppressor function directly participating to carcinogenesis, malignant transformation, invasiveness and metastasis.

Here, we focus on a particular class of transcripts encoding polycistronic miRNA genes that yields multiple miRNA components. We describe clustered MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis (ClustMMRA), a fully redesigned release of the MMRA computational pipeline (MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis), developed to search for clustered miRNAs potentially driving cancer molecular subtyping. Genomically clustered miRNAs are frequently co-expressed to target different components of pro-tumorigenic signalling pathways. By applying ClustMMRA to breast cancer patient data, we identified key miRNA clusters driving the phenotype of different tumor subgroups. The pipeline was applied to two independent breast cancer datasets, providing statistically concordant results between the two analysis. We validated in cell lines the miR-199/miR-214 as a novel cluster of miRNAs promoting the triple negative subtype phenotype through its control of proliferation and EMT.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic methods that rely on information from multiple, unlinked genes have recently been developed for resolving complex situations where evolutionary relationships do not conform to bifurcated trees and are more adequately depicted by networks. Such situations arise when successive interspecific hybridizations in combination with genome duplications have shaped species phylogenies. Several processes such as homoeolog loss and deep coalescence can potentially hamper our ability to recover the historical signal correctly. Consequently the prospect of reconstructing accurate phylogenies lies in the combination of several low-copy nuclear markers that when, used in concert, can provide homoeologs for all the ancestral genomes and help to disentangle gene tree incongruence due to deep coalescence events. Expressed sequence tag (EST) databases represent valuable resource for the identification of genes in organisms with uncharacterized genomes and for development of molecular markers. The genus Silene L. is a prime example of a plant group whose evolutionary history involves numerous events of hybridization and polyploidization. As for many groups there is currently a shortage of low-copy nuclear markers, for which phylogenetic usefulness has been demonstrated. Here, we present two EST libraries for two species of Silene that belong to large phylogenetic groups not previously investigated with next generation technologies. The assembled and annotated transcriptomes are used for identifying low copy nuclear regions, suitable for sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory caspase-11/4/5 recognize cytosolic LPS from invading Gram-negative bacteria and induce pyroptosis and cytokine release, forming rapid innate antibacterial defenses. Since extracellular or vacuole-constrained bacteria are thought to rarely access the cytoplasm, how their LPS are exposed to the cytosolic sensors is a critical event for pathogen recognition. Hemolysin is a pore-forming bacterial toxin, which was generally accepted to rupture cell membrane, leading to cell lysis. Whether and how hemolysin participates in non-canonical inflammasome signaling remains uncovered. Here, we show that hemolysin-overexpressed enterobacteria triggered significantly increased caspase-4 activation in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Hemolysin promoted LPS cytosolic delivery from extracellular bacteria through dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Further, we revealed that hemolysin was largely associated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and induced rupture of OMV-containing vacuoles, subsequently increasing LPS exposure to the cytosolic sensor. Accordingly, overexpression of hemolysin promoted caspase-11 dependent IL-18 secretion, gut inflammation, and enterocyte pyroptosis in orally-infected mice, which was associated with restricting bacterial colonization in vivo. Together, our work reveals a concept that hemolysin promotes noncanonical inflammasome activation via liberating OMVs for cytosolic LPS sensing, which offers insights into innate immune surveillance of dysregulated hemolysin via caspase-11/4 in intestinal antibacterial defenses.\\n\\nSignificanceSensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytosol triggers non-canonical inflammasome-mediated innate responses. Recent work revealed that bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) enables LPS to access the cytosol for extracellular bacteria. However, since intracellular OMVs are generally constrained in endosomes, how OMV-derived LPS gain access to the cytosol remains unknown. Here, we reported that hemolysin largely bound with OMVs and entered cells through dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Intracellular hemolysin significantly impaired OMVs-constrained vacuole integrity and increased OMV-derived LPS exposure to the cytosolic sensor, which promoted non-canonical inflammasome activation and restricted bacterial gut infections. This work reveals the role of hemolysin in promoting non-canonical inflammasome activation and alerting host immune recognition, which provides insights into the more sophisticated biological functions of hemolysin upon infection.",

    "abstract": "Female ornaments are a rare occurrence in nature. One explanation for this is that female ornaments are costly to produce and maintain and, therefore, females must trade-off resources related to reproduction to promote ornament expression. Here, we investigate the potential trade-off between female ornamentation and fecundity in the sex-role reversed, wide-bodied pipefish, Stigmatopora nigra. We measured two components of the female ornament, body width and stripe thickness, and tested the relationship between these ornaments and female fecundity and the mean egg size. Both body width and stripe thickness were strongly and positively related to female body size. After controlling for the influence of body size, we found no evidence of a cost of belly width or stripe thickness on female fecundity. Rather, females that have larger ornaments have higher fecundity and thus a greater relative fitness advantage. However, larger females suffered a slight decrease in egg size, consistent with a potential trade-off between egg size and body size, although no relationship between egg size and ornaments was observed. Our results suggest that larger S. nigra females accurately advertise their reproductive value to males, and underscore the importance of investigating the potential mechanisms that promote and maintain honesty of female ornaments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe accurate detection of copy number alterations from the analysis of circulating cell free tumour DNA (ctDNA) in blood is essential to realising the potential of liquid biopsies. However, currently available approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample -both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets.\\n\\nResultsWith a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals. Together with the range of sequencing platforms supported by our qCNV+sCNA-Seq pipeline, as well as the Galaxy implementation of this solution, this pipeline makes cfDNA profiling more accessible and makes it easier to identify sCNA from the plasma of cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Parasites are important components of food webs. Although their direct effects on hosts are well-studied, indirect impacts on trophic networks, thus on non-host species, remain unclear.\\n\\nIn this study, we investigate the consequences of parasitism on coexistence and stability within a simple trophic module: one predator consuming two prey species in competition. We test how such effects depend on the infected species (prey or predator). We account for two effects of parasitism: the virulence effect (parasites affect the infected species intrinsic growth rate through direct effects on fecundity or mortality) and the interaction effect (increased vulnerability of infected prey or increased food intake of infected predators).\\n\\nResults show that coexistence is favored when effects have intermediate intensity. We link this result to modifications of direct and apparent competitions among prey species. Given a prey infection, accounting for susceptible-infected population structure highlights that coexistence may also be reduced due to predator-parasite competition.\\n\\nParasites affect stability by modulating energy transfer from prey to predator. Predator infection therefore has a stabilizing effect due to increased energy fluxes and/or predator mortality.\\n\\nOur results suggest that parasites potentially increase species coexistence. Precise predictions however require an assessment of various parasite effects. We discuss the implications of our results for the functioning of trophic networks and the evolution of foraging strategies within food webs.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is associated with multiple complex abnormalities in functional brain connectivity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Despite much research in this area, to date, neuroimaging-based models are not able to characterize individuals with ASD with sufficient sensitivity and specificity; this is likely due to the heterogeneity and complexity of this disorder. Here we apply a data-driven subject-level approach, connectome-based predictive modeling, to resting-state fMRI data from a set of individuals from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Using leave-one-subject-out and split-half analyses, we define two functional connectivity networks that predict continuous scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and confirm that these networks generalize to novel subjects. Notably, these networks were found to share minimal anatomical overlap. Further, our results generalize to individuals for whom SRS/ADOS scores are unavailable, predicting worse scores for ASD than typically developing individuals. In addition, predicted SRS scores for individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from the ADHD-200 Consortium are linked to ADHD symptoms, supporting the hypothesis that the functional brain organization changes relevant to ASD severity share a component associated with attention. Finally, we explore the membership of predictive connections within conventional (atlas-based) functional networks. In summary, our results suggest that an individuals functional connectivity profile contains information that supports dimensional, non-binary classification in ASD, aligning with the goals of precision medicine and individual-level diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Riboregulators are short RNA sequences that, upon binding to a ligand, change their secondary structure and influence the expression rate of a downstream gene. They constitute an attractive alternative to transcription factors for building synthetic gene regulatory networks because they can be engineered de novo and they have a fast turnover and a low metabolic burden. However, riboregulators are generally designed in silico and tested in vivo, which only provides a yes/no evaluation of their performances, thus hindering the improvement of design algorithms. Here we show that a cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system provides valuable quantitative information about the performances of in silico designed riboregulators. In particular, we use the ribosome as an exquisite molecular machine that detects functional riboregulators, precisely measures their concentration and linearly amplifies the signal by generating a fluorescent protein. We apply this method to characterize two types of translational riboregulators composed of a cis-repressed (cr) and a trans-activating (ta) strand. At the DNA level we demonstrate that high concentrations of taDNA poisoned the activator until total shut off. At the RNA level, we show that this approach provides a fast and simple way to measure dissociation constants of functional riboregulators, in contrast to standard mobility-shift assays. Our method opens the route for using cell-free TX-TL systems for the quantitative characterization of functional riboregulators in order to improve their design in silico.",

Xf has been recently detected in several regions outside its natural range including Europe. In that context, accurate estimates of its response to climate change are required to design cost-efficient and environment-friendly control strategies. In the present study, we collected data documenting the native and invaded ranges of the three main subspecies of Xf: fastidiosa, pauca and multiplex, as well as two strains of Xf subsp. multiplex recently detected in southern France (ST6 and ST7). We fitted bioclimatic species distribution models (SDMs) to forecast their potential geographic range and impact in Europe under current and future climate conditions. According to model predictions, the geographical range of Xf as presently reported in Europe is small compared to the large extent of suitable areas. The European regions most threatened by Xf encompass the Mediterranean coastal areas of Spain, Greece, Italy and France, the Atlantic coastal areas of France, Portugal and Spain as well as the south-western regions of Spain and lowlands in southern Italy. Potential distribution of the different subspecies / strains are contrasted but all are predicted to increase by 2050, which could threaten several of the most economically important wine-, olive- and fruit-producing regions of Europe, warranting the design of control strategies. Bioclimatic models also predict that the subspecies multiplex might represent a threat to most of Europe under current and future climate conditions. These results may serve as a basis for future design of a spatially informed European-scale integrated management strategy, including early detection surveys in plants and insect vectors, quarantine measures as well as agricultural practices.",

Here, we describe Tasman-PCR: a simple PCR-based diagnostic assay that distinguishes DFT1 and DFT2 by amplification of DNA spanning tumour-specific interchromosomal translocations. We demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of this assay by testing DNA from 557 tumours and 818 normal devils. A temporal-spatial screen confirmed the reported geographic ranges of DFT1 and DFT2 and did not provide evidence of additional DFT clones. DFT2 affects disproportionately more males than females, and devils can be co-infected with DFT1 and DFT2. Overall, we present a PCR-based assay that delivers rapid, accurate and high-throughput diagnosis of DFT1 and DFT2.

This work investigates in vivo kinetics, quantification strategies and imaging characteristics of a novel tau PET radioligand [18F]MK-6240 in humans.\\n\\nMethodsFifty-one individuals ranging from cognitively normal young controls to persons with dementia underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and [11C]PiB and [18F]MK-6240 PET imaging. PET data were coregistered to the MRI and time-activity curves were extracted from regions of interest to assess [18F]MK-6240 kinetics. The pons and inferior cerebellum were investigated as potential reference regions. Reference tissue methods (Logan graphical analysis (LGA) and multilinear reference tissue method (MRTM2)) were investigated for quantification of [18F]MK-6240 distribution volume ratios (DVRs) in a subset of nineteen participants. Stability of DVR methods was evaluated using truncated scan durations. Standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) estimates were compared to DVR estimates to determine the optimal timing window for SUVR analysis. Parametric SUVR images were used to identify regions of potential off-target binding and to compare binding patterns with neurofibrillary tau staging established in neuropathology literature.\\n\\nResultsStandard uptake values in the pons and the inferior cerebellum indicated consistent clearance across all 51 subjects. LGA and MRTM2 DVR estimates were similar, with LGA slightly underestimating DVR compared to MRTM2. DVR estimates remained stable when truncating the scan duration to 60 minutes. SUVR determined 70-90 minutes post-injection of [18F]MK-6240 indicated linearity near unity when compared to DVR estimates and minimized potential spill-in from uptake outside of the brain. [18F]MK-6240 binding patterns in target regions were consistent with neuropathological neurofibrillary tau staging. Off-target binding regions included the ethmoid sinus, clivus, meninges, substantia nigra, but not the basal ganglia or choroid plexus.\\n\\nConclusions[18F]MK-6240 is a promising PET radioligand for in vivo imaging of neurofibrillary tau aggregates in AD with minimal off-target binding in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising construct to study cognitive processes in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetencephalography (MEG). Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures - phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) - is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all three indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all three indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the mean vector length was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, biphasic coupling can solely be detected by the modulation index. Coupling values of all three indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The modulation index was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the modulation index for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the mean vector length is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LImean vector length is most sensitive for differentiating coupling strength\\nC_LIO_LImodulation index is most robust to differences in data length, sampling rate and SNR\\nC_LIO_LIphase-locking value and mean vector length cannot detect biphasic phase-amplitude coupling\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies reported that chimpanzees share an ability to produce spontaneous temporal coordination with humans (Yu & Tomonaga, 2015; 2016). However, it remains unclear how visual cues of an interacting partners movement influence on the emergence of tempo convergence. The current study conducted a comparative study in humans and chimpanzees under the same experimental setup as that used in Yu & Tomonaga (2016). Three conditions, including baseline, paired-invisible and paired-visible, were prepared. In the baseline condition, the participants produced the repetitive tapping movement alone. In contrast, in the other two paired conditions, the participants in a pair produced the tapping movement concurrently while facing a conspecific partner. However, in the paired-invisible condition, a visual barrier was placed in between the participants to control visual cues of an interacting partners movement. Moderate auditory cues, corresponding to each participants tapping movement, were presented throughout the conditions. Results showed that there are significant changes on the tapping tempo between baseline and the paired-invisible condition, whereas there are little changes between paired-invisible and paired-visible condition in both species. The current stepwise analysis across three conditions demonstrates that auditory cues were more influential than additive visual cues of an interacting partners movement on the tempo convergence in humans and chimpanzees.",

    "abstract": "Co-expression network analysis provides useful information for studying gene regulation in biological processes. Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis.\\n\\nOne possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights. In both analyses, we identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions and observe that the modules that are upregulated in a particular condition are often involved in condition-specific activities. Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGene co-expression networks provide insights into the mechanism of cellular activity and gene regulation. Condition-specific mechanisms may be identified by constructing and comparing co-expression networks of multiple conditions. We propose a novel statistical method to jointly construct co-expression networks for gene expression profiles from multiple conditions. By using a data-driven approach to capture condition-specific co-expression patterns, this method is effective in identifying both co-expression patterns that are specific to a condition and that are common across conditions. The application of this method on real datasets reveals interesting biological insights.",

    "abstract": "Signatures of spatially varying selection have been investigated both at the genomic and transcriptomic level in several organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, the majority of these studies have analyzed North American and Australian populations, leading to the identification of several loci and traits under selection. However, populations in these two continents showed evidence of admixture that likely contributed to the observed population differentiation patterns. Thus, disentangling demography from selection is challenging when analyzing these populations. European populations could be a suitable system to identify loci under spatially varying selection provided that no recent admixture from African populations would have occurred. In this work, we individually sequence the genome of 42 European strains collected in populations from contrasting environments: Stockholm (Sweden), and Castellana Grotte, (Southern Italy). We found low levels of population structure and no evidence of recent African admixture in these two populations. We thus look for patterns of spatially varying selection affecting individual genes and gene sets. Besides single nucleotide polymorphisms, we also investigate the role of transposable elements in local adaptation. We concluded that European populations are a good dataset to identify loci under spatially varying selection. The analysis of the two populations sequenced in this work in the context of all the available D. melanogaster data allowed us to pinpoint genes and biological processes relevant for local adaptation. Identifying and analyzing populations with low levels of population structure and admixture should help to disentangle selective from non-selective forces underlying patterns of population differentiation in other species as well.",

Here we show that in vitro ZIKV infection of human cells, including NPCs, causes disruption of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice2-4. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)5. Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the viral capsid protein in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and capsid expression post-transcriptionally downregulated UPF1, a process that we confirmed occurs during de novo ZIKV infection. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures. We therefore propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to dampen antiviral activities of NMD6,7, which subsequently contributes to neuropathology in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Cell mechanical measurements are gaining increasing interest in biological and biomedical studies. However, there are no standardized calibration particles available that permit the cross-comparison of different measurement techniques operating at different stresses and time-scales. Here we present the rational design, production, and comprehensive characterization of poly-acylamide (PAAm) microgel beads mimicking biological cells. We produced mono-disperse beads at rates of 20 - 60 kHz by means of a microfluidic droplet generator, where the pre-gel composition was adjusted to tune the beads elasticity in the range of cell and tissue relevant mechanical properties. We verified bead homogeneity by optical diffraction tomography and Brillouin microscopy. Consistent elastic behavior of microgel beads at different shear rates was confirmed by AFM-enabled nanoindentation and real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC). The remaining inherent variability in elastic modulus was rationalized using polymer theory and effectively reduced by sorting based on forward-scattering using conventional flow cytometry. Our results show that PAAm microgel beads can be standardized as mechanical probes, to serve not only for validation and calibration of cell mechanical measurements, but also as cell-scale stress sensors.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOften vastly different cell mechanical properties are reported even for the same cell type when employing different measurement techniques. This discrepancy shows the urgent need for standardized calibration particles to cross-compare and validate techniques. Microgel beads can serve this purpose, but they have to fulfil specific requirements such as homogeneity, sizes and elasticities in the range of the cells, and they have to provide comparable results independent of the method applied. Here we demonstrate the standardized production of polyacrylamide microgel beads with all the features an elastic cell-mimic should have. These can not only be used as method calibration particles, but can also serve as cell-scale sensors to quantify normal and shear stresses exerted by other cells and inside tissues, enabling many new applications.",

In Australia, the vanB genotype is dominant; however there has been a recent increase in the predominantly plasmid-encoded vanA genotype, prompting investigation into the genomic epidemiology of VREfm in this context.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsA cross-sectional study of VREfm in Victoria, Australia (Nov.10th - Dec.9th, 2015). A total of 321 VREfm isolates (from 286 patients) were collected and whole-genome sequenced with Illumina NextSeq. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to assess relatedness. Multi-locus sequence types (STs), and genes associated with resistance and virulence were identified. The vanA-harbouring plasmid from an isolate from each ST was assembled using long-read data.\\n\\nResultsvanA-VREfm comprised 17.8% of isolates. ST203, ST80 and a pstS(-) clade, ST1421, predominated (30.5%, 30.5% and 37.2% of vanA-VREfm, respectively). Most vanB-VREfm were ST796 (77.7%). vanA-VREfm isolates were closely-related within hospitals vs. between them (core SNPs 10 [interquartile range 1-357] vs. 356 [179-416] respectively), suggesting discrete introductions of vanA-VREfm, with subsequent intra-hospital transmission. In contrast, vanB-VREfm had similar core SNP distributions within vs. between hospitals, due to widespread dissemination of ST796. Overall, vanA-harbouring plasmids differed across STs, and with exception of ST78 and ST796, Tn1546 transposons also varied.\\n\\nConclusionsvanA-VREfm in Victoria is associated with multiple STs, and is not solely mediated by a single shared plasmid/Tn1546 transposon; clonal transmission appears to play an important role, predominantly within, rather than between, hospitals. In contrast, vanB-VREfm appears to be well-established and widespread across Victorian healthcare institutions.",

    "abstract": "Monkeys appear to visually fixate targets in scotopic conditions. The function fixations fulfill in photopic vision, keeping the targets image on the fovea, is nullified in scotopic vision, because the fovea, with its cones, is desensitized in dim light. Here we followed the hypothesis that a previously described retinal region, the locus of maximal rod density, functionally replaces the fovea; we found that with dark background, most of the fixations direct the fovea above the target, so that the targets image appears to fall on the line connecting the fovea with the locus of maximal rod density. There is considerable trial-by-trial variation in the fixation positions along this line. On the whole, the closer the visual conditions are to full scotopic, the higher is this gaze upshift, indicating the closer does the target fall to the locus of maximal rod density. Mesopic background induces low mean upshift. Full (45-min) dark adaptation was essential to achieving high upshift values. There is no analogous photopic effect - 45-min  bright adaptation did not shift the locus of photopic fixation.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of proteins captures evolutionary ancestry, and serves as starting point to understand the origin of diseases. Proteins adopt their structure autonomously by the process of protein folding. Over the last decades, the folding process of several proteins has been studied with temporal and spatial resolution which allowed the identification of so-called Early Folding Residues (EFR) in the folding process. These structurally relevant residues become affected early in the folding process and initiate the formation of secondary structure elements and guide their assembly.\\n\\nUsing a dataset of 30 proteins and 3,337 residues provided by the Start2Fold database, discriminative features of EFR were identified by a systematical characterization. Therefore, proteins were represented as graphs in order to analyze topological descriptors of EFR. They constitute crucial connectors of protein regions which are distant at sequence level. Especially, these residues exhibit a high number of non-covalent contacts such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. This tendency also manifest as energetically stable local regions in a knowledge-based potential. Conclusively, these features are not only characteristic for EFR but also differ significantly with respect to functional residues. This unveils a split between structurally and functionally relevant residues in proteins which can drastically improve their evolvability and robustness.\\n\\nThe characteristics of EFR cannot be attributed to trivial features such as the accessible surface area. Thus, the presented features are novel descriptors for EFR of the folding process. Potentially, these features can be used to design classifiers to predict EFR from structure or to implement structure quality assessment programs. The shown division of labor between functional and EFR has implications for the prediction of mutation effects as well as protein design and can provide insights into the evolution of proteins. Finally, EFR allow to further the understanding of the protein folding process due to their pivotal role.\\n\\nAuthor summaryProteins are chains of amino acids which adopt a three-dimensional structure and are then able to catalyze chemical reactions or propagate signals in organisms. Without external influence, most proteins fold into their correct structure, and a small number of Early Folding Residues (EFR) have been shown to become affected at the very start of the process. We demonstrated that these residues are located in energetically stable local conformations. EFR are in contact to many other residues of a protein and act as hubs between sequentially distant regions of a proteins. These distinct characteristics can give insights into what causes certain residues to initiate and guide the folding process. Furthermore, it can help our understanding regarding diseases such as Alzheimers or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which are the result of protein folding gone wrong. We further found that the structurally relevant EFR are almost exclusively non-functional. Proteins separate structure and function, which increases evolvability and robustness and gives guidance for the artificial design of proteins.",

    "abstract": "The fluid-mosaic model posits a liquid-like plasma membrane, which can flow in response to tension gradients. It is widely assumed that membrane flow transmits local changes in membrane tension across the cell in milliseconds. This conjectured signaling mechanism has been invoked to explain how cells coordinate changes in shape, motility, and vesicle fusion, but the underlying propagation has never been observed. Here we show that propagation of membrane tension occurs quickly in cell-attached blebs, but is largely suppressed in intact cells. The failure of tension to propagate in cells is explained by a fluid dynamical model that incorporates the flow resistance from cytoskeleton-bound transmembrane proteins. In primary endothelial cells, local increases in membrane tension lead only to local activation of mechanosensitive ion channels and to local vesicle fusion. Thus membrane tension is not a mediator of long-range intra-cellular signaling, but local variations in tension mediate distinct processes in sub-cellular domains.",

    "abstract": "Extreme statistics describe the distribution of rare events that can define the timescales of transduction within cellular microdomains. We combine biophysical modeling and analysis of live-cell calcium imaging to explain the fast calcium transient in spines. We show that in the presence of a spine apparatus (SA), which is an extension of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), calcium transients during synaptic inputs rely on rare and extreme calcium ion trajectories. Using numerical simulations, we predicted the asymmetrical distributions of Ryanodine receptors and SERCA pumps that we confirmed experimentally. When calcium ions are released in the spine head, the fastest ions arriving at the base determine the transient timescale through a calcium-induced calcium release mechanism. In general, the fastest particles arriving at a small target are likely to be a generic mechanism that determines the timescale of molecular transduction in cellular neuroscience.\\n\\nSignificance statementIntrigued by fast calcium transients of few milliseconds in dendritic spines, we investigated its underlying biophysical mechanism. We show here that it is generated by the diffusion of the fastest calcium ions when the spine contains a Spine Apparatus, an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum. This timescale is modulated by the initial number of released calcium ions and the asymmetric distribution of its associated calcium release associated Ryanodyne receptors, present only at the base of a spine. This novel mechanism of calcium signaling that we have unraveled here is driven by the fastest particles. To conclude, the rate of arrival of the fastest particles (ions) to a small target receptor defines the timescale of activation instead of the classical forward rate of chemical reactions introduced by von Smoluchowski in 1916. Applying this new rate theory to transduction should refine our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying molecular signaling.",

Affected women frequently have metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. PCOS is diagnosed with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, resulting in a phenotypic spectrum of PCOS cases. The genetic similarities between cases diagnosed with different criteria have been largely unknown. Previous studies in Chinese and European subjects have identified 16 loci associated with risk of PCOS. We report a meta-analysis from 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry and characterisation of PCOS related traits. We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease indicate shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. Only one locus differed in its association by diagnostic criteria, otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci.",

    "abstract": "During aging some individuals are resilient to the decline of cognitive functions whereas others are vulnerable. These inter-individual differences in memory abilities have been associated with differences in the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis measured at old age. Whether the maintenance of the functionality of neurons generated throughout adult life is linked to resilience to cognitive aging remains completely unexplored. Using the immediate early gene Zif268, we analysed the activation of dentate granule neurons born in adult (3 month-old), middle-aged (12 month-old) or senescent (18 month-old) rats (n=96) in response to learning when animals reached 21 month-old. The activation of neurons born during the developmental period was also examined. We show that neurons generated 4, 10 or 19 months before learning (and not developmentally born neurons) are activated in senescent rats with good learning abilities. In contrast, aged rats with bad learning abilities do not exhibit an activity-dependent regulation of Zif268. In conclusion, we propose that resilience to cognitive aging is associated to the responsiveness of neurons born during adult-life. These data add to our current knowledge by showing that the aging of memory abilities stems not only from the number but also from the responsiveness of adult-born neurons.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence suggest that levels of alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) expression play a critical role in Parkinsons disease (PD). Several mutations of the SNCA gene, encoding for aSyn have been associated to either the familial or the sporadic forms of PD. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying wild type aSyn-mediated neurotoxicity in neuronal cells as well as its specific driving role in PD pathogenesis has yet to be fully clarified. In this view, the development of proper in vitro cellular systems is a crucial step.\\n\\nHere we present a novel human Tet-on hNSC cell line, in which aSyn timing and level of expression can be tightly experimentally tuned. Induction of aSyn in self-renewing hNSCs leads to progressive formation of aSyn aggregates and impairs their proliferation and cell survival. Furthermore, aSyn induction during the neuronal differentiation process results in impaired neurogenic potential due to enhanced refractoriness to exit self-renewal and to increase of gliogenic vs neurogenic competence. Finally, acute aSyn induction in hNSC-derived dopaminergic neuronal cultures results in cell toxicity.\\n\\nThis novel conditional in vitro cell model system may be a valuable tool for dissecting of aSyn pathogenic effects in hNSCs and neurons and in developing new potential therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The use of social contact rates is widespread in infectious disease modelling, since it is known that they provide proxies of crucial determinants of epidemiological and disease transmission parameters. Information on social contact rates can, for example, be obtained from a population-based contact diary survey, such as the POLYMOD study. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using bivariate smoothing techniques. Typically, smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondents and contacts age. In this paper, we introduce a smoothing constrained approach - taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts - where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts. This is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus contact rates should vary smoothly by cohorts. Two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed: (1) reordening of the diagonal components of the social contact rate matrix; and (2) reordening of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components. Parameter estimation is done using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares. A simulation study is presented to compare methods. The proposed methods are illustrated on the Belgian POLYMOD data of 2006.",

    "abstract": "One of the most extensively used techniques in Drosophila is the Gal4/UAS binary system, which allows tissue-specific misexpression or knockdown of specific genes of interest. The original UAS vector, UASt, can only be activated for transgene expression in somatic tissues and not in the germline cells. Rorth (1998) generated UASp, a modified UAS vector that is responsive to Gal4 in both somatic and germline tissues, by replacing both the hsp70 promoter and the SV40 3UTR with the P transposase promoter and the K10 3UTR respectively. At present, the mechanisms by which UASt is silenced in germline cells are not fully understood. Here, we report that the piRNA pathway is involved in suppressing UASt expression in ovarian germline cells. Individually knocking down or mutating components of the piRNA biogenesis pathway (e.g., Piwi, AGO3, Aub, Spn-E, and Vasa) resulted in the expression of the UASt-reporter (GFP or RFP) in the germline. An RNA-seq analysis of small RNAs revealed that the hsp70 promoter of UASt is targeted by piRNAs, and in the aub mutant ovary, the amount of piRNAs targeting the hsp70 promoter is reduced by around 40 folds. In contrast, the SV40 3UTR of the UASt, which happens to be targeted by the Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, is not responsible for germline UASt suppression, as UASt-reporters with NMD-insensitive 3UTRs fail to show germline expression. Taken together, our studies reveal a crucial role of the piRNA pathway, potentially via the suppression of the hsp70 promoter, in germline UASt silencing in Drosophila ovaries.",

    "abstract": "What are the neurophysiological correlates of sustained visual processing in the scalp EEG signal? In a previous study using intracranial recordings in humans, we found that presentation of visual stimuli for prolonged durations (up to 1.5 seconds) was associated with two kinds of sustained neural activity patterns: a high-frequency broadband (>30 Hz) response that tracked the duration of the stimulus with high precision in early visual cortex (EVC), and with lesser temporal precision in downstream category-selective areas; and a sustained low-frequency potential shift appearing in a small subset of EVC sites. Using a similar approach of presenting images for variable durations to identify sustained activity, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of the manifestation of sustained visual responses as recorded with EEG. In a series of four experiments, we found that both high- and low-frequency sustained responses can be detected on the scalp. The high frequency activity could be detected with high signal to noise ratio only in a subset of individual subjects, in whom it was unequivocal and highly localized. The low frequency sustained response was sensitive to the size and position of the stimulus in the visual field. Both response types showed strong lateralization for stimuli on the left vs. right visual field, suggesting a retinotopic visual cortical source. However, different scalp topographies and different modulation by stimulus properties suggest that the two types of sustained responses are likely driven by distinct sources, and reflect different aspects of sustained processing in the visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "DNA molecular machines have great potential for use in computing systems. Since Adleman originally introduced the concept of DNA computing through his use of DNA strands to solve a Hamiltonian path problem, a range of DNA-based computing elements have been developed, including logic gates, neural networks, finite state machines (FSMs) and non-deterministic universal Turing machines. It has also been established that DNA molecular machines can be controlled using electrical signals and that the state of DNA nanodevices can be measured using an electrochemical readout. However, to the best of our knowledge there has as yet been no demonstration of a fully integrated biomolecular computing system that has multiple levels of information processing capacity, can accept electronic inputs and is capable of independent operation. In this paper we address the question of how such a system could work. We present simulation results showing that such an integrated hybrid system could convert electrical impulses into biomolecular signals, perform logical operations and take a decision, storing its history. We also illustrate theoretically how such a system could potentially be used to perform a task such as controlling an autonomous robot navigating through a maze.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary studies of species coexistence are underpinned by deterministic models that assume that competing species have continuous (i.e. non-integer) densities, live in infinitely large landscapes, and coexist over infinite time horizons. By contrast, in nature species are composed of discrete individuals subject to demographic stochasticity, and occur in habitats of finite size where extinctions occur in finite time. One consequence of these discrepancies is that metrics of species coexistence derived from deterministic theory may be unreliable predictors of the duration of species coexistence in nature. These coexistence metrics include invasion growth rates and niche and fitness differences, which are now commonly applied in theoretical and empirical studies of species coexistence. Here we test the efficacy of deterministic coexistence metrics on the duration of species coexistence in a finite world. We introduce new theoretical and computational methods to estimate coexistence times in stochastic counterparts of classic deterministic models of competition. Importantly, we parameterized this model using experimental field data for 90 pairwise combinations of 18 species of annual plants, allowing us to derive biologically-informed estimates of coexistence times for a natural system. Strikingly, we find that for species expected to deterministically coexist, habitat sizes containing only tens of individuals have predicted coexistence times of greater than 1, 000 years. We also find that invasion growth rates explain 60% of the variation in intrinsic coexistence times, reinforcing their general usefulness in studies of coexistence. However, only by integrating information on both invasion growth rates and species equilibrium population sizes could most (> 99%) of the variation in species coexistence times be explained. This integration is achieved with demographically uncoupled single species models solely determined by the invasion growth rates and equilibrium population sizes. Moreover, because of a complex relationship between niche overlap/fitness differences and equilibrium population sizes, increasing niche overlap and increasing fitness differences did not always result in decreasing coexistence times as deterministic theory would predict. Nevertheless, our results tend to support the informed use of deterministic theory for understanding the duration of species coexistence, while highlighting the need to incorporate information on species equilibrium population sizes in addition to invasion growth rates.",

    "abstract": "Many insects use vision to inform their behavior, but visual information differs between habitats and the sensory demands vary with each species ecology. The small size of insects eyes constrains their optical performance, and so it is unsurprising that they have evolved specializations for optimizing the information they obtain from their habitat. Unraveling how behavioral, environmental, and phylogenetic factors influence the evolution of such specializations is difficult, however, because existing techniques to analyze insect eyes require specimens to be preserved beforehand. To facilitate broad comparative studies on insect eyes and the evolution of complex visual behavior, we developed a novel analysis technique that uses x-ray micro-computed tomography to quantify and recreate the visual world of insects. We use our methodology to investigate the eyes of fungus gnats (Orfeliini), a tribe of diminutive Dipterans, to identify the visual specializations they evolved for surviving in different forest habitats and to explore how this changed over 30 million years of evolutionary history. The specimens we studied were preserved in different ways (in ethanol, air dried, and as an endocast in amber), demonstrating that our method provides a new opportunity to quantitatively study and compare the vision of a wide range insects held in museum collections. Our analysis indicates that different visual specializations have evolved between fungus gnat species living in different forest types and that the eyes of gnats from a similar geographic location have evolved to match the changing environmental conditions. Despite the small size of fungus gnats, evolution has evidentially been able to exploit sensory specializations to meet the differing sensory demands of species from a variety of forest habitats.\\n\\nSignificance statementDo insects have visual specializations that evolve with changes in their environment? To answer this question, a novel analysis technique is described that uses 3D imaging and simulations to compare the vision of ancient amber-embedded insects to those of their extant relatives. This study investigated the vision of fungus gnats to understand how tiny insects use vision to negotiate forests, some of the worlds most visually complex environments. Despite being amongst the smallest of any flying insect, the gnats miniature eyes have evolved visual specializations specifically adapted for different forest types, allowing different species to meet their visual demands of their specific habitats.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, multivariate pattern analyses and especially decoding analyses have become a popular alternative to traditional mass-univariate analyses in neuroimaging research. However, a fundamental limitation of decoding analyses is that the source of information driving the decoder is ambiguous, which becomes problematic when the to-be-decoded variable is confounded by variables that are not of primary interest. In this study, we use a comprehensive set of simulations and analyses of empirical data to evaluate two techniques that were previously proposed and used to control for confounding variables in decoding analyses: counterbalancing and confound regression. For our empirical analyses, we attempt to decode gender from structural MRI data when controlling for the confound  brain size. We show that both methods introduce strong biases in decoding performance: counterbalancing leads to better performance than expected (i.e., positive bias), which we show in our simulations is due to the subsampling process that tends to remove samples that are hard to classify; confound regression, on the other hand, leads to worse performance than expected (i.e., negative bias), even resulting in significant below-chance performance in some scenarios. In our simulations, we show that below-chance accuracy can be predicted by the variance of the distribution of correlations between the features and the target. Importantly, we show that this negative bias disappears in both the empirical analyses and simulations when the confound regression procedure performed in every fold of the cross-validation routine, yielding plausible model performance. From these results, we conclude that foldwise confound regression is the only method that appropriately controls for confounds, which thus can be used to gain more insight into the exact source(s) of information driving ones decoding analysis.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe interpretation of decoding models is ambiguous when dealing with confounds;\\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluate two methods, counterbalancing and confound regression, in their ability to control for confounds;\\nC_LIO_LIWe find that counterbalancing leads to positive bias because it removes hard-to-classify samples;\\nC_LIO_LIWe find that confound regression leads to negative bias, because it yields data with less signal than expected by chance;\\nC_LIO_LIOur simulations demonstrate a tight relationship between model performance in decoding analyses and the sample distribution of the correlation coefficient;\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that the negative bias observed in confound regression can be remedied by cross-validating the confound regression procedure;\\nC_LI",

While changes in tendon structure have been linked with tendinopathy, the effects of distance running on tendon structure is not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize structural differences in the Achilles tendons in healthy young adults and competitive distance runners using quantitative ultrasound analyses. We hypothesized that competitive distance runners with no clinical signs or symptoms of tendinopathy would have quantitative signs of tendon damage, characterized by decreased collagen alignment and echogenicity, in addition to previous reports of thicker tendons. Longitudinal ultrasound images of the right Achilles tendon mid-substance were acquired in competitive distance runners and recreationally-active adults. Collagen organization, mean echogenicity, and tendon thickness were quantified using image processing techniques. Clinical assessments confirmed that runners had no signs or symptoms of tendinopathy and controls were only included if they had no history of Achilles tendon pain or injuries. Runner tendons were 40% less organized, 48% thicker, and 41% less echogenic compared to the control tendons (p < 0.001). Young adults engaged in competitive distance-running have structurally different tendons than recreationally-active young adults. While these structural differences have been associated with tendon damage, the lack of clinical symptoms of tendinopathy may suggest that these detected differences may either be precursors of tendinopathy development or protective adaptations to cyclic tendon loading experienced during running.",

However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs.

    "abstract": "To understand how neural circuits process information, it is essential to identify the relationship between computation and circuit topology. Rich-clubs, highly interconnected sets of neurons, are known to propagate a disproportionate amount of information within cortical circuits. Here, we test the hypothesis that rich-clubs also perform a disproportionate amount of computation. To do so, we recorded the spiking activity of on average [~]300 well-isolated individual neurons from organotypic cortical cultures. We then constructed weighted, directed networks reflecting the effective connectivity between the neurons. For each neuron, we quantified the amount of computation it performed based on its inputs. We found that rich-club neurons compute [~]200% more information than neurons outside of the rich club. Indeed, the amount of computation performed in the rich-club was proportional to the amount information propagation by the same neurons. This suggests that, in these circuits, information propagation drives computation. Comparing the computation-to-propagation ratio inside versus outside of the rich club showed that rich clubs compute at a slightly, though significantly, reduced level ([~]4% lower). In total, our findings indicate that rich club topology in effective cortical circuits supports not only information propagation but also neural computation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHere we answer the question of whether rich club topology in functional cortical circuits supports neural computation as it has been previously shown to do for information propagation. To do so, we combined network analysis with information theoretic tools to analyze the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons recorded from organotypic cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that neurons in rich clubs computed significantly more than neurons outside of rich clubs, suggesting that rich-clubs do support computation in cortical circuits.

    "abstract": "Achilles tendon ruptures are painful injuries that often lead to long-term functional deficits. Despite the prevalence of these injuries, the mechanism responsible for limited function has not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to present preliminary findings that support a hypothesis that skeletal muscle remodeling is the driving factor of poor outcomes in some patients. Biomechanical and ultrasonography assessments were performed on a patient that presented with poor functional outcomes 2.5 years after a surgically-repaired acute Achilles tendon rupture. Single-leg heel raise function was decreased by 70% in the affected limb while walking mechanics showed no deficits. Ultrasonography revealed that the affected limb had shorter, more pennated, and less thick medial gastrocnemius muscles compared to the unaffected limb. A simple computational model of a maximal-effort plantarflexion contraction was employed to test the implications of muscle remodeling on single-leg heel raise function. Subject-specific fascicle length and pennation measurements explained deficits in ankle work and power that strongly agreed with experimentally measured values using motion capture. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that skeletal muscle goes extensively remodels in response to a ruptured tendon, which reduces the amount of work and power the joint can generate. This multidisciplinary framework of biomechanical, imaging, and computational modeling provides a unique platform for studying the complex interactions between structure and function in patients recovering from Achilles tendon injuries.",

    "abstract": "Geometric and tendon excursion methods have both been used extensively for estimating plantarflexor muscle moment arm in vivo. Geometric measures often utilize magnetic resonance imaging, which can be costly and impractical for many investigations. Estimating moment arm from tendon excursion measured with ultrasonography may provide a cost-effective alternative to geometric measures of moment arm, but how well such measures represent geometry-based moment arms remains in question. The purpose of this study was to determine whether moment arms from tendon excursion can serve as a surrogate for moment arms measured geometrically. Magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging were performed on 19 young male subjects to quantify plantarflexor moment arm based on geometric and tendon excursion paradigms, respectively. These measurements were only moderately correlated (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.052), and moment arm from tendon excursion under-approximated geometric moment arm by nearly 40% (p < 0.001). This moderate correlation between methods is at odds with a prior report (N = 9) of a very strong correlation (R2 = 0.94) in a similar study. Therefore, we performed 92,378 regression analyses (19 choose 9) to determine if such a strong correlation existed in our study population. We found that certain sub-populations of the current study generated similarly strong coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.92), but 84% of all analyses revealed no correlation (p > 0.05). Our results suggest that the moment arms from musculoskeletal geometry cannot be otherwise obtained by simply scaling moment arms estimated from tendon excursion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEffective classification of cancer patients into groups with differential survival remains an important and unsolved challenge. Biomarkers have been developed based on mRNA abundance data, but their replicability and clinical utility is modest. Integrating functional information, such as pathway data, has been suggested to improve biomarker performance. To date, however, the advantages of subnetwork-based biomarkers have not been quantified.\\n\\nResultsWe deeply sampled the population of prognostic gene-based and subnetwork-based biomarkers in a breast cancer meta-dataset of 4,960 patients. Analysing the performance and robustness of 22,000,000 gene biomarkers and 6,250,000 subnetwork biomarkers across twenty different training:testing cohort partitions of the meta-dataset revealed that subnetwork biomarkers exhibit superior overall performance and higher concordance across partitions. We find evidence of an upper bound for optimal biomarker size of [~]200 genes or [~]100 subnetworks. Additionally, with both biomarker feature types, larger biomarkers tend to show less consistency in performance across partitions, suggestive of over-fitting. Finally, an evaluation of varying training cohort sizes quantifies the effects of training cohort size.\\n\\nConclusionsMany groups are developing techniques for exploiting network-based representations of biological pathways to characterize cancer and other diseases. By considering the distribution of gene- and subnetwork-based biomarkers, we show that pathway data improves performance and replicability, and that smaller biomarkers are more robust across patient cohorts.

    "abstract": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) utilizes a bifurcated cellular entry strategy, fusing either with the plasma membrane or, after endocytosis, with the endosome membrane. Whether cellular factors restrict or enhance either entry pathway is largely unknown. We found that the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits hMPV infection to an extent similar to endocytosis-inhibiting drugs, and an IFITM3 variant that accumulates at the plasma membrane in addition to its endosome localization provided increased virus restriction. Mechanistically, IFITM3 blocks hMPV F protein-mediated membrane fusion, and inhibition of infection was reversed by the membrane destabilizing drug amphotericin B. Conversely, we unexpectedly found that infection by some hMPV strains is enhanced by Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), an endosomal protein, suggesting that cellular entry via endocytosis may be particularly advantageous for hMPV despite eventual restriction of this pathway upon induction of IFITM3. Overall, our results identify IFITM3 and TLR7 as endosomal factors differentially regulating hMPV infection.",

MCI individuals were clinically evaluated 24 months after the MRI scan, and the group further divided into a subset of subjects who either did (c-MCI) or did not (nc-MCI) convert to AD. Compared to HC subjects, AD patients exhibited a collapse of long-range connectivity from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, pronounced cortical/sub-cortical atrophy, and a dramatic decline in cognitive performances. c-MCI patients showed entorhinal and hippocampal hypo-connectivity, no signs of cortical thinning but evidence of right hippocampus atrophy. On the contrary, nc-MCI patients showed lack of brain atrophy, largely preserved cognitive functions, hippocampal and entorhinal hyper-connectivity with selected neocortical/sub-cortical regions mainly involved in memory processing and brain meta-stability. This hyper-connectivity can represent an early compensatory strategy to overcome the progression of cognitive impairment. This functional signature can also be employed for the diagnosis of c-MCI subjects.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal models are commonly used to quantify joint motions and loads during human motion. Constraining joint kinematics simplifies these models but the implications of the number of markers used during data acquisition remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to establish the effects of marker placement and quantity on kinematic fidelity when using a constrained-kinematic model. We hypothesized that a constrained-kinematic model would faithfully reproduce lower extremity kinematics regardless of the number of tracking markers removed from the thigh and shank. Healthy-young adults (N = 10) walked on a treadmill at slow, moderate, and fast speeds while skin-mounted markers were tracked using motion capture. Lower extremity kinematics were calculated for 256 combinations of leg and shank markers to establish the implications of marker placement and quantity on joint kinematics. Sagittal joint and hip coronal kinematics errors were smaller than documented errors caused by soft-tissue artifact, which tends to be approximately 5 degrees, when excluding thigh and shank markers. Joint angle and center kinematic errors negatively correlated with the number of markers included in the analyses (R2 > 0.97) and typically showed the greatest error reductions when two markers were included. Further, we demonstrated that a simplified marker set that included markers on the pelvis, lateral knee condyle, lateral malleolus, and shoes produced kinematics that strongly agreed with the traditional marker set. In conclusion, constrained-kinematic models are resilient to marker placement and quantity, which has implications on study design and post-processing workflows.\\n\\nEthics Approval and Consent to Participate this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania (#824466).

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of cancer is important for the development of appropriate cancer therapies. The task is challenging because tumors evolve as heterogeneous cell populations with an unknown number of genetically distinct subclones of varying frequencies. Conventional approaches based on bulk sequencing are limited in addressing this challenge as clones cannot be observed directly. Single-cell sequencing holds the promise of resolving the heterogeneity of tumors; however, it has its own challenges including elevated error rates, allelic dropout, and uneven coverage. Here, we develop a new approach to mutation detection in individual tumor cells by leveraging the evolutionary relationship among cells. Our method, called SCI{Phi}, jointly calls mutations in individual cells and estimates the tumor phylogeny among these cells. Employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme we robustly account for the various sources of noise in single-cell sequencing data. Our approach enables us to reliably call mutations in each single cell even in experiments with high dropout rates and missing data. We show that SCI{Phi} outperforms existing methods on simulated data and applied it to different real-world datasets, namely a whole exome breast cancer as well as a panel acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset.

We are able expand total B cells in culture 10-fold and outgrow the IgD+IgM+CD27- naive subset from 35% to over 80% of the culture.

    "abstract": "The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In Caenorhabditis elegans, RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. Through separate physiological mechanisms, RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli. Based on these observations, we proposed a model for how RIA may integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.",

    "abstract": "Biogeochemical hotspots are pervasive at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, particularly within groundwater-surface water mixing zones (hyporheic zones), and they are critical to understanding spatiotemporal variation in biogeochemical cycling. Here, we use multi  omic comparisons of hotspots to low-activity sediments to gain mechanistic insight into hyporheic zone organic matter processing. We hypothesized that microbiome structure and function, as described by metagenomics and metaproteomics, would distinguish hotspots from low-activity sediments through a shift towards carbohydrate-utilizing metabolic pathways and elucidate discrete mechanisms governing organic matter processing in each location. We also expected these differences to be reflected in the metabolome, whereby hotspot carbon (C) pools and metabolite transformations therein would be enriched in sugar-associated compounds. In contrast to expectations, we found pronounced phenotypic plasticity in the hyporheic zone microbiome that was denoted by similar microbiome structure, functional potential, and expression across sediments with dissimilar metabolic rates. Instead, diverse nitrogenous metabolites and biochemical transformations characterized hotspots. Metabolomes also corresponded more strongly to aerobic metabolism than bulk C content only (explaining 67% vs. 42% of variation), and bulk C did not improve statistical models based on metabolome composition alone. These results point to organic nitrogen as a significant regulatory factor influencing hyporheic zone organic matter processing. Based on our findings, we propose incorporating knowledge of metabolic pathways associated with different chemical fractions of C pools into ecosystem models will enhance prediction accuracy.",

No studies have yet explored chemical modification at all positions of the crRNA guide and tracrRNA cofactor. Here, we have identified several heavily-modified versions of crRNA and tracrRNA that are more potent than their unmodified counterparts. In addition, we describe fully chemically modified crRNAs and tracrRNAs (containing no 2-OH groups) that are functional in human cells.

    "abstract": "The influenza A matrix 2 (M2) transmembrane protein facilitates virion release from the infected host cell. In particular, M2 plays a role in the induction of membrane curvature and/or in the scission process whereby the envelope is cut upon virion release. Here we show using coarse-grained computer simulations that various M2 assembly geometries emerge due to an entropic driving force, resulting in compact clusters or linearly extended aggregates as a direct consequence of the lateral membrane stresses. Conditions under which these protein assemblies will cause the lipid membrane to curve are explored and we predict that a critical cluster size is required for this to happen. We go on to demonstrate that under the stress conditions taking place in the cellular membrane as it undergoes large-scale membrane remodeling, the M2 protein will in principle be able to both contribute to curvature induction and sense curvature in order to line up in manifolds where local membrane line tension is high. M2 is found to exhibit linactant behavior in liquid-disordered/liquid-ordered phase-separated lipid mixtures and to be excluded from the liquid-ordered phase, in near-quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Our findings support a role for M2 in membrane remodeling during influenza viral budding both as an inducer and a sensor of membrane curvature, and they suggest a mechanism by which localization of M2 can occur as the virion assembles and releases from the host cell, independent of how the membrane curvature is produced.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFor influenza virus to release from the infected host cell, controlled viral budding must finalize with membrane scission of the viral envelope. Curiously, influenza carries its own protein, M2, which can sever the membrane of the constricted budding neck. Here we elucidate the physical mechanism of clustering and spatial localization of the M2 scission proteins through a combined computational and experimental approach. Our results provide fundamental insights into how M2 clustering and localization interplays with membrane curvature, membrane lateral stresses, and lipid bilayer phase behavior during viral budding in order to contribute to virion release.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modification of histones, such as histone methylation controlled by specific methyltransferases and demethylases, play critical roles in modulating chromatin dynamics and transcription in eukaryotes. Misregulation of histone methylation can lead to aberrant gene expression, thereby contributing to abnormal development and diseases such as cancer. As such, the mammalian lysine-specific demethylase 2 (KDM2) homologs, KDM2A and KDM2B, are either oncogenic or tumor suppressive, depending on specific pathological contexts. However, the role of KDM2 proteins during development in the whole organisms remains poorly understood. Unlike vertebrates, Drosophila has only one KDM2 homolog (dKDM2), but its functions in vivo remain elusive due to the complexities of the existing mutant alleles. To address this problem, we have generated two dKdm2 null alleles using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. These dKdm2 homozygous mutants are fully viable and fertile, with no developmental defects observed under laboratory conditions. However, the dKdm2 null mutant adults display defects in circadian rhythms. Most of the dKdm2 mutants become arrhythmic under constant darkness, while the circadian period of the rhythmic mutant flies is approximately one hour shorter than the control. Interestingly, opposite defects are observed when dKDM2 is overexpressed in circadian pacemaker neurons. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dKdm2 is not essential for viability; instead, dKDM2 protein plays important roles in regulating circadian rhythms in Drosophila. Further analyses of the molecular mechanisms of how dKDM2 and its orthologs in vertebrates regulate circadian rhythms will advance our understanding of the epigenetic regulations of circadian clocks.",

    "abstract": "The in vitro methods to recapitulate environmental cues around cells are usually optimized to test a specific property of the environment (biochemical nature or the stiffness of the extra cellular matrix (ECM), or nanotopography) for its capability to induce defined cell behaviors (lineage commitment, migration). Approaches that combine different environmental cues in 3D to assess the biological response of cells to the spatial organization of different biophysical and biochemical cues are growingly being developed. We demonstrate how the lamination of through-hole polymeric bio-functionalized membranes can be implemented to create complex bona fide micro-niches with differential 3D environmental properties using photoactive materials. Our approach enables to create micro-niches ranging in size from single cells to cell aggregates. They are bio-functionalized in 3D simultaneously with topographical featured, protein patterns and structured ECM surrogate with 1 micrometer resolution. We demonstrate how these niches extend in 3D the ability to pattern cells. We exemplify how they can be used to standardize cells shapes in 3D and to trigger the apico-basal polarization of single epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEntry into genetic competence in streptococci is controlled by ComX, an alternative sigma factor for genes that enable the import of exogenous DNA. In Streptococcus mutans, the immediate activator of comX is the ComRS signaling system, which consists of the cytosolic receptor ComR and the 7-residue signal peptide XIP, which is derived from ComS. Extracellular XIP imported by an oligopeptide permease interacts with ComR to form a transcriptional activator for both comX and comS. Therefore, extracellular XIP can function as an exogenous signal to trigger S. mutans competence. However, the mechanisms that process ComS and export it as XIP are not fully known in S. mutans. The observation that comX is expressed bimodally under some environmental conditions suggests that ComR may also interact with endogenously produced XIP or ComS, creating an intracellular positive feedback loop in comS transcription. Here we use single cell and microfluidic methods to compare the effects of the native comS gene and extracellular XIP on comX expression. We find that deletion of comS reduces the response of comX to extracellular XIP. We also find that comS-overexpressing cells autoactivate their comX even when their growth medium is rapidly exchanged, although this autoactivation requires an intact copy of comS under control of its own promoter. However comS-overexpressing cells do not activate comS-deficient mutants growing in coculture. These data show that individual cells can activate comX without exporting or importing the XIP or ComS signal, and that endogenously and exogenously produced ComS/XIP have inequivalent effects on comX behavior. These data are fully consistent with a model in which intracellular positive feedback in comS transcription plays a role in ComRS signaling, and is responsible for the bimodal expression of comX.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHeterogeneous gene expression in genetically identical populations plays an important role in bacterial persistence and survival under changing environmental conditions. In the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, the physiological state of genetic competence can exhibit bimodality, with only some cells becoming competent. S. mutans controls its entry into competence by using the ComRS signaling system to activate comX, a gene encoding the master competence regulator ComX. The ComRS system is understood as a quorum sensing system, in which the extracellular accumulation of the small signal peptide XIP, derived from ComS, induces comX expression. We coupled observation of bacteria that fluoresce when comX is active with mathematical analysis and chemical binding assays to show that activation of comX does not necessarily require extracellular XIP or ComS, and that comX-active cells do not necessarily export XIP. Our experiments and mathematical modeling indicate that a positive feedback loop in comS transcription allows a cell to activate comX in response to its own XIP or ComS in the absence of extracellular XIP, or to amplify its comX response to extracellular XIP if present. Such positive feedback loops are often the cause of bimodal gene expression like that seen in S. mutans competence.",

    "abstract": "One key problem in precision genome editing is the resultant unpredictable plurality of sequence outcomes at the site of targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This is due to the typical activation of the versatile Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. Such unpredictability limits the utility of somatic gene editing for applications including gene therapy and functional genomics. For germline editing work, the accurate reproduction of identical alleles using NHEJ is a labor intensive process. In this study, we propose inducing Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ) as a viable solution for improving somatic sequence homogeneity in vivo, capable of generating a single predictable allele at high rates (56% ~ 86% of the entire mutant allele pool). Using a combined dataset from zebrafish (Danio rerio) in vivo and human HeLa cell in vitro as a training dataset, we identified specific contextual sequence determinants surrounding genomic DSBs for robust MMEJ pathway activation. We then applied our observation and prospectively designed MMEJ-inducing sgRNAs against a variety of proof-of-principle genes and demonstrated a high level of mutant allele homogeneity at these loci. F0 mutant zebrafish embryos and larvae generated with these gRNAs faithfully recapitulated previously reported, recessive loss-of-function phenotypes. We also provide a novel algorithm MENTHU (http://genesculpt.org/menthu/) for improved prediction of candidate MMEJ loci, suitable for both targeted and genome-wide applications. We believe that this MMEJ-centric approach will have a broad impact on genome engineering and its applications. For example, whereas somatic mosaicism hinders efficient recreation of a knockout mutant allele at base pair resolution via the standard NHEJ-based approach, we demonstrate that F0 founders transmitted the identical MMEJ allele of interest at high rates. Most importantly, the ability to directly dictate the reading frame of an endogenous target will have important implications for gene therapy applications in human genetic diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNew gene editing tools precisely break DNA at pre-defined genomic locations, but cells repair these lesions using diverse pathways that often lead to unpredictable outcomes in the resulting DNA sequences. This sequence diversity in gene editing outcomes represents an important obstacle to the application of this technology for human therapies. Using a vertebrate animal as a model system, we provide strong evidence that we can overcome this obstacle by selectively directing DNA repair of double-stranded breaks through a lesser-described pathway termed Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ). Unlike other, better-understood pathways, MMEJ uses recurring short sequence patterns surrounding the site of DNA breakage. This enables the prediction of repair outcomes with improved accuracy. Importantly, we also show that preferential activation of MMEJ is compatible with effective gene editing. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm and software for designing DNA-breaking reagents that have high chance of activating the MMEJ pathway. We believe that the MMEJ-centric approach to be broadly applicable for a variety of gene editing applications both within the laboratory and for human therapies.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionHA contributed in Conceptualization, Data Curation, Formal Analysis, Investigation, Funding Acquisition, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - Original draft preparation, and Writing - Review and Editing.

    "abstract": "Like most animals, the survival of fish depends crucially on navigation in space. This capacity has been documented in numerous behavioral studies that have revealed navigation strategies and the sensory modalities used for navigation. However, virtually nothing is known about how freely swimming fish represent space and locomotion in the brain to enable successful navigation. Using a novel wireless neural recording system, we measured the activity of single neurons in the goldfish lateral pallium, a brain region known to be involved in spatial memory and navigation, while the fish swam freely in a two-dimensional water tank. Four cell types were identified: border cells, head direction cells, speed cells and conjunction head direction with speed. Border cells were active when the fish was near the boundary of the environment. Head direction cells were shown to encode head direction. Speed cells only encoded the absolute speed independent of direction suggestive of an odometry signal. Finally, the conjunction of head direction with speed cells represented the velocity of the fish. This study thus sheds light on how information related to navigation is represented in the brain of swimming fish, and addresses the fundamental question of the neural basis of navigation in this diverse group of vertebrates. The similarities between our observations in fish and earlier findings in mammals may indicate that the networks controlling navigation in vertebrate originate from an ancient circuit common across vertebrates.\\n\\nSummaryNavigation is a fundamental behavioral capacity facilitating survival in many animal species. Fish is one lineage where navigation has been explored behaviorally, but it remains unclear how freely swimming fish represent space and locomotion in the brain. This is a key open question in our understanding of navigation in fish and more generally in understanding the evolutionary origin of the brains navigation system. To address this issue, we recorded neuronal signals from the brain of freely swimming goldfish and successfully identified representations of border and swimming kinematics in a brain region known to be associated with navigation. Our findings thus provide a glimpse into the building blocks of the neural representation underlying fish navigation. The similarity of the representation in fish with that of mammals may be key evidence supporting a preserved ancient mechanism across brain evolution.",

    "abstract": "Stochasticity in gene expression impacts the dynamics and functions of gene regulatory circuits. Intrinsic noises, including those that are caused by low copy number of molecules and transcriptional bursting, are usually studied by stochastic analysis methods, such as Gillespie algorithm and Langevin simulation. However, the role of extrinsic factors, such as cell-to-cell variability and heterogeneity in microenvironment, is still elusive. To evaluate the effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic noises, we develop a new method, named sRACIPE, by integrating stochastic analysis with random circuit perturbation (RACIPE) method. Unlike traditional methods, RACIPE generates and analyzes an ensemble of mathematical models with random kinetic parameters. Previously, we have shown that the gene expression from random models form robust and functionally related clusters. Under the framework of this randomization-based approach, here we develop two stochastic simulation schemes, aiming to reduce the computational cost without sacrificing the convergence of statistics. One scheme uses constant noise to capture the basins of attraction, and the other one uses simulated annealing to detect the stability of states. By testing the methods on several gene regulatory circuits, we found that high noise, but not large parameter variation, merges clusters together. Our approach quantifies the robustness of a gene circuit in the presence of noise and sheds light on a new mechanism of noise induced hybrid states. We have implemented sRACIPE into a freely available R package.",

The same genotype can produce different phenotypes in response to different environments, but whether such plasticity constrains or facilitates evolutionary change remains an unresolved and controversial problem (Ghalambor et al. 2007). Theoretical models to date have made diverse predictions on the role of plasticity in evolutionary divergence (e.g. Ancel 2000; Paenke et al. 2007; Thibert-Plante and Hendry 2011), and empirical studies have largely been limited to retrospective approaches that infer the role of plasticity long-after popu ...",

Nuclear accumulation of IL-33 has been reported in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) during intestinal inflammation and cancer, but a functional role for this nuclear form remains unclear. To study the role of nuclear IL-33 in IEC, we generated transgenic mice expressing full-length IL-33 in the intestinal epithelium (Vfl33 mice). Expression of full-length IL-33 in the epithelium resulted in accumulation of IL-33 protein in the nucleus and secretion of IL-33. Over-expression of full-length IL-33 by IEC did not promote gut inflammation, but induced expression of genes in the IEC and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) that correlated negatively with genes expressed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Because the IL-33 receptor ST2 is expressed by IEC, there was the potential that both the mature and full-length forms could mediate this effect. To specifically interrogate the transcriptional role of nuclear IL-33, we intercrossed the Vfl33 mice with ST2-deficient mice. ST2 deficiency completely abrogated the transcriptional effects elicited by IL-33 expression, suggesting that the transcriptional effects of IL-33 on IEC are mediated by its mature, not its nuclear form.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIExpression of full-length IL-33 in the epithelium resulted in accumulation of IL-33 protein in the nucleus and secretion of IL-33.\\nC_LIO_LIFull-length IL-33 induced differential gene expression in IEC and LPL that was negatively associated with intestinal inflammatory diseases\\nC_LIO_LIIL-33 regulated gene expression in IEC via its extracellular (mature) form not via its nuclearform.\\nC_LI",
