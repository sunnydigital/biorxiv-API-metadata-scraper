    "abstract": "The treatment of epilepsy using antiepileptogenic drugs is complicated by drug re-sistance, resulting in treatment failure in more than one-third of cases. Human P-glycoprotein (hPGP; MDR1) is a known epileptogenic mediator. Given that experimental investigations have suggested a role for pharmacogenetics in this treatment failure, it would be of interest to study hPGP polymorphisms that might contribute to the emergence of drug resistance. Changes in protein functional activity could result from point mutations as well as altered abundance. Bioinformatics approaches were used to assess and rank the functional impact of 20 missense MDR1 polymorphisms and the top five were selected. The structures of the wildtype and mutant hPGP were modelled based on the mouse PGP structure. Docking studies of the wildtype and mutant hPGP with four standard anti-epileptic drugs were carried out. Our results revealed that the drug binding site with respect to the wildtype protein was uniform. However the mutant hPGP proteins displayed a repertoire of binding sites with stronger binding affinities towards the drug. Our studies indicated that specific polymorphisms in MDR1 could drive conformational changes of PGP structure, facilitating altered contacts with drug-substrates and resulting in drug extrusion. This suggests that MDR1 polymorphisms could play an active role in modifying drug bioavailability, leading to pharmacoresistance in antiepileptic chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants probability of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions time, but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a \\\"stochastic satisficing\\\" (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen options thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence. We further tested and verified the predictions of this model in a second experiment. Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions. Finally, we discuss how the stochastic satisficing account of decision confidence serves psychological and social purposes associated with the evaluation, communication and justification of decision-making.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEvery day we make several choices under uncertainty, like choosing a queue in a supermarket. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such decisions remain unknown. For example, how does one choose between an option with unreliable high expected reward, like the volatile express queue, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward in the standard queue? Inspired by bounded rationality and the notion of  satisficing, i.e. settling for a good enough option, we propose that such decisions are made by comparing the likelihood of different actions to surpass an acceptability threshold. When facing uncertain decisions, our participants confidence ratings were not consistent with the expected outcomes rewards, but instead followed the satisficing heuristic proposed here. Using an acceptability threshold may be especially useful when evaluating and justifying decisions under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Human sociality depends upon the benefits of mutual aid and extensive communication. However, diverse norms and preferences complicate mutual aid, and ambiguity in meaning hinders communication. Here we demonstrate that these two problems can work together to enhance cooperation through the strategic use of deliberately ambiguous signals: covert signaling. Covert signaling is the transmission of information that is accurately received by its intended audience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow coordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or hostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the empirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling, such as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics. We introduce a novel mathematical model to assess when a covert signaling strategy will evolve, as well as how receiver attitudes coevolve with covert signals. Covert signaling plausibly serves an important function in facilitating within-group cooperative assortment by allowing individuals to pair up with similar group members when possible and to get along with dissimilar ones when necessary. This mechanism has broad implications for theories of signaling and cooperation, humor, social identity, political psychology, and the evolution of human cultural complexity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data contains a wealth of information which has to be inferred computationally from the observed sequencing reads. As the ability to sequence more cells improves rapidly, existing computational tools suffer from three problems. (1) The decreased reads-per-cell implies a highly sparse sample of the true cellular transcriptome. (2) Many tools simply cannot handle the size of the resulting datasets. (3) Prior biological knowledge such as bulk RNA-seq information of certain cell types or qualitative marker information is not taken into account. Here we present UNCURL, a preprocessing framework based on non-negative matrix factorization for scRNA-seq data, that is able to handle varying sampling distributions, scales to very large cell numbers and can incorporate prior knowledge.\\n\\nResultsWe find that preprocessing using UNCURL consistently improves performance of commonly used scRNA-seq tools for clustering, visualization, and lineage estimation, both in the absence and presence of prior knowledge. Finally we demonstrate that UNCURL is extremely scalable and parallelizable, and runs faster than other methods on a scRNA-seq dataset containing 1.3 million cells.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code is available at https://github.com/yjzhang/uncurl_python\\n\\nContactksreeram@uw.edu, gseelig@uw.edu",

    "abstract": "Whole cell responses involve multiple subcellular processes (SCPs). To understand how balance between SCPs controls the dynamics of whole cell responses we studied neurite outgrowth in rat primary cortical neurons in culture. We used a combination of dynamical models and experiments to understand the conditions that permitted growth at a specified velocity and when aberrant growth could lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We hypothesized that dystrophic bulb formation is due to quantitative imbalances between SCPs. Simulations predict redundancies between lower level sibling SCPs within each type of high level SCP. In contrast, higher level SCPs, such as vesicle transport and exocytosis or microtubule growth characteristic of each type need to be strictly coordinated with each other and imbalances result in stalling of neurite outgrowth. From these simulations, we predicted the effect of changing the activities of SCPs involved in vesicle exocytosis or microtubule growth could lead to formation of dystrophic bulbs. siRNA ablation experiments verified these predictions. We conclude that whole cell dynamics requires balance between the higher-level SCPs involved and imbalances can terminate whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of DNA is increasingly understood to play a decisive role in gene regulation and other vital cellular processes, which has triggered an explosive growth of research on the spatial architecture of the genome. Many studies focus on the role of various DNA-packaging proteins, crowding, and confinement in organizing chromatin, but structural information might also be directly encoded in bare DNA itself. Here, we use a fluorescence-based single-molecule technique to visualize plectonemes, the extended intertwined DNA loops that form upon twisting DNA. Remarkably, we find that the underlying DNA sequence directly encodes the structure of supercoiled DNA by pinning plectonemes at specific positions. We explore a variety of DNA sequences to determine what features influence pinning, and we develop a physical model that predicts the level of plectoneme pinning in excellent agreement with the data. The intrinsic curvature measured over a range of ~70 base pairs is found to be the key property governing the supercoiled structure of DNA. Our model predicts that plectonemes are likely to localize directly upstream of prokaryotic transcription start sites, and this prediction is experimentally verified in vitro. Our results reveal a hidden code in DNA that helps to spatially organize the genome.",

This trend has introduced at least two novel problems: an elevated risk of somatic disorders, such as cancer, and declining evolvability due to reduced population size, lower reproduction rate and extended generation time. Low population size is widely recognized to explain the high mutation rates in animals by limiting the presumed universally negative selection acting on mutation rates. Here, we present evidence from stochastic modeling that the direction and strength of selection acting on mutation rates is highly dependent on the evolution of somatic maintenance, and thus longevity, which modulates the cost of somatic mutations. We argue that this mechanism may have been critical in facilitating animal evolution.",

    "abstract": "Light is one of the main signals that regulates flowering. Low red to far-red ratios accelerate flowering in a wide range of species. The central gene pathways controlling flowering time in Arabidopsis, appear to be largely conserved in legumes. However, numerous examples exist of gene duplication and loss. The role of CONSTANS-LIKE genes as integrators of the photoperiod response has been questioned in several dicot species, including legumes. In this study on subterranean clover, using RNA-seq and controlled light spectra, we identified 13 differentially expressed genes related to light signalling, meristem identity and flowering promotion. Of these, we pinpointed genes which seem to link photoperiod and far-red light signalling coding for a With no lysine kinase, a CCT motif related to CONSTANS, a FLOWERING LOCUS T b2 like protein, and their active downstream cascade. The earlier down-regulation of these genes under blue compared to far-red-enriched light may explain their role in floral induction. A second independent approach (qPCR analysis) confirmed our findings. Contrasting responses to light quality related to reproduction and defence mechanisms were also found. These results will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of flowering in response to light quality in long-day plants.",

The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1-3, or Y1-3) bind to m6A-modified cellular mRNA and modulate its metabolism and processing, thereby affecting protein translation in cells. We previously reported that HIV-1 RNA contains m6A modification and that Y1-3 proteins inhibit HIV-1 infection by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription. Here we extended our studies to further understand the mechanisms of Y1-3-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection and viral production.\\n\\nResultsOverexpression of Y1-3 proteins in HIV-1 target cells decreased viral genome RNA (gRNA) levels and inhibited early and late reverse transcription. Purified recombinant Y1-3 proteins preferentially bound to the m6A-modified 5 leader sequence of gRNA compared with its unmodified RNA counterpart, consistent with the strong binding of Y1-3 to HIV-1 gRNA in infected cells. HIV-1 mutants with two altered m6A modification sites in the 5 leader sequence of gRNA demonstrated significantly lower infectivity compared with wild-type HIV-1, confirming that these sites are important for viral infection. HIV-1 produced from cells with knockdown of endogenous Y1, Y3, or Y1-3 proteins together showed increased viral infectivity compared with HIV-1 produced from control cells. Interestingly, we found that Y1-3 proteins and HIV-1 Gag formed a complex with RNA in HIV-1-infected target cells.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest the inhibitory effects of Y1-3 proteins on HIV-1 infection and provide new insight into the mechanisms of m6A modification of HIV-1 RNA in regulating viral replication, which clarify some discrepancies in the previously published studies in this area.",

This process has two phases: a rapid initiation (primary mineralization), followed by slower accrual of mineral (secondary mineralization) that continues until that portion of bone is renewed by remodelling. Within the bone matrix is an interconnected network of cells termed osteocytes. These cells are derived from bone-forming osteoblasts. Osteoblast differentiation requires expression of ephrinB2, and we were intrigued about why ephrinB2 continues to be expressed in mature osteocytes. To determine its function in osteocytes, we developed an osteocyte-specific ephrinB2 null mouse and found they exhibited a brittle bone phenotype. This was not caused by a change in bone mass, but by an intrinsic defect in the strength of the bone material. Although the initiation of osteoid mineralization occurred at a normal rate, the process of secondary mineralization was accelerated in these mice. The maturing mineralized bone matrix incorporated mineral and carbonate more rapidly than controls, indicating that osteocytic ephrinB2 suppresses mineral accumulation in bone. No known regulators of mineralization were modified in the bone of these mice. However, RNA sequencing showed differential expression of a group of autophagy-associated genes, and increased autophagic flux was confirmed in ephrinB2 knockdown osteocytes. This indicates that the process of secondary mineralization in bone makes use of autophagic machinery in a manner that is limited by ephrinB2 in osteocytes, and that this process may be disrupted in conditions of bone fragility.",

VideoTagger allows non-programming users to efficiently explore, annotate, and visualize large quantities of video data, within their existing experimental protocols. Further, it is built to accept programmed plugins written in Python, to enable seamless integration with other sophisticated computer-aided analyses.\\n\\nWe tested VideoTagger ourselves, and have a growing base of users in other scientific disciplines. Capitalising on the unique features of VideoTagger to play back infinite lengths of video footage at various speeds, we annotated 39h of a Drosophila melanogaster lifespan video, at approximately 10-15x faster than real-time. We then used these labels to train a machine-learning plugin, which we used to annotate an additional 538h of footage automatically. In this way, we found that flies fall over spontaneously with increasing frequency as they age, and also spend longer durations struggling to right themselves. Ageing in flies is typically defined by length of life. We propose that this new mobility measure of ageing could help the discovery of mechanisms in biogerontology, refining our definition of what healthy ageing means in this extremely small, but widely used, invertebrate.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show how VideoTagger is sufficiently flexible for studying lengthy and/or numerous video experiments, thus directly improving scientists productivity across varied domains.",

Many collective decisions are achieved via communication, for example by differential recruitment depending on resource quality. However, even species without recruitment can respond to a changing environment on collective level by tracking food source quality.\\n\\nWe hypothesised that an apparent collective decision to focus on the highest quality food source can be explained by differential learning of food qualities. Ants may learn the location of higher quality food faster, with most ants finally congregating at the best food source.\\n\\nTo test the effect of reward quality and motivation on learning in Lasius niger, we trained individual ants to find a reward of various sucrose molarities on one arm of a T-maze in spring and in autumn after one or four days of starvation.\\n\\nAs hypothesised, ants learned fastest in spring and lowest in autumn, with reduced starvation leading to slower learning. Surprisingly, the effect of food quality and motivation on the learning speed of individuals which persisted in visiting the feeders was small. However, persistence rates varied dramatically: All ants in spring made all (6) return visits to all food qualities, in contrast to 33% of ants in autumn under low starvation.\\n\\nFitting the empirical findings into an agent-based model revealed that even a tendency of ants to memorise routes to high quality food sources faster can result in ecologically sensible colony-level behaviour. Low motivation colonies are also choosier, due to increasing sensitivity to food quality.\\n\\nSignificance statementCollective decisions of insects are often achieved via communication and/or other interactions between individuals. However, animals can also make collective decisions in the absence of communication.\\n\\nWe show that foraging motivation and food quality can affect both route memory and the likelihood to return to the food source and thus mediate selective food exploitation. An agent-based model, implemented with our empirical findings, demonstrates that, at the collective level, even small differences in learning lead to ecologically sensible behaviour: mildly starved colonies are selective for high quality food while highly starved colonies exploit all food sources equally.\\n\\nWe therefore suggest that non-interactive factors such as individual learning and the foraging motivation of a colony can mediate or even drive group level behaviour. Instead of accounting collective behaviour exclusively to social interactions, possible contributing individual processes should also be considered.",

    "abstract": "The E.coli ribosome exit tunnel can accommodate small folded proteins, while larger ones fold outside. It remains unclear, however, to what extent the geometry of the tunnel influences protein folding. Here, using E. coli ribosomes with deletions in loops in proteins uL23 and uL24 that protrude into the tunnel, we investigate how tunnel geometry determines where proteins of different sizes fold. We find that a 29-residue zinc-finger domain normally folding close to the uL23 loop folds deeper in the tunnel in uL23 {Delta}loop ribosomes, while two ~100-residue protein normally folding close to the uL24 loop near the tunnel exit port fold at deeper locations in uL24 {Delta}loop ribosomes, in good agreement with results obtained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. This supports the idea that cotranslational folding commences once a protein domain reaches a location in the exit tunnel where there is sufficient space to house the folded structure.",

We develop a stochastic, lattice-based random walk model of a two-dimensional scratch assay where the total population is composed of three distinct subpopulations which we visualise as red, yellow and green subpopulations. Our model mimics FUCCI technology in which cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle fluoresce red, cells in the early S phase fluoresce yellow, and cells in the S/G2/M phase fluoresce green. The model is an exclusion process so that any potential motility or proliferation event that would place an agent on an occupied lattice site is aborted. Using experimental images and previous experimental measurements, we explain how to apply the stochastic model to simulate a scratch assay initialised with a low to moderate density monolayer of human melanoma cell line. We obtain additional mathematical insight by deriving an approximate partial differential equation (PDE) description of the stochastic model, leading to a novel system of three coupled nonlinear reaction diffusion equations. Comparing averaged simulation data with the solution of the continuum limit model confirms that the PDE description is accurate for biologically-relevant parameter combinations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disorder with increasing impact in an aging society; however, there is no cure or effective treatments so far due to lack of sufficient understanding of its pathogenesis. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and DNA methylation profiling identified many non-coding loci associated to OA, the interpretation of them remains challenging.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we employed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map the accessible chromatin landscape in articular knee cartilage of OA patients and to identify the chromatin signatures relevant to OA.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 109,215 accessible chromatin regions in cartilage and 71% of these regions were annotated as enhancers. We found these accessible chromatin regions are enriched for OA GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and OA differentially methylated loci, implying their relevance to OA. By linking these enhancers to their potential target genes, we have identified a list of candidate enhancers that may be relevant to OA. Through integration of ATAC-seq data with RNA-seq data, we identified genes that are altered both at epigenomic and transcriptomic levels. These genes are enriched in pathways regulating ossification and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Consistently, the differentially accessible regions in OA are enriched for mesenchymal stem cell-specific enhancers and motifs of transcription factor families involved in osteoblast differentiation (e.g. bZIP and ETS).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study marks the first investigation of accessible chromatin landscape on clinically relevant hard tissues and demonstrates how accessible chromatin profiling can provide comprehensive epigenetic information of a disease. Our analyses provide supportive evidence towards the model of endochondral ossification-like cartilage-to-bone conversion in OA knee cartilage, which is consistent with the OA characteristic of thicker subchondral bone. The identified OA-relevant genes and their enhancers may have a translational potential for diagnosis or drug targets.",

When bound to Argonaute (AGO) proteins, miRNAs are protected from degradation, even when released into the extracellular space in ribonucleoprotein complexes, and with or without the protection of membranes in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Purified miRNAs also appear to present less of a target for degradation than other RNAs. Although miRNAs are by no means immune to degradation, biological samples subjected to prolonged incubation at room temperature, multiple freeze/thaws, or collection in the presence of inhibitors like heparin, can typically be remediated or used directly for miRNA measurements. Here, we provide additional confirmation of early, well validated findings on miRNA stability and detectability. Our data also suggest that inadequate depletion of platelets from plasma may explain the occasional report that freeze-thaw cycles can adversely affect plasma miRNA levels. Overall, the repeated observation of miRNA stability is again confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the studyBasic wood density is an important ecological trait for woody plants. It is used to characterize species performance and fitness in community ecology, and to compute tree and forest biomass in carbon cycle studies. While wood density has been historically measured at 12% moisture, it is convenient for ecological purposes to convert this measure to basic wood density, i.e. the ratio of dry mass over green volume. Basic wood density can then be used to compute tree dry biomass from living tree volume.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we derive a new, exact formula to compute the basic wood density Db from the density at moisture content w denoted Dw, the fibre saturation point S, and the volumetric shrinkage coefficient R. We estimated a new conversion factor using a global wood technology database where values to use this formula are available for 4022 trees collected in 64 countries (mostly tropical) and representing 872 species.\\n\\nKey resultsWe show that previous conversion factors used to convert densities at 12% moisture into basic wood densities are inconsistent. Based on theory and data, we found that basic wood density could be inferred from the density at 12% moisture using the following formula: Db = 0.828D122. This value of 0.828 provides basic wood density estimates 4-5% smaller than values inferred from previous conversion factors.\\n\\nConclusionsThis new conversion factor should be used to derive basic wood densities in global wood density databases. This would prevent overestimating global forest carbon stocks and allow predicting better tree species community dynamics from wood density.",

    "abstract": "Curation of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) databases is a labor-intensive process that requires expert knowledge to manually collect, correct, and/or annotate individual genes. Correspondingly, updates to existing databases tend to be infrequent, commonly requiring years for completion and often containing inconsistences. Further, because of limitations of manual curation, most existing ARG databases contain only a small proportion of known ARGs (~5k genes). A new approach is needed to achieve a truly comprehensive ARG database, while also maintaining a high level of accuracy. Here we propose a new web-based curation system, ARG-miner, which supports annotation of ARGs at multiple levels, including: gene name, antibiotic category, resistance mechanism, and evidence for mobility and occurrence in clinically-important bacterial strains. To overcome limitations of manual curation, we employ crowdsourcing as a novel strategy for expanding curation capacity towards achieving a truly comprehensive, up-to-date database. We develop and validate the approach by comparing performance of multiple cohorts of curators with varying levels of expertise, demonstrating that ARG-miner is more cost effective and less time-consuming relative to traditional expert curation. We further demonstrate the reliability of a trust validation filter for rejecting confounding input generated by spammers. Crowdsourcing was found to be as accurate as expert annotation, with an accuracy >90% for the annotation of a diverse test set of ARGs. ARG-miner provides a public API and database available at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/argminer.",

    "abstract": "Fractal topologies, which are statistically self-similar over multiple length scales, are pervasive in nature. The recurrence of patterns at increasing length scales in fractal-shaped branched objects, e.g., trees, lungs, and sponges, results in high effective surface areas, and provides key functional advantages, e.g., for molecular trapping and exchange. Mimicking these topologies in designed protein-based assemblies will provide access to novel classes of functional biomaterials for wide ranging applications. Here, we describe a modular, multi-scale computational design method for the reversible self-assembly of proteins into tunable supramolecular fractal-like topologies in response to phosphorylation. Computationally-guided atomic-resolution modeling of fusions of symmetric, oligomeric proteins with Src homology 2 (SH2) binding domain and its phosphorylatable ligand peptide was used to design iterative branching leading to fractal-like assembly formation by enzymes of the atrazine degradation pathway. Structural characterization using various microscopy techniques and Cryo-electron tomography revealed a variety of dendritic, hyperbranched, and sponge-like topologies which are self-similar over three decades ([~]10nm-10m) of length scale, in agreement with models from multi-scale computational simulations. We demonstrate control over mesoscale topology (by linker design), formation dynamics, and functional enhancements due to dynamic multi-component assemblies constructed with three atrazine degradation pathway enzymes. The described design method should enable the construction of a variety of novel, spatiotemporally responsive catalytic biomaterials featuring fractal topologies.",

    "abstract": "Histone-modifiable lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1/KDM1A) is often upregulated in many cancers, including hepatoma, and is regarded as oncoprotein. We previously reported that the hepatoma-preventive geranylgeranoic acid (GGA) inhibits KDM1A activity at the same IC50 as that of the clinically used drug tranylcypromine, a verified inhibitor of KDM1A. Here, we report that these inhibitors induced cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear KDM1A in a human hepatoma-derived cell line. Immunofluorescence studies revealed cytoplasmic localization of KDM1A, 3 h after addition of GGA or tranylcypromine in HuH-7 cells. Geranylgeraniol and all-trans retinoic acid were both unable to induce translocation of nuclear KDM1A, whereas farnesoic acid showed the weak activity. Furthermore, GGA did not affect subcellular localization of another histone lysine-specific demethylase, KDM5A. This suggests that the inhibitor-induced translocation of nuclear KDM1A to the cytoplasm is specific for KDM1A. These data demonstrate for the first time that KDM1A inhibitors specifically induce the cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear KDM1A.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) is a rare, dominantly inherited human ataxia characterized by atrophy of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. SCA11 is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Serine/Threonine kinase Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) that result in premature truncations of the protein. We previously showed that TTBK2 is a key regulator of the assembly of primary cilia in vivo. However, the mechanisms by which the SCA11-associated mutations disrupt TTBK2 function, and whether they interfere with ciliogenesis were unknown. In this work, we present evidence that SCA11-associated mutations are dominant negative alleles and that the resulting truncated protein (TTBK2SCA11) interferes with the function of full length TTBK2 in mediating ciliogenesis. A Ttbk2 allelic series revealed that upon partial reduction of full length TTBK2 function, TTBK2SCA11 can interfere with the activity of the residual wild-type protein to decrease cilia number and interrupt cilia-dependent Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling. Our studies have also revealed new functions for TTBK2 after cilia initiation in the control of cilia length, trafficking of a subset of SHH pathway components, including Smoothened (SMO), and cilia stability. These studies provide a molecular foundation to understand the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of human SCA11, and help account for the link between ciliary dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDefects in primary cilia structure and function are linked to a number of recessive genetic disorders, now collectively referred to as ciliopathies. Most of the characteristics of these disorders arise from disruptions to embryonic development, with the requirements for primary cilia in adult tissues being less well-defined. We previously showed that a kinase associated with an adult-onset neurodegenerative condition is required for cilium assembly and ciliary signaling during development. Here, we show that the human disease-associated mutations act as mild dominant negatives, interfering with the function of the full length protein in cilia formation and ciliary signaling.",

One requirement that satisfies SAC is appropriate tension between sister chromatids at the metaphase-anaphase juncture. Proper tension generated by poleward pulling of mitotic spindles signals biorientation of the underlying chromosome. In the budding yeast, the tension status is monitored by the conserved Shugoshin protein, Sgo1p, and the tension sensing motif (TSM) of histone H3. ChIP-seq reveals a unique TSM-dependent, tripartite domain of Sgo1p in each mitotic chromosome. This domain consists of one centromeric and two flanking peaks 3 - 4 kb away, and is present exclusively in mitosis. Strikingly, this trident motif coincides with cohesin localization, but only at the centromere and the two immediate adjacent loci, despite that cohesin is enriched at numerous regions throughout mitotic chromosomes. The TSM-Sgo1p-cohesin triad is at the center stage of higher-ordered chromatin architecture for error-free segregation.",

    "abstract": "The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is required to regulate transcription and to integrate it with other essential cellular processes. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CTD of Rpb1p consists of 26 conserved heptad repeats that are post-translationally modified to orchestrate protein factor binding at different stages of the transcription cycle. A long-standing question in the study of the CTD is if there are any functional differences between the 26 repeats. In this study, we present evidence that repeats of identical sequence have different functions based on their position within the CTD. We assembled plasmids expressing Rpb1p with serine to alanine substitutions in three defined regions of the CTD and measured a range of phenotypes for yeast expressing these constructs. Mutations in the beginning and middle regions of the CTD had drastic, and region-specific effects, while mutating the distal region had no observable phenotype. Further mutational analysis determined that Ser5 within the first region of repeats was solely responsible for the observed growth differences and sequencing fast-growing suppressors allowed us to further define the functional regions of the CTD. This mutational analysis is consistent with current structural models for how the RNAPII holoenzyme and the CTD specifically would reside in complex with Mediator and establishes a foundation for studying regioselective binding along the repetitive RNAPII CTD.",

    "abstract": "Acute inflammation in humans or mice enhances the analgesic properties of opioids. However, the inflammatory transducers that prime opioid receptor signaling in nociceptors are unknown. We found that TRPV1-/- mice are insensitive to peripheral opioid analgesia in an inflammatory pain model. We report that TRPV1 channel activation drives a MAPK signaling pathway accompanied by the shuttling of {beta}-arrestin2 to the nucleus. This shuttling in turn prevents: {beta}-arrestin2-receptor recruitment, subsequent internalization of agonist-bound mu opioid receptor (MOR), and suppression of DAMGO-induced inhibition of N-type calcium current observed upon desensitization. Consequently, inflammation-induced activation of TRPV1 preserves opioid analgesic potency in a mouse model of opioid receptor desensitization. Overall, our work reveals a TRPV1-mediated signaling mechanism, involving {beta}-arrestin2 nuclear translocation, that underlies the peripheral opioid control of inflammatory pain. Our data single out TRPV1 channels as modulators of opioid analgesia.",

    "abstract": "Whereas optogenetic techniques have proven successful in their ability to manipulate neuronal populations in species ranging from insects to rodents--with high spatial and temporal fidelity--significant obstacles remain in their application to non-human primates (NHPs). Robust optogenetics-activated behavior and long-term noninvasive monitoring of target neurons, have been challenging in NHPs. Here we present a method for all-optical interrogation (AOI), integrating optical stimulation and simultaneous two-photon imaging of neuronal populations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake rhesus macaques. A red-shifted channel-rhodopsin transgene (C1V1) and genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GCaMP5 or GCaMP6s) were delivered by AAVs, and subsequently expressed in V1 neuronal populations for months with high stability. We achieved optogenetic stimulation using both single-photon (1P) activation of neuronal populations and two-photon (2P) activation of single-cells, while simultaneously recording 2P calcium imaging in awake monkeys. Optogenetic manipulations of V1 neuronal populations produced reliable artificial visual percepts. Together, our advances show the feasibility of precise and stable all-optical interrogation of cortical neurons in awake NHPs, which may facilitate broad applications in high-level cognition and pre-clinical testing studies.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disorder causing severe intellectual and physical disability. The cause is a mutation in the gene coding for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), a multifunctional regulator protein. Purpose of the study was integration and investigation of multiple gene expression profiles in human cells with impaired MECP2 gene to obtain a data-driven insight in downstream effects. Information about changed gene expression was extracted from five previously published studies. We identified a set of genes which are significantly changed not in all but several transcriptomics datasets and were not mentioned in the context of RTT before. Using overrepresentation analysis of molecular pathways and gene ontology we found that these genes are involved in several processes and molecular pathways known to be affected in RTT. Integrating transcription factors we identified a possible link how MECP2 regulates cytoskeleton organization via MEF2C and CAPG. Integrative analysis of omics data and prior knowledge databases is a powerful approach to identify links between mutation and phenotype especially in rare disease research where little data is available.\\n\\nAbbreviationsRett syndrome (RTT), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), fold change (FC), Gene Ontology (GO), EIF (eukaryotic initiation of transcription factor)\\n\\nFor genes the symbols according to the HGNC nomenclature were used.",

Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming, and quality filtering. These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level programming languages (e.g., Python and Java) and provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient.\\n\\nResultsWe developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality cutting, and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. It also supports unique molecular identifier preprocessing, poly tail trimming, output splitting, and base correction for paired-end data. It can automatically detect adapters for single-end and paired-end FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2-5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar tools.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe open-source code and corresponding instructions are available at https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp\\n\\nContactchen@haplox.com",

    "abstract": "When modeling electric current flow in neurons and excitable cells, traditional cable theory ignores electrodiffusion (i.e. the interaction between electric fields and ionic diffusion) as it assumes that concentration changes associated with ionic currents are negligible. This assumption, while true for large neuronal compartments, fails when applied to femto-liter size compartments such as dendritic spines - small protrusions that form the main site of synaptic inputs in the brain. Here, we use the Poisson (P) and Nernst-Planck (NP) equations, which relate electric field to charge and couple Ficks law of diffusion to the electric field, to model ion concentration dynamics in dendritic spines. We use experimentally measured voltage transients from spines with nanoelectrodes to explore these dynamics with realistic parameters. We find that (i) passive diffusion and electrodiffusion jointly affect the kinetics of spine excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs); (ii) spine geometry plays a key role in shaping EPSPs; and, (iii) the spine-neck resistance dynamically decreases during EPSPs, leading to short-term synaptic facilitation. Our formulation can be easily adopted to model ionic biophysics in a variety of nanoscale bio-compartments.",

ADNIV is caused by a gain of function mutation in Calpain-5 (CAPN5), a calcium dependent cysteine protease. Very little is known about the normal function of Capn5 in the adult retina, and there are conflicting results regarding its role during mammalian embryonic development. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent animal model for studying vertebrate development and tissue regeneration, and represents a novel model to explore the function of Capn5 in the eye.\\n\\nMethodsWe characterized the expression of Capn5 in the developing zebrafish central nervous system (CNS) and retina, in the adult zebrafish retina, and in response to photoreceptor degeneration and regeneration using whole mount in situ hybridization, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunohistochemistry.\\n\\nResultsIn zebrafish, capn5 is strongly expressed in the developing embryonic brain, early optic vesicles, and in newly differentiated retinal photoreceptors. We found that expression of capn5 co-localized with cone specific markers in the adult zebrafish retina. We observed an increase in expression of Capn5 in a zebrafish model of chronic rod photoreceptor degeneration and regeneration. Acute light damage to the zebrafish retina, was accompanied by an increase in expression of Capn5 in the surviving cones and in a subset of Muller glia.\\n\\nConclusionsThese studies suggest that Capn5 may play a role in CNS development, photoreceptor maintenance, and photoreceptor regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Genomic silencing can promote germ cell immortality, or transgenerational maintenance of the germ line, via mechanisms that may occur during mitosis or meiosis. Here we report that the gsp-2 PP1/Glc7 phosphatase promotes germ cell immortality. We identified a separation-of-function allele of C. elegans GSP-2 that caused a meiosis-specific chromosome segregation defect and defects in transgenerational small RNA-induced genome silencing. GSP-2 is recruited to meiotic chromosomes by LAB-1, which also promoted germ cell immortality. Sterile gsp-2 and lab-1 mutant adults displayed germline degeneration, univalents and histone phosphorylation defects in oocytes, similar to small RNA genome silencing mutants. Epistasis and RNA analysis suggested that GSP-2 functions downstream of small RNAs. We conclude that a meiosis-specific function of GSP-2/LAB-1 ties small RNA-mediated silencing of the epigenome to germ cell immortality. Given that hemizygous genetic elements can drive transgenerational epigenomic silencing, and given that LAB-1 promotes pairing of homologous chromosomes and localizes to the interface between homologous chromosomes during pachytene, we suggest that discontinuities at this interface could promote nuclear silencing in a manner that depends on GSP-2.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe germ line of an organism is considered immortal in its capacity to give rise to an unlimited number of future generations. To protect the integrity of the germ line, mechanisms act to suppress the accumulation of transgenerational damage to the genome or epigenome. Loss of germ cell immortality can result from mutations that disrupt the small RNA-mediated silencing pathway that helps to protect the integrity of the epigenome. Here we report for the first time that the C. elegans protein phosphatase GSP-2 that promotes core chromosome biology functions during meiosis is also required for germ cell immortality. Specifically, we identified a partial loss of function allele of gsp-2 that exhibits defects in meiotic chromosome segregation and is also dysfunctional for transgenerational small RNA-mediated genome silencing. Our results are consistent with a known role of Drosophila Protein Phosphatase 1 in heterochromatin silencing, and point to a meiotic phosphatase function that is relevant to germ cell immortality, conceivably related to its roles in chromosome pairing or sister chromatid cohesion.",

We detect a decrease in structure in translated regions, and we identify the ribosome as a major remodeler of RNA structure in vivo. In contrast, we find that 3-UTRs form highly folded structures in vivo, which can affect gene expression by modulating miRNA activity. Furthermore, we find that dynamic 3-UTR structures encode RNA decay elements, including regulatory elements in nanog and cyclin A1, key maternal factors orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition.

    "abstract": "We interact socially and form bonds with others because such experiences are rewarding. However, an insecure attachment style or social anxiety can reduce these rewarding effects. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may facilitate social interactions either by increasing their rewarding experience or by attenuating anxiety, although effects can be sex- and attachment-style dependent. In this study, 64 pairs of same-sex friends completed a social sharing paradigm in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject design with one friend inside an MRI scanner and the other in a remote behavioral testing room. In this way we could examine whether intranasal-OXT differentially modulated the emotional impact of social sharing and associated neural processing. Additionally, we investigated if OXT effects were modulated by sex and attachment style. Results showed that in women, but not men, OXT increased ratings for sharing stimuli with their friend but not with a stranger, particularly in the friend in the scanner. Corresponding neuroimaging results showed that OXT decreased both amygdala and insula activity as well as their functional connectivity in women when they shared with friends but had the opposite effect in men. On the other hand, OXT did not enhance responses in brain reward circuitry. In the PLC treated group amygdala responses in women when they shared pictures with their friend were positively associated with attachment anxiety and OXT uncoupled this. Our findings demonstrate that OXT facilitates the impact of sharing positive experiences with others in women, but not men, and that this is associated with differential effects on the amygdala and insula and their functional connections. Furthermore, OXT particularly reduced increased amygdala responses during sharing in individuals with higher attachment anxiety. Thus, OXT effects in this context may be due more to reduced anxiety when sharing with a friend than to enhanced social reward.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the biology of the brain gives rise to the computations that drive behavior requires high fidelity, large scale, and subcellular measurements of neural activity. 2-photon microscopy is the primary tool that satisfies these requirements, particularly for measurements during behavior. However, this technique requires rigid head-fixation, constraining the behavioral repertoire of experimental subjects. Increasingly, complex task paradigms are being used to investigate the neural substrates of complex behaviors, including navigation of complex environments, resolving uncertainty between multiple outcomes, integrating unreliable information over time, and/or building internal models of the world. In rodents, planning and decision making processes are often expressed via head and body motion. This produces a significant limitation for head-fixed two-photon imaging. We therefore developed a system that overcomes a major problem of head-fixation: the lack of rotational vestibular input. The system measures rotational strain exerted by mice on the head restraint, which consequently drives a motor, rotating the constraint system and dissipating the strain. This permits mice to rotate their heads in the azimuthal plane with negligible inertia and friction. This stable rotating head-fixation system allows mice to explore physical or virtual 2-D environments. To demonstrate the performance of our system, we conducted 2-photon GCaMP6f imaging in somas and dendrites of pyramidal neurons in mouse retrosplenial cortex. We show that the subcellular resolution of the systems 2-photon imaging is comparable to that of conventional head-fixed experiments. Additionally, this system allows the attachment of heavy instrumentation to the animal, making it possible to extend the approach to large-scale electrophysiology experiments in the future. Our method enables the use of state-of-the-art imaging techniques while animals perform more complex and naturalistic behaviors than currently possible, with broad potential applications in systems neuroscience.",

The conversion of genome coordinates between different assemblies is required for many integrative and comparative studies.

When converting the boundary positions of segments spanning larger genome regions, segments may be mapped into smaller subsegments if the original segments continuity is disrupted in the target assembly. Such a conversion may lead to a relevant degree of data loss in some circumstances such as copy number variation (CNV) analysis, where the quantitative representation of a genomic region takes precedence over base-specific accuracy. segment_liftover aims at continuity-preserving remapping of genome segments between assemblies and provides features such as approximate locus conversion, automated batch processing and comprehensive logging to facilitate processing of datasets containing large numbers of structural genome variation data.",

Sequencing times varied from 1 to 2 hours. These times compare favorably with NGS library preparation (>3.5 hours) and sequencing (>12 hours) times. Whole-chromosome aneuploidy screening results obtained from nanopore-based sequencing were identical to those obtained using NGS.\\n\\nConclusion(s)Methods for PGS of embryos have evolved from FISH to microarrays and most recently to NGS. Here we report the first application of nanopore-based sequencing for PGS on trophecoderm biopsy samples using a rapid multiplex short-read nanopore sequencing library preparation. Aneuploidy screening could be performed on 5 samples in one nanopore flowcell with 1 to 2 hour sequencing times. Overall, nanopore sequencing is a promising tool to perform rapid PGS assay onsite with a rapid turnover time, enabling same day testing and embryo transfer thus obviating the need for complex, large and expensive DNA sequencers or frozen embryos.",

    "abstract": "Our comparative studies seek to understand the structure and function of ion channels in cartilaginous fish that can detect very low voltage gradients in seawater. The principal channels of the electroreceptor include a calcium activated K channel, whose  subunit is Kcnma1, a voltage-dependent calcium channel, Cacna1d, and a relatively uncharacterized K channel which interacts with the calcium channel to produce fast (20 Hz) oscillations. Large conductance calcium-activated K channels (BK) are comprised of four  subunits, encoded by Kcnma1 and modulatory {beta} subunits of the Kcnmb class. We recently cloned and published the skate Kcnma1 gene and most of Kcnmb4 derived from using purified mRNA of homogenized isolated electroreceptors. Bellono et al. have recently performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on purified mRNA from skate electroreceptors and found several ion channels including Kcnma1. We searched the the Bellono et al RNA-seq repository for additional channels and subunits. Our most significant findings are the presence of two Shaker type voltage dependent potassium channel sequences which are grouped together as isoforms in the data repository. The larger of these is a skate ortholog of the voltage dependent fast potassium channel Kv1.1, which is expressed at appreciable levels and seems likely to explain the 20 Hz oscillations believed to occur in vivo. The second was more similar to Kv1.5 than to Kv1.1 but was somewhat atypical. We also found a beta subunit sequence (Kcnab2) which appears not to cause fast inactivation due to specific structural features. The new channels and subunits were verified by RT-PCR and the Kv1.1 sequence was confirmed by cloning. We also searched the RNA-seq repository for accessory subunits of the calcium activated potassium channel, Kcnma1, and found a computer generated assembly that contained a complete sequence of its beta subunit, Kcnmb2. Skate Kcnmb2 has a total of 279 amino acids, with 51 novel amino acids at the N-terminus which may play a specific physiological role. This sequence was confirmed by PCR and cloning. However, skate Kcnmb2 is expressed at low levels in the electroreceptor compared to Kcnma1 and skate Kcnmb1 (beta1) is absent. The evolutionary origin of the newly described channels and subunits was studied by aligning skate sequences with human sequences and those found in related fish: the whale shark (R. typus) an elasmobranch, and ghost shark (C.milii). There is also homology with the lamprey, which has electroreceptors. An evolutionary tree is presented. Further research should include focusing on the subcellular locations of these channels in the receptor cells, their gating behavior, and the effects of accessory subunits on gating.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry, also known as CyTOF, is a newly developed technology for quantification and classification of immune cells that can allow for analysis of over three dozen protein markers per cell. The high dimensional data that is generated requires innovative methods for analysis and visualization. We conducted a comparative analysis of four dimension reduction techniques - principal component analysis (PCA), isometric feature mapping (Isomap), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and Diffusion Maps by implementing them on benchmark mass cytometry data sets. We compare the results of these reductions using computation time, residual variance, a newly developed comparison metric we term neighborhood proportion error (NPE), and two-dimensional visualizations. We find that t-SNE and Diffusion Maps are the two most effective methods for preserving relationships of interest among cells and providing informative visualizations. In low dimensional embeddings, t-SNE exhibits well-defined phenotypic clustering. Additionally, Diffusion Maps can represent cell differentiation pathways with long projections along each diffusion component. We thus recommend a complementary approach using t-SNE and Diffusion Maps in order to extract diverse and informative cell relationship information in a two-dimensional setting from CyTOF data.",

    "abstract": "The selective lysosomal degradation (autophagy) of entire organelles is required for cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is involved in degenerative disorders such as Parkinsons Disease. While autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy) is becoming better understood, other forms of organelle autophagy are relatively unexplored. Here we develope multiple quantitative assays to measure organelle autophagy using flow cytometry, microscopy, and Western blotting. Focusing on autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy), we show that these assays allow facile measurement of ER-phagy, and that ER-phagy is inhibited by knockdown of either core autophagy components or the recently reported FAM134B ER-phagy receptor. Using these assays, we further identify that Atlastins, the ER-resident GTPases involved in ER membrane morphology, are key positive effectors of ER-phagy. Atlastin-depleted cells have decreased ER-phagy under starvation conditions, and Atlastins role in ER-phagy requires both a functional GTPase domain and proper ER localization. The three Atlastin family members functionally compensate for one another during ER-phagy and may form heteromeric complexes with one another. We also find that Atlastins act downstream of the FAM134B ER-phagy receptor. We propose that during ER-phagy, Atlastins remodel ER membrane to separate pieces of FAM134B-marked ER for efficient autophagosomal engulfment. Human mutations in Atlastins led to hereditary spastic paraplegia, and our results suggest that this disease may be linked to deficiencies in ER-phagy rather than ER morphology.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the expression of genes using a binary system involving the yeast GAL4 transcription factor has been a mainstay of Drosophila melanogaster developmental genetics for twenty-five years. However, most existing GAL4 expression constructs only function effectively in somatic cells, but not in germ cells during oogenesis, for unknown reasons. A special UAS promoter, UASp was created that does express during oogenesis, but the need to use different constructs for somatic and female germline cells has remained a significant technical limitation. Here we show that the expression problem of UASt and many other Drosophila molecular tools in germline cells is caused by their core Hsp70 promoter sequences, which are targeted in female germ cells by Hsp70-directed piRNAs generated from endogenous Hsp70 gene sequences. In a genetic background lacking genomic Hsp70 genes and associated piRNAs, UASt-based constructs function effectively during oogenesis. By reducing Hsp70 sequences targeted by piRNAs, we created UASz, which functions better than UASp in the germline and like UASt in somatic cells.",
