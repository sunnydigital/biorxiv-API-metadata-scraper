    "abstract": "Metagenomic datasets contain billions of protein sequences that could greatly enhance large-scale functional annotation and structure prediction. Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of million of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 hours on a single server to 50% sequence identity, > 1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases. (Open-source software and Metaclust database: https://mmseqs.org/).",

    "abstract": "Extensive evidence suggests that people use base rate information inconsistently in decision making. A classic example is the inverse base rate effect (IBRE), whereby participants classify ambiguous stimuli sharing features of both common and rare categories as members of the rare category. Computational models of the IBRE have either posited that it arises from associative similarity-based mechanisms or dissimilarity-based processes that may depend upon higher-level inference. Here we develop a hybrid model, which posits that similarity- and dissimilarity-based evidence both contribute to the IBRE, and test it using functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from human subjects completing an IBRE task. Consistent with our model, multivoxel pattern analysis reveals that activation patterns on ambiguous test trials contain information consistent with dissimilarity-based processing. Further, trial-by-trial activation in left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex tracks model-based predictions for dissimilarity-based processing, consistent with theories positing a role for higher-level symbolic processing in the IBRE.",

    "abstract": "Our previous publication suggested CRISPR-Cas9 editing at the zygotic stage might unexpectedly introduce a multitude of subtle but unintended mutations, an interpretation that not surprisingly raised numerous questions. The key issue is that since parental lines were not available, might the reported variants have been inherited? To expand upon the limited available whole genome data on whether CRISPR-edited mice show more genetic variation, whole-genome sequencing was performed on two other mouse lines that had undergone a CRISPR-editing procedure. Again, parents were not available for either the Capn5 nor Fblim1 CRISPR-edited mouse lines, so strain controls were examined. Additionally, we also include verification of variants detected in the initial mouse line. Taken together, these whole-genome-sequencing-level results support the idea that in specific cases, CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic uncertainty of sensory information (i.e., evidence) does not necessarily deter an observer from making a reliable decision. Indeed, uncertainty can be reduced by integrating (accumulating) incoming sensory evidence. It is widely thought that this accumulation is instantiated via recurrent rate-code neural networks. Yet, these networks do not fully explain important aspects of perceptual decision-making, such as a subjects ability to retain accumulated evidence during temporal gaps in the sensory evidence. Here, we utilized computational models to show that cortical circuits can switch flexibly between  retention and  integration modes during perceptual decision-making. Further, we found that, depending on how the sensory evidence was readout, we could simulate  stepping and  ramping activity patterns, which may be analogous to those seen in different studies of decision-making in the primate parietal cortex. This finding may reconcile these previous empirical studies because it suggests these two activity patterns emerge from the same mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, it has become almost a necessity for many biologists to execute bioinformatics workflows (WFs) as part of their research. However, most WF-management software packages require for their operation at least some programming expertise. Here we describe NeatSeq-Flow, a platform that enables users with no programming knowledge to design and execute complex high throughput sequencing WFs. This is achieved by using a compendium of pre-built modules as well as a generic module, both do not require programming expertise. Nonetheless, NeatSeq-Flow retains the flexibility to generate sophisticated WF modules using templates and only basic Python programming abilities. NeatSeq-Flow is designed to enable easy sharing of WFs and modules by conceptually separating modules, WF design, sample information and execution. Moreover, NeatSeq-Flow works hand in hand with CONDA environments for easy installation of the WFs analysis programs in one go. NeatSeq-Flow enables efficient WF execution on computer clusters by parallelizing on both samples and WF steps. NeatSeq-Flow operates by shell-script generation; thus it allows full transparency of the WF process. NeatSeq-Flow offers real-time WF execution monitoring, detailed documentation and self-sustaining WF backups for reproducibility. All of these features make NeatSeq-Flow an easy-to-use WF platform while not compromising for flexibility, reproducibility, transparency and efficiency.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://neatseq-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nContactsklarz@bgu.ac.il",

    "abstract": "Individuals struggle when making financial decisions, sometimes preferring to avoid difficult decisions and receive lower future rewards over actively deliberating between options of similar value. Here, we examine how conflict deriving from objective and subjective value characteristics of stocks, as well as the behavioural and phenomenological correlates of decision conflict, are accompanied by variation in a thus far understudied ERP component, the conflict negativity (CN). In a novel EEG paradigm (N = 53), we simulated a financial decision situation in which participants made incentivized choices between different, sometimes conflicting, stock options. Our results indicate that participants become slower, more undecided, and less pleased, when choosing between similar options compared to choices in which one option clearly outweighs the other. This effect even held when participants chose between two objectively good alternatives. We further provide preliminary evidence that the CN, a negative-going ERP recorded over the medial prefrontal cortex, is not only sensitive to decision conflict, but also predicts behavioural indecision. What is more, subjective value characteristics of stocks, impressions based on brand perception of the stock options, modestly influenced affective and behavioural reactions over and above objective stock characteristics. While our results are at odds with assumptions made by classic economic theory, they may serve as one out of several indicators as to why private investors seem to avoid financial decisions.",

Interactions within the central nervous system are fundamental to motor coordination, but the principles governing functional integration remain poorly understood. We used network analysis to investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity amongst 36 muscles. Anatomical networks were defined by the physical connections between muscles and functional networks were based on intermuscular coherence assessed during postural tasks. We found a modular structure of functional networks that was strongly shaped by the anatomical constraints of the musculoskeletal system. Changes in postural tasks were associated with a frequency-dependent reconfiguration of the coupling between functional modules. These findings reveal distinct patterns of functional interactions between muscles involved in flexibly organising muscle activity during postural control. Our network approach to the motor system offers a unique window into the neural circuitry driving the musculoskeletal system.",

However, their integration remains challenging. Here, we delineate a general approach for data-driven and unbiased identification of key TFs and dynamic GRNs, called EPIC-DREM. We generated time-series transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles during differentiation of mouse multipotent bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) towards adipocytes and osteoblasts. Using our novel approach we constructed time-resolved GRNs for both lineages. To prioritize the identified shared regulators, we mapped dynamic super-enhancers in both lineages and associated them to target genes with correlated expression profiles. We identified aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Glis family zinc finger 1 (GLIS1) as mesenchymal key TFs controlled by dynamic MSC-specific super-enhancers that become repressed in both lineages. AHR and GLIS1 control differentiation-induced genes and we propose they function as guardians of mesenchymal multipotency.",

    "abstract": "Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.",

The functional properties of mature postnatally-generated neurons often match those of their embryonically-produced counterparts. However, we show here that in the olfactory bulb (OB), embryonic and postnatal neurogenesis produce functionally distinct subpopulations of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. We define two subclasses of OB DA neuron by the presence or absence of a key subcellular specialisation: the axon initial segment (AIS). Large AIS-positive axon-bearing DA neurons are exclusively produced during early embryonic stages, leaving small anaxonic AIS-negative cells as the only DA subtype generated via adult neurogenesis. These populations are functionally distinct: large DA cells are more excitable, yet display weaker and - for certain long-latency or inhibitory events - more broadly-tuned responses to odorant stimuli. Embryonic and postnatal neurogenesis can therefore generate distinct neuronal subclasses, placing important constraints on the functional roles of adult-born neurons in sensory processing.",

R. irregularis has only ten or eleven copies of complete 45S rDNAs, whereas the general eukaryotic genome has tens to thousands of rDNA copies. R. irregularis rDNAs are highly heterogeneous and lack a tandem repeat structure. These findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that rDNA heterogeneity depends on the lack of tandem repeat structures. RNA-Seq analysis confirmed that all rDNA variants are actively transcribed.

    "abstract": "The physical mechanism of aerial dispersal of spiders, \\\"ballooning behavior,\\\" is still unclear because of the lack of serious scientific observations and experiments. Therefore, as a first step in clarifying the phenomenon, we studied the ballooning behavior of relatively large spiders (heavier than 5 mg) in nature. Additional wind tunnel tests to identify ballooning silks were implemented in the laboratory. From our observation, it seems obvious that spiders actively evaluate the condition of the wind with their front leg (leg I) and wait for the preferable wind condition for their ballooning takeoff. In the wind tunnel tests, as yet unknown physical properties of ballooning fibers (length, thickness and number of fibers) were identified. Large spiders, 16-20 mg Xysticus species, spun 50 to 60 nanoscale fibers, with a diameter of 121 to 323 nm. The length of these threads was 3.22 {+/-} 1.31 m (N = 22). These physical properties of ballooning fibers can explain the ballooning of large spiders with relatively light updrafts, 0.1-0.5 m s-1, which exist in a light breeze of 1.5-3.3 m s-1. Additionally, in line with previous research on turbulence in atmospheric boundary layers and from our wind measurements, it is hypothesized that spiders use the ascending air current for their aerial dispersal, the \\\"ejection\\\" regime, which is induced by hairpin vortices in the atmospheric boundary layer turbulence. This regime is highly correlated with lower wind speeds. This coincides well with the fact that spiders usually balloon when the wind speed is lower than 3 m s-1.",

We then examine the theoretical consequences that ensue from this assumption. This framework naturally explains why some tasks - for example, unfamiliar or dual tasks - are costly and permits to quantify these costs using information-theoretic measures. Finally, we discuss brain implementation of this principle and show that subjective cognitive costs can originate either from local or global capacity limitations on information processing or from increased rate of metabolic alterations.

    "abstract": "As antimicrobial signalling molecules, type III or lambda interferons (IFN{lambda}s) are critical for defence against infection by diverse pathogens. Counter-intuitively, expression of one member of the family, IFN{lambda}4, is associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the human population; by contrast, a natural in-frame nucleotide insertion that abrogates IFN{lambda}4 production improves viral clearance. To further understand how genetic variation between and within species affects IFN{lambda}4 function, we screened a panel of extant coding variants of human IFN{lambda}4 and identified three variants that substantially affect antiviral activity (P70S, L79F and K154E). The most notable variant was K154E, which enhanced in vitro activity in a range of antiviral and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) assays. This more active E154 variant of IFN{lambda}4 was found only in African Congo rainforest  Pygmy hunter-gatherers. Remarkably, E154 was highly conserved as the ancestral residue in mammalian IFN{lambda}4s yet K154 is the dominant variant throughout evolution of the hominid genus Homo. Compared to chimpanzee IFN{lambda}4, the human orthologue had reduced activity due to amino acid substitution of glutamic acid with lysine at position 154. Meta-analysis of published gene expression data from humans and chimpanzees showed that this difference in activity between K154 and E154 in IFN{lambda}4 is consistent with differences in antiviral gene expression in vivo during HCV infection. Mechanistically, our data suggest that human-specific K154 likely affects IFN{lambda}4 activity by reducing secretion and potency. We postulate that evolution of an IFN{lambda}4 with attenuated activity in humans (K154) likely contributes to distinct host-specific responses to and outcomes of infection, such as HCV.",

    "abstract": "O_LIIn animals, behavioural responses may play an important role in determining population persistence in the face of environmental changes. Body size is a key trait central to many life history traits and behaviours. While behaviours are typically assumed to be highly plastic, size correlations may impose constraints on their adaptive value when size itself is subject to environmental changes.\\nC_LIO_LIUrbanization is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing web-building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size, and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we disentangle direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity at two spatial scales.\\nC_LIO_LISpiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes. Spiders thus altered different components of their web-building behaviours independently in response to urbanization: mesh width and web surface decreased independently with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. These responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that responses in typically size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximisation in novel environments. The spatial scale of the behavioural responses to urbanization suggest contributions of both genetic adaptation and plasticity. Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, Araneus diadematus abundances were remarkably similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Effective use of semantic knowledge requires a set of conceptual representations and control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of this knowledge are retrieved and selected. It is well-established that levels of semantic knowledge increase across the lifespan. However, the effects of ageing on semantic control processes have not been assessed. I addressed this issue by comparing the performance profiles of young and older people on a verbal comprehension test. Two sets of variables were used to predict accuracy and RT in each group: (a) the psycholinguistic properties of words probed in each trial, (b) the performance on each trial by two groups of semantically-impaired neuropsychological patients. Young people demonstrated poor performance for low frequency and abstract words, suggesting that they had difficulty processing words with intrinsically weak semantic representations. Indeed, performance in this group was strongly predicted by the performance of patients with semantic dementia, who suffer from degradation of semantic knowledge. In contrast, older adults performed poorly on trials where the target semantic relationship was weak and distractor relationships strong - conditions which require high levels of controlled processing. Their performance was not predicted by the performance of semantic dementia patients, but was predicted by the performance of patients with semantic control deficits. These findings indicate that the effects of ageing on semantic cognition are more complex than has previously been assumed. While older people have larger stores of knowledge than young people, they appear to be less skilled at exercising control over the activation of this knowledge.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFor automated reading of scientific publications to extract useful information about molecular mechanisms it is critical that genes, proteins and other entities be correctly associated with uniform identifiers, a process known as named entity linking or \\\"grounding.\\\" Correct grounding is essential for resolving relationships among mined information, curated interaction databases, and biological datasets. The accuracy of this process is largely dependent on the availability of machine-readable resources associating synonyms and abbreviations commonly found in biomedical literature with uniform identifiers.\\n\\nResultsIn a task involving automated reading of [~]215,000 articles using the REACH event extraction software we found that grounding was disproportionately inaccurate for multi-protein families (e.g., \\\"AKT\\\") and complexes with multiple subunits (e.g.\\\"NF-{kappa}B\\\"). To address this problem we constructed FamPlex, a manually curated resource defining protein families and complexes as they are commonly encountered in biomedical text. In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership. To create FamPlex, text strings corresponding to entities were identified empirically from literature and linked manually to uniform identifiers; these identifiers were also mapped to equivalent entries in multiple related databases. FamPlex also includes curated prefix and suffix patterns that improve named entity recognition and event extraction. Evaluation of REACH extractions on a test corpus of [~]54,000 articles showed that FamPlex significantly increased grounding accuracy for families and complexes (from 15% to 71%). The hierarchical organization of entities in FamPlex also made it possible to integrate otherwise unconnected mechanistic information across families, subfamilies, and individual proteins. Applications of FamPlex to the TRIPS/DRUM reading system and the Biocreative VI Bioentity Normalization Task dataset demonstrated the utility of FamPlex in other settings.\\n\\nConclusionFamPlex is an effective resource for improving named entity recognition, grounding, and relationship resolution in automated reading of biomedical text. The content in FamPlex is available in both tabular and Open Biomedical Ontology formats at https://github.com/sorgerlab/famplex under the Creative Commons CC0 license and has been integrated into the TRIPS/DRUM and REACH reading systems.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant bacteria are critical public health concerns. Among the prime causative factors for the spread of antibiotic resistance is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). A useful model organism for investigating the relationship between HGT and antibiotic resistance is the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis, since the species possesses highly conjugative plasmids that readily disseminate antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in nature. Unlike many commensal E. faecalis strains, the genomes of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis clinical isolates are enriched for mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and lack CRISPR-Cas genome defense systems. CRISPR-Cas systems cleave foreign DNA in a programmable, sequence-specific manner and are disadvantageous for MGE-derived genome expansion. An unexplored facet of CRISPR biology in E. faecalis is that MGEs that are targeted by native CRISPR-Cas systems can be transiently maintained. Here, we investigate the basis for this \\\"CRISPR tolerance.\\\" We observe that E. faecalis can maintain self-targeting constructs that direct Cas9 to cleave the chromosome, but at a fitness cost. Interestingly, DNA repair genes were not up-regulated during self-targeting, but integrated prophages were strongly induced. We determined that low cas9 expression contributes to this transient non-lethality and use this knowledge to develop a robust CRISPR-assisted genome editing scheme. Our results suggest that E. faecalis has maximized the potential for DNA acquisition by attenuating its CRISPR machinery, thereby facilitating acquisition of potentially beneficial MGEs that may otherwise be restricted by genome defense.\\n\\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas has provided a powerful toolkit to manipulate bacteria, resulting in improved genetic manipulations and novel antimicrobials. These powerful applications rely on the premise that CRISPR-Cas chromosome targeting, which leads to double-stranded DNA breaks, is lethal. In this study, we show that chromosomal CRISPR targeting in Enterococcus faecalis is transiently non-lethal. We uncover novel phenotypes associated with this \\\"CRISPR tolerance\\\" and, after determining its genetic basis, develop a genome editing platform in E. faecalis with negligible off-target effects. Our findings reveal a novel strategy exploited by a bacterial pathogen to cope with CRISPR-induced conflicts to more readily accept DNA, and our robust CRISPR editing platform will help simplify genetic modifications in this organism.",

    "abstract": "Geographic patterns in human genetic diversity carry footprints of population history1,2 and provide insights for genetic medicine and its application across human populations3,4. Summarizing and visually representing these patterns of diversity has been a persistent goal for human geneticists5-10, and has revealed that genetic differentiation is frequently correlated with geographic distance. However, most analytical methods to represent population structure11-15 do not incorporate geography directly, and it must be considered post hoc alongside a visual summary. Here, we use a recently developed spatially explicit method to estimate \\\"effective migration\\\" surfaces to visualize how human genetic diversity is geographically structured (the EEMS method16). The resulting surfaces are \\\"rugged\\\", which indicates the relationship between genetic and geographic distance is heterogenous and distorted as a rule. Most prominently, topographic and marine features regularly align with increased genetic differentiation (e.g. the Sahara desert, Mediterranean Sea or Himalaya at large scales; the Adriatic, interisland straits in near Oceania at smaller scales). In other cases, the locations of historical migrations and boundaries of language families align with migration features. These results provide visualizations of human genetic diversity that reveal local patterns of differentiation in detail and emphasize that while genetic similarity generally decays with geographic distance, there have regularly been factors that subtly distort the underlying relationship across space observed today. The fine-scale population structure depicted here is relevant to understanding complex processes of human population history and may provide insights for geographic patterning in rare variants and heritable disease risk.",

Second, we undertook a pilot study using Illumina next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the frequency of HHV-6 in CSF and respiratory samples that were initially submitted to the laboratory for other diagnostic tests.\\n\\nResultsOf 72 samples tested for HHV-6 by PCR at the request of a clinician, 24 (33%) were positive for HHV-6. The majority of these patients were under the care of the haematology team (30/41, 73%), and there was a borderline association between HHV-6 detection and both Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and Central nervous system (CNS) disease (p=0.05 in each case). We confirmed detection of HHV-6 DNA using NGS in 4/20 (20%) CSF and respiratory samples.\\n\\nConclusionsHHV-6 is common in clinical samples submitted from a high-risk haematology population, and enhanced screening of this group should be considered. NGS can be used to identify HHV-6 from a complex microbiomee, but further controls are required to define the sensitivity and specificity, and to correlate these results with clinical disease.

The present study employs an unsupervised data-driven method to identify spatial patterns of tau-PET distribution, and to compare these patterns to previously published \\\"pathology-driven\\\" ROIs.

Associations with cognition were tested in a separate sample of 90 individuals from ADNI. BioFINDER [18F]AV1451 images were entered into a robust voxelwise stable clustering algorithm, which resulted in five clusters. Mean [18F]AV1451 uptake in the data-driven clusters, and in 35 previously published pathology-driven ROIs, was extracted from ADNI [18F]AV1451 scans. We performed linear models comparing [18F]AV1451 signal across all 40 ROIs to several tests of global cognition, adjusting for age, sex and education. Two data-driven ROIs consistently demonstrated the strongest or near-strongest effect sizes across all cognitive tests. Inputting all regions plus demographics into a feature selection routine resulted in selection of two ROIs (one data-driven, one pathology-driven) and education, which together explained 28% of the variance of a global cognitive composite score. Our findings suggest that [18F]AV1451-PET data naturally clusters into spatial patterns that are biologically meaningful and that may offer advantages as clinical tools.",

To address this question, we assembled the largest molecular data set to date, covering > 300 species (out of ca. 800 extant), from 13 of the 14 known families over nine genes, and employed relaxed molecular clocks to uncover their patterns of diversification. As the fossil record of flatfish is contentious, we used sister species distributed on both sides of the American continent to calibrate clock models based on the closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS), and on their current species range. We show that flatfish diversified in two bouts, as species that are today distributed around the Equator diverged during the closure of CAS, while those with a northern range diverged after this, hereby suggesting the existence of a post-CAS closure dispersal for these northern species, most likely along a trans-Arctic northern route, a hypothesis fully compatible with paleogeographic reconstructions.",

Studies in NOD mice previously revealed the common H2-Kd and/or H2-Db class I molecules expressed by this strain acquire an aberrant ability to mediate pathogenic CD8+ T-cell responses through interactions with T1D susceptibility (Idd) genes outside the MHC. A gene(s) mapping to the Idd7 locus on proximal Chromosome 7 was previously shown to be an important contributor to the failure of the common class I molecules expressed by NOD mice to mediate the normal thymic negative selection of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. Using an inducible model of thymic negative selection and mRNA transcript analyses we initially identified an elevated Nfkbid expression variant is likely an NOD Idd7 region gene contributing to impaired thymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic attenuation of Nfkbid expression in NOD mice resulted in improved negative selection of autoreactive diabetogenic AI4 and NY8.3 CD8+ T-cells. These results indicated allelic variants of Nfkbid represent an Idd7 gene contributing to the efficiency of intrathymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. However, while enhancing thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8+ T-cells, ablation of Nfkbid expression surprisingly accelerated T1D onset in NOD mice likely at least in part by numerically decreasing regulatory T- and B-lymphocytes (Tregs/Bregs), thereby reducing their peripheral immunosuppressive effects.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic heritability of complex traits and diseases is seldom explained by individual genetic variants. Algorithms that select SNPs which are close and connected on a biological network have been successful in finding biologically-interpretable and predictive loci. However, we argue that the connectedness constraint favors selecting redundant features that affect similar biological processes and therefore does not necessarily yield better predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called SPADIS that selects SNPs that cover diverse regions in the underlying SNP-SNP network. SPADIS favors the selection of remotely located SNPs in order to account for the complementary additive effects of SNPs that are associated with the phenotype. This is achieved by maximizing a submodular set function with a greedy algorithm that ensures a constant factor (1-1/e) approximation. We compare SPADIS to the state-of-the-art method SConES, on a dataset of Arabidopsis Thaliana genotype and continuous flowering time phenotypes. SPADIS has better regression performance in 12 out of 17 phenotypes on average, it identifies more candidate genes and runs faster. We also investigate the use of Hi-C data to construct SNP-SNP network in the context of SNP selection problem for the first time, which yields slight but consistent improvements in regression performance.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe ecological specialization of parasites - whether they can obtain high fitness on very few or very many different host species - is a determining feature of their ecology. In order to properly assess specialization, it is imperative to measure parasite fitness across host species; to understand its origins, fitness must be decomposed into the underlying traits. Despite the omnipresence of parasites with multiple hosts, very few studies assess and decompose their specialization in this way. To bridge this gap, we quantified the infectivity, virulence, and transmission rate of two parasites, the horizontally transmitted microsporidians Anostracospora rigaudi and Enterocytospora artemiae, in their natural hosts, the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica and Artemia franciscana. Our results demonstrate that each parasite performs well on one of the two host species (A. rigaudi on A. parthenogenetica, and E. artemiae on A. franciscana), and poorly on the other. This partial specialization is driven by high infectivity and transmission rates in the preferred host, and is associated with maladaptive virulence and large costs of resistance in the other. Our study represents a rare empirical contribution to the study of parasite evolution in multi-host systems, highlighting the negative effects of under- and over-exploitation when adapting to multiple hosts.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of brain pH is a critical homeostatic process and changes in brain pH modulate various ion channels and receptors and thus neuronal excitability. Tissue acidosis, resulting from hypoxia or hypercapnia, can activate various proteins and ion channels, among which acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) a family of primarily Na+ permeable ion channels, which alongside classical excitotoxicity causes neuronal death. Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are long-lived, fossorial, eusocial rodents that display remarkable behavioral/cellular hypoxia and hypercapnia resistance. In the central nervous system, ASIC subunit expression is similar between mouse and NMR with the exception of much lower expression of ASIC4 throughout the NMR brain. However, ASIC function and neuronal sensitivity to sustained acidosis has not been examined in the NMR brain. Here, we show with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of cultured NMR and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons that NMR neurons have smaller voltage-gated Na+ channel currents and more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. We further demonstrate that acid-mediated currents in NMR neurons are of smaller magnitude than in mouse, and that all currents in both species are fully blocked by the ASIC antagonist benzamil. We further demonstrate that NMR neurons show greater resistance to acid-induced cell death than mouse neurons. In summary, NMR neurons show significant cellular resistance to acidotoxicity compared to mouse neurons, contributing factors likely to be smaller ASIC-mediated currents and reduced NaV activity.\\n\\nAbbreviationsASIC, acid-sensing ion channel; CNS, central nervous system; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; NaV, voltage-gated Na+ channel; NMR, naked mole-rat; TTX, tetrodotoxin",

    "abstract": "It has been argued that the brain is a prediction machine that continuously learns how to make better predictions about the stimuli received from the external environment. It builds a model of the world around us and uses this model to infer the external stimulus. Predictive coding has been proposed as a mechanism through which the brain might be able to build such a model of the external environment. However, it is not clear how predictive coding can be used to build deep neural network models of the brain while complying with the architectural constraints imposed by the brain. In this paper, we describe an algorithm to build a deep generative model using predictive coding that can be used to infer latent representations about the stimuli received from external environment. Specifically, we used predictive coding to train a deep neural network on real-world images in a unsupervised learning paradigm. To understand the capacity of the network with regards to modeling the external environment, we studied the latent representations generated by the model on images of objects that are never presented to the model during training. Despite the novel features of these objects the model is able to infer the latent representations for them. Furthermore, the reconstructions of the original images obtained from these latent representations preserve the important details of these objects.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMost studies focused on understanding the neural circuits underlying spatial navigation are restricted to small behavioral arenas ([&le;] 1 m2) because of the limits imposed by the cables extending from the animal to the recording system. New wireless recording systems have significantly increased the recording range. However, the size of arena is still constrained by the lack of a video tracking system capable of monitoring the animals movements over large areas integrated with these recording systems. We developed and benchmarked a novel, open-source, scalable multi-camera tracking system based on commercially available and low-cost hardware (Raspberry Pi computers and Raspberry Pi cameras). This Picamera system was used in combination with a wireless recording system for characterizing neural correlates of space in environments of various sizes up to 16.5 m2. Spatial rate maps generated using the Picamera system showed improved accuracy in estimating spatial firing characteristics of neurons compared to a popular commercial system, due to its better temporal accuracy. The system also showed improved accuracy in estimating head direction cell tuning as well as theta phase precession in place cells. This improved temporal accuracy is crucial for accurately aligning videos from multiple cameras in large spaces and characterizing spatially modulated cells in a large environment.",

    "abstract": "Social environment influences drug consumption, its persistence and evolution. Little is known regarding the influence of the presence of a peer during drug consumption and especially how the relationship between peers (familiarity and dominance) can influence drug consumption. We used here a translational and transdisciplinary approach to explore the influence of peer presence and peer familiarity in rats and humans that self-administer stimulants. In rats, cocaine intake was compared when rats were alone with intake when peers with different characteristics (familiar or not, cocaine naive or not, dominant or subordinate) were present. In humans, 77 cocaine and/or methylphenidate users were asked to detail their most recent drug use episodes and their relationship with peers present at consumption. The results show that in both humans and rats, the risk of cocaine/stimulant consumption was significantly reduced by 37% and 32%, respectively, when a peer was present. Moreover, the lowest risk of consumption was consistently observed when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar) with a further 38% and 17% risk reduction, respectively. In rats, a decreased risk of consumption was greater when the peer was cocaine naive (vs non-cocaine naive).\\n\\nThe presence of a non-familiar and possibly drug-naive peer is the most efficient condition to diminish stimulant intake. Our results indirectly support the use of harm reduction strategies, in particular supervised consumption rooms for stimulant users.",

Heritability of structural changes of WM tracts has been examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in family-based studies for different age groups. The availability of genetic and DTI data from recent large population-based studies offers opportunity to further improve our understanding of genetic contributions. Here, we analyzed the genetic architecture of WM tracts using DTI and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of unrelated individuals in the UK Biobank (n [~] 8000). The DTI parameters were generated using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. We found that DTI parameters are substantially heritable on most WM tracts. We observed a highly polygenic or omnigenic architecture of genetic influence across the genome as well as the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Our bivariate analyses showed strong genetic correlations for several pairs of WM tracts as well as pairs of DTI parameters. We performed voxel-based analysis to illustrate the pattern of genetic effects on selected parts of the tract-based spatial statistics skeleton. Comparing the estimates from the UK Biobank to those from small population-based studies, we illustrated that sufficiently large sample size is essential for genetic architecture discovery in imaging genetics. We confirmed this finding with a simulation study.",

    "abstract": "Recent global progress in scaling up malaria control interventions has revived the goal of complete elimination in many countries. Decreasing transmission intensity generally leads to increasingly patchy spatial patterns of malaria transmission, however, and control programs must accurately identify remaining foci in order to target interventions efficiently. In particular, mosquito control interventions like bed nets and insecticide spraying are best targeted to transmission hotspots, and the role of connectivity between different pockets of local transmission becomes increasingly important since humans are able to move parasites beyond the limits of mosquito dispersal and re-introduce parasites to previously malaria-free regions. Quantifying the connectivity between regions due to human travel, measuring malaria transmission intensity in different areas, and monitoring parasite spatial spread are therefore key issues for policy-makers because they underpin the feasibility of elimination and inform the path to its attainment. To this end, recent efforts have been made to develop new approaches to incorporating human mobility into spatial epidemiological models, for example using mobile phone data, and there has been a surge of interest in collecting spatially informative parasite samples to measure the genomic signatures of parasite connectivity. Due to their complicated life-cycles, Plasmodium parasites pose unique challenges to researchers in this respect and new methods that move beyond traditional phylogenetic and population genetic tools must be developed to harness genetic information effectively. Here, we discuss the spatial epidemiology of malaria in the context of transmission-reduction interventions, and the challenges and promising directions for the development of integrated mapping, modeling, and genomic approaches that leverage disparate data sets to measure both connectivity and transmission.",

    "abstract": "Spliced peptides are short protein fragments spliced together in the proteasome by peptide bond formation. True estimation of the contribution of proteasome-spliced peptides (PSPs) to the global Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) ligandome is critical. A recent study suggested that PSPs contribute up to 30% of the HLA ligandome. We performed a thorough reanalysis of the reported results using multiple computational tools and various validation steps and concluded that only a fraction of the proposed PSPs passes the quality filters. To better estimate the actual number of PSPs, we present an alternative workflow. We performed de-novo sequencing of the HLA-peptide spectra and discarded all de-novo sequences found in the UniProt database. We checked whether the remaining de-novo sequences could match spliced peptides from human proteins. The spliced sequences were appended to the UniProt fasta file, which was searched by two search tools at a FDR of 1%. We find that maximally 2-4% of the HLA ligandome could be explained as spliced protein fragments. The majority of these potential PSPs have good peptide-spectrum match properties and are predicted to bind the respective HLA molecules. However, it remains to be shown how many of these potential PSPs actually originate from proteasomal splicing events.",

We conducted causal mediation analyses of aggregated data from two RCTs; which included 160 patients with chronic low back pain, and 120 patients with knee OA. Participants were randomised via one central randomisation schedule, to the intervention, or usual care. The intervention consisted of brief advice and referral to a 6-month telephone-based healthy lifestyle coaching service. Participants in the back pain trial were also offered a single physiotherapy consultation. The hypothesised primary mediator was self-reported weight, and alternative mediators were diet, physical activity, and pain beliefs. Outcomes were pain intensity, disability, and quality of life (QoL). Data were analysed using causal mediation analyses with sensitivity analyses for sequential ignorability. All mediation models were specified a priori. The intervention had no effect on pain intensity, disability or physical QoL. The intervention significantly improved mental QoL, however, the intervention effect was not channelled via the selected mediators. The intervention did not reduce weight, or the alternative mediators (diet, physical activity, pain beliefs), and these mediators were not associated with the outcomes (with one exception; poor diet was associated with lower mental QoL). The sensitivity analyses showed that our estimates were stable across all possible levels of residual confounding. Our findings show that the intervention did not cause a meaningful change in the hypothesised mediators, and these mediators were not associated with patient outcomes.",

Despite its attractive simplicity, and its established position at the summit of the evidence-based medicine hierarchy, the reliability of any meta-analysis is largely constrained by the quality of its constituent studies. One major limitation is small study effects, whose presence can often easily be detected, but not so easily adjusted for. Here, robust methods of estimation based on the median and mode are proposed as tools to increase the reliability of findings in a meta-analysis. By re-examining data from published meta-analyses, and by conducting a detailed simulation study, we show that these two simple methods offer notable robustness to a range of plausible bias mechanisms, without making any explicit modelling assumptions. In conclusion, when performing a meta-analysis with suspected small study effects, we recommend reporting the mean, median and modal pooled estimates as a simple but informative sensitivity analyses.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of novel protein-coding genes from noncoding regions of the genome is one of the most compelling evidence for genetic innovations in nature. One popular approach to identify de novo genes is phylostratigraphy, which consists of determining the approximate time of origin (age) of a gene based on its distribution along a species phylogeny. Several studies have revealed significant flaws in determining the age of genes, including de novo genes, using phylostratigraphy alone. However, the rate of false positives in de novo gene surveys, based on phylostratigraphy, remains unknown. Here, I re-analyze the findings from three studies, two of which identified tens to hundreds of rodent-specific de novo genes adopting a phylostratigraphy-centered approach. Most of the putative de novo genes discovered in these investigations are no longer included in recently updated mouse gene sets. Using a combination of synteny information and sequence similarity searches, I show that about 60% of the remaining 381 putative de novo genes share homology with genes from other vertebrates, originated through gene duplication, and/or share no synteny information with non-rodent mammals. These results led to an estimated rate of [~]12 de novo genes per million year in mouse. Contrary to a previous study (Wilson et al. 2017), I found no evidence supporting the preadaptation hypothesis of de novo gene formation. Nearly half of the de novo genes confirmed in this study are within older genes, indicating that co-option of preexisting regulatory regions and a higher GC content may facilitate the origin of novel genes.",

Randomised sham-controlled trials of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and theta-burst stimulation (TBS), without co-initiation of another treatment, were included. We analysed response, remission and all-cause discontinuation rates, and depression severity scores. Fifty-four studies were included (N = 2,959, mean age = 44.94 years, 61.98% female). Response rates demonstrated efficacy of high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC (OR = 3.94, 95% CI [2.52; 6.15]), right-sided low-frequency rTMS (OR = 7.44, 95% CI [2.06; 26.83]) bilateral rTMS (OR = 3.68, 95% CI [1.66; 8.13]), deep TMS (OR = 1.69, 95% CI [1.003; 2.85]), intermittent TBS (OR = 4.70, 95% CI [1.14; 19.38]) and tDCS (OR = 4.32, 95% CI [2.02; 9.29]); but not for continuous TBS, bilateral TBS or synchronised TMS. There were no differences in all-cause discontinuation rates. The strongest evidence was for high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC. Intermittent TBS provides an advance in terms of reduced treatment duration. tDCS is a potential treatment for non-resistant depression.",

    "abstract": "The brain contains billions of neurons defined by diverse cytoarchitectural, anatomical, genetic, and functional properties. Sensory encoding and decoding are popular research areas in the fields of neuroscience, neuroprosthetics and artificial intelligence but the contribution of neuronal diversity to these processes is not well understood. Deciphering this contribution necessitates development of sophisticated neurotechnologies that can monitor brain physiology and behavior via simultaneous assessment of individual genetically-defined neurons during the presentation of discrete sensory cues and behavioral contexts. Neural networks are a powerful technique for formulating hierarchical representations of data using layers of nonlinear transformations. Here we leverage the availability of an unprecedented collection of neuronal activity data, derived from [~]25,000 individual genetically-defined neurons of the parcellated mouse visual cortex during the presentation of 118 unique and complex naturalistic scenes, to demonstrate that neural networks can be used to decode discrete visual scenes from neuronal calcium responses with high ([~]96%) accuracy. Our findings highlight the novel use of neural networks for sensory decoding using neuronal calcium imaging data and reveal a neuroanatomical map of visual decoding strength traversing brain regions, cortical layers, neuron types, and time. Our findings also demonstrate the utility of feature selection in assigning contributions of neuronal diversity to visual decoding accuracy and the low requirement of network architecture complexity for high accuracy decoding in this experimental context.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous service robots become more affordable and thus available for the general public, there is a growing need for user-friendly interfaces to control these systems. Control interfaces typically get more complicated with increasing complexity of the robotic tasks and the environment. Traditional control modalities as touch, speech or gesture commands are not necessarily suited for all users. While non-expert users can make the effort to familiarize themselves with a robotic system, paralyzed users may not be capable of controlling such systems even though they need robotic assistance most. In this paper, we present a novel framework, that allows these users to interact with a robotic service assistant in a closed-loop fashion, using only thoughts. The system is composed of several interacting components: non-invasive neuronal signal recording and co-adaptive deep learning which form the brain-computer interface (BCI), high-level task planning based on referring expressions, navigation and manipulation planning as well as environmental perception. We extensively evaluate the BCI in various tasks, determine the performance of the goal formulation user interface and investigate its intuitiveness in a user study. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the system in real world scenarios, considering fetch-and-carry tasks and tasks involving human-robot interaction. As our results show, the system is capable of adapting to frequent changes in the environment and reliably accomplishes given tasks within a reasonable amount of time. Combined with high-level planning using referring expressions and autonomous robotic systems, interesting new perspectives open up for non-invasive BCI-based human-robot interactions.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology employs engineering principles to redesign biological system for clinical or industrial purposes. The development and application of novel genetic devices for genetic circuits construction will facilitate the rapid development of synthetic biology. Here we demonstrate that mammalian cells could perform two- and three-input linear-double-stranded DNA (ldsDNA) based Boolean AND logic computation. Through hydrodynamic ldsDNA delivery, two-input ldsDNA-base AND-gate computation could be achieved in vivo. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs expression, a key enzyme in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), could significantly downregulate the intensity of output signals from ldsDNA-based AND-gate. We further reveal that in mammalian cells ldsDNAs could undergo end processing and then perform AND-gate calculation to generate in-frame output proteins. Moreover, we show that ldsDNAs or plasmids with identical overlapping sequences could also serve as inputs of AND-gate computation. Our work establishes novel genetic devices and principles for genetic circuits construction, thus may open a new gate for the development of new disease targeting strategies and new protein genesis methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Cellular membranes feature dynamic submicrometer-scale lateral membrane domainsvariously referred to as lipid rafts, membrane rafts or glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEM). In order to understand the molecular functions of lipid rafts, numerous studies have utilized various biochemical methods to isolate and examine the protein composition of membrane rafts. However, interpretation of individual raft proteomics studies are confounded by the limitations of isolation methods and the dynamic nature of rafts. Knowledge-based approaches can facilitate biological data interpretation by integrating experimental evidence from existing studies. To this end, we previously developed RaftProt (http://lipid-raft-database.di.uq.edu.au/), a searchable database of mammalian lipid raft-associated proteins. Despite being a valuable and highly used resource, improvements in search capabilities and visualisation were still needed. Here, we present RaftProt V2 (http://raftprot.org), an improved update of RaftProt, enabling interrogation and integration of datasets at the cell/tissue type and UniRef/Gene level. Besides the addition of new datasets and re-mapping of all entries to both UniProt and UniRef IDs, we have annotated the level of experimental evidence for each protein entry. The search engine now allows for multiple protein or experiment searches where correlations, interactions or overlaps can be investigated. The web-interface has been completely re-designed and offers new interactive tools for data and subset selection, correlation analysis and network visualization. Overall, RaftProt aims to advance our understanding of lipid raft function by revealing the proteomes and pathways that are associated with membrane microdomains in diverse tissue and conditions.\\n\\nDatabase URL: http://raftprot.org",

A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, using genetic instruments for methylation at 14 of the 16 CpG sites, and 29,863 cases and 55,586 controls from the TRICL-ILCCO lung cancer consortium, was performed to appraise the causal role of methylation at these sites on lung cancer. This approach provided little evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral blood at the 14 CpG sites play a causal role in lung cancer development, including for cg05575921 AHRR, where methylation is strongly associated with lung cancer risk. Further studies are needed to investigate the causal role played by DNA methylation in lung tissue.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuantitative molecular data from urine are rare in epidemiology and genetics. NMR spectroscopy could provide these data in high-throughput, and it has already been applied in epidemiological settings to analyse urine samples. However, quantitative protocols for large-scale applications are not available.\\n\\nMethodsWe describe in detail how to prepare urine samples and perform NMR experiments to obtain quantitative metabolic information. Semi-automated quantitative lineshape fitting analyses were set up for 43 metabolites and applied to data from various analytical test samples and from 1,004 individuals from a population-based epidemiological cohort. Novel analyses on how urine metabolites associate with quantitative serum NMR metabolomics data (61 metabolic measures; n=995) were performed. In addition, confirmatory genome-wide analyses of urine metabolites were conducted (n=578). The fully automated quantitative regression-based spectral analysis is demonstrated for creatinine and glucose (n= 4,548).\\n\\nResultsIntra-assay metabolite variations were mostly <5% indicating high robustness and accuracy of the urine NMR spectroscopy methodology per se. Intra-individual metabolite variations were large, ranging from 6% to 194%. However, population-based inter-individual metabolite variations were even larger (from 14% to 1655%), providing a sound base for epidemiological applications. Metabolic associations between urine and serum were found clearly weaker than those within serum and within urine, indicating that urinary metabolomics data provide independent metabolic information. Two previous genome-wide hits for formate and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate were replicated at genome-wide significance.\\n\\nConclusionsQuantitative urine metabolomics data suggest broad novelty for systems epidemiology.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCircadian rhythm may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD). Chronotype is the behavioural manifestation of circadian rhythm and Mendelian randomisation (MR) involves the use of genetic variants to explore causal effects of exposures on outcomes. This study aimed to explore a causal relationship between chronotype and coffee consumption on risk of PD.\\n\\nMethodsTwo-sample MR was undertaken using publicly available GWAS data. Associations between genetic instrumental variables (IV) and \\\"morning person\\\" (one extreme of chronotype) were obtained from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc., and UK Biobank, and consisted of the per-allele odds ratio of being a \\\"morning person\\\" for 15 independent variants. The per-allele difference in log-odds of PD for each variant was estimated from a recent meta-analysis. The inverse variance weight method was used to estimate an odds ratio (OR) for the effect of being a \\\"morning person\\\" on PD. Additional MR methods were used to check for bias in the IVW estimate, arising through violation of MR assumptions. The results were compared to analyses employing a genetic instrument of coffee consumption, because coffee consumption has been previously inversely linked to PD.\\n\\nFindingsBeing a \\\"morning person\\\" was causally linked with risk of PD (OR 1*27; 95% confidence interval 1*06-1*51; p=0*012). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that invalid instruments were biasing the effect estimate and there was no evidence for a reverse causal relationship between liability for PD and chronotype. There was no robust evidence for a causal effect of high coffee consumption using IV analysis, but the effect was imprecisely estimated (OR 1*12; 95% CI 0*89-1*42; p=0*22).\\n\\nInterpretationWe observed causal evidence to support the notion that being a \\\"morning person\\\", a phenotype driven by the circadian clock, is associated with a higher risk of PD. Further work on the mechanisms is warranted and may lead to novel therapeutic targets.\\n\\nFundingNo specific funding source.",

    "abstract": "Stereopsis is a fundamental visual function that has been studied extensively. However, it is not clear why depth discrimination (stereoacuity) varies more significantly among people than other modalities. Previous studies reported the involvement of both dorsal and ventral visual areas in stereopsis, implying that not only neural computations in cortical areas but also the anatomical properties of white matter tracts connecting those areas can impact stereopsis and stereoacuity. Here, we studied how human stereoacuity relates to white matter properties by combining psychophysics, diffusion MRI (dMRI), and quantitative MRI (qMRI). We performed a psychophysical experiment to measure stereoacuity, and in the same participants we analyzed the microstructural properties of visual white matter tracts based on two independent measurements, dMRI (fractional anisotropy, FA) and qMRI (macromolecular tissue volume; MTV). Microstructural properties along the right vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF), a major tract connecting dorsal and ventral visual areas, were highly correlated with measures of stereoacuity. This result was consistent for both FA and MTV, suggesting that the structural-behavioral relationship reflects differences in neural tissue density, rather than differences in the morphological configuration of fibers. fMRI confirmed that binocular disparity stimuli activated the dorsal and ventral visual regions near VOF endpoints. No other occipital tracts explained the variance in stereoacuity. In addition, the VOF properties were not associated with differences in performance on a different psychophysical task (contrast detection). These series of experiments suggest that stereoscopic depth discrimination performance is, at least in part, constrained by dorso-ventral communication through the VOF.",

Here, we reveal that the brain employs a combinatorially optimized strategy to solve such location-invariant stimulus selection. With experiments in a key inhibitory nucleus in the vertebrate midbrain selection network, called isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc) in owls, we discovered that the central element is a  multilobe neuron, which encodes visual locations with multiple firing fields. This multilobed coding of space is necessitated by scarcity of Imc neurons. Although distributed seemingly randomly in space, the locations of these lobes are optimized across the high firing Imc neurons, allowing them to cooperatively suppress stimuli throughout 2D visual space while minimizing metabolic and circuit wiring costs. Our work suggests that combinatorial coding of space by sparse inhibitory neurons may be a general functional module for spatial selection.",

    "abstract": "With the growing importance of aquaculture worldwide, characterisation of the microbial flora of high-value aquaculture species and identification of gut flora shifts induced by changes in fish physiology or nutrition is of special interest.\\n\\nHere we report the first metabarcoding survey of the intestinal bacteria of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), an economically important aquacultured species. The microbiota of 30 farmed Chinook salmon from a single cohort was surveyed using metabarcode profiling of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Seawater, feed and intestinal samples, and controls were sequenced in quadruplicate to assess both biological and technical variation in the microbial profiles.\\n\\nOver 1,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified within the cohort, providing a first glimpse into the gut microbiota of farmed Chinook salmon. The taxonomic distribution of the salmon microbiota was reasonably stable, with around two thirds of individuals dominated by members of the family Vibrionaceae.\\n\\nThis survey was performed amid a summer heat wave, during which the fish exhibited reduced feeding. Although the sampled fish appeared healthy, they had minimal intestinal content, and the observed intestinal flora may represent the microbiota of fasting and stressed fish. Limited comparison between Mycoplasma and Vibrio sequences from the Chinook salmon gut and published microbial sequences from the intestines of a variety of fish species (including Atlantic salmon) indicated that despite the starvation and temperature variations, the replacement of Vibrio with Mycoplasma is occurring within expected ecological parameters and does not necessarily reflect colonisation by atypical microbes.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYRaw sequences from Chinook salmon intestinal microbiome 16S survey generated on the Illumina platform are publically available through NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database:\\n\\nBioproject PRJNA421844\\n\\nSRA study SRP134829\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA421844\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTAlthough 16S metabarcoding surveys are becoming routine, little is still known about the microbiota of fish. This is the first survey of the intestinal microbiota of Chinook salmon, a species native to the Pacific Northwest which is farmed in New Zealand and Chile. While most intestinal microbiota studies are performed on faecal material, we directly sampled the intestine epithelium and content.\\n\\nDuring the time of sampling, the farmed fish population was experiencing stress from a summer heat wave and had little intestinal content. Over 1,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified within the intestines of the cohort, providing a first glimpse into the gut microbiota of farmed Chinook salmon.\\n\\nWe believe this survey will be of interest not only to those interested in fish biology and aquaculture, but also as an addition to the ongoing debate in the literature on sampling and DNA extraction methods for challenging samples.",

    "abstract": "Systematic analysis of human arginine methylation events bifurcates its signaling mechanism, functioning either in isolation akin to canonical PTM regulation or clustered within disordered protein sequence. Hundreds of proteins contain methyl-arginine clusters and are more prone to mutation and more tightly expression-regulated than dispersed methylation targets. Arginine clusters in the highly methylated RNA binding protein SYNCRIP were experimentally shown to function in concert providing a tunable protein interaction interface. Quantitative immuno-precipitation assays defined two distinct cumulative regulatory mechanisms operating across 18 proximal arginine-glycine motifs in SYNCRIP. Functional binding to the methyl-transferase PRMT1 was promoted by continual arginine stretches while interaction with the methyl-binding protein SMN1 was arginine content dependent irrespective of linear position within the unstructured region. This study highlights how highly repetitive di-amino acid motifs in otherwise low structural complexity regions can provide regulatory potential, and with SYNCRIP as an extreme example how PTMs leverage these disordered sequences to drive cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Most missense mutations causing Rett syndrome affect domains of MeCP2 that have been shown to either bind methylated DNA or interact with a transcriptional co-repressor complex. Several mutations, however, including the C-terminal truncations that account for ~10% of cases, fall outside these characterised domains. We studied the molecular consequences of four of these \\\"non-canonical\\\" mutations in cultured neurons and mice to see if they reveal additional essential domains without affecting known properties of MeCP2. The results show that the mutations partially or strongly deplete the protein and also in some cases interfere with co-repressor recruitment. These mutations therefore impact the activity of known functional domains and do not invoke new molecular causes of Rett syndrome. The finding that a stable C-terminal truncation does not compromise MeCP2 function raises the possibility that small molecules which stabilise these mutant proteins may be of therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate genomes replicate according to a precise temporal program strongly correlated with their organization into topologically associating domains. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of early-replicating domains remain largely unknown. We defined two minimal cis-element modules containing a strong replication origin and chromatin modifier binding sites capable of shifting a targeted mid-late replicating region for earlier replication. When inserted side-by-side, these modules acted in cooperation, with similar effects on two late-replicating regions. Targeted insertions of these two modules at two chromosomal sites separated by 30 kb brought these two modules into close physical proximity and induced the formation of an early-replicating domain. Thus, combinations of strong origins and cis-elements capable of opening the chromatin structure are the basic units of early-replicating domains, and are absent from late-replicated regions. These findings are consistent with those of genome-wide studies mapping strong initiation sites and open chromatin marks in vertebrate genomes.",

Axonemal dyneins have various subtypes, but the roles of each dynein subtype and their assembly processes remain elusive in vertebrates. The PIH protein family, consisting of four members, has been implicated in the assembly of different dynein subtypes, although evidence for this idea is sparse. Here, we established zebrafish mutants of all four PIH-protein genes: pih1d1, pih1d2, ktu, and twister, and analyzed the structures of axonemal dyneins in mutant spermatozoa by cryo-electron tomography. Mutations caused the loss of specific dynein subtypes, which was correlated with abnormal sperm motility. We also found organ-specific compositions of dynein subtypes, which could explain the severe motility defects of mutant Kupffers vesicle cilia. Our data demonstrate that all vertebrate PIH proteins are differently required for cilia/flagella motions and the assembly of axonemal dyneins, assigning specific dynein subtypes to each PIH protein.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the role of axonal transport in regulating neuronal mitochondrial density. We show that the density of mitochondria in the touch receptor neuron (TRN) of adult Caenorhabditis elegans is constant. Mitochondrial density and transport are controlled both by the Kinesin heavy chain and the Dynein-Dynactin complex. However, unlike in other models, the presence of mitochondria in C. elegans TRNs depends on Kinesin light chain as well. Mutants in the three C. elegans miro genes do not alter mitochondrial density in the TRNs. Mutants in the Kinesin-1 associated proteins, UNC-16/JIP3 and UNC-76/FEZ1, show increased mitochondrial density and also have elevated levels of both the Kinesin Heavy and Light Chains in neurons. Genetic analyses suggest that, the increased mitochondrial density at the distal end of the neuronal process in unc-16 and unc-76 depends partly on Dynein. We observe a net anterograde bias in the ratio of anterograde to retrograde mitochondrial flux in the neuronal processes of unc-16 and unc-76, likely due to both increased Kinesin-1 and decreased Dynein in the neuronal processes. Our study shows that UNC-16 and UNC-76 indirectly limit mitochondrial density in the neuronal process maintaining a balance in anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial axonal transport.",

PIP5K1{beta} participates in numerous cellular activities, such as B cell and platelet activation, cell phagocytosis and endocytosis, cell apoptosis, and cytoskeletal organization. In the present work, we aimed to make insight into the function of PIP5K1{beta} in osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis to provide promising strategies for osteoporosis prevention and treatment. We discovered that PIP5k1{beta} deletion in mice resulted in obvious bone loss and PIP5K1{beta} was highly expressed both during osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation, besides, PIP5K1{beta} deletion enhanced the proliferation and migration of BMMs to promote osteoclast differentiation. PIP5k1{beta}-/- osteoclast exhibited normal cytoskeleton architecture but stronger resorption activity. PIP5k1{beta} deficiency also promoted activation of MAPK and Akt signaling, enhanced TRAF6 and c-Fos expression, facilitated the expression and nuclear translocation of NFATC1 and upregulated Grb2 expression, thereby accelerating osteoclast differentiation and function. Finally, PIP5K1{beta} enhanced osteoblast differentiation by upregulating master genes expression through triggering smad1/5/8 signaling. Thereby, PIP5K1{beta} modulate bone homeostasis and remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Cyclophilins (Cyp) are peptidil-prolyl-isomerases and the intracellular receptors for the immunosuppressant Cyclosporine-A (CsA), which produces epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and renal tubule-interstitial fibrosis. Since CsA inhibits Cyp enzymatic activity, we hypothesized that Cyp could be involved in EMT and fibrosis. Here, we demonstrate that CypB is a critical regulator of tubule epithelial cell plasticity on the basis that: i) CypB silencing caused epithelial differentiation in proximal tubule-derived HK-2 cells, ii) CypB silencing prevented TGF{beta}-induced EMT in HK-2, and iii) CypB knockdown mice exhibited reduced UUO-induced inflammation and kidney fibrosis. By contrast, silencing of CypA induces a more undifferentiated phenotype and favors TGF{beta} effects. EMT mediators Slug and Snail were up-regulated in CypA-silenced cells, while in CypB silencing, Slug, but not Snail, was down-regulated; thus, reinforcing the role of Slug in kidney fibrosis. CypA regulates Slug through its PPIase activity whereas CypB depends on its ER location, where interacts with calreticulin, a calcium modulator which is involved in TGF{beta} signaling. In conclusion, this work uncovers new roles for CypA and CypB in modulating proximal tubular cell plasticity.",

Seizures and their behavioural manifestations were evaluated with continuous video-electrocorticography telemetry.\\n\\nResultsTeNT injection into rat primary visual cortex induced focal neocortical epilepsy without preceding status epilepticus. The latency to first seizure ranged from 3 to 7 days. Seizure duration was bimodal, with both short (approximately 30s) and long-lasting (>100s) seizures occurring in the same animals. Seizures were accompanied by non-motor features such as behavioural arrest, or motor seizures with or without evolution to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Seizures were commoner during the sleep phase of a light-dark cycle. Seizure occurrence was not random, and tended to cluster with significantly higher probability of recurrence within 24 hours of a previous seizure. Across animals, the number of seizures in the first week could be used to predict the number of seizures in the following 22 days.\\n\\nSignificanceThe TeNT model of visual cortical epilepsy is a robust model of acquired focal neocortical epilepsy, and is well suited for preclinical evaluation of novel anti-epileptic strategies.

Computational reinforcement-learning modelling of behaviour provided support for precision-weighting of unsigned prediction errors. Functional MRI revealed coding of unsigned prediction errors relative to their precision in bilateral superior frontal gyri and dorsal anterior cingulate.

    "abstract": "The temporal coordination of slow oscillations and sleep spindles is believed to underlie processes of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and reorganization. Accumulating evidence of the predominantly local expression of these individual oscillatory rhythms suggests that their interaction may have a similar local component. However, it is unclear whether local coupling holds uniformly across the cortex, and whether and how these dynamics differ between fast and slow spindles, and sleep stages. Moreover, substantial individual variability in the expression of both spindles and slow oscillations raise the possibility that their cross-frequency interactions show similar individual differences. Using two nights of multi-channel electroencephalography recordings from 24 healthy individuals, we characterized the topography of slow oscillation-spindle coupling. We found that locally coupled oscillations occur over widespread cortical areas, but that their dynamics vary with spindle class, sleep stage, and location. Moreover, the phase of the slow oscillation cycle at which spindles were expressed differed markedly across individuals but was stable across nights. However, individual variability of coupling phase was not correlated with overnight memory change. These findings both add an important spatial aspect to our understanding of the temporal coupling of sleep oscillations and demonstrate the heterogeneity of coupling dynamics, which must be taken into account when formulating mechanistic accounts of sleep-related memory processing.",

Moreover, newborn neurons are thought to replace preexisting ones that die. Despite a wealth of evidence supporting this model, systematic in vivo observations of the process are still scarce. We used 2-photon imaging to study neuronal integration and survival directly in the olfactory bulb (OB) of living mice. Long-term tracking of over 1400 neurons demonstrated that cell-loss in the OB is virtually absent. Neuronal death resembling a critical period was induced by standard doses of BrdU or EdU, but disappeared when low doses of EdU were used, demonstrating toxicity. Finally, we demonstrate that the OB grows throughout life. This shows that neuronal selection during OB-neurogenesis does not occur during integration and argues against the existence of a critical period.

Herein, we demonstrate the application of solid-state NMR spectroscopy on native, heterogeneous thylakoid membranes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) and on Cr Light-Harvesting Complex II (LHCII) in thylakoid lipid bilayers to detect LHCII conformational dynamics in its native membrane environment. We show that membrane-reconstituted LHCII contains selective sites that undergo fast, large-amplitude motions, including the phytol tails of two chlorophylls. Protein plasticity is also observed in the N-terminal stromal loop and in protein fragments facing the lumen, involving sites that stabilize the xanthophyll-cycle carotenoid violaxanthin and the two luteins. The results report on the intrinsic flexibility of LHCII pigment-protein complexes in a membrane environment, revealing putative sites for conformational switching. In thylakoid membranes, fast dynamics of protein and pigment sites is significantly reduced, which suggests that in their native organelle membranes, LHCII complexes are locked in specific conformational states.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPhotosynthetic Light-Harvesting Complexes undergo dynamic conformational transitions that regulate the capacity of the light-harvesting antenna.

    "abstract": "How transcription factors (TFs) recognize their DNA sequences is often investigated complementarily by high-throughput protein binding assays and by structural biology experiments. The former quantifies the specificity of TF binding sites for numerous DNA sequences, often represented as the position-weight-matrix (PWM). The latter provides mechanistic insights into the interactions via the protein-DNA complex structures. However, these two types of data are not readily integrated. Here, we propose and test a new modeling method that incorporates the PWM with complex structure data. Based on pre-tuned coarse-grained models for proteins and DNAs, we model the specific protein-DNA interactions, PWMcos, in terms of an orientation-dependent potential function, which enables us to perform molecular dynamics simulations at unprecedentedly large scales. We show that the PWMcos model reproduces subtle specificity in the protein-DNA recognition. During the target search in genomic sequences, TF moves on highly rugged landscapes and occasionally flips on DNA depending on the sequence. The TATA-binding protein exhibits two remarkably distinct binding modes, of which frequencies differ between TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters. The PWMcos is general and can be applied to any protein-DNA interactions given their PWMs and complex structure data are available.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cell migration is essential for the early steps of metastasis, during which cancer cells move through the primary tumor and reach the blood vessels. In vivo, cancer cells are exposed to directional guidance cues, either soluble, such as gradients of growth factors, or insoluble, such as collagen fiber alignment. Depending on the number and strength of such cues, cells will migrate in a random or directed manner. Interestingly, similar cues also stimulate cell proliferation. In this regard, it is not clear whether cell cycle progression affects migration of cancer cells and whether this effect is different in random versus directed migration. In this study, we tested the effect of cell cycle progression on random and directed migration, both in 2D and 3D environments, in the breast carcinoma cell line, FUCCI-MDA-MB-231, using computational image analysis by LEVER. Directed migration in 2D was modeled as chemotaxis along a gradient of soluble EGF inside 10 {micro}m-wide microchannels. In 3D, directed migration was modeled as contact guidance (alignotaxis) along aligned collagen fibers. Time-lapse recordings of cells in 2D and 3D revealed that directed, but not random migration, is cell cycle-dependent. In both 2D and 3D directed migration, cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle outperformed cells in the G2 phase in terms of migration persistence and instantaneous velocity. These data suggest that in the presence of guidance cues in vivo, breast carcinoma cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle may be more efficient in reaching vasculature.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are sensory organelles that orchestrate major signaling pathways during organ development and homeostasis. By using a double Arl13b/mCherry-Cetn2/GFP transgenic mouse model, we characterized the spatio-temporal localization of primary cilia in the epididymis, from birth to adulthood. We report here a constitutive localisation of primary cilia in peritubular myoid cells and a dynamic profiling in differentiated epithelial cells throughout post-natal development. While primary cilia are present at the apical pole of the undifferentiated epithelial cells from birth to puberty, they are absent from the apical pole of the epithelium in adults, where they appear exclusively associated with cytokeratin 5-positive basal cells. Exogenous labeling of primary cilia marker Arl13b and IFT88 confirmed the cell lineage specific localization of primary cilia in basal cells and myoid cells in human epididymides. From whole epididymis tissues and serum-free cultures of DC2 murine epididymal principal cell lines we determined that primary cilia from the epididymis are associated with the polycystic kidney disease-related proteins polycystin 1 (PC1) and polycystin 2 (PC2), and Gli3 Hedgehog signaling transcription factor. Thus, our findings unveil the existence of primary cilia sensory organelles, which have the potential to mediate mechano/ chemo-signaling events in the epididymis.",

    "abstract": "Certain animal and plant pathogenic bacteria have developed virulence factors (including effector proteins) that enable them to overcome host immunity. A plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto), secretes a large repertoire of effectors into plant cells via a type III secretory apparatus, thereby suppressing plant immunity. Here, we show that exposure to Pto caused sepsis in mice. Surprisingly, the effector HopQ1 disrupted phagocytosis by inhibiting actin rearrangement via a direct interaction with the LIM domain of the animal target protein LIM kinase, a key regulator of actin polymerization. The results provide new insights into cross-kingdom pathogenicity of bacteria. The current studies demonstrate that certain plant pathogenic bacteria such as Pto can be fatal in animals due to cross-kingdom host immune suppression.",

    "abstract": "Gap junction-mediated cell-cell communication enables tumor cells to synchronize the execution of complex processes. Despite the connexin family of gap junction proteins being considered tumor suppressors, we previously found that glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs) express higher levels of Cx46 compared to non-stem tumor cells, and this was necessary and sufficient for CSC maintenance. To develop a Cx46 targeting strategy, we utilized point mutants to disrupt specific functions of Cx46 and found that gap junction coupling was the critical function of Cx46 for CSCs. Based on this finding, we screened a clinically relevant library of small molecules and identified clofazimine as an inhibitor of Cx46-specific cell-cell communication. Clofazimine attenuated proliferation, self-renewal, and tumor growth and synergized with temozolomide to induce apoptosis. These data suggest that combining clofazimine with standard-of-care therapies may target glioblastoma CSCs. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the importance of targeting cell-cell communication as an anti-cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) make up a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes, and thus are important drivers of genome evolution. However, the evolutionary forces controlling TE copy number and the extent to which TEs affect phenotypic variation on a genome-wide scale are still unclear. We characterised TE insertion polymorphism and its effects on gene expression in 124 whole genome sequences from a single population of Capsella grandiflora. The frequency of insertions was negatively correlated with distance to genes, as well as density of conserved non-coding elements, suggesting that the negative effects of TEs on gene regulation are important in limiting their abundance. Rare TE variants strongly influence gene expression variation, predominantly through downregulation. In contrast, rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute equally to up- and down-regulation, but have a weaker effect. Taken together, these results imply that TEs are a significant contributor to gene expression variation and can be more likely than rare SNPs to cause extreme changes in gene expression.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTransposable elements (TEs), mobile DNA elements with the ability to excise from the genome and reinsert in new locations, are important components of genomic diversity. Due to their abundance and mobility, TEs play an influential role in genomic evolution, often deleterious. Here we show that TEs in a population of the plant Capsella grandiflora are most deleterious when they insert in genic and regulatory regions. We find that TEs indeed are associated with unusual levels of gene expression, predominantly decreased expression.\\n\\nFurthermore, this effect is stronger than the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with gene expression variation, highlighting the importance of TE contribution to the maintenance of expression variation.",

    "abstract": "RNAi-based therapeutics show promising clinical data for treatment of liver-associated disorders. However, siRNA delivery into extra-hepatic tissues remains an obstacle, limiting the use of siRNA-based therapies. Here we report on a first example of chemical engineering of lipophilic conjugates to enable extra-hepatic delivery. We synthesized a panel of fifteen lipophilic siRNA and evaluated the impact of their chemical configuration on siRNA tissue distribution profile. Generally, lipophilic conjugates allow siRNA distribution to a wide range of tissues, where the degree of lipophilicity defines the ratio of liver/spleen to kidney distribution. In addition to primary clearance tissues, several conjugates achieve significant siRNA distribution to lung, heart, adrenal glands, fat, muscle. siRNA tissue accumulation leads to productive silencing, shown with two independent targets. siRNA concentrations necessary for productive silencing are tissue and conjugate dependent, varying significantly from 5 to 200 ng/mg. The collection of conjugated siRNA described here enables functional gene modulation in vivo in lung, muscle, fat, heart, adrenal glands opening these tissues for future therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Unresectable pancreatic cancer is almost universally lethal because chemotherapy and radiation cannot completely stop the growth of the cancer. The major problem with using radiation to approximate surgery in unresectable disease is that the radiation dose required to ablate pancreatic cancer exceeds the tolerance of the nearby duodenum. WR-2721, also known as amifostine, is a well-known radioprotector, but has significant clinical toxicities when given systemically. WR-2721 is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite, WR-1065, by alkaline phosphatases in normal tissues. The small intestine is highly enriched in these activating enzymes, and thus we reasoned that oral administration of WR-2721 just before radiation would result in localized production of the radioprotective WR-1065 in the small intestine, providing protective benefits without the significant systemic side effects. Here, we show that oral WR-2721 is as effective as intraperitoneal WR-2721 in promoting survival of intestinal crypt clonogens after morbid irradiation. Furthermore, oral WR-2721 confers full radioprotection and survival after lethal upper abdominal irradiation of 12.5Gy x 5 fractions (total of 62.5Gy, D2EQ=140.6Gy), which would likely ablate pancreatic cancer. We find that the efficacy of oral WR-2721 stems from its selective accumulation in the intestine, but not in tumors or other normal tissues, as determined by in vivo mass spectrometry analysis. Thus, we demonstrate that oral WR-2721 is a well-tolerated, and quantitatively selective, radioprotector of the intestinal tract that is capable of enabling clinically relevant ablative doses of radiation to the upper abdomen without unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity.",

    "abstract": "In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA associates with numerous protein complexes and RNAs, forming the chromatin landscape. Through a genome-wide study of chromatin-associated proteins in Drosophila cells, five major chromatin types were identified as a refinement of the traditional binary division into hetero- and euchromatin. These five types are defined by distinct but overlapping combinations of proteins and differ in biological and biochemical properties, including transcriptional activity, replication timing and histone modifications. In this work, we assess the evolutionary relationships of chromatin-associated proteins and present an integrated view of the evolution and conservation of the fruit fly D. melanogaster chromatin landscape. We combine homology prediction across a wide range of species with gene age inference methods to determine the origin of each chromatin-associated protein. This provides insight into the emergence of the different chromatin types. Our results indicate that the two euchromatic types, YELLOW and RED, were one single activating type that split early in eukaryotic history. Next, we provide evidence that GREEN-associated proteins are involved in a centromere drive and expanded in a lineage-specific way in D. melanogaster. Our results on BLUE chromatin support the hypothesis that the emergence of Polycomb Group proteins is linked to eukaryotic multicellularity. In light of these results, we discuss how the regulatory complexification of chromatin links to the origins of eukaryotic multicellularity.",
