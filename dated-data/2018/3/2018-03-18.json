    "abstract": "The concept of \\\"genetic bandwagoning\\\" is introduced. In genetic bandwagoning, a bandwagoning allele evaluates the outlook for lineage fitness of the individual holding the allele. If its holders lineage fitness figures to be low, the bandwagoning allele induces its holder to relinquish some, or all, of the holders own resources (e.g., food, territory, mates), which are then used by individuals that happen to be nearby. While some nearby individuals may not possess a copy of the bandwagoning allele, it is likely, if assortment is sufficiently positive, that numerous individuals do and most of those that do have a better lineage fitness outlook than that of the individual that was induced to forfeit the resources, since the inducement is contingent upon a poor lineage fitness outlook. Due to their better lineage fitness outlook, the nearby individuals make better usage of the resources than the forfeiting individuals would have and the ratio between the quantity of descendants nearby individuals produce with the resources and the quantity of descendants that would have been produced by the forfeiting individuals tends to increase with each generation due to multiple reasons examined in section 2. If assortment is sufficiently positive, more copies of the allele are produced over the ensuing generations than if the resources had not been forfeited, as the allele is selected by \\\"jumping on the bandwagon\\\" of these fit lineages that use the resources.\\n\\nTwo ways to bandwagon are introduced: resonation and reservation. In resonation, the bandwagoning allele accomplishes the two steps of bandwagoning--1) evaluating its holders lineage fitness outlook and 2) inducing a holder with a low (i.e., poor) outlook to relinquish resources--sequentially. The necessity for reservation occurs because a lineages fitness outlook can depend upon aspects of quality which are difficult to evaluate during a generation in which many individuals are able to avoid death or serious harm. In reservation, a bandwagoning allele solves this problem of evaluating quality by inducing its holder to reserve from (i.e., withhold) some of its ability to survive against one or more natural enemies, particularly predators or parasites: An individual that can remain healthy in spite of reserving from its ability to survive predators or parasites is likely to have genes that enable its descendants to survive when the predator or parasite threat is more severe; however, if the individual perishes or becomes sick as a result of reservation, its lineage fitness outlook is determined to be low and the relinquishment of resources occurs with this same perishing or sickness. That is, the individuals perishing or sickness due to reservation serves simultaneously: 1) to identify that individual as having a low lineage fitness outlook and 2) as the source of relinquishing the individuals resources on the basis of this low lineage fitness outlook.\\n\\nGenetic bandwagoning constitutes a novel mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Numerous paradoxes can be explained by the actions of bandwagoning alleles that use a combination of resonation and reservation, including the phenotypic cooccurrences of robust defenses against parasites and depressive symptoms; phenotypic cooccurrences of robust defenses against parasites and photosynthetic costs; phenotypic cooccurrences of susceptibility to parasites and androgenic benefits; the maintenance of honest signals when there are opportunities to cheat; the forfeiture of reproductive opportunities by functionally capable individuals; and the differential nurturing of offspring.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) from sequencing data of nuclear families has identified risk genes for many complex diseases, including multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is, however, challenging because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a new statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations and combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of [~]300 autism family trios across five studies, and discovered several new autism risk genes. The software is freely available for all research uses.",

    "abstract": "1A recent stream of alarmist publications has questioned the validity of published neuroimaging findings. As a consequence, fMRI teams worldwide have been encouraged to increase their sample sizes to reach higher power and thus increase the positive predictive value of their findings. However, an often-overlooked factor influencing power is the experimental design: by choosing the appropriate experimental design, the statistical power of a study can be increased within subjects. By optimizing the order and timing of the stimuli, power can be gained at no extra cost. To facilitate design optimization, we created a python package and web-based tool called Neurodesign to maximize the detection power or estimation efficiency within subjects, while controlling for psychological factors such as the predictability of the design. We implemented both a simulation-based optimisation, as well as an optimisation using the genetic algorithm, introduced by Wager and Nichols (2003) and further improved by Kao et al. (2009), to optimize the experimental design. The toolbox Neurodesign allows more complex experimental setups than existing toolboxes, while the GUI provides a more user-friendly experience. The toolbox is accessible online at www.neuropowertools.org.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphic phenotypes of mammalian coat color have been important to the study of genetics and evolution, but little is known about the heritability and fitness consequences of variation in complex coat pattern traits in wild populations. Understanding the current evolution of coat patterns requires reliably measuring traits, quantifying heritability of the traits, and identifying the fitness consequences of specific phenotypes. Giraffe coat markings are highly variable and it has been hypothesized that variation in coat patterns most likely affects fitness by camouflaging neonates against predators. We quantified spot pattern traits of wild Masai giraffes using image analysis software, determined whether spot pattern traits were heritable, and assessed whether variation in heritable spot pattern traits was related to fitness as measured by juvenile survival. The methods we described comprise a framework for objective quantification of mammalian coat pattern traits based on photographic coat pattern data. We demonstrated that characteristics of giraffe coat spot shape are heritable. We did not find evidence for juvenile survival consequences of variation in spot traits, suggesting that spot traits are currently not under strong directional, disruptive, or stabilizing selection for neonate camouflage in our study population, but our sample size could not detect small differences in survival. Spot trait variation also may be more relevant to other components of fitness, such as adult survival or fecundity. We hope this case study will inspire further investigations of coat pattern traits.",

[G/C]AGG[C/T] was the most significantly associated motif with 6mA modification. 6mA sites were enriched in the coding regions and mark actively transcribed genes in human cells. We further found that DNA N6-methyladenine and N6-demethyladenine modification in human genome were mediated by methyltransferase N6AMT1 and demethylase ALKBH1, respectively. The abundance of 6mA was significantly lower in cancers, accompaning with decreased N6AMT1 and increased ALKBH1 levels, and down-regulation of 6mA modification levels promoted tumorigenesis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that DNA 6mA modification is extensively present in human cells and the decrease of genomic DNA 6mA promotes human tumorigenesis.",

Recently, novel in vivo methods and technologies utilizing genome editing enabled important insights into the cell lineages of animals2-8. In contrast, human cell lineage remains restricted to retrospective approaches, which still lack in resolution and cost-efficient solutions. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for human cell lineage tracing based on Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) targeted by duplex Molecular Inversion Probes (MIPs). With this platform we accurately reproduced a known lineage of DU145 cell lines cells9 and reconstructed lineages of healthy and metastatic single cells from a melanoma patient. The reconstructed trees matched the anatomical and SNV references while adding further refinements. Our platform allowed to faithfully recapitulate lineages of developmental tissue formation in cells from healthy donors. In summary, our lineage discovery platform can profile informative STR somatic mutations efficiently and we provide a solid, high-resolution lineage reconstruction even in challenging low-mutation-rate healthy single cells.",

    "abstract": "In many studies of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), stimulus encoding and processing (per-ceptual function) and response selection (executive function) have been intertwined. To dissociate deficits in these functions, we introduced a task that parametrically varied low-level stimulus features (orientation and color) for fine-grained analysis of perceptual function. It also required participants to switch their attention between feature dimensions on a trial-by-trial basis, thus taxing executive processes. Furthermore, we used a response paradigm that captured task-irrelevant motor output (TIMO), reflecting failures to use the correct stimulus-response rule. ADHD participants had substantially higher perceptual variability than Controls, especially for orientation, as well as higher TIMO. In both ADHD and Controls, TIMO was strongly affected by the switch manipulation. Across participants, the perceptual variability parameter was correlated with TIMO, suggesting that perceptual deficits are associated with executive function deficits. Based on perceptual variability alone, we were able to classify participants into ADHD and Controls with a mean accuracy of about 77%. Participants self-reported General Executive Composite score correlated not only with TIMO but also with the perceptual variability parameter. Our results highlight the role of perceptual deficits in ADHD and the usefulness of computational modeling of behavior in dissociating perceptual from executive processes.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an ({Delta}{micro}, N, p, T) ensemble. We demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude as the average.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering common principles by which diverse modalities of information are processed is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In mammalian brain, thalamus is the central processing station for inputs from sensory systems, subcortical motor systems, and cortex; a function subserved by over 30 defined nuclei1,2. Multiple thalamic nuclei send convergent information to each region of the forebrain, but whether there is a conserved architecture across the set of thalamic pathways projecting to each forebrain area has remained unresolved3-5. To uncover organizational principles of thalamic pathways, we produced a near-comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of thalamus. This revealed a common logic for thalamic nuclei serving all major cortical modalities. We found that almost all nuclei belong to one of three major profiles, with a given cortical area getting input from each of these profiles. These profiles lie on a single axis of variance aligned with the mediolateral axis of thalamus, and this axis is strongly enriched in genes encoding receptors and ion channels. We further show that each projection profile exhibits different electrophysiological signatures. Single-cell profiling revealed that rather than forming discrete classes, thalamic neurons lie on a spectrum, with intermediate cells existing between profiles. Thus, in contrast to canonical models of thalamus that suggest it is a switchboard primarily concerned with routing distinct modalities of information to distinct cortical regions, we show that the thalamocortical system is more akin to a molecularly-defined  filter bank repeatedly applied across modality. Together, we reveal striking covariation in the organization of thalamic pathways serving all input modalities and output targets, establishing a simple and comprehensive thalamic functional architecture.",

Quorum sensing is mediated by extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Autoinducers are often structurally similar, raising questions concerning how bacteria distinguish among them. Here, we use the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR quorum-sensing receptor to explore receptor sensitivity and selectivity. Alteration of LasR amino acid S129 increases ligand selectivity and decreases ligand sensitivity. Conversely, the L130F mutation enhances LasR sensitivity while reducing selectivity. We solve crystal structures of LasR ligand binding domains complexed with non-cognate autoinducers. Comparison to existing structures reveals that ligand selectivity/sensitivity is mediated by a flexible loop adjacent to the ligand binding site. We show that P. aeruginosa harboring LasR variants with modified selectivity or sensitivity exhibit altered quorum-sensing responses. We suggest that an evolutionary trade-off between ligand selectivity and sensitivity enables LasR to optimally regulate quorum-sensing traits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransposable elements (TEs) are primarily responsible for the changes in genome sequences that occur over time within and between species. TEs themselves evolve, with clade specific LTR/ERV, LINEs and SINEs responsible for the bulk of species specific genomic features. Because TEs can contain regulatory motifs, they can be exapted as regulators of gene expression. While TE insertions can provide evolutionary novelty for the regulation of gene expression, their overall impact on the evolution of gene expression is unclear. Previous investigators have shown that tissue specific gene expression in amniotes is more similar across species than within species, supporting the existence of conserved developmental gene regulation. In order to understand how species specific TE insertions might affect the evolution/conservation of gene expression, we have looked at the association of gene expression in six tissues with TE insertions in six representative amniote genomes (human, opossum, platypus, anole lizard, bearded dragon and chicken).\\n\\nResultsWe have used a novel bootstrapping approach to minimise the conflation of effects of repeat types on gene expression. We compared the expression of orthologs containing different types of recent TE insertions to orthologs that contained older TE insertions and found significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. Likewise, we compared the expression of non-ortholog genes containing different types of recent TE insertions to non-orthologs with older TE insertions and found significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. As expected TEs were associated with species-specific changes in gene expression, but the magnitude and direction of change of expression changes were unexpected. Overall, orthologs containing clade specific TEs were associated with lower gene expression, while in non-orthologs, non clade-specific TEs were associated with higher gene expression. Exceptions were SINE elements in human and chicken, which had an opposite association with gene expression compared to other species.\\n\\nConclusionsOur observed species-specific associations of TEs with gene expression support a role for TEs in speciation/response to selection by species. TEs do not exhibit consistent associations with gene expression and observed associations can vary depending on the age of TE insertions. Based on these observations, it would be prudent to refrain from extrapolating these and previously reported associations to distantly related species.",

Here we perform a genome-wide prediction of SR rescuer genes by analyzing tumor transcriptomics and survival data of 10,000 TCGA cancer patients. Predicted SR interactions are validated in new experimental screens. We show that SR interactions can successfully predict cancer patients response and emerging resistance. Inhibiting predicted rescuer genes sensitizes resistant cancer cells to therapies synergistically, providing initial leads for developing combinatorial approaches to overcome resistance proactively.

    "abstract": "Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) present a major threat to genome integrity, preventing both the correct transcription of active chromatin and complete replication of the genome. This is exploited in genotoxic chemotherapy where ICL induction is used to kill highly proliferative cancer cells. Repair of ICLs involves a complex interplay of numerous proteins, including those in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, though alternative and parallel pathways have been postulated. Here, we investigate the role of the 3-5 exonuclease, EXD2, and the highly related WRN exonuclease (implicated in premature ageing human Werner syndrome), in repair of interstrand crosslinks in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that flies mutant for EXD2 (DmEXD2) have elevated rates of genomic instability resulting from chromosome breakage and loss of the resulting acentric fragments, in contrast to WRN exonuclease (DmWRNexo) mutants where excess homologous recombination is the principal mechanism of genomic instability. Most notably, we demonstrate that proliferating larval neuroblasts mutant for either DmWRNexo or DmEXD2 are deficient in repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks caused by diepoxybutane or mitomycin C, strongly suggesting that each nuclease individually plays a role in repair of ICLs in flies. These findings have significant implications not only for understanding the complex process of ICL repair in humans, but also for enhancing cancer therapies that rely on ICL induction, with caveats for cancer therapy in Werner syndrome and Fanconi anemia patients.",

    "abstract": "Kif5b-driven anterograde transport and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) are responsible for opposite intracellular trafficking, contributing to plasma membrane homeostasis. However, whether and how the two trafficking processes coordinate remain unclear. Here, we show that Kif5b directly interacts with clathrin heavy chain (CHC) at a region close to that for uncoating catalyst (Hsc70) and preferentially localizes on large clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Uncoating in vitro is decreased for CCVs from the cortex of kif5b conditional knockout (mutant) mouse and facilitated by adding CHC-binding Kif5b fragments, while cell peripheral distribution of CHC or Hsc70 keeps unaffected by Kif5b depletion. Furthermore, cellular entry of vesicular stomatitis virus that internalized into large CCV is inhibited in cells by Kif5b depletion or introducing a dominant-negative Kif5b fragment. These findings showed a new role of Kif5b in CCV uncoating and CME, indicating Kif5b as a molecular knot connecting anterograde transport to CME.",

However, most existing attempts rely on linear approaches based on correlation, which cannot apply in complex, nonlinear natural systems, because correlation is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for causation. Appling empirical dynamic modelling that acknowledges nonlinear dynamics on nine subpopulations of tiger mosquitos from three neighbouring reef islets of the Raiatea atoll, we identified temperature, precipitation, dew point, air pressure, and mean tide level as causal environmental variables. Interestingly, responses of subpopulations in close proximity (100-500 m) differed with respect to their causal environmental variables and the time delay of effect, highlighting complexity in mosquito-environment causality network. Moreover, we demonstrated how to explore the effects of changing environmental variables on number and strength of mosquito outbreaks, providing a new framework for pest control and disease vector ecology.",

    "abstract": "Telomere length (TL) predicts health and lifespan in humans and other organisms, making the identification of the causes of TL variation of interest. At conception, zygotes inherit genes that regulate TL during early development, but at the same time already express a phenotype, which is the TL of the parental gametes that formed the zygote. Whether the effect of gamete TL is transient or affects TL for life depends on the extent to which regulatory genes compensate for gamete TL variation during early development. A carry-over effect of parental TL, resulting in epigenetic inheritance, has been suggested to explain the observed relationship between parental age and offspring TL in humans and other species. However, reports of parental age effects are based on cross-sectional data, and age at reproduction has numerous confounds. Furthermore, parental age may affect offspring telomere dynamics between conception and sampling, which could also explain the paternal age effect. Using longitudinal telomere data of jackdaw parents and their chicks, we show that chicks hatched with shorter telomeres as individual fathers aged, whereas mother age had no effect. By cross-fostering eggs, we confirmed the paternal age effect to be independent of paternal care after conception. The epigenetic effect accounted for 34% of the variance in offspring TL that was explained by paternal telomere length; the remaining 66% we ascribe to a combination of environmental and additive genetic effects. Thus, our results strongly indicate epigenetic inheritance of TL, with potential consequences for offspring fitness prospects.\\n\\nSignificance statementTelomeres are DNA-protein structures at chromosome ends and their length predicts remaining lifespan in humans and other organisms. Variation in telomere length is thought to be largely of genetic origin, but telomere inheritance may be unusual because a fertilised cell already has a telomere length (most traits are first expressed later in life). Telomeres shorten with age, and, using long-term individual-based data of jackdaw families, we show that as fathers aged, they produced chicks with shorter telomeres. This shows that paternal telomere length directly affects offspring telomere length, i.e. is inherited genetically but without the involvement of genes. This is known as an epigenetic effect and explained a large part ([&ge;]34%) of the telomere resemblance between fathers and their offspring.",

However, precisely controlling fertilization has proved a major challenge across model systems. An ideal sterility induction system should be external, non-toxic, and reversible. Using the auxin-inducible degradation system targeting the spe-44 gene within the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we designed a means of externally inducing spermatogenesis arrest. We show that exposure to auxin during larval development induces both hermaphrodite self-sterility and male sterility. Moreover, male sterility can be reversed upon cessation of auxin exposure. The sterility induction system developed here has multiple applications in the fields of spermatogenesis and mating systems evolution. Importantly, this system is also a highly applicable tool for aging studies. We show that auxin-induced self-sterility is comparable to the commonly used chemically-induced FUdR sterility, while offering multiple benefits, including being less labor intensive, being non-toxic, and avoiding compound interactions with other experimental treatments.",

    "abstract": "Inflorescence capacity plays a crucial role in reproductive fitness in plants, and in production of hybrid crops. Maize is a monoecious species bearing separate male and female flowers (tassel and ear, respectively). The switch from open-pollinated populations of maize to hybrid-based breeding schemes in the early 20th century was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in tassel size, and the trend has continued with modern breeding over the recent decades. The goal of this study was to identify selection signatures in genes that may underlie this dramatic transformation. Using a population of 942 diverse inbred maize accessions and a nested association mapping population comprised of three 200-line biparental populations, we measured 15 tassel morphological characteristics by manual and image-based methods. Genome-wide association studies identified 242 single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with measured traits. We compared 41 unselected lines from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) population to 21 highly selected lines developed by modern commercial breeding programs and show that tassel size and weight were reduced significantly. We assayed genetic differences between the two groups using selection statistics XP-EHH, XP-CLR, and FST. All three selection statistics show evidence of selection at genomic regions associated with tassel morphology relative to genome-wide null distributions. These results support the tremendous effect, both phenotypic and genotypic, that selection has had on maize male inflorescence morphology.",

Because of the lifestyle of the original isolate, however, the nutritional repertoire of P. putida EM42 is centered largely on organic acids, aromatic compounds and some hexoses (glucose and fructose). To enlarge the biochemical network of P. putida EM42 to include disaccharides and pentoses, we implanted heterologous genetic modules for D-cellobiose and D-xylose metabolism into the enzymatic complement of this strain. Cellobiose was actively transported into the cells through the ABC complex formed by native proteins PP1015-PP1018. The knocked-in {beta}-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca catalyzed intracellular cleavage of the disaccharide to D-glucose, which was then channelled to the default central metabolism. Xylose oxidation to the dead end product D-xylonate was prevented by by deleting the gcd gene that encodes the broad substrate range quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Intracellular intake was then engineered by expressing the Escherichia coli proton-coupled symporter XylE. The sugar was further metabolized by the products of E. coli xylA (xylose isomerase) and xylB (xylulokinase) towards the pentose phosphate pathway. The resulting P. putida strain co-utilized xylose with glucose or cellobiose to complete depletion of the sugars. These results not only show the broadening of the metabolic capacity of a soil bacterium towards new substrates, but also promote P. putida EM42 as a platform for plug-in of new biochemical pathways for utilization and valorization of carbohydrate mixtures from lignocellulose processing.",

    "abstract": "The impact of spliceosomal introns on genome and organismal evolution remains puzzling. Here, we investigated the correlative associations among genome-wide features of introns from protein-coding genes (e.g., size, density, genome-content, repeats), genome size and multicellular complexity on 461 eukaryotes. Thus, we formally distinguished simple from complex multicellular organisms (CMOs), and developed the program GenomeContent to systematically estimate genomic traits. We performed robust phylogenetic controlled analyses, by taking into account significant uncertainties in the tree of eukaryotes and variation in genome size estimates. We found that changes in the variation of some intron features (such as size and repeat composition) are only weakly, while other features measuring intron abundance (within and across genes) are not, scaling with changes in genome size at the broadest phylogenetic scale. Accordingly, the strength of these associations fluctuates at the lineage-specific level, and changes in the length and abundance of introns within a genome are found to be largely evolving independently throughout Eukarya. Thereby, our findings are in disagreement with previous estimations claiming a concerted evolution between genome size and introns across eukaryotes. We also observe that intron features vary homogeneously (with low repetitive composition) within fungi, plants and stramenophiles; but they vary dramatically (with higher repetitive composition) within holozoans, chlorophytes, alveolates and amoebozoans. We also found that CMOs and their closest ancestral relatives are characterized by high intron-richness, regardless their genome size. These patterns contrast the narrow distribution of exon features found across eukaryotes. Collectively, our findings unveil spliceosomal introns as a dynamically evolving non-coding DNA class and strongly argue against both, a particular intron feature as key determinant of eukaryotic gene architecture, as well as a major mechanism (adaptive or non-adaptive) behind the evolutionary dynamics of introns over a large phylogenetic scale. We hypothesize that intron-richness is a pre-condition to evolve complex multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of pneumonia and a leading cause of death world-wide. Antibody-mediated immune responses can offer protection against repeated exposure to S. pneumoniae, yet vaccines only offer partial protection. Patients with Activated PI3K{delta} Syndrome (APDS) are highly susceptible to S. pneumoniae. We generated a conditional knockin mouse model of this disease and identified a CD19+B220- B cell subset that is induced by PI3K{delta} signaling, is resident in the lungs, and which promotes increased susceptibility to S. pneumoniae during the early phase of infection via an antibody-independent mechanism. We show that an inhaled PI3K{delta} inhibitor improves survival rates following S. pneumoniae infection in wild-type mice and in mice with activated PI3K{delta}. These results suggest that a subset of B cells in the lung can promote the severity of S. pneumoniae infection, representing a novel therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The higher response rates observed on ratio than on matched interval reward schedules has been attributed to the differential reinforcement of longer inter-response times (IRTs) on the interval contingency. Some data, however, seem to contradict this hypothesis, showing that the difference is still observed when the role of IRT reinforcement is neutralized by using a regulated-probability interval schedule (RPI). Given the mixed evidence for these predictions, we re-examined this hypothesis by training three groups of rats to lever press under ratio, interval and RPI schedules across two phases while matching reward rates within triads. At the end of the first phase, the master ratio and RPI groups responded at similar rates. In the second phase, an interval group yoked to the same master ratio group of the first phase responded at a lower rate than the RPI group. Post-hoc analysis showed comparable reward rates for master and yoked schedules. The experienced response-outcome rate correlations were likewise similar, and approached zero as training progressed. We discuss these results in terms of dual-system theories of instrumental conditioning.",

    "abstract": "Perception and cognition oscillate with fluctuating bodily states. For example, visual processing has been shown to change with alternating cardiac phases. Here, we study the heartbeats role for active information sampling--testing whether humans implicitly act upon their environment so that relevant signals appear during preferred cardiac phases.\n\nDuring the encoding period of a visual memory experiment, participants clicked through a set of emotional pictures to memorize them for a later recognition test. By self-paced key press, they actively prompted the onset of shortly (100-ms) presented pictures. Simultaneously recorded electrocardiograms allowed us to analyse the self-initiated picture onsets relative to the heartbeat. We find that self-initiated picture onsets vary across the cardiac cycle, showing an increase during cardiac systole, while memory performance was not affected by the heartbeat. We conclude that active information sampling integrates heart-related signals, thereby extending previous findings on the association between body-brain interactions and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Brief (2-3d) monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period induces a profound loss of responsiveness within layer 4 of primary visual cortex (V1). This has largely been ascribed to long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses onto pyramidal neurons, while a contribution from intracortical inhibition has been controversial. Here we used optogenetics to probe feedforward thalamocortical and feedback intracortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratios following brief MD. While thalamocortical inputs onto pyramidal neurons were depressed, there was stronger depression onto PV+ interneurons, which shifted the thalamocortical-evoked E-I ratio toward excitation. In contrast, feedback intracortical E-I ratio was shifted toward inhibition, and a computational model of layer 4 demonstrated that these opposing shifts produced an overall suppression of layer 4 excitability. Thus, feedforward and feedback E-I ratios onto the same postsynaptic target can be independently regulated by visual experience, and enhanced feedback inhibition is the primary driving force behind loss of visual responsiveness.",

Predictions of forthcoming demand can be driven by explicit external cues or be generated internally, based on past experience (cognitive history). However, it is not known whether and how the brain reconciles these two sources of information to guide control. Pairing a probabilistic task-switching paradigm with computational modeling, we found that external and internally generated predictions jointly guide task preparation, with a bias for internal predictions. Using model-based neuroimaging, we then show that the two sources of task prediction are integrated in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and jointly inform a representation of the likelihood of a change in task demand, encoded in frontoparietal cortex. Upon task-stimulus onset, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encoded the need for reactive task-set adjustment. These data reveal, for the first time, how the human brain integrates external cues and cognitive history to prepare for an upcoming task.",

    "abstract": "Current models propose that the brain uses a multi-layered architecture to reduce the high dimensional visual input to lower dimensional representations that support face, object and scene categorizations. However, understanding the brain mechanisms that support such information reduction for behavior remains challenging. We addressed the challenge using a novel information theoretic framework that quantifies the relationships between three key variables: single-trial information randomly sampled from an ambiguous scene, source-space MEG responses and perceptual decision behaviors. In each observer, behavioral analysis revealed the scene features that subtend their decisions. Independent source space analyses revealed the flow of these and other features in cortical activity. We show where (at the junction between occipital cortex and ventral regions), when (up until 170 ms post stimulus) and how (by separating task-relevant and irrelevant features) brain regions reduce the high-dimensional scene to construct task-relevant feature representations in the right fusiform gyrus that support decisions. Our results inform the occipito-temporal pathway mechanisms that reduce and select information to produce behavior.",

    "abstract": "WT1 is a transcription factor with a DNA binding N-terminal domain containing four C2H2-type zinc fingers. In order to perform its role as a transcription factor, WT1 needs to specifically recognize and properly bind to its target DNA. How this is done is still not completely clear. Two of WT1s major isoforms are distinguished by the presence or absence of a 3 amino acid insert, Lysine-Threonine-Serine (KTS) in the linker between zinc-fingers 3 and 4. This KTS insert is conserved throughout all life forms expressing WT1. The -KTS isoform, which acts as a transcription factor, binds DNA with higher affinity than the +KTS isoform, which is thought to participate in RNA splicing and interaction with partner proteins. This study was aims at elucidating the effect of the KTS insert on DNA binding. Here we present the crystal structure of WT1 zinc fingers 2-4, with and without the KTS insert, bound to the WT1 9-base pair cognate DNA sequence, refined to 1.9 [A] and 2.5 [A] respectively. The structures show that the +KTS isoform of WT1 recognizes DNA with the same specificity as the -KTS isoform. The only differences in the DNA bound conformation of the two isoforms are found within the linker containing the KTS, and these mainly involve the loss of the C-capping interactions thought to stabilize the complex. These structures provide the molecular detail necessary for the interpretation of the WT1 transcriptional DNA recognition and validation of its transcriptional targets.",

However, whilst the heterogeneous environment is known to contribute to metastatic progression, little is known about the mechanism by which heterogeneic hypoxia contributes to cancer progression. This is largely because existing experimental models do not recapitulate the heterogeneous nature of hypoxia. The primary effector of the hypoxic response is the transcription factor Hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-alpha). HIF1-alpha is stabilised in response to low oxygen levels in the cellular environment and its expression is seen in hypoxic regions throughout the tumour.\\n\\nWe have developed a model system in which HIF1-alpha can be induced within a sub-population of cancer cells, thus enabling us to mimic the effects of heterogeneic HIF1-alpha expression.\\n\\nWe show that induction of HIF1-alpha not only recapitulates elements of the hypoxic response in the induced cells but also results in significant changes in proliferation, gene expression and mammosphere formation within the HIF1-alpha negative population.\\n\\nThese findings suggest that the HIF1-alpha expressing cells found within hypoxic regions are likely to contribute to the subsequent progression of a tumour by modifying the behaviour of cells in the non-hypoxic regions of the local micro-environment.",

    "abstract": "Improving extinction learning is essential to optimize psychotherapy for persistent fear-related disorders. In two independent studies (both n=24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal fronto-parietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala. Connectivity analyses revealed this down-regulation engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, this reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 hours later. Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement. In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a non-invasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.\\n\\nSignificant statementFear-related disorders represent a significant burden on individual sufferers and society. There is a high need to optimize treatment, in particular via non-invasive means. One potentially effective intervention is execution of eye movements following trauma recall. However, a neurobiological understanding of how eye movements can reduce traumatic symptoms is lacking. We demonstrate that goal-directed eye-movements, like working memory tasks, deactivate the amygdala, the core neural substrate of fear learning. Effective connectivity analyses revealed amygdala deactivation engaged dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal pathways. When applied during safety learning, this deactivation predicts a reduction in later fear recovery. These findings provide a parsimonious and mechanistic account of how behavioral manipulations taxing working memory and suppress amygdala activity can alter retention of emotional memories.",

    "abstract": "Scaffolding is a fundamental principle of cell signaling commonly thought to involve multi-domain proteins that tether different components of a pathway together into a complex 1,2. We now report an alternative mechanism for scaffolding that is necessary for RhoA-mediated contractile signaling. We find that anillin binding stabilizes active, GTP-RhoA, and promotes contractility at both the epithelial zonula adherens (ZA) and the cytokinetic furrow. However, anillin does not conform to the classical picture of a multi-domain tether, since its RhoA-binding AH domain alone was sufficient to promote contractile signaling. Moreover, anillin competes with contractile effectors for a common site on RhoA, presenting the conundrum of how an inhibitory interaction can otherwise promote signaling. To explain this, we propose that inactivation of RhoA is non-Poissonian, having a rate that increases with time, unless the process is reset via transient binding to anillin. Repeated cycles of binding and un-binding therefore increase cortical residence times of non-sequestered GTP-RhoA and hence the probability of engaging contractile effectors. We identify the modification of the local lipid environment as a potential mechanism underlying such non-Poisson statistics, and demonstrate agreement with a minimal cellular system. Finally, we show that Myosin II anchors anillin at the cortex to form a feedback pathway that enhances RhoA signaling. This new paradigm of scaffolding is a regulatory analogue of kinetic proofreading and may be employed by other binding proteins that do not fit the classical picture.",

Mean-variance QTL mapping is based on the double generalized linear model, which elaborates on the standard linear model by incorporating not only a linear model for the data itself, but also a linear model for the residual variance. Its potential for use in QTL mapping has been described previously, but it remains underutilized, with certain key advantages undemonstrated until now. In the first case study, we use mean-variance QTL mapping to reanalyze a reduced complexity intercross of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice examining circadian behavior and find a mean-controlling QTL for circadian wheel running activity that was not detected by traditional interval mapping. Mean-variance QTL mapping was more powerful than traditional interval mapping at the QTL because it accounted for the fact that mice homozygous for the C57BL/6N allele had less residual variance than the other mice. In the second case study, we reanalyze an intercross between C57BL/6J and C58/J mice examining anxiety-like behaviors, and identify a variance-controlling QTL for rearing behavior. This QTL was not identified in the original analysis because traditional interval mapping does not target variance QTL.",

We applied G x Cell Type Proportion interaction models to identify 26 cell-type specific eQTLs in 20 genes, including 4 autoimmune disease GWAS loci, demonstrating the potential of in silico deconvolution of bulk tissue to identify cell-type restricted regulatory variants.",

    "abstract": "Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have increasingly revealed potential neural substrates of individual differences in diverse types of brain function and dysfunction. Although most previous studies have been inherently limited to state-specific characterizations of related brain networks and their functions, several recent studies have examined the potential state-unspecific nature of functional brain networks, such as their global similarities across different experimental conditions (i.e., states) including both task and rest. However, no previous studies have carried out direct, systematic characterizations of state-unspecific brain networks, or their functional implications. Here, we quantitatively identified several modes of state-unspecific individual variation in whole-brain functional connectivity patterns, called \\\"Common Neural Modes (CNMs)\\\", from a large fMRI dataset including eight task/rest states, obtained from the Human Connectome Project. Furthermore, we tested how CNMs account for variability in individual behavioral measures. The results revealed that three CNMs were robustly extracted under various different preprocessing conditions. Each of these CNMs was significantly correlated with different aspects of behavioral measures of both fluid and crystalized intelligence. The three CNMs were also able to predict several life outcomes, such as income and life satisfaction, achieving the highest performance when combined with behavioral intelligence measures as inputs. Our findings highlight the importance of state-unspecific brain networks to characterize fundamental individual variation.",

    "abstract": "The WT1 protein is a transcription factor that controls genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. It has become increasing apparent that WT1 can act both as a tumor suppressor and oncogene in a tissue specific manner. This opposing role of WT1 is linked to its underlying transcriptional regulatory function, which involves the specific binding to its regulatory elements on gene promoters. WT1 binds DNA using it C-terminal domain made up of 4 C2H2-typ zinc fingers. This same zinc finger domain is used to bind RNA and proteins and it is still not clear how each zinc finger contributes to this promiscuous binding behavior. The molecular details of DNA binding by zinc finger 2 to 4 have been described but it remains to be determined whether or not zinc finger 1 binds DNA and if so whether it exhibits any DNA binding specificity. We present the X-ray structures of zinc finger 1 to 3 bound to a 9 bp and an 8 bp DNA. The two structures refined to 1.7 [A], show no DNA binding specificity for zinc finger 1. The only DNA interactions involving zinc finger 1 are crystal-packing interactions with a symmetry related molecule. In the structure of zinc finger 1 to 3 bound to the 9 bp DNA we observe a shift in the DNA binding positions for zinc fingers 2 and 3. These structures provide molecular detail into the WT1-DNA interaction showing that zinc finger 1 only modestly contributes to DNA binding affinity through transient interactions. The dislocation of zinc finger 2 and 3 emphasizes the importance of zinc finger 4 for maintaining gene transcriptional specificity.",

    "abstract": "Many siRNAs and shRNAs are toxic to cancer cells through a 6mer seed sequence (position 2-7 of the guide strand). A siRNA screen with all 4096 possible 6mer seed sequences in a neutral RNA backbone revealed a preference for guanine in positions 1-3 and a GC content of >80% of the 6mer seed in the most toxic siRNAs. These 6mer seed containing siRNAs exert their toxicity by targeting survival genes which contain GC-rich 3UTRs. The master tumor suppressor miRNA miR-34a was found to be toxic through such a G-rich 6mer seed suggesting that certain tumor suppressive miRNAs use a toxic 6mer seed to kill cancer cells. An analysis of all mature miRNAs suggests that most miRNAs evolved to avoid guanine at the 5' end of the 6mer seed sequence of the predominantly expressed arm. In contrast, for many tumor suppressive miRNAs the predominant arm contains a G-rich toxic 6mer seed, presumably to eliminate cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Estrogens have been shown to rapidly regulate local signalling events at both synapses and within the nucleus. The result of these signalling events is to rapidly modulate synapse structure and function, as well as epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications. Ultimately these mechanisms are thought to contribute to long-lasting changes in neural circuitry, and thus influences cognitive functions such as learning and memory. However, the mechanisms by which estrogen-mediated local synaptic and nuclear signalling events are coordinated are not well understood. In this study we have found that the scaffold protein afadin, (also known as AF-6), undergoes a bi-directional trafficking to both synaptic and nuclear compartment in response to acute 17{beta}-estradiol (estradiol) treatment. Interestingly, nuclear accumulation of afadin was coincidental with an increase in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10p). This histone modification is associated with the remodelling of chromatin into an open euchromatin state, allowing for transcriptional activation and related learning and memory processes. Critically, the cyto-nuclear trafficking of afadin was required for estradiol-dependent H3S10p. We further determined that nuclear accumulation of afadin is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of the mitogentic kinases ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) within the nucleus. Moreover, nuclear pERK1/2 was required for estradiol-dependent H3S10p. Taken together, we propose a model whereby estradiol incudes the bi-directional trafficking of afadin to synaptic and nuclear sub-compartments. Within the nucleus, afadin is required for increased pERK1/2 which in turn is required for H3S10p. Therefore this represents a mechanism through which estrogens may be able to coordinate both synaptic and nucleosomal events within the same neuronal population.",

    "abstract": "Calcium imaging is commonly used to measure the neural activity of large groups of neurons in mice. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) can be delivered for this purpose using non-invasive genetic methods. Compared to viral gene transfer, transgenic targeting of GECIs provides stable long-term expression and obviates the need for invasive viral injections. Transgenic mice expressing the green GECI GCaMP6 are already widely used. Here we present the generation and characterizarion of transgenic mice expressing the sensitive red GECI jRGECO1a, driven by the Thy1 promoter. Four transgenic lines with different expression patterns showed sufficiently high expression for cellular in vivo imaging. We used two-photon microscopy to characterize visual responses of individual neurons in the visual cortex in vivo. The signal-to-noise ratio in transgenic mice was comparable to, or better than, for mice transduced with adeno-associated virus. We also show that Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are useful for transcranial population imaging and functional mapping using widefield fluorescecnce microscopy. We also demonstrate imaging of visual responses in retinal ganglion cells. Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are therefore a useful addition to the toolbox for imaging activity in intact neural networks.",

    "abstract": "O_LIWhite grain disorder is a recently emerged wheat disease in Australia, caused by three Botryosphaeriaceae spp.; Eutiarosporella darliae, E. pseudodarliae, and E. tritici-australis. The disease cycle of these pathogens and the molecular basis of their interaction with wheat are poorly understood. To address this, we undertook a comparative genomics approach to identify potential pathogenicity factors.\\nC_LIO_LISubsequent genome analysis revealed that each of the white grain disorder species harbour modular polyketide synthase genes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fungi harbouring such genes. Further comparative analysis using the modular polyketide synthase genes discovered their presence in the closely related Macrophomina phaseolina. Phylogenetic analysis implicates horizontal acquisition of these genes from a bacterial or a protist species.\\nC_LIO_LIBoth E. darliae and E. pseudodarliae possess a secondary metabolite cluster with multiple polyketide/non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes (Hybrid-1, -2, and -3). In contrast, only remnant and partial genes homologous to this cluster were identified at a syntenic locus in E. tritici-australis suggesting loss of this cluster. Homologues of Hybrid-2 in other fungi have been proposed to facilitate disease induction in woody plants. Subsequent assays confirmed that E. darliae and E. pseudodarliae were both pathogenic on woody plant hosts, but E. tritici-australis was not, implicating woody plants as potential host reservoirs for the fungi. We hypothesise that loss of the cluster in E. tritici-australis represents a committed lifestyle jump to grasses.\\nC_LIO_LICombined, our observations relating to the secondary metabolite potential of the WGD Eutiarosporella spp. have contributed novel data to the field by expanding the range of known fungal secondary metabolite genes, and helped develop our understanding of the lifestyle and potential host-range of a recently emerged pathogen of wheat.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The plant immune system involves a large family of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) intracellular immune receptors. These immune receptors often function to directly or indirectly mediate the perception of specific pathogen effector proteins secreted into the cell. Activation of these immune receptors typically results in activation of the immune system and subsequent suppression of pathogen proliferation. Although many examples of NLR receptors are known, a mechanistic understanding of how receptor activation ultimately leads to an immune response is not well understood. A subset of the NLR proteins contain a TIR domain at their N terminus (TNL). One such TNL, the N gene, was previously shown to depend on a non-TIR NLR protein, N requirement gene 1 (NRG1) for immune function. We tested additional NLR proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana for dependency on NRG1. We found that two additional TIR-NLR proteins, Roq1 and RPP1, also require NRG1 but that two coiled-coil NLR proteins, Bs2 and Rps2, do not. This finding suggests that NRG1 may be a conserved component of TNL signaling pathways.",
