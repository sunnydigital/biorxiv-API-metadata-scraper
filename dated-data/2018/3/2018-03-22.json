    "abstract": "In phenotype prediction, the physical characteristics of an organism are predicted from knowledge of its genotype and environment. Such studies are of the highest societal importance, as they are of central importance to medicine, crop-breeding, etc. We investigated three phenotype prediction problems: one simple and clean (yeast), and the other two complex and real-world (rice and wheat). We compared standard machine learning methods (elastic net, ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosting machines (GBM), and support vector machines (SVM)), with two state-of-the-art classical statistical genetics methods (including genomic BLUP). Additionally, using the clean yeast data, we investigated how performance varied with the complexity of the biological mechanism, the amount of observational noise, the number of examples, the amount of missing data, and the use of different data representations. We found that for almost all phenotypes considered standard machine learning methods outperformed the methods from classical statistical genetics. On the yeast problem, the most successful method was GBM, followed by lasso regression, and the two statistical genetics methods; with greater mechanistic complexity GBM was best, while in simpler cases lasso was superior. When applied to the wheat and rice studies the best two methods were SVM and BLUP. The most robust method in the presence of noise, missing data, etc. was random forests. The classical statistical genetics method of genomic BLUP was found to perform well on problems where there was population structure, which suggests one way to improve standard machine learning methods when population structure is present. We conclude that the application of machine learning methods to phenotype prediction problems holds great promise.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe stress activated protein kinases (SAPKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, are important players in cell fate decisions in response to environmental stress signals. Crosstalk signaling between JNK and p38 is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism in the inflammatory and stress responses. However, it is still unknown how this crosstalk affects signaling dynamics, cell-to-cell variation, and cellular responses at the single-cell level. To address these questions, we established a multiplexed live-cell imaging system based on kinase translocation reporters to simultaneously monitor JNK and p38 activities with high specificity and sensitivity at single-cell resolution. Various stresses, such as anisomycin, osmotic stress, and UV irradiation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines activated JNK and p38 with various dynamics. In all cases, however, p38 suppressed JNK activity in a cross-inhibitory manner. We demonstrate that p38 antagonizes JNK through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. This cross-inhibition of JNK appears to generate cellular heterogeneity in JNK activity after stress exposure. Our data indicate that this heterogeneity in JNK activity plays a role in fractional killing in response to UV stress. Our highly sensitive multiplexed imaging system enables detailed investigation into the p38-JNK interplay in single cells.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCross-inhibition by p38 generates cell-to-cell variability in JNK activity.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which different microbes colonize the healthy human gut versus other body sites, the gut in disease states, or other environments remain largely unknown. Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between having a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we use metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis reveals thousands of genes potentially involved in adaptation to the gut across species, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also find microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which are significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an in vivo competition experiment. Finally, we identify gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohns disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation. These gene targets may represent new avenues for modulating host colonization and disease. Our strategy of combining metagenomics with phylogenetic modeling is general and can be used to identify genes associated with adaptation to any environment.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhy do certain microbes and not others colonize our gut, and why do they differ between healthy and sick people? One explanation is the genes in their genomes. If we can find microbial genes involved in gut adaptation, we may be able to keep out pathogens and encourage the growth of beneficial microbes. One could look for genes that were present more often in prevalent microbes, and less often in rare ones.\\n\\nHowever, this ignores that related species are more likely to share an environment and also share many unrelated phenotypes simply because of common ancestry. To solve this problem, we used a method from ecology that accounts for phylogenetic relatedness. We first calculated gut prevalence for thousands of species using a compendium of shotgun sequencing data, then tested for genes associated with prevalence, adjusting for phylogenetic relationships. We found genes that are associated with overall gut prevalence, with a preference for the gut over other body sites, and with the gut in Crohns disease versus health. Many of these findings have biological plausibility based on existing literature. We also showed agreement with the results of a previously published high-throughput screen of bacterial gene knockouts in mice. These results, and this type of analysis, may eventually lead to new strategies for maintaining gut health.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans exhibits morphological changes in cell size during lung infection, producing both typical size 5 to 7 {micro}m cells and large titan cells (> 10 {micro}m and up to 100 {micro}m). We found and optimized in vitro conditions that produce titan cells in order to identify the ancestry of titan cells, the environmental determinants, and the key gene regulators of titan cell formation. Titan cells generated in vitro harbor the main characteristics of titan cells produced in vivo including their large cell size (>10 {micro}m), polyploidy with a single nucleus, large vacuole, dense capsule, and thick cell wall. Here we show titan cells derived from the enlargement of progenitor cells in the population independent of yeast growth rate. Change in the incubation medium, hypoxia, nutrient starvation and low pH were the main factors that trigger titan cell formation, while quorum sensing factors like the initial inoculum concentration, pantothenic acid, and the quorum sensing peptide Qsp1p also impacted titan cell formation. Inhibition of ergosterol, protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis altered titan cell formation, as did serum, phospholipids and anti-capsular antibodies in our settings. We explored genetic factors important for titan cell formation using three approaches. Using H99-derivative strains with natural genetic differences, we showed that titan cell formation was dependent on LMP1 and SGF29 genes. By screening a gene deletion collection, we also confirmed that GPR4/5-RIM101, and CAC1 genes were required to generate titan cells and that the PKR1, TSP2, USV101 genes negatively regulated titan cell formation. Furthermore, analysis of spontaneous Pkr1 loss-of-function clinical isolates confirmed the important role of the Pkr1 protein as a negative regulator of titan cell formation. Through development of a standardized and robust in vitro assay, our results provide new insights into titan cell biogenesis with the identification of multiple important factors/pathways.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that is capable of morphological change upon interaction with the host. Particularly, in the lungs of infected mice, a subpopulation of yeast enlarges, producing cells up to 100 {micro}m in cell body diameter - referred to as titan cells. Along with their large size, the titan cells have other unique characteristics such as thickened cell wall, dense capsule, polyploidization, large vacuole with peripheral nucleus and cellular organelles. The generation of a large number of such cells outside the lungs of mice has been described but was not reproducible nor standardized. Here we report standardized, reproducible, robust conditions for generation of titan cells and explored the environmental and genetic factors underlying the genesis of these cells. We showed that titan cells were generated upon stresses such as change in the incubation medium, nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and low pH. Using collections of well characterized reference strains and clinical isolates, we validated with our model that the cAMP/PKA/Rim101 pathway is a major genetic determinant of titan cell formation. This study opens the way for a more comprehensive picture of the ontology of morphological changes in Cryptococcus neoformans and its impact on pathobiology of this deadly pathogen.",

This has been interpreted as an effect of temporal structure. Such structure in movies depends on pre-existing event schemas, but temporal structure can also arise de novo from learning. Here we examined the relative role of schema-consistent temporal structure and arbitrary but consistent temporal structure on the human posterior medial network. We tested whether, with repeated viewing, the network becomes engaged by scrambled movies with temporal structure. Replicating prior studies, posterior medial regions were immediately locked to stimulus structure upon exposure to intact but not scrambled movies. However, for temporally structured scrambled movies, functional coupling within the network increased across stimulus repetitions, rising to the level of intact movies. Thus, temporal structure is a key determinant of network dynamics and function.",

The mechanism enabling RecBCD to achieve such fast unwinding rate is not known. We employed a combination of equilibrium and time-resolved binding experiments, and ensemble and single molecule activity assays to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying RecBCDs rapid catalysis. We report the existence of auxiliary binding sites, where ATP binds with lower affinity and with distinct chemical interactions as compared to the known catalytic sites. The catalytic rate of RecBCD is reduced both by preventing and by strengthening ATP binding to these sites, suggesting that the dynamics of ATP at these sites modulates the enzymes rate. We propose a model by which RecBCD achieves its fast unwinding rate by utilizing the weaker binding sites to increase the flux of ATP to its catalytic sites.",

Comparative transcriptome analysis of ten organs from breeders and non-breeders of the eusocial long-lived NMR and the polygynous shorter-lived guinea pig provide comprehensive and unbiased molecular evidence that sexual maturation in NMR is socially suppressed. After transition into breeders, transcriptomes are markedly sex-specific, show pronounced feedback signaling via gonadal steroids and have similarities to reproductive phenotypes in African cichlid fish. Further, NMRs show functional enrichment of status-related expression differences associated with aging. Lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation - molecular networks known to be linked to aging - were identified among most affected gene sets. Further, a transcriptome pattern associated with longevity is reinforced in NMR breeders contradicting the disposable soma theory of aging and potentially contributing to their exceptional long life- and healthspan.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConcerns that antimicrobial treatment may foster selection and transmission of resistant bacterial lineages have led to conflicting guidelines for clinical management of common non-severe infections. However, the impact of antimicrobial treatment on colonization dynamics is poorly understood. We used data from a previously-conducted trial of amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) to understand how antimicrobial treatment impacts the acquisition and clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae lineages with varying susceptibility to penicillin.\\n\\nMethods and findingsWe measured impacts of antimicrobial treatment on nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP) lineages at end-of-treatment and 15d, 30d, and 60d after treatment in a previously-conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Analyses were not specified in the original protocol. Among children 6-35 months of age with stringently-defined AOM, 162 were assigned amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 160 were assigned placebo. Children who did not show clinical improvement received open-label antimicrobial rescue treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate irrespective of the randomized treatment assignment, to which both patients and physicians were blinded. The intention-to-treat populations of the intervention and placebo arms thus received care resembling immediate antimicrobial therapy and watchful waiting, respectively. Immediate amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced PSSP carriage prevalence by 88% (95%CI: 76-96%) at end-of-treatment and by 27% (-3-49%) after 60d, but did not measurably alter PNSP carriage prevalence throughout follow-up. By end-of-treatment, 7% of children who carried PSSP at enrollment remained colonized in the amoxicillin-clavulanate arm, compared to 61% of PSSP carriers who received placebo; differences in carriage prevalence persisted at least 60d after treatment among children who carried PSSP at enrollment. Among children not carrying pneumococci at enrollment, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced PSSP acquisition by >80% over 15d. Among children who carried PNSP at enrollment, no differences in carriage prevalence of S. pneumoniae, PSSP, or PNSP were detected at follow-up visits.\\n\\nConclusionsIn a setting with low PNSP prevalence, antimicrobial therapy for AOM conferred a selective impact on colonizing S. pneumoniae by accelerating clearance, and delaying acquisition, of penicillin-susceptible lineages. Absolute risk of carrying PNSP was unaffected by treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00299455; Funding: NIH/NIGMS).",

In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Accessible chromatin is important for RNA polymerase II recruitment and transcription initiation at eukaryotic promoters. We investigated the mechanistic links between promoter DNA sequence, nucleosome positioning and transcription. Our results indicate that precise positioning of the transcription start site-associated +1 nucleosome in yeast is critical for efficient TBP binding, and is driven by two key factors, the essential chromatin remodeler RSC and a small set of ubiquitous pioneer transcription factors. We find no evidence for recruitment of RSC by pioneer factors, but show instead that the strength and directionality of RSC action on nucleosomes depends upon the arrangement of two specific DNA motifs that promote its binding and nucleosome displacement activity at promoters. Thus, despite their widespread co-localization, RSC and pioneer factors predominantly act independently to generate accessible chromatin. Our results provide insight into how promoter DNA sequence instructs trans-acting factors to control nucleosome architecture and stimulate transcription initiation.",

We previously introduced a supervised machine learning approach, S/HIC, for finding both hard and soft selective sweeps in genomes on the basis of patterns of genetic variation surrounding a window of the genome. While S/HIC was shown to be both powerful and precise, the utility of S/HIC was limited by the use of phased genomic data as input.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe challenge the oft-repeated claim that the beetles (Coleoptera) are the most species-rich order of animals. Instead, we assert that another order of insects, the Hymenoptera, are more speciose, due in large part to the massively diverse but relatively poorly known parasitoid wasps. The idea that the beetles have more species than other orders is primarily based on their respective collection histories and the relative availability of taxonomic resources, which both disfavor parasitoid wasps. Though it is unreasonable to directly compare numbers of described species in each order, the ecology of parasitic wasps - specifically, their intimate interactions with their hosts - allows for estimation of relative richness. We present a simple logical model that shows how the specialization of many parasitic wasps on their hosts suggests few scenarios in which there would be more beetle species than parasitic wasp species. We couple this model with an accounting of what we call the \\\"genus-specific parasitoid-host ratio\\\" from four well-studied genera of insect hosts, a metric by which to generate extremely conservative estimates of the average number of parasitic wasp species attacking a given beetle or other insect host species. Synthesis of our model with data from real host systems suggests that the Hymenoptera may have 2.5 - 3.2x more species than the Coleoptera. While there are more described species of beetles than all other animals, the Hymenoptera are almost certainly the larger order.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles around 30-100 nm in diameter that are secreted from cells and can be found in most body fluids. Exosomes can be a vital source of biomarkers as they contain various substances (e.g. lipids, RNAs, metabolites and proteins) that can reflect the cell of origin (e.g. cancer cells). For isolation of exosomes present in biological matrices, ultracentrifugation (UC)-based procedures are most common. Other approaches exist, including commercial kits developed for easy and low sample volume isolation. In this study, differential UC and an isolation kit from a major vendor (Total Exosome Isolation Reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific) were compared. Exosomes were isolated from cell culture media of two different cell sources (patient derived cells from glioblastoma multiforme and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231). For both isolation methods, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and western blotting indicated the presence of exosomes. The kit- and UC isolates contained similar amounts of protein measured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay with absorbance at 562 nm. Using western blot, positive exosome markers were identified in all isolates, and additional exosome markers were identified using MS-based proteomics. For the glioblastoma exosome isolates, the number of proteins identified with liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) was higher for the UC isolates than the kit isolates when injecting equal protein amounts, contrary to that for the breast cancer exosome isolates. However, negative exosome markers were also found in glioblastoma isolates using LC-MS/MS. Thus, we would not use the term \\\"exosome isolation\\\" as impurities may be present with both isolation methods. Notably, potential biomarkers for both diseases were identified in the isolates using LS-MS/MS. In our opinion, the two isolation methods had rather similar performance, although with some minor differences based on cell of origin.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) stand as powerful experimental designs for identifying DNA variants associated with complex traits and diseases. In the past decade, both the number of such studies and their sample sizes have increased dramatically. Recent GWAS of height and body mass index (BMI) in [~]250,000 European participants have led to the discovery of [~]700 and [~]100 nearly independent SNPs associated with these traits, respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in [~]450,000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N[~]700,000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3,290 and 716 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of p<1 x 10-8), including 1,185 height-associated SNPs and 554 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The genome-wide significant SNPs explain [~]24.6% of the variance of height and [~]5% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were 0.44 and 0.20, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and eQTL data by Summary-data based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), we identified an enrichment of eQTLs amongst lead height and BMI signals, prioritisting 684 and 134 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow up studies.",

    "abstract": "Low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) can impair essential physiological processes and cause cellular damage and death. We have shown that specific hypoxic conditions disrupt protein homeostasis in C. elegans, leading to protein aggregation and proteotoxicity. Here, we show that nutritional cues regulate this effect of hypoxia on proteostasis. Animals fasted prior to hypoxic exposure develop dramatically fewer protein aggregates compared to their fed counterparts, indicating that the effect of hypoxia is abrogated. Fasting is effective at protecting against hypoxia-induced proteostasis defects in multiple developmental stages, tissues, and in different models of misfolded or aggregation prone proteins. Our data also demonstrate that the effect of fasting is induced and reversed quite rapidly, suggesting that the nutritional environment experienced at the onset of hypoxia dictates at least some aspects of the physiological response to hypoxia. We further demonstrate that the insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway plays a role in mediating the protective effects of fasting in hypoxia. Animals with mutations in daf-2, the C. elegans insulin-like receptor, display wild-type levels of hypoxia-induced protein aggregation upon exposure to hypoxia when fed, but are not protected by fasting. However, we found that DAF-2 acts independently of the FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16, to mediate the protective effects of fasting. These results suggest a non-canonical role for the insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway in coordinating the effects of hypoxia and nutritional state on proteostasis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhen blood flow to various parts of the body becomes restricted, those tissues suffer from a lack of oxygen, a condition called hypoxia. Hypoxia can cause cellular damage and death, such as is observed as a result of stroke and cardiovascular disease. We have found that in the model organism C. elegans (a roundworm) specific concentrations of hypoxia cause aggregation of polyglutamine proteins - the same kind of proteins that are found in an aggregated state in the neurodegenerative disorder Huntingtons disease. Here, we show that that worms can be protected from hypoxia-induced protein aggregation if they are fasted (removed from their food source) prior to experiencing hypoxia. Furthermore, we show that the insulin receptor is required for this protection. The insulin receptor is responsible for detecting insulin, a hormone that is released after feeding. Worms with a nonfunctional version of the insulin receptor displayed hypoxia-induced protein aggregation despite being fasted before the hypoxic exposure. Our results highlight a new role for the insulin signaling pathway in coordinating the effects of both hypoxia and nutritional state on protein aggregation.",

    "abstract": "The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperones, vital to the proper folding of proteins inside cells, consume ATP and require cochaperones in assisting protein folding. It is unclear whether Hsp70 can utilize the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to fold a protein into a native state that is thermodynamically unstable in the chaperone-free equilibrium. Here we present a model of Hsp70-mediated protein folding, which predicts that Hsp70, as a result of differential stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by its Hsp40 cochaperone, dissociates faster from a substrate in fold-competent conformations than from one in misfolding-prone conformations, thus elevating the native concentration above and suppressing the misfolded concentration below their respective equilibrium values. Previous models would not make or imply these predictions, which are experimentally testable. Our model quantitatively reproduces experimental refolding kinetics, predicts how modulations of the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperone system affect protein folding, and suggests new approaches to regulating cellular protein quality.",

We first developed a computational framework that enables unbiased, granular cell-type annotation of scRNA-seq. This approach identified a macrophage subpopulation that was specific to injured lung and notable for high expression of Cx3cr1+ and MHCII genes. We found that these macrophages, which bear a gene expression profile consistent with monocytic origin, progressively acquire alveolar macrophage identity and localize to sites of fibroblast accumulation. Probing their functional role, in vitro studies showed a trophic effect of these cells on fibroblast activation, and ablation of Cx3cr1-expressing cells suppressed fibrosis in vivo. We also found by gene set analysis and immunofluorescence that markers of these macrophages were upregulated in samples from patients with lung fibrosis compared with healthy controls.

We consider different disease progressions accounting for lethal infection, immunity waning, and potential cross-species transmission when the two populations share the same refuge along the migratory path of M. schreibersii.\\n\\nResultsWe find that EBLV-1 persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii bats, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis population, and on a disease progression leading to survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The higher fragmentation along the northern portion of the migratory path is necessary to maintain EBLV-1 sustained circulation in both species, whereas persistence would not be ensured in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides first estimates for the EBLV-1 transmission potential in M. schreibersii bats and average duration of immunity in the host species, yielding values compatible with previous empirical observations in M. myotis bats.\\n\\nConclusionsHabitats sharing and the strong spatial component of EBLV-1 transmission dynamics identified as key drivers in this ecological context may help understanding the observed spatial diffusion of the virus at a larger scale and across a diverse range of host species, through long-range migration and seeding of local populations.

Understanding these mechanisms and developing biomarkers to identify their presence thus represents a vital goal. Towards this goal, here we report a chemoproteomic map of the covalent targets of fumarate, an oncometabolite whose accumulation marks the genetic cancer predisposition syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). First, we validate the ability of known and novel chemoproteomic probes to report on fumarate reactivity in vitro. Next, we apply these probes in concert with LC-MS/MS to identify cysteine residues sensitive to either fumarate treatment or fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in untransformed and human HLRCC cell models, respectively. Mining this data to understand the structural determinants of fumarate reactivity reveals an unexpected anti-correlation with nucleophilicity, and the discovery of a novel influence of pH on fumarate-cysteine interactions. Finally, we show that many fumarate-sensitive and FH-regulated cysteines are found in functional protein domains, and perform mechanistic studies of a fumarate-sensitive cysteine in SMARCC1 that lies at a key protein-protein interface in the SWI-SNF tumor suppressor complex. Our studies provide a powerful resource for understanding the influence of fumarate on reactive cysteine residues, and lay the foundation for future efforts to exploit this distinct aspect of oncometabolism for cancer diagnosis and therapy.",

Significantly, a chromosomal inversion results in antigenic variation of PhtD, an important surface-exposed virulence factor. We generated a new genome annotation using automated tools, followed by manual curation, reflecting the current knowledge in the field. By combining sequence-driven terminator prediction, deep paired-end transcriptome sequencing and enrichment of primary transcripts by Cappable-Seq, we mapped 1,015 transcriptional start sites and 748 termination sites. Using this new genomic map, we identified several new small RNAs (sRNAs), riboswitches (including twelve previously misidentified as sRNAs), and antisense RNAs. In total, we annotated 92 new protein-encoding genes, 39 sRNAs and 165 pseudogenes, bringing the S. pneumoniae D39 repertoire to 2,151 genetic elements.

How pneumococcal genes are expressed and regulated at the different stages of its life cycle, as commensal or as pathogen, has not been entirely described. To chart the transcriptional responses of S. pneumoniae, we quantified the transcriptome under 22 different infection-relevant conditions. The transcriptomic compendium exposed a high level of dynamic expression and, strikingly, all annotated pneumococcal genomic features were expressed in at least one of the studied conditions. By computing the correlation of gene expression of every two genes across all studied conditions, we created a co-expression matrix that provides valuable information on both operon structure and regulatory processes. The co-expression data is highly consistent with well-characterized operons and regulons, such as the PyrR, ComE and ComX regulons, and has allowed us to identify a new member of the competence regulon. Finally, we created an interactive data center named PneumoExpress (www.veeninglab.com/pneumoexpress) that enables users to access the expression data as well as the co-expression matrix in an intuitive and efficient manner, providing a valuable resource to the pneumococcal research community.",

We show that the overall modular organization of the transcriptional program is conserved. We highlight modules of co-expressed genes in one species that dissolve or split in the other species. Many of the associated regulatory mechanisms - as reflected by computationally inferred trans regulators, or enriched cis-regulatory elements - are conserved between the species.

    "abstract": "Direct visualization of metabolic dynamics in living tissues with high spatial and temporal resolution is essential to understanding many biological processes. Here we introduce a platform that combines deuterium oxide (D2O) probing with stimulated Raman scattering microscopy (DO-SRS) to image in situ metabolic activities. Enzymatic incorporation of D2O-derived deuterium into macromolecules generates carbon-deuterium (C-D) bonds, which track biosynthesis in tissues and can be imaged by SRS in situ. Within the broad vibrational spectra of C-D bonds, we discovered lipid-, protein-, and DNA-specific Raman shifts and developed spectral unmixing methods to obtain C-D signals with macromolecular selectivity. DO-SRS enabled us to probe de novo lipogenesis in animals, image protein biosynthesis without tissue bias, and simultaneously visualize lipid and protein metabolism and reveal their different dynamics. DO-SRS, being noninvasive, universally applicable, and cost-effective, can be adapted to a broad range of biological systems to study development, tissue homeostasis, aging, and tumor heterogeneity.",

Mammalian genomes encode four Sec24 paralogs (Sec24a-d), with two subfamilies based on sequence homology (SEC24A/B and C/D), though little is known about their comparative functions and cargo-specificities. Complete deficiency for Sec24d results in very early embryonic lethality in mice (before the 8 cell stage), with later embryonic lethality (E 7.5) observed in Sec24c null mice. To test the potential overlap in function between SEC24C/D, we employed dual recombinase mediated cassette exchange to generate a Sec24cc-d allele, in which the C-terminal 90% of SEC24C has been replaced by SEC24D coding sequence. In contrast to the embryonic lethality at E7.5 of SEC24C-deficiency, Sec24cc-d/c-d pups survive to term, though dying shortly after birth. Sec24cc-d/c-d pups are smaller in size, but exhibit no obvious developmental abnormality. These results suggest that tissue-specific and/or stage-specific expression of the Sec24c/d genes rather than differences in cargo function explain the early embryonic requirements for SEC24C and SEC24D.",

Here we show in freely moving mice that a population of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) responds specifically when the animal is at a given distance and direction from a spatially confined object. These  object-vector cells are tuned similarly to a spectrum of discrete objects, irrespective of their location in the test arena. The vector relationships are expressed from the outset in novel environments with novel objects. Object-vector cells are distinct from grid cells, which use a distal reference frame, but the cells exhibit some mixed selectivity with head-direction and border cells. Collectively, these observations show that object locations are integrated in metric representations of self-location, with specific subsets of MEC neurons encoding vector relationships to individual objects.",

    "abstract": "Oxygenated membrane fatty acid derivatives dubbed oxylipins play important roles in the plants defense against biotic and abiotic cues. Plants challenged by insect pests, for example, synthesize a blend of different defense compounds that, amongst others, comprise volatile aldehydes and jasmonic acid (JA). Because all oxylipins are derived from the same pathway, we asked how their synthesis might be regulated and focused on two closely related, atypical cytochrome P450 enzymes designated CYP74A and CYP74B, i.e., allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL). Both enzymes compete for the same substrate but give rise to different products. While the final product of the AOS branch is JA, those of the HPL branch comprise volatile aldehydes and alcohols. AOS and HPL are plastid envelope enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana but accumulate at different locations. Biochemical experiments identified AOS as constituent of complexes also containing lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC), which catalyze consecutive steps in JA precursor biosynthesis, while excluding the concurrent HPL reaction. Based on published X-ray data, the structure of this complex could be modelled and amino acids involved in catalysis and subunit interactions identified. Genetic studies identified the microRNA 319 (miR319)-regulated clade of TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF) transcription factor genes and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) to control JA production through the AOS-LOX2-AOC2 complex. Together, our results define a molecular branch point in oxylipin biosynthesis that allows fine-tuning the plants defense machinery in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Misfolding and aggregation of tau protein are closely associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimers Disease (AD). By interrogating IgG+ memory B cells from asymptomatic donors with tau peptides, we have identified two somatically mutated VH5-51/VL4-1 antibodies. One of these, CBTAU-27.1, binds to the aggregation motif in the R3 repeat domain and blocks the aggregation of tau into paired helical filaments (PHFs) by sequestering monomeric tau. The other, CBTAU-28.1, binds to the N-terminal insert region and inhibits the spreading of tau seeds and mediates the uptake of tau aggregates into microglia by binding PHFs. Crystal structures revealed that the combination of VH5-51 and VL4-1 recognizes a common Pro-Xn-Lys motif driven by germline-encoded hotspot interactions while the specificity and thereby functionality of the antibodies are defined by the CDR3 regions. Affinity improvement led to improvement in functionality, identifying their epitopes as new targets for therapy and prevention of AD.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic spindle positioning specifies the plane of cell division during anaphase. Spindle orientation and positioning is therefore critical to ensure symmetric division in mitosis and asymmetric division during development. The control of astral microtubule length plays an essential role in positioning the spindle. Here we show using gene knockout that the Kinesin-8 Kif18b controls microtubule length to center the mitotic spindle at metaphase. Using an integrated approach, we reveal that Kif18b is a highly processive plus end-directed motor that uses a C-terminal non-motor microtubule-binding region to accumulate at growing microtubule plus ends. This region is regulated by phosphorylation to spatially control Kif18b accumulation at plus ends and is essential for Kif18b-dependent spindle positioning and regulation of microtubule length. Finally, we demonstrate that Kif18b shortens microtubules by increasing the catastrophe rate of dynamic microtubules. Overall, our work reveals that Kif18b utilizes its motile properties to reach microtubule ends where it regulates astral microtubule length to ensure spindle centering.",

While thermal biology predicts nonlinear effects of temperature on vector and pathogen traits that drive disease transmission, the empirical relationship between temperature and transmission remains unknown for most vector-borne pathogens. We built a mechanistic model to estimate the thermal response of Ross River virus, an important mosquito-borne pathogen of humans in Australia, the Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. Transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4{degrees}C) and declines to zero at low (17.0{degrees}C) and high (31.5{degrees}C) temperatures. The model predicted broad patterns of disease across Australia. First, transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics and sub-tropics but seasonal in temperate zones. Second, nationwide human cases peak seasonally as predicted from population-weighted seasonal temperatures. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear, mechanistic models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change.",

In contrast to defining haplotypes as allele combinations at two marker loci, we concentrate on the clustering of sampled chromosomes induced by their coalescent genealogy. The root of a binary coalescent trees defines two clusters of chromosomes. At two different loci this assignment may be different as a result of recombination. We show that the amount of shared chromosomes among clusters at two different loci, measured by the squared correlation, constitutes a natural measure of LD. We call this topological LD (tLD) since it is induced by the topology of the coalescent tree. We find that its rate of decay decreases more slowly with distance between loci than that of conventional LD. Furthermore, tLD has a smaller coefficient of variation, which should render it more accurate for any kind of mapping purposes than conventional LD. We conclude with a practical application to the LCT region in human populations.",

    "abstract": "The internal representation of stimuli is imperfect and subject to bias. Noise introduced at initial encoding and during maintenance degrades the precision of representation. Stimulus estimation is also biased away from recently encountered stimuli, a phenomenon known as adaptation. Within a Bayesian framework, greater biases are predicted to result from poor precision. We tested for this effect in individual difference measures. 202 subjects contributed data through an on-line experiment (https://cfn.upenn.edu/iadapt). During separate face and color blocks, subjects performed three different tasks: an immediate stimulus-match (15 trials), a 5 seconds delayed match (30 trials), and 5 seconds of adaptation followed by a delayed match (30 trials). The stimulus spaces were circular and subjects entered their responses using a color/face wheel. Bias and precision of responses were extracted by fitting a mixture of von Mises distributions to account for random guesses. Two blocks of each measure were obtained, allowing for tests of measure reliability. We found that reliable differences between individuals in precision were as great as those between tasks or materials. The adaptation manipulation induced the expected bias in responses (colors: 7.8{degrees}; faces: 5.0{degrees}), and the magnitude of this bias reliably and substantially varied between subjects. Across subjects, there was a negative correlation between mean precision and bias (color:{rho} = -0.26; faces:{rho} = -0.13). This relationship was replicated in a new experiment with 192 subjects (color:{rho} = -0.22; faces:{rho} = -0.19). This result is consistent with a Bayesian observer model, in which individual differences in the precision of perceptual representation influences the magnitude of adaptation bias.",

However, the relationship between voluntary and involuntary phantom vision remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated two forms of visual phantom color, neon phantom color spreading and voluntary color mental imagery and their effect on subsequent binocular rivalry perception. Passively viewing neon phantom color induced time sensitive, suppressive effects on spatially non-overlapping subsequent binocular rivalry. These effects could be attenuated by rotating the color-inducers, or like color imagery, by concurrent uniform luminance stimulation. The degree of neon color induced rivalry suppression predicted the degree of voluntary color imagery facilitation, both on subsequent rivalry perception. Further, these suppressive and facilitative effects were additive when experienced successively. Our results suggest potential sensory mechanistic commonalities between voluntary and involuntary phantom vision.",

Here we report that the claustrum, a poorly understood subcortical neural structure, coordinates neocortical slow-wave generation. We established a transgenic mouse line allowing genetic and electrophysiological interrogation of a subpopulation of claustral glutamatergic neurons. These claustral excitatory neurons received inputs from glutamatergic neurons in a large neocortical network. Optogenetic activation of claustral neurons in vitro induced excitatory post-synaptic responses in most neocortical neurons, but elicited action potentials primarily in inhibitory interneurons. Optogenetic activation of claustral neurons in vivo induced a Down-state featuring a prolonged silencing of neural acticity in all layers of many cortical areas, followed by a globally synchronized Down-to-Up state transition. These results demonstrate a crucial role of the claustrum in synchronizing inhibitory interneurons across the neocortex for spatiotemporal coordination of brain state. Thus, the claustrum is a major subcortical hub for the synchronization of neocortical slow-wave activity.",

However, assembling highly heterozygous genomes is still facing a major problem where the two haplotypes for a region are highly polymorphic and the synteny is not recognised during assembly. This causes issues with downstream analysis, for example variant discovery using the haploid assembly, or haplotype reconstruction using the diploid assembly. A new pipeline--Purge Haplotigs--was developed specifically for third-gen assemblies to identify and reassign the duplicate contigs. The pipeline takes a draft haplotype-fused assembly or a diploid assembly, and read alignments to produce an improved assembly. The pipeline was tested on a simulated dataset and on four recent diploid (phased) de novo assemblies from third-generation long-read sequencing.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases. However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells.\\n\\nTo this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data.\\n\\nOverall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohns disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (prs102275=1.44e-20, prs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p<0.05).\\n\\nIn summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR- 3614-5p in autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "While Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, complex combinations of the underlying pathologies have led to evolved concepts in clinical and neuropathological criteria in the past decade. Pathological AD can be decomposed into subsets of individuals with significantly different antemortem cognitive decline rates. Using transcriptome as a proxy for functional state, we preselected 414 expression profiles of clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and age matched non-demented controls sampled from a large community based neuropathological study. By combining brain tissue specific protein interactome with gene network, we identify functionally distinct composite clusters of genes which reveal extensive changes in expression levels in AD. The average global expression for clusters corresponding to synaptic transmission, metabolism, cell cycle, survival and immune response were downregulated while the upregulated cluster had a large set of uncharacterized pathways and processes that may constitute an AD specific phenotypic signature. We identified four master regulators across all clusters of differentially expressed genes by enrichment analysis including TGIF1 and EGR3. These transcription factors have previously not been associated with AD and were validated in brain tissue samples from an independent AD cohort. We identify TGIF1, a transcriptional repressor as being neuroprotective in AD by activating co-repressors regulating genes critical for DNA repair, maintaining homeostasis and arresting cell cycle. In addition, we show that loss of EGR3 regulation, mediates synaptic deficits by targeting the synaptic vesicle cycle. Collectively, our results highlight the utility of integrating protein interactions with gene perturbations to generate a comprehensive framework for characterizing the alterations in molecular network as applied to AD.",

    "abstract": "Existing functional description of genes are categorical, discrete, and mostly through manual process. In this work, we explore the idea of gene embedding, distributed representation of genes, in the spirit of word embedding. From a pure data-driven fashion, we trained a 300 dimension vector representation of all human genes, using gene co-expression patterns in 984 data sets from the GEO databases. These vectors capture functional relatedness of genes in terms of recovering known pathways - the average inner product (similarity) of genes within a pathway is 1.68X greater than that of random genes. Using t-SNE, we produced a gene co-expression map that shows local concentrations of tissue specific genes. We also illustrated the usefulness of the embedded gene vectors, laden with rich information on gene co-expression patterns, in tasks such as gene-gene interaction prediction. Overall, we believe that this distributed representation of genes may be useful for more bioinformatics applications.",

    "abstract": "Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been revealed as crucial modulators in tumor metastasis and target therapy, our understanding of their roles in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and Sunitinib treatment is limited. Here, We focused on 2 published microarray data to select out our anchored miRNA which was downregulated after Sunitinib treatment while upregulated in metastasis RCC tissues. Then we discovered that treating with Sunitinib, the targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), inhibited renal cell migration and invasion via attenuating the expression of miR-452-5p. The novel identified miR-452-5p was upregulated and associated with poor prognosis in RCC. Preclinical studies using multiple RCC cells and xenografts model illustrated that miR-452-5p could promote RCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, P65 could directly bind to the miR-452-5p promoter and thus transcriptionally induce miR-452-5p expression, which led to post-transcriptionally abrogate SMAD4 expression, thus inhibition of its downstream signals including SMAD7 and EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) associated genes. Our study presented a road map for targeting this newly identified miR-452-5p and its SMAD4/SMAD7/EMT signals pathway, which imparted a new potential therapeutic strategy for mRCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is an agricultural pest of solanaceous crops which has developed insecticide resistance at an alarming rate. Up to this point, little consideration has been given to unintended, or inadvertent effects that non-insecticide xenobiotics may have on insecticide susceptibility in L. decemlineata. Fungicides, such as chlorothalonil and boscalid, are often used to control fungal pathogens in potato fields and are applied at regular intervals when L. decemlineata populations are present in the crop. In order to determine whether fungicide use may be associated with elevated levels of insecticide resistance in L. decemlineata, we examined phenotypic responses in L. decemlineata to the fungicides chlorothalonil and boscalid. Using enzymatic and transcript abundance investigations we also examined modes of molecular detoxification in response to both insecticide (imidacloprid) and fungicide (boscalid and chlorothalonil) application to more specifically determine if fungicides and insecticides induce similar metabolic detoxification mechanisms. Both chlorothalonil and boscalid exposure induced a phenotypic, enzymatic and transcript response in L. decemlineata which correlates with known mechanisms of insecticide resistance.\\n\\nKey MessagesO_LIPrior-exposure to a fungicidal application changes the phenotypic response of Leptinotarsa decemlineata to the insecticide imidacloprid\\nC_LIO_LIBoth a fungicide and insecticide application activates similar molecular mechanisms of detoxification in Leptinotarsa decemlineata\\nC_LIO_LIFungicidal xenobiotics may contribute to insecticide resistance in Leptinotarsa decemlineata\\nC_LI\\n\\nAuthor Contribution StatementJC, SS, CB, AH, and RG conceived and designed research.

Recently, evidence from ancient DNA has brought new insights into migration events that could be linked to the advent of agriculture, and possibly to the spread of Indo-European languages. However, little is known so far about the ancient population history of north-eastern Europe, in particular about populations speaking Uralic languages, such as Finns and Saami. Here we analyse ancient genomic data from 11 individuals from Finland and Northwest Russia. We show that the specific genetic makeup of northern Europe traces back to migrations from Siberia that began at least 3,500 years ago. This ancestry was subsequently admixed into many modern populations in the region, in particular populations speaking Uralic languages today. In addition, we show that ancestors of modern Saami inhabited a larger territory during the Iron Age than today, which adds to historical and linguistic evidence for the population history of Finland.",

    "abstract": "There has been long-standing speculation that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves an increase in excitation relative to inhibition. However, there is little direct evidence of increased neural excitation in humans with ASD. Here we provide a potential explanation for this discrepancy: we show that increased neural excitation emerges only after repeated stimulation, manifesting as a deficit in neural adaptation. We measured fMRI responses induced by repeated audio-visual stimulation and button presses in early sensory-motor cortical areas. Across all cortical areas we show reduced adaptation in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical individuals. The degree of adaptation is correlated between cortical areas and with button-press reaction times across subjects. These findings suggest that increased neural excitation in ASD, manifesting as dysregulated neural adaptation, is domain-general and behaviorally-relevant.",

    "abstract": "EGY2 is a zinc - containing, intramembrane protease, located in the thylakoid membrane. It is consider to be involved in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis - a mechanism leading to activation of membrane-anchored transcription factors through proteolytic cleavage, which causes them to be released from the membrane. The physiological functions of EGY2 in chloroplasts remains poorly understood. To answer the question what is the significance of EGY2 in chloroplast functioning two T-DNA insertion lines devoid of EGY2 protein were obtained and the mutants phenotype and photosystem II parameters were analyzed. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements revealed that the lack of EGY2 protease caused changes in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and minimum fluorescence yield (F0) as well as higher sensitivity of photosystem II (PSII) to photoinhibition. Further immunoblot analysis revealed significant changes in the accumulation levels of the three chloroplast-encoded PSII core apoproteins: PsbA (D1) and PsbD (D2) forming the PSII reaction centre and PsbC - a protein component of CP43, a part of inner PSII antennae. The accumulation level of nuclear-encoded proteins Lhcb1-3 - a components of the major light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) as well as proteins forming minor peripheral antennae complexes, namely Lhcb4 (CP29), Lhcb5 (CP26), and Lhcb6 (CP24) remain, however, unchanged. The lack of EGY2 led to a significant increase in the level of PsbA (D1) with simultaneous decrease in accumulation levels of PsbC (CP43) and PsbD (D2). To test the hypothesis that the observed changes in the abundance of chloroplast-encoded proteins are a consequence of changes in gene expression levels, real-time PCR was performed. The obtained results shown that egy2 mutants display an increased expression of PSBA and reduction in the PSBD and PSBC genes. Simultaneously pTAC10, pTAC16 and FLN1 proteins were found to accumulate in thylakoid membranes of analyzed mutant lines. These proteins interact with core complex of plastid encoded RNA polymerase and may be involved in the regulation of chloroplast gene expression.",

However, no data exists on whether RsMYB1 is involved in the mechanism that leads to abiotic stress tolerance. Under normal conditions, transgenic petunia plants expressing RsMYB1 and WT were able to thrive by producing well-developed broad leaves and regular roots. In contrast, a reduction in plant growth was observed when they were exposed to heavy metals (CuSO4, ZnSO4, MnSO4, and K2Cr2O7). However, RsMYB1-overexpressing plants were found to be more tolerant to the stresses than the WT plants because the expressions of stress tolerant genes (GSH and PCs) and antioxidant genes (SOD, CAT, and POX) were enhanced. In addition, according to the phylogenetic analysis, RsMYB1 has a strong sequence similarity with other MYB TFs that confer different abiotic stresses. These results suggest that overexpression of RsMYB1 enhances the expression levels of metal-induced stress tolerance genes and antioxidant genes, and the resultant increase in gene expression improves heavy metal stress tolerance in petunia.",

Universal method of sex determination has not yet been developed. Most of known methods are not sufficiently accurate, or used at a relatively late age, or difficult to use. Perfect early determination of sex is considered to be impossible. Because of the dark color of most sturgeon, important morphological differences, which fish of almost all ages have, were overlooked. We first found that the scute structure of Sterlet and Siberian sturgeon depends on the sex, such a pattern is typical for sturgeon of all ages. We found that sex determination is possible at very early stages. Dependencies found with the help of machine learning method open a possibility for creation of sex determination equipment using the artificial intelligence. Our results open a perspective for creation of the sex determination methods for other 23 sturgeon species, which can increase the efficiency of caviar aquaculture and sturgeon restoration in natural waters.",

While notable success has been reached in the field of tissue clarification and confocal imaging to obtain high-fidelity maps of three-dimensional neuron organization, neuron segmentation is still far away of ground-truth and manual segmentation performed by experts may be needed. The need of an expert is in part related to the limited success of the algorithms and tools performing single-neuron segmentation from 3D microscopic image data available in the State of Art, in part to the non-complete information given by these methods, which typically perform neuron tracing and thus limit the interpret-ability of results.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, a novel algorithm for segmenting single neurons in their own arrangement within the brain is presented. The algorithm performs a region growing procedure with local thresholds based on the pixel intensity statistics typical of confocal acquisitions of biological samples and described by a mixture model. The algorithm is developed and tested on 3D confocal datasets obtained from clarified tissues. We compare the result of our algorithm with those obtained by manual segmentation performed by 6 different experts in terms of neuron surface area, volume and Sholl profiles. Statistical analysis performed on morphologic features extracted from the segmented structures confirms the feasibility of our approach.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe Smart Region Growing (SmRG) algorithm used in the analysis along with test confocal image stacks is available on request to the authors.\\n\\nContactalejandrocallara@gmail.com\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available on request to the authors.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DV) is a compact, icoshedrally symmetric, enveloped particle, covered by 90 dimers of envelope protein (E), which mediates viral attachment and membrane fusion. Fusion requires a dimer-to-trimer transition and membrane engagement of hydrophobic \\\"fusion loops\\\". We previously characterized the steps in membrane fusion for the related West Nile virus (WNV), using recombinant, WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) for single-particle experiments. Trimerization and membrane engagement are rate-limiting; fusion requires at least two adjacent trimers; availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane creates a trimerization bottleneck. We have extended that work to dengue VLPs, from all four DV serotypes, finding an essentially similar mechanism. Small-molecule inhibitors of DV infection that target E block its fusion-inducing conformation change. We show that [~]15 bound molecules per particle ([~]8.5 % occupancy) completely prevent fusion, in accord with the proposed mechanism and the likely inhibitor binding site on E.\\n\\nImpact statementSingle-particle studies of dengue-virus membrane fusion and the effect of small-molecule inhibitors of infection clarify the viral fusion mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions between species such as pollination and plant-mycorrhiza interactions are ubiquitous in nature and essential for ecosystem functioning. Often dozens or even hundreds of species with different degree of specialization form complex networks of interdependence. How the complexity evolved and is maintained are fundamental questions in ecology. Here, we present a new game theoretical approach to model complex mutualistic interactions, which we apply to pollination networks. The theoretical analysis revealed multiple evolutionary stable network structures that form a gradient from generalism toward specialism with increasing availability of pollination service. In particular, we found that efficient communities evolve only under pollination oversupply, but that pollination shortage selects for inefficient network structures due to a pollination dilemma. These results suggest that availability of pollination services is a key factor structuring pollination networks and offer a new explanation for the geographical differences in pollination faunas that have long been recognized by ecologists. The study bridges the gap between network studies, game theory, and the natural history of pollination, which have hitherto been studied largely independently.",

    "abstract": "We propose the Evolutionary Moulding hypothesis that population diversities of partners in nitrogen-fixing rhizobium-legume symbiosis are matched, and tested it in nucleotide polymorphism of symbiotic genes encoding two components of the plant-bacteria signalling system. The first component is the rhizobial nodA acyltransferase involved in the fatty acid tail decoration of Nod factor (rhizobia signalling molecule). The second component is the plant NFR5 receptor, putatively required for Nod-factor binding.\\n\\nWe collected three wild growing legume species together with soil samples adjacent to the roots (soil pool) from one large 25-year fallow: Vicia sativa, Lathyrus pratensis and Trifolium hybridum nodulated by one of the two Rhizobium leguminosarum biovars (viciae and trifolii). For each plant species we prepared three pools for DNA extraction: the plant pool (30 plant indiv.), the nodule pool (90 nodules) and the soil pool (30 samples). NFR5 gene libraries from the plant pool and nodA gene libraries from nodule and soil pools were sequenced by Sanger technology and High-throughput pyrosequencing, respectively. Analysis of the data demonstrated concordance in population diversities of one symbiotic partner (rhizobia) the second partner (legume host), in line with the Evolutionary Moulding hypothesis. This effect was evinced by the following observations for each plant species: (1) significantly increased diversity in the nodule nodA popset (set of gene sequences derived from the nodule population) compared to the soil popset; (2) a monotonic relationship between the diversity in the plant NFR5 gene popset and the nodule rhizobial nodA gene popset; and (3) higher topological similarity of the NFR5 gene tree with the nodA gene tree of the nodule popset, than with the nodA gene tree of the soil popset. Both nonsynonymous diversity and Tajimas D were increased in the nodule popsets compared to the soil popsets, consistent with relaxation of negative selection and/or admixture of balancing selection underlying the Evolutionary Moulding effect. We propose that the observed genetic concordance arises from the selection of particular characteristics of the nodule nodA genes by the host plant.",

In public health, sequence data is used to reconstruct the evolution of pathogens, anticipate future spread, and target interventions. In clinical settings whole genome sequences identify pathogens at the strain level, can be used to predict phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence, and inform treatment by linking to closely related cases. However, the vast majority of sequence data are only used for specific narrow applications such as typing. Comprehensive analysis of these data could provide detailed insight into outbreak dynamics, but is not routinely done since fast, robust, and interpretable analysis work-flows are not in place.

    "abstract": "Replication stress is a primary threat to genome stability and has been implicated in tumorigenesis1, 2. Common fragile sites (CFSs) are loci hypersensitive to replication stress3 and are hotspots for chromosomal rearrangements in cancers4. CFSs replicate late in S-phase3, are cell-type dependent4-6 and nest within very large genes4, 7-9. The mechanisms responsible for CFS instability are still discussed, notably the relative impact of transcription-replication conflicts7, 8, 10 versus their low density in replication initiation events5, 6. Here we address the relationships between transcription, replication, gene size and instability by manipulating the transcription of three endogenous large genes, two in chicken and one in human cells. Remarkably, moderate transcription destabilises large genes whereas high transcription levels alleviate their instability. Replication dynamics analyses showed that transcription quantitatively shapes the replication program of large genes, setting both their initiation profile and their replication timing as well as regulating internal fork velocity. Noticeably, high transcription levels advance the replication time of large genes from late to mid S-phase, which most likely gives cells more time to complete replication before mitotic entry. Transcription can therefore contribute to maintaining the integrity of some difficult-to-replicate loci, challenging the dominant view that it is exclusively a threat to genome stability.",

This database, and analysis has been made available through an open-access web-server, miRiam, to promote further exploration.\\n\\nHere we report that expression of genes involved in Apoptosis Processes, Immune System Processes, Translation Regulator Activities, and Molecular Transport Activities within the cell are predominately regulated by miRNA mediation. Our findings further indicate that this regulatory effect has a profound effect in controlling protein crowding inside the cell. A miRNA mediated gene expression regulation serves as a temporal regulator, allowing the cellular machinery to temporarily  pause the translation of mRNA, indicating that the miRNA-mRNA interactions may be important for governing the optimal usage of cell volume.",

We discovered an age-dependent, possibly senescence-related transition of haustorial shape that occurred significantly earlier and at higher frequency in the CSG mutants.

Thirty young adults (half APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers, the other half APOE-{varepsilon}3{varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}2{varepsilon}3; mean age 20 years) were scanned using both diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tractography was used to quantify the microstructure (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional anisotropy, FA) of the parahippocampal cingulum bundle (PHCB), which links pDMN and the medial temporal lobe. APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers had lower MD and higher FA relative to non-carriers in PHCB. Further, PHCB microstructure was selectively associated with pDMN activity during a scene discrimination task known to be sensitive to Alzheimers disease (AD). These findings are consistent with a lifespan view of AD risk, where early-life structural and functional brain changes in specific, vulnerable networks leads to increased neural activity that may ultimately trigger amyloid-{beta} deposition.",

Inhibitory cell types contribute to brain function in distinct ways but recording from specific, inhibitory cell types during behaviour to determine their contributions is difficult. In particular, the in vivo activities of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneuron specific 3 (IS3) cells in the hippocampus that only target other inhibitory cells are unknown at present. We perform a massive, computational exploration of possible synaptic inputs to IS3 cells using multi-compartment models and optimized synaptic parameters. We find that asynchronous in vivo-like states that are sensitive to additional theta-timed inputs exist when excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances are equally balanced and there are low amounts of correlated inputs. Thus, using a generally applicable computational approach we predict the existence of balanced states in hippocampal circuits during rhythmic activities.",

    "abstract": "The roles and regulatory mechanisms of transriptome changes during aging are unclear. It has been proposed that the transcriptome suffers decay during aging owing to age-associated down-regulation of transcription factors. In this study, we characterized the role of a transcription factor DAF-16, which is a highly conserved lifespan regulator, in the normal aging process of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that DAF-16 translocates into the nucleus in aged wild-type worms and activates the expression of hundreds of genes in response to age-associated cellular stress. Most of the age-dependent DAF-16 targets are different from the canonical DAF-16 targets downstream of insulin signaling, indicating that activation of DAF-16 during aging is not due to reduced insulin signaling from DAF-2. Further analysis showed that it is due to the loss of proteostasis during aging, at least in part. We also found that without daf-16, dramatic gene expression changes occur as early as on adult day 2, indicating that DAF-16 acts to stabilize the transcriptome during normal aging. Our results thus reveal that normal aging is not simply a process in which the gene expression program descends into chaos due to loss of regulatory activities; rather, there is active transcriptional regulation that fights aging.",

In order to understand the development and evolution of this structure, transcriptomes were produced in de novo assemblies from the developing pre-pupal head tissues of two distantly related curculionids, the rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) and the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), which have highly divergent rostra.

RNA interference was performed with S. oryzae for functional insight into the Hox gene Sex combs reduced.

We further divide the sexually active population into diagnosed or undiagnosed infected individuals. We define model parameters for both the national and the urban case. These parameter sets are used to study the predicted population dynamics over the next 5 years. Our results indicate that the undiagnosed high risk infected group is the largest contributor to the epidemic. Finally, we apply a preventative medication protocol to the susceptible population and observe the effective reduction in the infected population. The simulations suggest that preventative medication effectiveness extends outside of the group that is taking the drug (herd immunity). Our models suggest that a strategy targeting the high risk undiagnosed infected group would have the largest impact in the next 5 years. We also find that such a protocol has similar effects for the national as the urban case, despite the smaller sexual network found in rural areas.",

The intermediate is pre-organized because of the constraints of base-pairing with the template and hydrogen bonding between the imidazole amino group and both flanking phosphates. Our results provide atomic-resolution insight into the mechanism of nonenzymatic primer extension, and set the stage for further structural dissection and optimization of the RNA copying process.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that primary hepatocytes cultured in vitro undergo a rapid loss of function. On the other hand, in the clinic, drug induced liver injury typically manifests 5 days to 3 months after starting a medication. Thus, novel approaches that can maintain the function of primary human hepatocytes for longer durations of time may enable the development of improved in vitro assays for detecting hepatotoxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that two-dimensional micro-patterning of hepatocytes with fibroblasts leads to improved maintenance of the hepatocyte phenotype relative to hepatocyte monocultures, in serum containing medium. Additionally, we, and others, have shown that three-dimensional culture of hepatocytes leads to enhanced function (in serum-free medium). In this study we wanted to (i) examine the effect of combining the above two approaches on hepatocyte function, and (ii) to further delineate the effect of serum on hepatocyte function. We developed a user-friendly and inexpensive approach for constructing layered spheroids. Similar to previous results in two-dimensional (2d) culture, we observed that 3d culture of hepatocytes alone (i.e. monoculture) in serum-containing medium led to an increase in the urea production rate, but near-complete loss of cytochrome activity in both lots of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) tested. In serum-free sandwich culture, cytochrome activity was maintained at the level observed in freshly thawed PHH for one lot, but almost completely lost in another lot. Spheroid culture of both lots of PHH in serum-free medium led to maintenance of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity at the fresh thaw level, though CYP2B6 activity was reduced. In contrast to PHH monoculture, co-cultures of PHH with NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells benefitted from the presence of serum, and led to 3-5-fold increases in CYP activity relative to even serum-free spheroid monocultures. Layering of the fibroblasts did not result in improvements over mixed co-cultures. These results indicate the importance of appropriate serum-free monoculture control experiments in the evaluation of novel biomaterials and techniques for hepatocyte co-culture. Further, urea production and cytochrome production are decoupled; therefore, urea production is an insufficient readout when developing models for pharmaceutical applications.",

    "abstract": "Exposing cells to an unconventional sequence of physical cues can reveal subtleties of cellular sensing and response mechanisms. We investigated the mechanoresponse of cyclically-stretched fibroblasts under a spatially non-uniform strain field which was subjected to repeated changes in stretching directions over 55 hours. A polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic stretcher array optimized for complex staining procedures and imaging was developed to generate biologically relevant strain and strain gradient amplitudes. We demonstrated that cells can successfully reorient themselves repeatedly, as the main cyclical stretching direction is consecutively switched between two perpendicular directions every 11 hours. Importantly, from one reorientation to the next, the extent to which cells reorient themselves perpendicularly to the local strain direction progressively decreases, while their tendency to align perpendicularly to the strain gradient direction tends to increase. We demonstrate that these results are consistent with our finding that cellular responses to strains and strain gradients occur on two distinct time scales, the latter being slower. Overall, our results reveal the absence of major irreversible cellular changes that compromise the ability to sense and reorient to changing strain directions under the conditions of this experiment. On the other hand, we show how the history of strain field dynamics can influence the cellular realignment behavior, due to the interplay of complex time-dependent responses.",

    "abstract": "The meiotic spindle in oocytes is assembled in the absence of centrosomes, the major microtubule nucleation sites in mitotic and male meiotic cells. A crucial, yet unresolved question in meiosis is how spindle microtubules are generated without centrosomes and only around chromosomes in the large volume of oocytes. Here we report a novel oocyte-specific microtubule nucleation pathway that is essential for assembling most spindle microtubules complementarily with the Augmin pathway, and sufficient for triggering microtubule assembly in oocytes. This pathway is mediated by the kinesin-6 Subito/MKlp2, which recruits the {gamma}-tubulin complex to the spindle equator to nucleate microtubules in Drosophila oocytes. Away from chromosomes, Subito interaction with the {gamma}-tubulin complex is suppressed by its N-terminal region to prevent ectopic microtubule assembly in oocytes. We further demonstrate that the Subito complex from ovaries can nucleate microtubules from pure tubulin dimers in vitro. Taken together, microtubule nucleation regulated by Subito drives spatially restricted spindle assembly in oocytes.",

    "abstract": "Female gamete production relies on coordinated molecular and cellular processes that occur in the ovary throughout oogenesis. In fish, as in other vertebrates, these processes have been extensively studied both in terms of endocrine/paracrine regulation and protein expression and activity. The role of small non-coding RNAs in the regulation of animal reproduction remains however largely unknown and poorly investigated, despite a growing interest for the importance of miRNAs in a wide variety of biological processes. Here, we analyzed the role of miR-202, a miRNA predominantly expressed in male and female gonads in several vertebrate species. We studied its expression in the medaka ovary and generated a mutant line (using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering) to determine its importance for reproductive success with special interest for egg production. Our results show that miR-202-5p is the biologically active form of the miRNA and that it is expressed in granulosa cells and in the unfertilized egg. The knock out (KO) of miR-202 resulted in a strong phenotype both in terms of number and quality of eggs produced. Mutant females exhibited either no egg production or produced a drastically reduced number of eggs that could not be fertilized, ultimately leading to no reproductive success. We quantified the size distribution of the oocytes in the ovary of KO females and performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis approach to identified dysregulated molecular pathways. Together, cellular and molecular analyses indicate that lack of miR-202 impairs the early steps of oogenesis/folliculogenesis and decreases the number of large (i.e. vitellogenic) follicles, ultimately leading to dramatically reduced female fecundity. This study sheds new light on the regulatory mechanisms that control the early steps of follicular development and provides the first in vivo functional evidence that an ovarian-predominant microRNA may have a major role in female reproduction.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe role of small non-coding RNAs in the regulation of animal reproduction remains poorly investigated, despite a growing interest for the importance of miRNAs in a wide variety of biological processes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe diverse array of phenotypes and lekking behaviors in birds-of-paradise have long excited scientists and laymen alike. Remarkably, almost nothing is known about the genomics underlying this iconic radiation. Currently, there are 41 recognized species of birds-of-paradise, most of which live on the islands of New Guinea. In this study we sequenced genomes of representatives from all five major clades recognized within the birds-of-paradise family (Paradisaeidae). Our aim was to characterize genomic changes that may have been important for the evolution of the groups extensive phenotypic diversity.\\n\\nResultsWe sequenced three de novo genomes and re-sequenced two additional genomes representing all major clades within the birds-of-paradise. We found genes important for coloration, morphology and feather development to be under positive selection. GO enrichment of positively selected genes on the branch leading to the birds-of-paradise shows an enrichment for collagen, glycogen synthesis and regulation, eye development and other categories. In the core birds-of-paradise, we found GO categories for  startle response (response to predators) and  olfactory receptor activity to be enriched among the gene families expanding significantly faster compared to the other birds in our study. Furthermore, we found novel families of retrovirus-like retrotransposons active in all three de novo genomes since the early diversification of the birds-of-paradise group, which could have potentially played a role in the evolution of this fascinating group of birds.\\n\\nConclusionHere we provide a first glimpse into the genomic changes underlying the evolution of birds-of-paradise. Our aim was to use comparative genomics to study to what degree the genomic landscape of birds-of-paradise deviates from other closely related passerine birds. Given the extreme phenotypic diversity in this family, our prediction was that genomes should be able to reveal features important for the evolution of this amazing radiation. Overall, we found a strong signal for evolution on mechanisms important for coloration, morphology, sensory systems, as well as genome structure.",

    "abstract": "In order to exploit the specific vulnerabilities of tumors, it is urgent to identify the basis of associated defects in genome maintenance. One unsolved problem is the mechanism of inhibition of processing of DNA double-strand break repair by REV7 and its influence on DNA repair pathways. We searched for REV7-associated proteins in human cells and found FAM35A, a protein of previously unknown function. By analyzing the FAM35A sequence we discovered that FAM35A has an unstructured N-terminal region and a C-terminal region harboring three OB-fold domains similar to single-stranded binding protein RPA. Knockdown of FAM35A caused sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and FAM35A re-localized in damaged cell nuclei. In a BRCA1 mutant cell line, however, depletion of FAM35A increased resistance to camptothecin, suggesting that FAM35A participates in processing of DNA ends to allow more efficient DNA repair. Moreover, we found FAM35A absent in one widely used BRCA1-mutant cancer cell line (HCC1937) with anomalous resistance to PARP inhibitors. A survey of FAM35A alterations in cancer revealed that the gene is altered at the highest frequency in prostate cancers (up to 13%) and significantly less expressed in metastatic cases. The results reveal a new DNA repair factor with promise as a therapeutically relevant cancer marker.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphMitochondria are a network of critical intracellular organelles with diverse functions ranging from energy production to cell signaling. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) consists of 37 genes that support oxidative phosphorylation and are prone to dysfunction that can lead to currently untreatable diseases. Further characterization of mtDNA gene function and creation of more accurate models of human disease will require the ability to engineer precise genomic sequence modifications. To date, mtDNA has been inaccessible to direct modification using traditional genome engineering tools due to unique DNA repair contexts in mitochondria1. Here, we report a new DNA modification process using sequence-specific transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins to manipulate mtDNA in vivo and in vitro for reverse genetics applications. First, we show mtDNA deletions can be induced in Danio rerio (zebrafish) using site-directed mitoTALE-nickases (mito-nickases). Using this approach, the protein-encoding mtDNA gene nd4 was deleted in injected zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, this DNA engineering system recreated a large deletion spanning from nd5 to atp8, which is commonly found in human diseases like Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and Pearson syndrome. Enrichment of mtDNA-deleted genomes was achieved using targeted mitoTALE-nucleases (mitoTALENs) by co-delivering both mito-nickases and mitoTALENs into zebrafish embryos. This combined approach yielded deletions in over 90% of injected animals, which were maintained through adulthood in various tissues. Subsequently, we confirmed that large, targeted deletions could be induced with this approach in human cells. In addition, we show that, when provided with a single nick on the mtDNA light strand, the binding of a terminal TALE protein alone at the intended recombination site is sufficient for deletion induction. This \\\"block and nick\\\" approach yielded engineered mitochondrial molecules with single nucleotide precision using two different targeted deletion sites. This precise seeding method to engineer mtDNA variants is a critical step for the exploration of mtDNA function and for creating new cellular and animal models of mitochondrial disease.",

The genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) approach can characterize the landscape of 3D genome organization by measuring interaction frequencies between all genomic regions. Hi-C protocol improvements and rapid advances in DNA sequencing power have made Hi-C useful to diverse biological systems, not only to elucidate the role of 3D genome structure in proper cellular function, but also to characterize genomic rearrangements, assemble new genomes, and consider chromatin interactions as potential biomarkers for diseases. Yet, the Hi-C protocol is still complex and subject to variations at numerous steps that can affect the resulting data. Thus, there is still a need for better understanding and control of factors that contribute to Hi-C experiment success and data quality. Here, we evaluate recently proposed Hi-C protocol modifications as well as often overlooked variables in sample preparation and examine their effects on Hi-C data quality. We examine artifacts that can occur during Hi-C library preparation, including microhomology-based artificial template copying and chimera formation that can add noise to the downstream data. Exploring the mechanisms underlying Hi-C artifacts pinpoints steps that should be further optimized in the future.

To address the role of sensory information in the neural representation of concepts, we investigated how people born blind process concepts whose referents are imperceptible to them because of their visual nature (e.g. \\\"rainbow\\\", or \\\"red\\\"). We find that the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (ATL) shows preference both to typical abstract concepts (\\\"freedom\\\") and to concepts whose referents are not sensorially-available to the blind (\\\"rainbow\\\"), as compared to partially sensorially-perceptible referents (e.g. \\\"rain\\\"). Activation pattern similarity in dorsal ATL is related to the sensorial-accessibility ratings of the concepts in the blind. Parts of inferior-lateral aspects of ATL and the temporal pole responded preferentially to abstract concepts devoid of any external referents (\\\"freedom\\\") relative to imperceptible objects, in effect distinguishing between object and non-object concepts. The medial ATL showed a preference for concrete concepts (\\\"cup\\\"), along with a preference for partly perceptible items to the blind (\\\"rain\\\", as compared with \\\"rainbow\\\"), indicating this regions role in representing concepts with sensory referents beyond vision.

The pathway is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease, chronic pain, inflammation, and cancer. NGF binds the extracellular domain of TrkA, leading to the activation of the receptors intracellular kinase domain. TrkA signaling is highly dynamic, thus mechanistic studies would benefit from a tool with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we present the design and evaluation of four strategies for light-inducible activation of TrkA in the absence of NGF. Our strategies involve the light-sensitive protein Arabidopsis cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) and its binding partner CIB1. We demonstrate successful recapitulation of native NGF/TrkA functions by optical induction of plasma membrane recruitment and homo-interaction of the intracellular domain of TrkA. This approach activates PI3K/AKT and Raf/ERK signaling pathways, promotes neurite growth in PC12 cells, and supports the survival of dorsal root ganglion neurons in the absence of NGF. This ability to activate TrkA using light bestows high spatial and temporal resolution for investigating NGF/TrkA signaling.",

While microbiota exposure is required for normal behavior in mammals, it is not known how widely this dependency is present in other animal species. We proposed the hypothesis that the microbiome has a major influence on the behavior of the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster), a major invertebrate model organism. Several assays were used to test the contribution of the microbiome on some well-characterized behaviors: defensive behavior, sleep, locomotion, and courtship in microbe-bearing, control flies and two generations of germ-free animals. None of the behaviors were largely influenced by the absence of a microbiome, and the small or moderate effects were not generalizable between replicates and/or generations. These results refute the hypothesis, indicating that the Drosophila microbiome does not have a major influence over several behaviors fundamental to the animals survival and reproduction. The impact of commensal microbes on animal behaviour may not be broadly conserved.",

    "abstract": "We used transient biochemical and structural kinetics to elucidate the molecular mechanism of mavacamten, an allosteric cardiac myosin inhibitor and prospective treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We find that mavacamten stabilizes an auto-inhibited state of two-headed cardiac myosin, not found in the isolated S1 myosin motor fragment. We determined this by measuring cardiac myosin actin-activated and actin-independent ATPase and single ATP turnover kinetics. A two-headed myosin fragment exhibits distinct auto-inhibited ATP turnover kinetics compared to a single-headed fragment. Mavacamten enhanced this auto-inhibition. It also enhanced auto-inhibition of ADP release. Furthermore, actin changes the structure of the auto-inhibited state by forcing myosin lever-arm rotation. Mavacamten slows this rotation in two-headed myosin but does not prevent it. We conclude that cardiac myosin is regulated in solution by an interaction between its two heads and propose that mavacamten stabilizes this state.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSmall-molecule allosteric effectors designed to target and modulate striated and smooth myosin isoforms for the treatment of disease show promise in preclinical and clinical trials. Beta-cardiac myosin is an especially important target, as heart disease remains a primary cause of death in the U.S. One prevalent type of heart disease is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is hypothesized to result from dysregulated force generation by cardiac myosin. Mavacamten is a potent cardiac myosin ATPase activity inhibitor that improves cardiac output in HCM animal models. Our results show that mavacamten selectively stabilizes a two-head dependent, auto-inhibited state of cardiac myosin in solution. The kinetics and energetics of this state are consistent with the auto-inhibited super-relaxed state, previously only observed in intact sarcomeres.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have challenged the prevailing dogma that transcription is repressed during mitosis. Transcription was also proposed to sustain the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) for several hours in response to unattached kinetochores. Here we used live-cell imaging of human cells in culture, combined with RNA-seq and qPCR, to investigate the requirement for de novo transcription during mitosis. Under conditions of persistently unattached kinetochores, transcription inhibition with actinomycin D, or treatment with other DNA-intercalating drugs, delocalized the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) protein Aurora B from centromeres, compromising SAC robustness and cell fate. However, we were unable to detect significant changes in transcript levels. Moreover, inhibition of transcription independently of DNA intercalation had no effect on SAC response, mitotic progression, exit or death. Mechanistically, we show that DNA intercalating agents reduce the interaction of the CPC with nucleosomes. Thus, the capacity of human cells to progress, sustain, exit or die in mitosis relies on centromere integrity, rather than de novo transcription.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter infections are among the leading bacterial causes of diarrhea and of  environmental enteropathy (EE) and growth failure worldwide. However, the lack of an inexpensive small animal model of enteric disease with Campylobacter has been a major limitation for understanding its pathogenesis, interventions or vaccine development. We describe a robust standard mouse model that can exhibit reproducible bloody diarrhea or growth failure, depending on the zinc or protein deficient diet and on antibiotic alteration of normal microbiota prior to infection. Zinc deficiency and the use of antibiotics create a niche for Campylobacter infection to establish by narrowing the metabolic flexibility of these mice for pathogen clearance and by promoting intestinal and systemic inflammation. Several biomarkers and intestinal pathology in this model also mimic those seen in human disease. This model provides a novel tool to testing specific hypotheses regarding disease pathogenesis as well as vaccine development that is currently in progress.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCampylobacter jejuni has been identified as one of the leading causes of enteropathy and diarrhea. In developing countries, these repeated enteric infections often result in growth deficits and cognitive impairment. There is a lack of small animal models of Campylobacter infection. This is a major hurdle in understanding the pathogenesis of Campylobacter infection in order to lead to therapeutic treatments and vaccines. We have developed a highly reproducible mouse model of Campylobacter infection that has clinical outcomes that match those of malnourished children. We hope that these insights into Campylobacter susceptibility will lead to the development of treatments against this major cause of diarrheal illness.",
