    "abstract": "Animals must integrate the activity of multiple mechanoreceptors to navigate complex environments. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the general roles of the mechanosensory neurons have been defined, but most studies involve end-point or single-time-point measurements, and thus lack dynamical information. Here, we formulate a set of unbiased quantitative characterizations of the mechanosensory system by using reverse correlation analysis on behavior. We use a custom tracking, selective illumination, and optogenetics platform to compare two mechanosensory systems: the gentle-touch (TRNs) and harsh-touch (PVD) circuits. This method yields characteristic linear filters that allow for prediction of behavioral responses. The resulting filters are consistent with previous findings, and further provide new insights on the dynamics and spatial encoding of the systems. Our results suggest that the tiled network of the gentle-touch neurons has better resolution for spatial encoding than the harsh-touch neurons. Additionally, linear-nonlinear models accurately predict behavioral responses based only on sensory neuron activity. Our results capture the overall dynamics of behavior induced by the activation of sensory neurons, providing simple transformations that quantitatively characterize these systems. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to capture the behavioral dynamics induced by any neuron or other excitable cells in the animal.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimals constantly integrate the activity of neurons throughout their bodies to choose the most appropriate behavior. A key goal in quantitative neuroscience is to characterize and predict how neuronal circuits control and modulate behavior. C. elegans, a nematode with a fully mapped connectome, is an ideal model organism for elucidating the links between neuronal circuits and behavior. However, many studies relating activity in neurons to behavior rely on spontaneous behavior and lack information about their dynamics. In this study, we formulate unbiased quantitative characterizations of sensory neurons in C. elegans using with reverse correlation analysis with a white noise stimulus. We use optogenetics to stimulate body touch sensory neurons in freely moving worms, and provide quantitative descriptions that capture the dynamic transformations between sensory neuron activity and behavioral outputs. Our results are consistent with previous findings, and additionally provide new insights on the spatial encoding of these systems. Our system provides a simple platform for characterizing the behavioral output due to specific neurons, and can be extended to any excitable cell in the animal.",

    "abstract": "Recently, molecular studies have uncovered significant cryptic diversity in the Mexican Highlands, leading to the description of many new endemic species. DNA approaches to this kind of species discovery have included both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and multilocus genomic methods. While these marker types have often been pitted against one another, there are benefits to deploying them together, as linked mtDNA data can provide the bridge between uncovering lineages through rigorous multilocus genomic analysis and identifying lineages through comparison to existing mtDNA databases. Here, we apply one class of multilocus genomic marker, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), and linked mtDNA data to a species complex of frogs (Sarcohyla bistincta) found in the Mexican Highlands. We generated data from 1,891 UCEs, which contained 1,742 informative SNPs for S. bistincta and closely related species and captured mitochondrial genomes for most samples. Genetic analyses based on both whole loci and SNPs agree there are numerous distinct and divergent lineages within S. bistincta. The SNP-based species tree provides the most conservative estimate of 8 well-supported lineages in three major clades. Having linked mtDNA data allowed us to tap into the large number of mtDNA sequences available on GenBank and identify one of these lineages as an already-described species, S. pentheter. One identified clade (containing 2 of the 8 lineages) was 10% divergent in mtDNA and paraphyletic with other S. bistincta, making this clade a clear candidate for species status. Phylogenies from UCEs and mtDNA mostly agreed in their topologies, but differed in that mtDNA suggested a more complex evolutionary history perhaps influenced by gene flow between some neighboring lineages. Our study demonstrates that the Mexican Highlands still hold substantial undescribed diversity. Combining multilocus genomic data with linked mtDNA data is a useful approach for identifying potential new species and associating them with already described taxa, which is especially important in groups with undescribed subadult phenotypes, where geographic ranges are unclear, or where phenotypes are conserved.",

    "abstract": "Elevated prefrontal cortex activity is often observed in healthy older adults despite declines in their memory and other cognitive functions. According to one view, this activity reflects a compensatory functional posterior-to-anterior shift, which contributes to maintenance of cognitive performance when posterior cortical function is impaired. Alternatively, the increased prefrontal activity may be less efficient or less specific, owing to structural and neurochemical changes accompanying aging. These accounts are difficult to distinguish on the basis of average activity levels within brain regions. Instead, we used a novel model-based multivariate analysis technique, applied to two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets from an adult-lifespan human sample (N=123 and N=115; approximately half female). Standard analysis replicated the age-related increase in average prefrontal activation, but multivariate tests revealed that this activity did not carry additional information. The results contradict the hypothesis of a compensatory posterior-to-anterior shift. Instead, they suggest that the increased prefrontal activation reflects reduced efficiency or specificity, rather than compensation.\\n\\nSignificance statementFunctional brain imaging studies have often shown increased activity in prefrontal brain regions in older adults. This has been proposed to reflect a compensatory shift to greater reliance on prefrontal cortex, helping to maintain cognitive function. Alternatively, activity may become less specific as people age. This is a key question in the neuroscience of aging. In this study, we used novel tests of how different brain regions contribute to long- and short-term memory. We found increased activity in prefrontal cortex in older adults, but this activity carried less information about memory outcomes than activity in visual regions. These findings are relevant for understanding why cognitive abilities decline with age, suggesting that optimal function depends on successful brain maintenance rather than compensation.",

By analyzing gene expression in primary visual cortex of wild-type and Otx2+/GFP mice at plastic and non-plastic ages, we identified several putative genes implicated in Otx2-dependent visual cortex plasticity for ocular dominance. Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced Gadd45b/g expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in Gadd45b/g up-regulation. Viral expression of Gadd45b in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Emerging pathogens are a major threat to public health, however understanding how pathogens adapt to new niches remains a challenge. New methods are urgently required to provide functional insights into pathogens from the massive genomic data sets now being generated from routine pathogen surveillance for epidemiological purposes. Here, we measure the burden of atypical mutations in protein coding genes across independently evolved Salmonella enterica lineages, and use these as input to train a random forest classifier to identify strains associated with extraintestinal disease. Members of the species fall along a continuum, from pathovars which cause gastrointestinal infection and low mortality, associated with a broad host-range, to those that cause invasive infection and high mortality, associated with a narrowed host range. Our random forest classifier learned to perfectly discriminate long-established gastrointestinal and invasive serovars of Salmonella. Additionally, it was able to discriminate recently emerged Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium lineages associated with invasive disease in immunocompromised populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and within-host adaptation to invasive infection. We dissect the architecture of the model to identify the genes that were most informative of phenotype, revealing a common theme of degradation of metabolic pathways in extraintestinal lineages. This approach accurately identifies patterns of gene degradation and diversifying selection specific to invasive serovars that have been captured by more labour-intensive investigations, but can be readily scaled to larger analyses.",

Acute exercise promotes the release of endocannabinoids (especially anandamide, AEA), which enhance BDNF release and improve hippocampal plasticity in rodents. How acute exercise affects BDNF and AEA levels and influences memory performance in humans remains to date unknown. Here we combined blood biomarkers, behavioral and fMRI measurements to assess the impact of acute physical exercise on associative memory and underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. For each participant, memory was tested after three conditions: rest, moderate or high exercise intensity. A long-term memory retest took place 3 months later. At both test and retest, memory performance increased after moderate but not high intensity exercise or rest. We also show that memory benefited from exercise-related increases in both AEA and BNDF levels: AEA boosted hippocampal activity during memory recall, while BDNF enhanced hippocampal memory representations and long-term performance.",

We describe and illustrate how to transform selection gradients for PC scores back into selection gradients for the original traits, addressing issues of multicollinearity and biological interpretation. We demonstrate this approach with empirical data and examples from the literature, highlighting how selection estimates for PC scores can be interpreted while reducing the consequences of multicollinearity.",

We assessed dynamics in relative abundance and potential activities by sequencing the small sub-unit ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA gene) and rRNA molecules (rRNA) of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota once to twice-daily between March 2014 and May 2014 from the surface ocean off Catalina Island, California. Typically Ostreococcus, Braarudosphaera, Teleaulax, and Synechococcus dominated phytoplankton sequences (including chloroplasts) while SAR11, Sulfitobacter, and Fluviicola dominated non-phytoplankton Bacteria and Archaea. We observed short-lived increases of diatoms, mostly Pseudo-nitzschia and Chaetoceros, with quickly responding Bacteria and Archaea including Flavobacteriaceae (Polaribacter & Formosa), Roseovarius, and Euryarchaeota (MGII), notably the exact amplicon sequence variants we observed responding similarly to another diatom bloom nearby, three years prior. We observed correlations representing known interactions among abundant phytoplankton rRNA sequences, demonstrating the biogeochemical and ecological relevance of such interactions: 1) The kleptochloroplastidic ciliate Mesodinium 18S rRNA gene sequences and a single Teleaulax taxon (via 16S rRNA gene sequences) were correlated (Spearman r =0.83) yet uncorrelated to a Teleaulax 18S rRNA gene OTU, or any other taxon (consistent with a kleptochloroplastidic or karyoklepty relationship) and 2) the photosynthetic prymnesiophyte Braarudosphaera bigelowii and two strains of diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A were correlated and each taxon was also correlated to other taxa, including B. bigelowii to a verrucomicrobium and a dictyochophyte phytoplankter (all r > 0.8). We also report strong correlations (r > 0.7) between various ciliates, bacteria, and phytoplankton, suggesting interactions via currently unknown mechanisms. These data reiterate the utility of high-frequency time-series to show rapid microbial reactions to stimuli, and provide new information about in-situ dynamics of previously recognized and hypothesized interactions.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have probed the role of the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm (8 - 12 Hz) in human visual perception through attempts to drive its neural generators. To that end, paradigms have used high-intensity strictly-periodic visual stimulation that created strong predictions about future stimulus occurrences and repeatedly demonstrated perceptual consequences in line with an entrainment of parieto-occipital alpha. Our study, in turn, examined the case of alpha entrainment by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation within theta-(4 - 7 Hz), alpha-(8 - 13 Hz) and beta (14 - 20 Hz) frequency bands, i.e. a class of stimuli that resemble the temporal characteristics of naturally occurring visual input more closely. We have previously reported substantial neural phase-locking in EEG recording during all three stimulation conditions. Here, we studied to what extent this phase-locking reflected an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the same dataset. Specifically, we tested whether quasi-periodic visual stimulation affected several properties of parieto-occipital alpha generators. Speaking against an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation, we found none of these properties to show differences between stimulation frequency bands. In particular, alpha band generators did not show increased sensitivity to alpha band stimulation and Bayesian inference corroborated evidence against an influence of stimulation frequency. Our results set boundary conditions for when and how to expect effects of entrainment of alpha generators and suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm may be more inert to external influences than previously thought.",

Addressing this deficit in molecular information can inform species typing, epidemiological monitoring and clinical treatment. Here, L. (V.) naiffi and L. (V.) guyanensis genomic DNA was sequenced to assemble these two genomes as draft references from short sequence reads. The methods used were tested using short sequence reads for L. braziliensis M2904 against its published reference as a comparison. This assembly and annotation pipeline identified 70 additional genes not annotated on the original M2904 reference. Phylogenetic and evolutionary comparisons of L. guyanensis and L. naiffi with ten other Viannia genomes revealed four traits common to all Viannia: aneuploidy, 22 orthologous groups of genes absent in other Leishmania subgenera, elevated TATE transposon copies, and a high NADH-dependent fumarate reductase gene copy number. Within the Viannia, there were limited structural changes in genome architecture specific to individual species: a 45 Kb amplification on chromosome 34 was present in all bar L. lainsoni, L. naiffi had a higher copy number of the virulence factor leishmanolysin, and laboratory isolate L. shawi M8408 had a possible minichromosome derived from the 3 end of chromosome 34. This combination of genome assembly, phylogenetics and comparative analysis across an extended panel of diverse Viannia has uncovered new insights into the origin and evolution of this subgenus and can help improve diagnostics for leishmaniasis surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions control a large range of biological processes and their identification is essential to understand the underlying biological mechanisms. To complement experimental approaches, in silico methods are available to investigate protein-protein interactions. Cross-docking methods, in particular, can be used to predict protein binding sites. However, proteins can interact with numerous partners and can present multiple binding sites on their surface, which may alter the binding site prediction quality. We evaluate the binding site predictions obtained using complete cross-docking simulations of 358 proteins with two different scoring schemes accounting for multiple binding sites. Despite overall good binding site prediction performances, 68 cases were still associated with very low prediction quality, presenting individual area under the specificity-sensitivity ROC curve (AUC) values below the random AUC threshold of 0.5, since cross-docking calculations can lead to the identification of alternate protein binding sites (that are different from the reference experimental sites). For the large majority of these proteins, we show that the predicted alternate binding sites correspond to interaction sites with hidden partners, i.e. partners not included in the original cross-docking dataset. Among those new partners, we find proteins, but also nucleic acid molecules. Finally, for proteins with multiple binding sites on their surface, we investigated the structural determinants associated with the binding sites the most targeted by the docking partners.\\n\\nAbbreviationsANOVA: ANalysis Of Variance; AUC: Area Under the Curve; Best Interface: BI; CAPRI: Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions; CC-D: Complete Cross-Docking; DNA: DesoxyriboNucleic Acid; FDR: False Discovery Rate; FRIres(type): Fraction of each Residue type in the Interface; FP: False Positives; GI: Global Interface; HCMD: Help Cure Muscular Dystrophy; JET: Joint Evolutionary Tree; MAXDo: Molecular Association via Cross Docking; NAI: Nucleic Acid Interface; NPV: Negative Predicted Value; PDB: Protein Data Bank; PIP: Protein Interface Propensity; PiQSi: Protein Quaternary Structure investigation; PPIs: Protein-Protein Interactions; PPV: Positive Predicted Value; Prec.: Precision; PrimI: Primary Interface; RNA: RiboNucleic Acid; ROC: Receiver Operating Characteristic; SecI: Secondary Interface; Sen.: Sensitivity; Spe.: Specificity; TN: True Negatives; TP: True Positives; WCG: World Community Grid.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate decoding methods applied to neuroimaging data have become the standard in cognitive neuroscience for unravelling statistical dependencies between brain activation patterns and experimental conditions. The current challenge is to demonstrate that information decoded as such by the experimenter is in fact used by the brain itself to guide behaviour. Here we demonstrate a promising approach to do so in the context of neural activation during object perception and categorisation behaviour. We first localised decodable information about visual objects in the human brain using a spatially-unbiased multivariate decoding analysis. We then related brain activation patterns to behaviour using a machine-learning based extension of signal detection theory. We show that while there is decodable information about visual category throughout the visual brain, only a subset of those representations predicted categorisation behaviour, located mainly in anterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of neuroimaging studies, highlight the importance of relating decoding results to behaviour, and suggest a suitable methodology towards this aim.",

    "abstract": "Understanding micro-evolutionary responses of mating systems to contemporary selection requires estimating sex-specific additive genetic variances and cross-sex genetic covariances in key reproductive strategy traits. One key trait comprises the occurrence of divorce versus mate-fidelity across sequential reproductive attempts. If divorce represents an evolving behavioural strategy it must have non-zero individual repeatability and heritability, but quantitative estimates from wild populations are scarce. We used 39 years of individual breeding records and pedigree data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify sex-specific permanent individual and additive genetic variances, and hence estimate repeatability and heritability, in liability for divorce. We estimated moderate repeatability in females, but little repeatability in males. Estimates of additive genetic variance were small in both sexes, and the cross-sex genetic covariance was close to zero. However, the total heritability was likely non-zero but small, indicating low potential for micro-evolutionary response to selection. Rapid micro-evolution of divorce rate therefore appears unlikely, even if there were substantial fitness benefits of divorce and resulting selection.",

    "abstract": "The use of screen electronic devices (SED) in the evening negatively affects sleep. Yet, sleep is known to be essential for brain maturation and a key factor for good academic performance, and thus is particularly critical during childhood and adolescence. While previous studies reported correlations between SED use and sleep impairments, the causal relationship between SED use and sleep in adolescents remains unclear. Using actigraphy and daily questionnaires in a large sample of students (12 to 19 years old), we assessed SED use and sleep habits over one month, including a two-week baseline phase and a two-week interventional phase, where participants were asked to stop screen use after 9 pm during pre-school nights. During the interventional phase, we found that reduction in time spent on SED after 9 pm correlated with earlier sleep onset time and increased total sleep duration. The latter led to improved daytime vigilance. We also observed that the beneficial impact of the intervention on sleep was influenced by catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism, which is implicated in the dopaminergic modulation of human behaviors, including wake and sleep regulation. These findings provide evidence that restricting SED use in the evening represents a valid and promising approach for improving sleep duration in adolescents, with potential implications for daytime functioning and health.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWith the emergence of smartphones and other connected devices, adolescents spend a lot of time on screen electronic devices (SED), especially during the evening. We report that time spent on SED after 9 pm negatively correlates with sleep onset time, sleep duration as well as mood, body weight, and academic performance. Such observable correlations urge for educational strategies to address the chronic lack of sleep observed in todays adolescent populations. Here we also show that limiting the use of SED after 9 pm improves sleep duration and daytime vigilance in most adolescents. This simple education recommendation pertaining to sleep hygiene can be implemented by every household, yielding direct positive effects on sleep, and presumed benefits for health and daytime functioning.",

Successful treatments for these disorders could interact with these complex changes in myriad ways, and as a consequence their mechanisms of action and their amelioration of symptoms are incompletely understood. Using Parkinsons disease as a case-study, we review here how computational models are a crucial tool for taming this complexity, across causative mechanisms, consequent neural dynamics, and treatments. For mechanisms, we review models that capture the effects of losing dopamine on basal ganglia function; for dynamics, we discuss models that have transformed our understanding of how beta-band (15-30 Hz) oscillations arise in the parkinsonian basal ganglia. For treatments, we touch on the breadth of computational modelling work trying to understand the therapeutic actions of deep brain stimulation. Collectively, models from across all levels of description are providing a compelling account of the causes, symptoms, and treatments for Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Multi-species microbial communities often display functions - biochemical activities unattainable by member species alone, such as fighting pathogens. To improve community function, we can artificially select communities by growing \\\"Newborn\\\" communities over \\\"maturation time\\\" into \\\"Adult\\\" communities, and selecting highest-functioning Adults to \\\"reproduce\\\" by diluting each into multiple Newborns of the next cycle. Community selection has been attempted a few times on complex communities, often generating mixed results that are difficult to interpret. Here, we ask how costly community function may be improved via mutations and community selection. We simulate selection of two-species communities where Helpers digest Waste and generate Byproduct essential to Manufacturers; Manufacturers divert a fraction of their growth to make Product. Community function, the total Product in an \\\"Adult\\\", is sub-optimal even when both species have been pre-optimized as monocultures. If we dilute an Adult into Newborns by pipetting (a common experimental procedure), stochastic fluctuations in Newborn composition prevents community function from improving. Reducing fluctuations via cell sorting allows selection to work. Our conclusions hold regardless of whether H and M are commensal or mutualistic, or variations in model assumptions.",

Through the genetic induction of anti-Pax6 single-chain antibody secretion, we have analyzed Pax6 non-cell autonomous activity on the migration of cortical hem- and septum-derived Cajal-Retzius (CR) neurons by live imaging of flat mount developing cerebral cortices. We observed that blocking extracellular Pax6 disrupts tangential CR cell migration patterns. We found a decrease in the distance travelled and changes both in directionality and in the depth at which CR cells migrate. Tracking of single CR cells in mutant cortices revealed that extracellular Pax6 neutralization enhances or reduces contact repulsion in medial and lateral regions, respectively. This study demonstrates that secreted Pax6 controls neuronal migration thus acting as a bona fide morphogen at an early stage of cerebral cortex development.\\n\\nSummary statementCajal-Retzius cell distribution in the embryonic cortex participates in determining the size and positioning of cortical areas.

    "abstract": "Humans and other animals adapt motor commands to predictable disturbances within tens of trials in laboratory conditions. A central question is how does the nervous system adapt to disturbances in natural conditions when exactly the same movements cannot be practiced several times. Because motor commands and sensory feedback together carry continuous information about limb dynamics, we hypothesized that the nervous system could adapt to unexpected disturbances online. We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which velocity-dependent force fields were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a force field prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, consistent with within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics. These findings suggest a fast time-scale of motor learning, which complements feedback control and supports adaptation of an ongoing movement.\n\nSignificance StatementAn important function of the nervous system is to adapt motor commands in anticipation of predictable disturbances, which supports motor learning when we move in novel environments such as force fields. Here we show that movement control when exposed to unpredictable disturbances exhibit similar traits: motor corrections become tuned to the force field, and they evoke after effects within an ongoing sequence of movements. We propose and discuss the framework of adaptive control to explain these results: a real-time learning algorithm, which complements feedback control in the presence of model errors. This candidate model potentially links movement control and trial-by-trial adaptation of motor commands.",

To characterize these variants, we developed a streamlined protocol for a high-throughput reporter assay, BiT-STARR-seq (Biallelic Targeted STARR-seq), that identifies allele-specific expression (ASE) while accounting for PCR duplicates through unique molecular identifiers. We tested 75,501 oligos (43,500 SNPs) and identified 2,720 SNPs with significant ASE (FDR 10%). To validate disruption of binding as one of the mechanisms underlying ASE, we developed a new high throughput allele specific binding assay for NFKB-p50. We identified 2,951 SNPs with allele-specific binding (ASB) (FDR 10%); 173 of these SNPs also had ASE (OR=1.97, p-value=0.0006). Of variants associated with complex traits, 1,531 resulted in ASE and 1,662 showed ASB. For example, we characterized that the Crohns disease risk variant for rs3810936 increases NFKB binding and results in altered gene expression.",

    "abstract": "It is an uninformative truism to state that the brain operates at multiple spatial and temporal scales, each with each own set of emergent phenomena. More worthy of attention is the point that our current understanding of it cannot clearly indicate which of these phenomenological scales are the significant contributors to the brains function and primary output (i.e. behaviour). Apart from the sheer complexity of the problem, a major contributing factor to this state of affairs is the lack of instrumentation that can simultaneously address these multiple scales without causing function altering damages to the underlying tissue. One important facet of this problem is that standard neural recording devices normally require one output connection per electrode. This limits the number of electrodes that can fit along the thin shafts of implantable probes generating a limiting balance between density and spread. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density probes.\n\nHere we report the design and in-vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. We show that this design targets both local and global spatial scales by allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning 7 functional regions with a single shaft. The neurons show similar recording longevity and signal to noise ratio to passive probes of comparable size and no adverse effects in awake or anesthetized animals. Addressing the data management of this device we also present novel visualization and monitoring methods. Using the probe with freely moving animals we show how accessing a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions offers a novel perspective on how the brain operates around salient behavioural events. Finally, we compare this probe with lower density, non CMOS designs (which have to adhere to the one electrode per output line rule). We show that an increase in density results in capturing neural firing patterns, undetectable by lower density devices, which correlate to self-similar structures inherent in complex naturalistic behaviour.\n\nTo help design electrode configurations for future, even higher density, CMOS probes, recordings from many different brain regions were obtained with an ultra-dense passive probe.",

We demonstrate, for the first time, oppositional effects of imprinted genes on brain and behavior. Specifically, here we show that mice lacking paternal Grb10 make fewer impulsive choices, with no dissociable effects on a separate measure of impulsive action. Taken together with previous work showing that mice lacking maternal Nesp55 make more impulsive choices this suggests that impulsive choice behavior is a substrate for the action of genomic imprinting. Moreover, the contrasting effect of these two genes suggests impulsive choices are subject to intra-genomic conflict and that maternal and paternal interests pull this behavior in opposite directions. Finally, these data may also indicate that an imbalance in expression of imprinted genes contributes to pathological conditions such as gambling and drug addiction, where impulsive behavior becomes maladaptive.",

Using genomically diverged island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow, we test predictions for phenotypic trait values and evolvability based on patterns of parental species divergence in four plumage color traits. We find associations between parental divergence and trait evolution in Italian sparrows. Fixed major QTL in species differences lead to hybrids with higher trait variation, and hence evolvability, than the parent species. Back and crown plumage show no correlation between current within-parent variability and among-parent differentiation. For these traits, Italian sparrow phenotypes are biased towards axes of high parental differentiation and show greater phenotypic novelty along axes of low current parental evolvability, as predicted when major QTL are involved in species differences. Crown color has consistently evolved back towards one parent, while back color varies among islands. We also find significant among-population diversification within the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization of the same parent species can generate different phenotypes. In conclusion, we find support for parental phenotypic divergence patterns reflecting divergence mechanisms, and hence such patterns can be useful in predicting how hybridization alters the potential to evolve and adapt.",

When applied to human repertoires, Ig-seq provides insight into fundamental immunological questions, and can be implemented in diagnostic and drug discovery projects. However, a major challenge in Ig-seq is ensuring accuracy, as library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms can introduce substantial errors and bias that compromise immunological interpretation. Here, we have established an approach for performing highly accurate human Ig-seq by combining synthetic standards with a comprehensive error and bias correction pipeline. First, we designed a set of 85 synthetic antibody heavy chain standards (in vitro transcribed RNA) to assess correction workflow fidelity. Next, we adapted a library preparation protocol that incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UIDs) for error and bias correction which, when applied to the synthetic standards, resulted in highly accurate data. Finally, we performed Ig-seq on purified human circulating B cell subsets (naive and memory), combined with a cellular replicate sampling strategy. This strategy enabled robust and reliable estimation of key repertoire features such as clonotype diversity, germline segment and isotype subclass usage, and somatic hypermutation (SHM). We anticipate that our standards and error and bias correction pipeline will become a valuable tool for researchers to validate and improve accuracy in human Ig-seq studies, thus leading to potentially new insights and applications in human antibody repertoire profiling.",

We dissected neuronal substrates underlying the identified habituation deficits and integrated genotype-phenotype annotations, gene ontologies and interaction networks to determine the clinical features and molecular processes that are associated with habituation deficits.\\n\\nResultsWe identified more than 100 genes required for habituation learning. For the vast majority of these, 93 genes, a role in habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes characterize ID disorders with overgrowth/macrocephaly and comorbid ASD. Moreover, ASD individuals from the Simons Simplex Collection carrying disruptive de novo mutations in these genes exhibit increased rates of specific aberrant behaviors including stereotypic speech, hyperactivity and irritability. At the molecular level, ID genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic function and converge on Ras-MAPK signaling. Both increased Ras-MAPK signaling in GABAergic and decreased Ras-MAPK signaling in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive habituation response.\\n\\nConclusionsOur work demonstrates the relevance of habituation learning to autism, identifies an unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an emerging role for inhibitory neurons in habituation and reveals an opposing, circuit-level-based mechanism for Ras-MAPK signaling. This establishes habituation as a possible, widely applicable target for pharmacologic intervention in ID/ASD.",

    "abstract": "Diverse psychophysical and neurophysiological results show that oculomotor networks are continuously active, such that plans for making the next eye movement are always ongoing. So, when new visual information arrives unexpectedly, how are those plans affected? At what point can the new information start guiding an eye movement, and how? Here, based on modeling and simulation results, we make two observations that are relevant to these questions. First, we note that many experiments, including those investigating the phenomenon known as \\\"saccadic inhibition,\\\" are consistent with the idea that sudden-onset stimuli briefly interrupt the gradual rise in neural activity associated with the preparation of an impending saccade. And second, we show that this stimulus-driven interruption is functionally adaptive, but only if perception is fast. In that case, putting on hold an ongoing saccade plan toward location A allows the oculomotor system to initiate a concurrent, alternative plan toward location B (where a stimulus just appeared), deliberate (briefly) on the priority of each target, and determine which plan should continue.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe fresh bones (with some meat on them; frequently discarded as a large quantity of industry garbage) of marine fish such as cod and salmon are good materials for manufacture of food additives (taste adjusters). However, such fish-bone originated additives often have apparent bitter taste and need additional debittering regime.\\n\\nRESULTSIn this study, 46 known bitter peptides in the cod proteome were targeted for specific protease digestion to eliminate bitter taste from the cod bone soup. Though the debittering effect was apparent, the bitter taste was not completely removed. However, the bitter taste can be removed by addition of trout extract to a complete extent. The strong debittering power of rainbow trout extract was further confirmed by the debittering experiments on salmon bone soup and bitter melon, both with perfect results.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONThese results indicated that the cod bone soup bitterness comes not only from bitter peptide but also from other substances that can be masked by trout extract. Considering the fact that trout proteome has more potential bitter peptides than cod, trout extract shall have a strong bitter masking substance to be determined in the future.",

    "abstract": "Optical mapping is a unique system that is capable of producing high-resolution, high-throughput genomic map data that gives information about the structure of a genome [21]. Recently it has been used for scaffolding contigs and assembly validation for large-scale sequencing projects, including the maize [32], goat [6], and amborella [4] genomes. However, a major impediment in the use of this data is the variety and quantity of errors in the raw optical mapping data, which are called Rmaps. The challenges associated with using Rmap data are analogous to dealing with insertions and deletions in the alignment of long reads. Moreover, they are arguably harder to tackle since the data is numerical and susceptible to inaccuracy. We develop cOMet to error correct Rmap data, which to the best of our knowledge is the only optical mapping error correction method. Our experimental results demonstrate that cOMet has high prevision and corrects 82.49% of insertion errors and 77.38% of deletion errors in Rmap data generated from the E. coli K-12 reference genome. Out of the deletion errors corrected, 98.26% are true errors. Similarly, out of the insertion errors corrected, 82.19% are true errors. It also successfully scales to large genomes, improving the quality of 78% and 99% of the Rmaps in the plum and goat genomes, respectively. Lastly, we show the utility of error correction by demonstrating how it improves the assembly of Rmap data. Error corrected Rmap data results in an assembly that is more contiguous, and covers a larger fraction of the genome.",

    "abstract": "To understand the evolution of flowers and mating systems in animal-pollinated plants, we have to directly address the function for which flowers evolved--the movement of pollen from anthers to stigmas. However, despite a long history of making significant advances in our understanding natural selection and evolution, the field of pollination biology has largely studied pollen movement indirectly (e.g., pollen analogues or paternity assignment to seeds) due to a lack of suitable pollen tracking methods. Here, we develop and test a novel pollen-tracking technique using quantum dots as pollen-grain labels. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals so small in size that they behave like artificial atoms. When exposed to UV light, they emit extremely bright light in a range of different colours. Their photostability, broad excitation range, and customisable binding-li-gands make quantum dots ideal bio-labels. We tested the suitability of CuInSexS2-x/ZnS (core/shell) quantum dots with oleic acid (zinc-oleate complex) ligands as pollen-grain labels. We found that quantum dots attach to pollen grains of four different species even after agitation in a polar solvent, suggesting that the oleic acid ligands on quantum dots bind to pollenkitt surrounding pollen grains. We also showed that most pollen grains within anthers of the same four species are labelled with quantum dots after applying sufficient quantum-dot solution to anthers. To test whether quantum-dot pollen-labels influenced pollen transport, we conducted pollen transfer trials on Sparaxis villosa (Iridaceae) using captively reared honeybees. We found no difference in pollen transport between labelled and unlabelled pollen grains. Our experiments therefore demonstrate the potential for quantum dots to be used as easily applied pollen labels, which allow subsequent tracking of the fates of pollen grains in the field. The ability to track pollen grain movement in situ, may finally allow us to address an historically neglected aspect of plant reproductive ecology and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association analysis is a powerful approach to studying the genetic architecture of complex traits. A key component of this approach is to build a model to predict (impute) gene expression levels from genotypes from samples with matched genotypes and expression levels in a specific tissue. However, it is challenging to develop robust and accurate imputation models with limited sample sizes for any single tissue. Here, we first introduce a multi-task learning approach to jointly impute gene expression in 44 human tissues. Compared with single-tissue methods, our approach achieved an average 39% improvement in imputation accuracy and generated effective imputation models for an average 120% (range 13%-339%) more genes in each tissue. We then describe a summary statistic-based testing framework that combines multiple single-tissue associations into a single powerful metric to quantify overall gene-trait association at the organism level. When our method, called UTMOST, was applied to analyze genome wide association results for 50 complex traits (Ntotal=4.5 million), we were able to identify considerably more genes in tissues enriched for trait heritability, and cross-tissue analysis significantly outperformed single-tissue strategies (p=1.7e-8). Finally, we performed a cross-tissue genome-wide association study for late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) and replicated our findings in two independent datasets (Ntotal=175,776). In total, we identified 69 significant genes, many of which are novel, leading to novel insights on LOAD etiologies.",

Here, we show that progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to taxane-resistance is characterized by altered methionine metabolism and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) availability, giving rise to DNA hypomethylation in regions enriched for transposable elements (TE). Compensatory redistribution of H3K27me3 forming Large Organized Chromatin domains of lysine (K) modification (LOCK) prevents expression of TE in taxane-resistant cells. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2, the H3K27me3 methyltransferase, alleviates TE repression, leading to the accumulation of dsRNA and activation of the interferon viral mimicry-response, specifically inhibiting the growth of taxane-resistant TNBC. Together, our work delineates a role for metabolic adaptations in redefining the epigenome of taxane-resistant TNBC cells and underlies an epigenetic vulnerability toward pharmacological inhibition of EZH2.",

We also tested how the deviant detection signal is affected by the degree of anticipation. We studied regional neural activity when people watched a movie that had varying saliency of a novel or an anticipated flow of salient events. Using intracranial electroencephalography from ten patients, we observed that high-frequency activity (50-150 Hz) in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral PFC), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) tracked event saliency. We also observed that medial OFC activity was stronger when the salient events were anticipated than when they were novel. These results suggest that dorsolateral PFC and medial OFC, as well as the hippocampus, signify the saliency magnitude of events, reflecting the hierarchical structure of event associations.",

    "abstract": "In resting-state fMRI, dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) measures are used to characterize temporal changes in the brains intrinsic functional connectivity. A widely used approach for DFC estimation is the computation of the sliding window correlation between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals from different brain regions. Although the source of temporal fluctuations in DFC estimates remains largely unknown, there is growing evidence that they may reflect dynamic shifts between functional brain networks. At the same time, recent findings suggest that DFC estimates might be prone to the influence of nuisance factors such as the physiological modulation of the BOLD signal. Therefore, nuisance regression is used in many DFC studies to regress out the effects of nuisance terms prior to the computation of DFC estimates. In this work we examined the relationship between DFC estimates and nuisance factors. We found that DFC estimates were significantly correlated with temporal fluctuations in the magnitude (norm) of various nuisance regressors, with significant correlations observed in the majority (76%) of the cases examined. Significant correlations between the DFC estimates and nuisance regressor norms were found even when the underlying correlations between the nuisance and fMRI time courses were relatively small. We then show that nuisance regression does not eliminate the relationship between DFC estimates and nuisance norms, with significant correlations observed in the majority (71%) of the cases examined after nuisance regression. We present theoretical bounds on the difference between DFC estimates obtained before and after nuisance regression and relate these bounds to limitations in the efficacy of nuisance regression with regards to DFC estimates.",

    "abstract": "Psychometric properties of perceptual assessments, like reliability, depend on the stochastic properties of psychophysical sampling procedures resulting in method variability, as well as inter- and intra-subject variability. Method variability is commonly minimized by optimizing sampling procedures through computer simulations. Inter-subject variability is inherent in the population of interest and cannot be acted upon. In contrast, intra-subject variability introduced by confounds cannot be simply quantified from experimental data, as this data also includes method variability. Therefore, this aspect is generally neglected when developing assessments. Yet, comparing method variability and intra-subject variability could give insights on whether effort should be invested in optimizing the sampling procedure, or in addressing potential confounds instead. We propose a new approach to estimate and model intra-subject variability of psychometric functions by combining computer simulations and behavioral data, and to account for it when simulating experiments. The approach was illustrated in a real-world scenario of proprioceptive difference threshold assessments. The behavioral study revealed a test-retest reliability of 0.212. Computer simulations lacking intra-subject variability predicted a reliability of 0.768, whereas the new approach including an intra-subject variability model lead to a realistic estimate of reliability (0.207). Such a model also allows computing the theoretically maximally attainable reliability (0.552) assuming an ideal sampling procedure. Comparing the reliability estimates when exclusively accounting for method variability versus intra-subject variability reveals that intra-subject variability should be reduced by addressing confounds and that only optimizing the sampling procedure may be insufficient to achieve a high reliability. The new approach also allows accelerating the development of assessments by simulating the converging behavior of the reliability confidence interval with a large number of subjects and retests without requiring additional experiments. Having such a tool of predictive value is especially important for target populations where time is scarce, such as for assessments in clinical settings.",

Here we developed a highly mechanistic model of Whole plAnt Carbon Nitrogen Interaction (WACNI), which predicts crop yield based on major metabolic and biophysical processes in source, sink and transport tissues. WACNI accurately predicted the yield responses of so far reported source, sink and transport related genetic manipulations on rice grain yields. Systematic sensitivity analysis with WACNI was used to classify the source, sink and transport related molecular processes into four categories, i.e. universal yield enhancers, universal yield inhibitors, conditional yield enhancers and weak yield regulators. Simulations using WACNI further show that even without a major change in leaf photosynthetic properties, 54.6% to 73% grain yield increase can be potentially achieved by optimizing these molecular processes during the rice grain filling period while simply combining all the  superior molecular modules together cannot achieve the optimal yield level. A common macroscopic feature in all these designed high-yield lines is that they all show  a sustained and steady growth of grain sink, which might be used as a generic selection criteria in high-yield rice breeding. Overall, WACNI can serve as a tool to facilitate plant source sink interaction research and guide future crops breeding by design.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryA mechanistic model of source, sink flow model is developed and used to demonstrate that optimization of the whole plant carbon nitrogen metabolism can dramatically increase crop yield potential.",

Our analyses of site frequency spectra indicate that these populations derive 2-19% of their genetic ancestry from an archaic population that diverged prior to the split of Neanderthals and modern humans. Using a method that can identify segments of archaic ancestry without the need for reference archaic genomes, we built genome-wide maps of archaic ancestry in the Yoruba and the Mende populations that recover about 482 and 502 megabases of archaic sequence, respectively. Analyses of these maps reveal segments of archaic ancestry at high frequency in these populations that represent potential targets of adaptive introgression.

    "abstract": "Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces show some reaction to visible light - although they lack photo pigments and the typical clock genes of fungi - that can be explained by damage of the cytochrome electron transport chain of the mitochondria. Evidence for a circadian clock, entrainable by cyclic environmental stimuli, exists for periodic changing temperature and light as zeitgeber. Whether seasonality follows from the existence of a circadian clock - which is a necessary requirement for annual rhythms - remains unknown.\\n\\nDue to an accidental observation, we were able to show that fermentation taking place in complete darkness and at constant temperature is influenced in some yeast strains by the history of the inoculum culture. Using yeast cultures growing on agar plates and exposed to diffuse daylight for three weeks either in March or in May as inoculum, leads to significantly different fermentation rates in the inoculated grape juice in both months: rates are higher in March when day length is shorter than in May. In must inoculated with cultures that grew in darkness or daylight, respectively, higher fermentation rates occur by the former. Other yeast strains react to artificial white light in the same way.\\n\\nWe used strains of S. cerevisiae, S. eubayanus, S. kudriavzevii, S. uvarum and furthermore hybrid strains of two or even three of these species. The most pronounced reaction to daylight was shown by the S. eubayanus x S. uvarum x S. cerevisiae hybrid, followed by S. cerevisiae x S. kudriavzevii hybrids, S. eubayanus and S. cerevisiae. S. uvarum was sensitive to artificial white light.\\n\\nThese observations can hardly be explained by some kind of photo damage because they base on an effect that persists through many cell division cycles after yeasts were exposed to light. If it really represents seasonality epigenetic memory is likely involved, since fermentation lasts for many days and yeast generations. If the existence of a circadian clock and seasonal behaviour in Saccharomyces is confirmed these yeasts could become an important tool in basic research concerning epigenetic memory.",

    "abstract": "An increasing body of literature suggests that both individual and collections of bacteria are associated with the progression of colorectal cancer. As the number of studies investigating these associations increases and the number of subjects in each study increases, a meta-analysis to identify the associations that are the most predictive of disease progression is warranted. We analyzed previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing data collected from feces and colon tissue. We quantified the odds ratios (ORs) for individual bacterial taxa that were associated with an individual having tumors relative to a normal colon. Among the fecal samples, there were no taxa that had significant ORs associated with adenoma and there were 8 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Similarly, among the tissue samples, there were no taxa that had a significant OR associated with adenoma and there were 3 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Among the significant ORs, the association between individual taxa and tumor diagnosis was equal or below 7.11. Because individual taxa had limited association with tumor diagnosis, we trained Random Forest classification models using only the taxa that had significant ORs, using the entire collection of taxa found in each study, and using operational taxonomic units defined based on a 97% similarity threshold. All training approaches yielded similar classification success as measured using the Area Under the Curve. The ability to correctly classify individuals with adenomas was poor and the ability to classify individuals with carcinomas was considerably better using sequences from fecal or tissue.\\n\\nImportanceColorectal cancer is a significant and growing health problem in which animal models and epidemiological data suggest that the colonic microbiota have a role in tumorigenesis. These observations indicate that the colonic microbiota is a reservoir of biomarkers that may improve our ability to detect colonic tumors using non-invasive approaches. This meta-analysis identifies and validates a set of 8 bacterial taxa that can be used within a Random Forest modeling framework to differentiate individuals as having normal colons or carcinomas. When models trained using one dataset were tested on other datasets, the models performed well. These results lend support to the use of fecal biomarkers for the detection of tumors. Furthermore, these biomarkers are plausible candidates for further mechanistic studies into the role of the gut microbiota in tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Much of our understanding about how acetylcholine modulates prefrontal cortical (PFC) networks comes from behavioral experiments that examine cortical dynamics during highly attentive states. However, much less is known about how PFC is recruited during passive sensory processing and how acetylcholine may regulate connectivity between cortical areas outside of task performance. To investigate the involvement of PFC and cholinergic neuromodulation in passive auditory processing, we performed simultaneous recordings in the auditory cortex (AC) and PFC in awake head fixed mice presented with a white noise auditory stimulus in the presence or absence of local cholinergic antagonists in AC. We found that a subset of PFC neurons were strongly driven by auditory stimuli even when the stimulus had no associative meaning, suggesting PFC monitors stimuli under passive conditions. We also found that cholinergic signaling in AC shapes the strength of auditory driven response in PFC, by modulating the intra-cortical sensory response through muscarinic interactions in AC. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence that cholinergic mechanisms have a continuous role in cortical gating through muscarinic receptors during passive processing and expand traditional views of prefrontal cortical function and the contributions of cholinergic modulation in sensory gating.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIPrefrontal cortex actively monitors non-associative stimuli under passive conditions\\nC_LIO_LIAcetylcholine facilitates cortical signaling even outside of attentional contexts\\nC_LIO_LILocal scopolamine infusion reduced intracortical signaling and impaired cortical gating\\nC_LIO_LImAChR have an ongoing role in sound processing\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The coordinated execution of innate, stereotyped sexual behaviours, such as courtship and mating, requires sexually dimorphic sensory-motor circuits that are genetically specified during development (reviewed in [1-3]). Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the development and function of neural circuits can be interrogated with single cell resolution, have revealed two general developmental mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in the nervous system. The first involves the acquisition of sexually dimorphic features in sex-shared neurons during sexual maturation, which include changes in terminal gene expression, such as odorant receptors, neurotransmitters and synaptic regulators [4-10]. The second mechanism involves the generation of sex-specific neurons [11-13]. This requires sex-specific cell death [14]or neurogenesis events resulting from extensive sex differences in the cell division patterns and neurodevelopmental programmes of post-embryonic cell lineages (reviewed in [3]). Here we identify a third, novel way to generate sexual dimorphism in the nervous system. We find that during sexual maturation (L4 stage), a class of sex-shared glial cells acquires sexually dimorphic function by undergoing a direct glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation that results in the production of male-specific neurons. This plasticity is regulated cell-intrinsically by the sex-determination pathway. These previously unnoticed neurons, which we term PHDs, are putative proprioceptors that regulate male locomotion during specific steps of mating. One of these steps is a novel readjustment movement performed when intromission becomes difficult to achieve. Our results reveal sex-specific direct transdifferentiation as a novel mechanism for generating sex-specific neurons and also show the importance of proprioceptive feedback during the complex steps of mating for successful reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary cancer disorders often provide an important window into novel mechanisms supporting tumor growth and survival. Understanding these mechanisms and developing biomarkers to identify their presence thus represents a vital goal. Towards this goal, here we report a chemoproteomic map of the covalent targets of fumarate, an oncometabolite whose accumulation marks the genetic cancer predisposition syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). First, we validate the ability of known and novel chemoproteomic probes to report on fumarate reactivity in vitro. Next, we apply these probes in concert with LC-MS/MS to identify cysteine residues sensitive to either fumarate treatment or fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in untransformed and human HLRCC cell models, respectively. Mining this data to understand the structural determinants of fumarate reactivity reveals an unexpected anti-correlation with nucleophilicity, and the discovery of a novel influence of pH on fumarate-cysteine interactions. Finally, we show that many fumarate-sensitive and FH-regulated cysteines are found in functional protein domains, and perform mechanistic studies of a fumarate-sensitive cysteine in SMARCC1 that lies at a key protein-protein interface in the SWI-SNF tumor suppressor complex. Our studies provide a powerful resource for understanding the influence of fumarate on reactive cysteine residues, and lay the foundation for future efforts to exploit this distinct aspect of oncometabolism for cancer diagnosis and therapy.",

However, this methodology assumes that the studied variants are in linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutation and consequently do not identify it. In an attempt to identify causal mutations in candidate genes for carcass traits in broilers, we selected 20 predicted deleterious SNPs within QTLs for association analysis. Additive, dominance and allele substitution effects were tested. From the 20 SNPs analyzed, we identified six SNPs with significant association (p-value <0.05) with carcass traits, and three are highlighted here. The SNP rs736010549 was associated with drumstick weight and yield with significant additive and dominance effects. The SNP rs739508259 was associated with thigh weight and yield, and with significant additive and allele substitution effects. The SNP rs313532967 was associated with breast weight and yield. The three SNPs that were associated with carcass traits (rs736010549, rs739508259 and rs313532967) are respectively located in the coding regions of the WDR77, VWA8 and BARL genes.

    "abstract": "Defining the specific factors that govern the evolution and transmission of influenza A virus (IAV) populations is of critical importance for designing more effective prediction and control strategies. Superinfection, the sequential infection of a single cell by two or more virions, plays an important role in determining the replicative and evolutionary potential of IAV populations. The prevalence of superinfection during natural infection, and the specific mechanisms that regulate it, remain poorly understood. Here, we used a novel single virion infection approach to directly assess the effects of individual IAV genes on superinfection efficiency. Rather than implicating a specific viral gene, this approach revealed that superinfection susceptibility is determined by the total number of viral genes expressed, independent of their identity. IAV particles that expressed a complete set of viral genes potently inhibit superinfection, while semi-infectious particles (SIPs) that express incomplete subsets of viral genes do not. As a result, virus populations that contain more SIPs undergo more frequent superinfection. These findings identify both a major determinant of IAV superinfection potential and a prominent role for SIPs in promoting viral co-infection.",

    "abstract": "The Ebola virus (EBOV) is a genetically simple negative sense RNA virus with only 7 genes yet it causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. The matrix protein VP40 of EBOV is the main driver of viral budding through binding to host plasma membrane lipids and formation of the filamentous, pleomorphic virus particles. To better understand this dynamic and complex process we have asked what the role of two highly conserved cysteine residues are in the C-terminal domain of VP40. Here we report that the mutation of Cys311 to alanine increases VP40 membrane binding affinity for phosphatidylserine containing membranes. C311A has a significant increase in binding to PS compared to WT, has longer virus like particles, and displays evidence of increased budding. C314A also has an increase in PS binding compared to WT, however to a lesser extent. The double Cys mutant shares the phenotypes of the single mutants with increased binding to PS. Computational studies demonstrate these Cys residues, Cys311 in particular, restrain a loop segment containing Lys residues that interact with the plasma membrane. Mutation of Cys311 promotes membrane binding loop flexibility, alters internal VP40 H-bonding, and increases PS binding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of mutations that increase VP40 affinity for biological membranes and the length of EBOV virus like particles. Together, our findings indicate these residues are important for membrane dynamics at the plasma membrane via the interaction with phosphatidylserine.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinases are major drug targets, but the development of highly-selective inhibitors has been challenging due to the similarity of their active sites. The observation of distinct structural states of the fully-conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) loop has put the concept of conformational selection for the DFG-state at the center of kinase drug discovery. Recently, it was shown that Gleevec selectivity for the Tyr-kinases Abl was instead rooted in conformational changes after drug binding. Here, we investigate whether protein dynamics after binding is a more general paradigm for drug selectivity by characterizing the binding of several approved drugs to the Ser/Thr-kinase Aurora A. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, we propose a universal drug-binding mechanism, that rationalizes selectivity, affinity and long on-target residence time for kinase inhibitors. These new concepts, where protein dynamics in the drug-bound state plays the crucial role, can be applied to inhibitor design of targets outside the kinome.\\n\\neLife digestThe Ser/Thr kinase Aurora A is an important target for the development of new anticancer therapies. A longstanding question is how to specifically and effectively inhibit only this kinase in a background of over 550 protein kinases with very similar structures. To this end, understanding the inhibition mechanism of Aurora A by different drugs is essential. Here, we characterize the kinetic mechanism of three distinct kinase drugs, Gleevec (Imatinib), Danusertib (PHA739358) and AT9283 (Pyrazol-4-yl Urea) for Aurora A. We show that inhibitor affinities do not rely exclusively on the recognition of a specific conformation of the Asp-Phe-Gly loop of the kinase. Our quantitative kinetics data put forward an opposing mechanism in which a slow conformational change after drug binding (i.e., induced-fit step) dictates drug affinity.",

Here, we explored mechanisms of hyperexcitability in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from Dup15q patients. Maturation of resting membrane potential in Dup15q-derived neurons was similar to neurons from unaffected control subjects, but Dup15q neurons had delayed action potential maturation and increased synaptic event frequency and amplitude.

Controlling the size and shape, or site-specific functionalization is, however, difficult to achieve with established membrane mimetics based on membrane scaffolding proteins, polymers or peptides. In this work, we describe a route to leverage the unique programmability of DNA nanotechnology and create DNA-encircled bilayers (DEBs), which are made of multiple copies of an alkylated oligonucleotide hybridized to a single-stranded minicircle. To stabilize the hydrophobic rim of the lipid bilayer, and to prevent formation of lipid vesicles, we introduced up to 2 alkyl chains per helical that point to the inside of the toroidal DNA ring and interact with the hydrophobic side chains of the encapsulated lipid bilayer.

    "abstract": "Aphids present an ideal system to study epigenetics as they can produce diverse, but genetically identical, morphs in response to environmental stimuli. Here, using whole genome bisulphite sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), we present the first detailed analysis of cytosine methylation in an aphid and investigate differences in the methylation and transcriptional landscapes of male and asexual female morphs. We find that methylation primarily occurs in a CG dinucleotide (CpG) context and that exons are highly enriched for methylated CpGs, particularly at the 3 end of genes. Methylation is positively associated with gene expression, and methylated genes are more stably expressed than un-methylated genes. Male and asexual female morphs have distinct methylation profiles. Strikingly, these profiles are divergent between the sex chromosome and the autosomes; autosomal genes are hypo-methylated in males compared to asexual females, whereas genes belonging to the sex chromosome, which is haploid in males, are hyper-methylated. Overall, we find correlated changes in methylation and gene expression between males and asexual females, and this correlation is particularly strong for genes located on the sex chromosome. Our results suggest that differential methylation of sex-biased genes plays a role in M. persicae sexual differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Major cell fate decisions are governed by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) that act in small cell populations within developing embryos. To understand how TFs regulate cell fate it is important to identify their genomic binding sites in these populations. However, current methods cannot profile TFs genome-wide at or near the single cell level. Here we adapt the CUT&RUN method to profile chromatin proteins in low cell numbers, mapping TF-DNA interactions in single cells and individual pre-implantation embryos for the first time. Using this method, we demonstrate that the pluripotency TF NANOG is significantly more dependent on the SWI/SNF family ATPase BRG1 for association with its genomic targets in vivo than in cultured cells--a finding that could not have been made using traditional approaches. Ultra-low input CUT&RUN (uliCUT&RUN) enables interrogation of TF binding from low cell numbers, with broad applicability to rare cell populations of importance in development or disease.",

    "abstract": "A precise understanding of the genomic organization into transcriptional units and their regulation is essential for our comprehension of opportunistic human pathogens and how they cause disease. Using single-molecule real-time (PacBio) sequencing we unambiguously determined the genome sequence of Streptococcus pneumoniae strain D39 and revealed several inversions previously undetected by short-read sequencing. Significantly, a chromosomal inversion results in antigenic variation of PhtD, an important surface-exposed virulence factor. We generated a new genome annotation using automated tools, followed by manual curation, reflecting the current knowledge in the field. By combining sequence-driven terminator prediction, deep paired-end transcriptome sequencing and enrichment of primary transcripts by Cappable-Seq, we mapped 1,015 transcriptional start sites and 748 termination sites. Using this new genomic map, we identified several new small RNAs (sRNAs), riboswitches (including twelve previously misidentified as sRNAs), and antisense RNAs. In total, we annotated 92 new protein-encoding genes, 39 sRNAs and 165 pseudogenes, bringing the S. pneumoniae D39 repertoire to 2,151 genetic elements. We report operon structures and observed that 9% of operons lack a 5-UTR. The genome data is accessible in an online resource called PneumoBrowse (https://veeninglab.com/pneumobrowse) providing one of the most complete inventories of a bacterial genome to date.

    "abstract": "Efficient and highly organized transcription initiation and termination is fundamental to an organisms ability to survive, proliferate, and quickly respond to its environment. Over the last decade, our simplistic outlook of bacterial transcriptional regulation and architecture has evolved to include stimulus-responsive regulation by untranslated RNA and the formation of alternate transcriptional units. In this study, we map the transcriptional landscape of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae by applying a combination of high-throughput RNA-sequencing techniques. Our study reveals a complex transcriptome wherein environment-respondent alternate transcriptional units are observed within operons stemming from internal transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription terminators (TTS) suggesting that more fine-tuning of regulation occurs than previously thought. Additionally, we identify many putative cis-regulatory RNA elements and riboswitches within 5-untranslated regions (5-UTR) of genes. By integrating TSSs and TTSs with independently collected RNA-Seq datasets from a variety of conditions, we establish the response of these regulators to changes in growth conditions and validate several of them. Furthermore, to determine the importance of ribo-regulation by 5-UTR elements for in vivo virulence, we show that the pyrR regulatory element is essential for survival, successful colonization and infection in mice suggesting that such RNA elements are potential drug targets. Importantly, we show that our approach of combining high-throughput sequencing with in vivo experiments can reconstruct a global understanding of regulation, but also pave the way for discovery of compounds that target (ribo-) regulators to mitigate virulence and antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic human pathogen that typically colonizes the nasopharyngeal passage and causes lethal disease in other host niches such as the lung or the meninges. How pneumococcal genes are expressed and regulated at the different stages of its life cycle, as commensal or as pathogen, has not been entirely described. To chart the transcriptional responses of S. pneumoniae, we quantified the transcriptome under 22 different infection-relevant conditions. The transcriptomic compendium exposed a high level of dynamic expression and, strikingly, all annotated pneumococcal genomic features were expressed in at least one of the studied conditions. By computing the correlation of gene expression of every two genes across all studied conditions, we created a co-expression matrix that provides valuable information on both operon structure and regulatory processes. The co-expression data is highly consistent with well-characterized operons and regulons, such as the PyrR, ComE and ComX regulons, and has allowed us to identify a new member of the competence regulon. Finally, we created an interactive data center named PneumoExpress (www.veeninglab.com/pneumoexpress) that enables users to access the expression data as well as the co-expression matrix in an intuitive and efficient manner, providing a valuable resource to the pneumococcal research community.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference was first described in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Ever since, several new endogenous small RNA pathways have been described and characterized to different degrees. Much like plants, but unlike Drosophila and mammals, worms have RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRPs) that directly synthesize small RNAs using other transcripts as a template. The very prominent secondary small interfering RNAs, also called 22G-RNAs, produced by the RdRPs RRF-1 and EGO-1 in C. elegans, maintain the 5 triphosphate group, stemming from RdRP activity, also after loading into an Argonaute protein. This creates a technical issue, since 5PPP groups decrease cloning efficiency for small RNA sequencing. To increase cloning efficiency of these small RNA species, a common practice in the field is the treatment of RNA samples, prior to library preparation, with Tobacco Acid pyrophosphatase (TAP). Recently, TAP production and supply was discontinued, so an alternative must be devised. We turned to RNA 5 pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH), a commercially available pyrophosphatase isolated from E. coli. Here we directly compare TAP and RppH in their use for small RNA library preparation. We show that RppH-treated samples faithfully recapitulate TAP-treated samples. Specifically, there is enrichment for 22G-RNAs and mapped small RNA reads show no small RNA transcriptome-wide differences between RppH and TAP treatment. We propose that RppH can be used as a small RNA pyrophosphatase to enrich for triphosphorylated small RNA species and show that RppH- and TAP-derived datasets can be used in direct comparison.",

    "abstract": "Microbes affect each others growth in multiple, often elusive ways. The ensuing interdependencies form complex networks, believed to influence taxonomic composition, as well as community-level functional properties and dynamics. Elucidation of these networks is often pursued by measuring pairwise interaction in co-culture experiments. However, combinatorial complexity precludes the exhaustive experimental analysis of pairwise interactions even for moderately sized microbial communities. Here, we use a machine-learning random forest approach to address this challenge. In particular, we show how partial knowledge of a microbial interaction network, combined with trait-level representations of individual microbial species, can provide accurate inference of missing edges in the network and putative mechanisms underlying interactions. We applied our algorithm to two case studies: an experimentally mapped network of interactions between auxotrophic E. coli strains, and a large in silico network of metabolic interdependencies between 100 human gut-associated bacteria. For this last case, 5% of the network is enough to predict the remaining 95% with 80% accuracy, and mechanistic hypotheses produced by the algorithm accurately reflect known metabolic exchanges. Our approach, broadly applicable to any microbial or other ecological network, can drive the discovery of new interactions and new molecular mechanisms, both for therapeutic interventions involving natural communities and for the rational design of synthetic consortia.\\n\\nImportanceDifferent organisms in a microbial community may drastically affect each others growth phenotype, significantly affecting the community dynamics, with important implications for human and environmental health. Novel culturing methods and decreasing costs of sequencing will gradually enable high-throughput measurements of pairwise interactions in systematic co-culturing studies. However, a thorough characterization of all interactions that occur within a microbial community is greatly limited both by the combinatorial complexity of possible assortments, and by the limited biological insight that interaction measurements typically provide without laborious specific follow-ups. Here we show how a simple and flexible formal representation of microbial pairs can be used for classification of interactions with machine learning. The approach we propose predicts with high accuracy the outcome of yet to be performed experiments, and generates testable hypotheses about the mechanisms of specific interactions.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes, upon activation in response to brain injury, play a critical role in protecting neurons by limiting inflammation through the excessive secretion of many soluble factors, such as, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Unfortunately, excessive CSPGs paradoxically prohibit neuronal recovery and growth, and eventually constitute a scar tissue. Many studies have attempted to overcome this barrier through various molecular approaches including the removal of inhibitory CSPGs by applying chondroitinase enzymes. In this study, we examined whether click-xylosides, which serve as primers of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis, can compete with endogenous inhibitory CSPGs for GAG assembly by serving as decoy molecules and thereby potentially reverse reactive astrocyte mediated neuronal growth inhibition. We investigated the axonal growth of hippocampal neurons in the presence of xyloside treated and untreated reactive astrocyte-conditioned media as a model recapitulating brain injury. Click-xylosides were found to interfere with the GAG biosynthetic machinery in astrocytes and reduced the amount of secreted inhibitory CSPGs by competing with endogenous assembly sites. The extent of underglycosylation was directly related to the outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. Overall, this study suggests that click-xylosides are promising therapeutic agents to treat CNS injuries and warrants further in vivo investigations.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/286450v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (24K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185db74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10abd40org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eecadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d48112_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The nature of cortical plasticity in the course of learning is one of the most intriguing questions of the modern cognitive neuroscience. Aversive conditioning is a type of associative learning produced by continuous pairing of neutral and aversive stimuli. Aversive conditioning and electroencephalography together provide a good framework for expanding our knowledge about fast learning-related cortical changes. In our experiment we tested a novel paradigm to study associative learning where aversive conditioning was combined with passive oddball. We employed conditioned auditory neutral stimuli and unconditioned aversive electrical shocks and used time-frequency, connectivity and event-related potentials (ERP) analyses to explore their interaction. First, we observed changes in the cortical activity in the form of conditioning-induced multisensory integration. The integration manifested itself in (1) desynchronization of lower beta activity in the contralateral to expected electrical shocks hemisphere and (2) enhanced functional connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex in the gamma frequency band. Second, we found a larger amplitude of P3a and the late posterior positivity (LPP) components of ERP to conditioned stimuli, which may be related to increased attentional and emotional significance of these stimuli. Our results reproduced and extended previous findings about multisensory integration in classical conditioning and demonstrated the improved discriminability of ERP responses through incorporation of the oddball paradigm in associative learning.",

    "abstract": "Protein trafficking in the endosomal system involves the recognition of specific signals within the cytoplasmic domains (CDs) of transmembrane proteins by clathrin adaptors. One such signal is the phosphoserine acidic cluster (PSAC), the prototype of which is in the endoprotease Furin. How PSACs are recognized by clathrin adaptors has been controversial. We reported previously that HIV-1 Vpu, which modulates cellular immunoreceptors, contains a PSAC that binds to the {micro} subunits of clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes. Here, we show that the CD of Furin binds the {micro} subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Moreover, we identify a PSAC in a cytoplasmic loop of the cellular transmembrane Serinc3, an inhibitor of the infectivity of retroviruses. The two serines within the PSAC of Serinc3 are phosphorylated by casein kinase II and mediate interaction with the {micro} subunits in vitro. The sites of these serines vary among mammals in a manner consistent with host-pathogen conflict, yet the Serinc3-PSAC seems dispensible for anti-HIV activity and for counteraction by HIV-1 Nef. The CDs of Vpu, Furin, and the PSAC-containing loop of Serinc3 each bind the  subunit of AP-2 ({micro}2) with similar affinities, but they appear to utilize different basic regions on {micro}2. The Serinc3 loop requires a region previously reported to bind the acidic plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. These data suggest that the PSACs within different proteins recognize different basic regions on the {micro} surface, providing the potential to inhibit the activity of viral proteins without necessarily affecting cellular protein trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Here, we focus on testing and improving force fields for molecular modeling, which see widespread use in diverse areas of computational chemistry and biomolecular simulation. A key issue affecting the accuracy and transferrability of these force fields is the use of atom typing. Traditional approaches to defining molecular mechanics force fields must encode, within a discrete set of atom types, all information which will ever be needed about the chemical environment; parameters are then assigned by looking up combinations of these atom types in tables. This atom typing approach leads to a wide variety of problems such as inextensible atom-typing machinery, enormous difficulty in expanding parameters encoded by atom types, and unnecessarily proliferation of encoded parameters. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning parameters for molecular mechanics force fields based on the industry standard SMARTS chemical perception language (with extensions to identify specific atoms available in SMIRKS). In this approach, each force field term (bonds, angles, and torsions, and nonbonded interactions) features separate definitions assigned in a hierarchical manner without using atom types. We accomplish this using direct chemical perception, where parameters are assigned directly based on substructure queries operating on the molecule(s) being parameterized, thereby avoiding the intermediate step of assigning atom types -- a step which can be considered indirect chemical perception. Direct chemical perception allows for substantial simplification of force fields, as well as additional generality in the substructure queries. This approach is applicable to a wide variety of (bio)molecular systems, and can greatly reduce the number of parameters needed to create a complete force field. Further flexibility can also be gained by allowing force field terms to be interpolated based on the assignment of fractional bond orders via the same procedure used to assign partial charges. As an example of the utility of this approach, we provide a minimalist small molecule force field derived from Mercks parm@Frosst (an Amber parm99 descendant), in which a parameter definition file only {approx} 300 lines long can parameterize a large and diverse spectrum of pharmaceutically relevant small molecule chemical space. We benchmark this minimalist force field on the FreeSolv small molecule hydration free energy set and calculations of densities and dielectric constants from the ThermoML Archive, demonstrating that it achieves comparable accuracy to the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) that consists of many thousands of parameters.",

    "abstract": "Social environment influences drug consumption, its persistence and evolution. Little is known regarding the influence of the presence of a peer during drug consumption and especially how the relationship between peers (familiarity and dominance) can influence drug consumption. We used here a translational and transdisciplinary approach to explore the influence of peer presence and peer familiarity in rats and humans that self-administer stimulants. In rats, cocaine intake was compared when rats were alone with intake when peers with different characteristics (familiar or not, cocaine naive or not, dominant or subordinate) were present. In humans, 77 cocaine and/or methylphenidate users were asked to detail their most recent drug use episodes and their relationship with peers present at consumption. The results show that in both humans and rats, the risk of cocaine/stimulant consumption was significantly reduced by 37% and 32%, respectively, when a peer was present. Moreover, the lowest risk of consumption was consistently observed when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar) with a further 38% and 17% risk reduction, respectively. In rats, a decreased risk of consumption was greater when the peer was cocaine naive (vs non-cocaine naive).\\n\\nThe presence of a non-familiar and possibly drug-naive peer is the most efficient condition to diminish stimulant intake. Our results indirectly support the use of harm reduction strategies, in particular supervised consumption rooms for stimulant users.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in systems neuroscience is how spontaneous activity at rest is reorganized during task performance. Recent studies suggest a strong relationship between resting and task FC. Furthermore, the relationship between resting and task FC has been shown to reflect individual differences. Particularly, various studies have demonstrated that the FC has higher reliability and provides enhanced detection of individual differences while viewing natural scenes. Although the large-scale organization of FC during rest and movie-viewing conditions have been well studied in relation to individual variations, the re-organization of FC during viewing natural scenes have not been studied in depth. In this study, we used principal component analysis on FC during rest and movie-viewing condition to characterize the dimensionality of FC patterns across conditions and subjects. We found that the variations in FC patterns related to viewing natural scenes can be explained by a single component, which enables identification of the task over subjects with 100% accuracy. We showed that the FC mode associated to viewing natural scenes better reflects individual variations. Furthermore, we investigated the signatures of movie-viewing-specific functional modes in dynamic FC based on phase-locking values between brain regions. We found that the movie-specific functional mode is persistent across time; suggesting the emergence of a stable processing mode. To explain the reorganization of whole-brain FC through the changes in local dynamics, we appeal to a large-scale computational model. This modelling suggested that the reorganization of whole-brain FC is associated to the interaction between frontal-parietal and frontal-temporal activation patterns.",

The Bland-Altman plot indicated good agreement. The median number of home-collected DBS cards per participant was 24 over a median of 6.9 months. Repeated DBS C-peptide levels varied considerably within and between subjects. Adjustment for corresponding home glucose measurements reduced the variance permitting accurate description of changes over time. The correlation of the C-peptide slope over time assessed by repeated home DBS versus area under the curve during the two MMTTs was r=0{middle dot}73; p<0.001. Mixed models showed that a 1-month increase of diabetes duration was associated with 17 pmol/l decline in fasting DBS C-peptide, whereas increases of 1 mmol/l in glucose, 1 year older age-at-diagnosis and 100 pmol/l higher baseline plasma C-peptide were associated with 18, 17 and 61 pmol/l higher fasting DBS C-peptide levels, respectively. In addition, glucose responsiveness decreased with longer diabetes duration.\\n\\nConclusionOur approach permitted frequent assessment of C-peptide, making it feasible to monitor {beta}-cell function at home.

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma mobile exhibits a smooth gliding movement as does its membrane-permeabilized ghost model. This exceptionally prominent experimental system has allowed us to conclude that the energy source for M. mobile motility is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the gliding is largely comprised of repetitions of unitary steps of about 70 nm. In the present study, we show a new motility mode, in which the ghost model prepared with a high concentration of detergent exhibits directed rotational motions with a constant speed. With a rotational speed and viscous friction of a single ghost, the torque was estimated to be [~]30 pN nm at saturated [ATP]s. Although the origin of the rotation has not been conclusively settled, we found that rotary ghosts treated with sialyllactose, the binding target for leg proteins, were stopped. This result suggested that biomolecules embedded on the cell membrane nonspecifically attaches to the glass and works as a flexible pivot point, and the linear motion of the leg is a driving force for a rotary motion. This simple geometry exemplifies the new mechanism, by which the movement of a linear motor is efficiently converted to a constant rotation of the object on a micrometer scale.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical scientists face major challenges in developing novel drugs for unmet medical needs. Only a small fraction of early drug programs progress to the market, due to safety and efficacy failures, despite extensive efforts to predict drug and target safety as early as possible using a variety of assays in vitro and in preclinical species. In principle, characterizing the effect of natural variation in the genes encoding drug targets should present a powerful alternate approach to predict not only whether a protein will be an effective drug target, but also whether a protein will be an inherently safe drug target, while avoiding the challenges of translating biology from experiments in non-human species. We have embarked on a retrospective analysis, demonstrating for the first time a statistical link between the organ systems involved in genetic syndromes of drug target genes and the organ systems in which side effects are observed clinically. Across 1,819 drugs and 21 organ system phenotype categories analyzed, drug side effects are more likely to occur in organ systems where there is genetic evidence of a link between the drug target and a phenotype involving that organ system, compared to when there is no such genetic evidence (30.0% vs 19.2%; OR = 1.80). Conversely, we find that having genetic evidence of a Mendelian syndrome involving a drug target in which a certain organ system is unaffected decreases the likelihood that side effects will manifest in that organ system, relative to having no informative syndrome (18.5% vs 20.2%; OR = 0.89). We find a relationship between genetics and side effects even when controlling for known confounders such as drug delivery route and indication. We highlight examples where genetics of drug targets could have anticipated side effects observed during clinical trials. This result suggests that human genetic data should be routinely used to predict potential safety issues associated with novel drug targets. This may lead to selection of better targets, appropriate monitoring of putative side effects early in development, reduction of the use of preclinical animal experiments, and ultimately increased success of molecules. Furthermore, deeply phenotyping human knockouts will be critically important to understand the full spectrum of effects that a new drug may elicit.",

While telephone-based interventions targeting weight loss are used routinely in the general populations, the cost-effectiveness of referring patients with knee osteoarthritis to these is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service for patients with knee osteoarthritis, who are overweight or obese, compared to usual care.\n\nMethodsWe randomised 120 patients with knee osteoarthritis to an intervention or usual care control group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention group received a referral to an existing non-disease specific 6-month telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service. The primary outcome of the study was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs (healthcare services and medication use) and absenteeism costs due to knee pain. The primary cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective.\n\nResultsMean cost differences between groups (intervention minus control) were, $454 (95%CI: -2735 to 4206) for healthcare costs, $-36, (95%CI: -73 to 2) for medication costs, and $-13 (95%CI: -225 to 235) for absenteeism costs. The total mean difference in societal costs was $1022 (95%CI: -2201 to 4771). For all outcomes, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared with usual care was less than 0.33 at all willingness-to-pay values.\n\nConclusionFrom a societal perspective, telephone-based weight loss support, provided using an existing non-disease specific 6-month weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care for overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis for QALYs, pain intensity, disability, weight, and BMI.",

    "abstract": "Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a common adult muscular dystrophy in which the muscles of the face, shoulder blades and upper arms are among the most affected. FSHD is the only disease in which \\\"junk\\\" DNA is reactivated to cause disease, and the only known repeat array-related disease where fewer repeats cause disease. More than 95% of FSHD cases are associated with copy number loss of a 3.3kb tandem repeat (D4Z4 repeat) at the subtelomeric chromosomal region 4q35, of which the pathogenic allele contains less than 10 repeats and has a specific genomic configuration called 4qA. Currently, genetic diagnosis of FSHD requires pulsed-field gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blot, which is labor-intensive, semi-quantitative and requires long turnaround time. Here, we developed a novel approach for genetic diagnosis of FSHD, by leveraging Bionano Saphyr single-molecule optical mapping platform. Using a bioinformatics pipeline developed for this assay, we found that the method gives direct quantitative measurement of repeat numbers, can differentiate 4q35 and the highly paralogous 10q26 regions, can determine the 4qA/4qB allelic configuration, and can quantitate levels of post-zygotic mosaicism. We evaluated this approach on 5 patients (including two with post-zygotic mosaicism) and 2 patients (including one with post-zygotic mosaicism) from two separate cohorts, and had complete concordance with Southern blots, but with improved quantification of repeat numbers resolved between haplotypes. We concluded that single-molecule optical mapping is a viable approach for molecular diagnosis of FSHD and may be applied in clinical diagnostic settings once more validations are performed.",

    "abstract": "Performing quality control to detect image artifacts and data-processing errors is crucial in structural magnetic resonance imaging, especially in developmental studies. Currently, many studies rely on visual inspection by trained raters for quality control. The subjectivity of these manual procedures lessens comparability between studies, and with growing study sizes quality control is increasingly time consuming. In addition, both inter-rater as well as intra-rater variability of manual quality control is high and may lead to inclusion of poor quality scans and exclusion of scans of usable quality. In the current study we present the Qoala-T tool, which is an easy and free to use supervised-learning model to reduce rater bias and misclassification in manual quality control procedures. First, we manually rated quality of N = 784 FreeSurfer-processed T1-weighted scans. Different supervised-learning models were then compared to predict manual quality ratings. Results show that the Qoala-T tool using random forests is able to predict scan quality with both high sensitivity and specificity (mean area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98). In addition, the Qoala-T tool was also able to adequately predict the quality of a novel unseen dataset (N = 112; mean AUC = 0.95). These outcomes indicate that using Qoala-T in other datasets could greatly reduce the time needed for quality control. More importantly, this procedure could further help to reduce variability related to manual quality control, thereby benefiting the comparability of data quality between studies.",

Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes targeting clock components for degradation are known to mostly recognize phosphorylated substrates. A case in point is the circadian factor PERIOD 2 (PER2) whose phospho-specific turnover involves its recognition by {beta}-transducin repeat containing proteins ({beta}-TrCPs). Yet, the existence of this unique mode of regulation of PER2s stability falls short of explaining persistent oscillatory phenotypes reported in biological systems lacking functional elements of the phospho-dependent PER2 degradation machinery.\\n\\nIn this study, we challenge the phosphorylation-centric view that PER2 degradation enhances circadian rhythm robustness by i) identifying the PER2:MDM2 endogenous complex, ii) establishing PER2 as a previously uncharacterized substrate for MDM2, iii) revealing an alternative phosphorylation-independent mechanism for PER2 ubiquitin-mediated degradation, iv) pinpointing residues for ubiquitin modification, and v) establishing the importance of MDM2-mediated PER2 turnover for defining the circadian period length. Our results not only expand MDM2s suite of specific substrates beyond the cell cycle to include circadian components but also uncover novel regulatory players that likely impact our view of how other mechanisms crosstalk and modulate the clock itself.",
