    "abstract": "A trophic radiation in the South-American annual killifish genus Austrolebias has led to the evolution of large specialized piscivores from small generalized carnivores. It has been proposed that this occurred in a single series of vicariant speciation events. An alternative hypothesis is denoted giant-dwarf speciation: piscivores would have evolved in sympatry by character displacement and cannibalism. We test the plausibility of both scenarios using size measures combined with distributional data and new phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers.\\n\\nOur analysis uses historical biogeography models and Ornstein-Uehlenbeck processes describing trait evolution across the posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees. Large species most likely evolved three times from small ones. For the clade containing A. elongatus, we argue that vicariance was not involved in the origin of these large and specialized piscivores. They experience stabilizing selection with an optimum shifted towards larger bodies and longer jaws. The branch leading to this clade has the fastest evolving jaw lengths across the phylogeny, in agreement with expectations for giant-dwarf speciation. For A. wolterstorffi, the support for giant-dwarf speciation is weaker. When the species is placed at the root of Austrolebias, ancestral reconstructions are unreliable and vicariance cannot be ruled out. For the remaining large species, we can reject vicariance and giant dwarf speciation. Our results give rise to two new additional scenarios for the evolution of specialized piscivores. In the first, two successive speciation events in sympatry or parapatry produced large and piscivorous species. In the second, the immigration of a different annual killifish genus (Cynopoecilus) in the Patos area of endemism has contributed to in-situ diversification of Austrolebias species.",

    "abstract": "The sensory drive theory predicts that signals, sensory systems, and signaling behavior should coevolve. Variation in the sensory systems of prey and predators may explain the diversity of color signals, such as color polymorphism. The spider Gasteracantha cancriformis (Araneidae) possesses several conspicuous color morphs. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the color polymorphism of G. cancriformis may be maintained by pressure from multiple signal receivers, such as prey and predators with distinct color vision systems. Although, the multiple receivers world is a more realistic scenario, it has received little attention. In orb-web spiders, the prey attraction hypothesis states that conspicuous colors are prey lures that increase spider foraging success via flower mimicry. However, in highly defended species, conspicuous colors could also be a warning signal to predators. We used color vision modelling to estimate chromatic and achromatic contrast of G. cancriformis morphs as perceived by potential prey and predator taxa. Our results revealed that individual prey and predator taxa perceive the conspicuousness of morphs differently. For instance, the red morph is perceived as quite conspicuous to lepidopteran prey and avian predators, but not by other insects. Therefore, the multiple prey and predator hypotheses may explain the evolution of color polymorphism in G. cancriformis. However, flower mimicry hypothesis was weakly corroborated. Other parameters that are not evaluated by color vision models, such as distance, shape, angle, and pattern geometry could also affect the perception of color morphs by both prey and predators and thereby influence morph survival.",

    "abstract": "Clinical pain is difficult to study using standard Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging because it is often ongoing and, if evoked, it is associated with stimulus-correlated motion. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) offers an attractive alternative. This study used arm repositioning to evoke clinically-relevant musculoskeletal pain in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Fifty-five patients were scanned using a multi post-labelling delay pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) sequence, first with both arms along the body and then with the affected arm raised into a painful position. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned as a control group. Arm repositioning resulted in increased perfusion in brain regions involved in sensory processing and movement integration, such as the contralateral primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex, mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, and, bilaterally, in the insular cortex/operculum, putamen, thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum. Perfusion in the thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum was larger in the patient group. Results of a post hoc analysis suggested that the observed perfusion changes were related to pain rather than arm repositioning. This study showed that ASL can be useful in research on clinical ongoing musculoskeletal pain but the technique is not sensitive enough to detect small differences in perfusion.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue in evolutionary systems biology is understanding the relationship between the topological architecture of a biological network, such as a metabolic network, and the evolution of the network. The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa.\\n\\nWe report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The relationship between several measures of network centrality and sensitivity to mutation is weak, but point estimates of the correlation between network centrality and mutational variance are positive, with only one exception. There is a marginally significant correlation between core number and mutational heritability. There is a small but significant negative correlation between the shortest path length between a pair of metabolites and the mutational correlation between those metabolites.\\n\\nPositive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between shortest path length and the mutational correlation between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.",

    "abstract": "Lens-free digital in-line holography (LDIH) is a promising microscopic tool that overcomes several drawbacks (e.g., limited field of view) of traditional lens-based microcopy. However, extensive computation is required to reconstruct object images from the complex diffraction patterns produced by LDIH, which limits LDIH utility for point-of-care applications, particularly in resource limited settings. Here, we describe a deep transfer learning (DTL) based approach to process LDIH images in the context of cellular analyses. Specifically, we captured holograms of cells labeled with molecular-specific microbeads and trained neural networks to classify these holograms without reconstruction. Using raw holograms as input, the trained networks were able to classify individual cells according to the number of cell-bound microbeads. The DTL-based approach including a VGG19 pretrained network showed robust performance even with noisy experimental data. Combined with the developed DTL approach, LDIH could be realized as a low-cost, portable tool for point-of-care diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Temporal fluctuations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have been profitably used to study brain activity and connectivity for over two decades. Unfortunately, fMRI data also contain structured temporal \\\"noise\\\" from a variety of sources, including subject motion, subject physiology, and the MRI equipment. Recently, methods have been developed to automatically and selectively remove spatially specific structured noise from fMRI data using spatial Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and machine learning classifiers. Spatial ICA is particularly effective at removing spatially specific structured noise from high temporal and spatial resolution fMRI data of the type acquired by the Human Connectome Project and similar studies. However, spatial ICA is mathematically, by design, unable to separate spatially widespread \\\"global\\\" structured noise from fMRI data (e.g., blood flow modulations from subject respiration). No methods currently exist to selectively and completely remove global structured noise while retaining the global signal from neural activity. This has left the field in a quandary--to do or not to do global signal regression--given that both choices have substantial downsides. Here we show that temporal ICA can selectively segregate and remove global structured noise while retaining global neural signal in both task-based and resting state fMRI data. We compare the results before and after temporal ICA cleanup to those from global signal regression and show that temporal ICA cleanup removes the global positive biases caused by global physiological noise without inducing the network-specific negative biases of global signal regression. We believe that temporal ICA cleanup provides a \\\"best of both worlds\\\" solution to the global signal and global noise dilemma and that temporal ICA itself unlocks interesting neurobiological insights from fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "The engulfment of apoptotic cells is essential for tissue homeostasis and responding to damage. Engulfment is mediated by receptors that recognize ligands exposed on apoptotic cells, such as phosphatidylserine (PS). Here, we convert Drosophila S2 cells into proficient phagocytes by transfecting the Draper engulfment receptor and replacing apoptotic cells with PS-coated beads. We show that PS-ligated Draper forms microclusters that exclude a bulky transmembrane phosphatase and recruit phosphotyrosine binding proteins, revealing a triggering mechanism similar to the T cell receptor (TCR). Analogous to the TCR, Drapers extracellular domain and PS can be replaced with FRB and FKBP respectively, resulting in a rapamycin-inducible engulfment system. However, in contrast to the TCR, we show that localized signaling at Draper microclusters results in time-dependent depolymerization of actin filaments. Collectively, our results reveal mechanistic similarities and differences between the receptors involved in apoptotic corpse clearance and mammalian immunity and demonstrate that engulfment can be reprogrammed towards non-native targets.\\n\\nCondensed titleSpatial Control of Engulfment Signaling",

    "abstract": "The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell-types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.",

For most birds, incubation poses a trade-off between investing in self-maintenance and offspring care. Furthermore, incubation is affected by environmental temperatures and, therefore, will be likely impacted by climate change. Despite its relevance and readily available temperature logging methods, avian incubation research is hindered by recognised limitations in available software. In this paper, a new quantitative approach to analyse incubation behaviour is presented. This new approach is embedded in a free R package, incR. The flexibility of the R environment eases the analysis, validation and visualisation of incubation temperature data. The core algorithm in incR is validated here and it is shown that the method extracts accurate metrics of incubation behaviour (e.g. number and duration of incubation bouts).

In contrast to HKT2 transporters that have been shown to exhibit high affinity K+-dependent Na+ transport, HKT1 proteins have, with one exception, only been shown to catalyse low affinity Na+ transport and no K+ transport. Here, using heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes we show that both TmHKT1;5-A and TaHKT1;5-D encode dual (high and low) affinity Na+-transporters with the high-affinity component being abolished when external K+ is in excess of external Na+. Based on 3-D structural modelling we propose that tighter binding of K+, compared to that of Na+ in the selectivity filter region by means of additional van der Waals forces, explains the K+ block at the molecular level. The low-affinity component for Na+ transport of TmHKT1;5-A had a lower Km than that of TaHKT1;5-D and was less sensitive to external K+.

    "abstract": "Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a global response in plants induced at the site of infection that leads to long-lasting and broad-spectrum disease resistance at distal, uninfected tissues. Despite the importance of this priming mechanism, the identity of the mobile defense signal that moves systemically throughout plants to initiate SAR has remained elusive. In this paper, we describe a new metabolite, N-hydroxy-pipecolic acid (N-OH-Pip), and provide evidence that this molecule is a mobile signal that plays a central role in initiating SAR signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that FLAVIN-DEPENDENT MONOOXYGENASE 1 (FMO1), a key regulator of SAR-associated defense priming, can synthesize N-OH-Pip from pipecolic acid in planta, and exogenously applied N-OH-PIP moves systemically in Arabidopsis and can rescue the SAR-deficiency of fmo1 mutants. We also demonstrate that N-OH-Pip treatment causes systemic changes in the expression of pathogenesis-related genes and metabolic pathways throughout the plant, and enhances resistance to a bacterial pathogen. This work provides new insight into the chemical nature of a mobile signal for SAR and also suggests that the N-OH-Pip pathway is a promising target for metabolic engineering to enhance disease resistance.",

    "abstract": "When estimating psychometric functions with sampling procedures, psychophysical assessments should be precise and accurate while being as efficient as possible to reduce assessment duration. The estimation performance of sampling procedures is commonly evaluated in computer simulations for single psychometric functions and reported using metrics as a function of number of trials. However, the estimation performance of a sampling procedure may vary for different psychometric functions. Therefore, the results of these type of evaluations may not be generalizable to a heterogeneous population of interest. In addition, the maximum number of trials is often imposed by time restrictions, especially in clinical applications, making trial-based metrics suboptimal. Hence, the benefit of these simulations to select and tune an ideal sampling procedure for a specific application is limited. We suggest to evaluate the estimation performance of sampling procedures in simulations covering the entire range of psychometric functions found in a population of interest, and propose a comprehensive set of performance metrics for a detailed analysis. To illustrate the information gained from these metrics in an application example, six sampling procedures were evaluated in a computer simulation based on prior knowledge on the population distribution and requirements from proprioceptive assessments. The metrics revealed limitations of the sampling procedures, such as inhomogeneous or systematically decreasing performance depending on the psychometric functions, which can inform the tuning process of a sampling procedure. More advanced metrics allowed directly comparing overall performances of different sampling procedures and select the best-suited sampling procedure for the example application. The proposed analysis metrics can be used for any sampling procedure and the estimation of any parameter of a psychometric function, independent of the shape of the psychometric function and of how such a parameter was estimated. This framework should help to accelerate the development process of psychophysical assessments.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings demonstrate that iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors from SCA7 patients express molecular and electrophysiological differences that are indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic activity associated to neuron cell-death instead of cell-division is reported in neurodegenerative diseases. However, why mitotic activity can take place in supposedly postmitotic neurons and how it is associated to cell-death remains largely unexplained. To address these questions, we have studied the response of primary neurons to oncogenic deregulation using a fusion protein based on truncated Cyclin E and Cdk2. Oncogenic Cyclin E/Cdk2 elicits mitotic checkpoint signaling, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and cell-death. However, as in mitotic cells, checkpoint suppression enables oncogenic cell-cycle progression and neuronal division. Further, neurons actively adapt to the cell-cycle by losing and reforming the axon initial segment, which integrates synaptic inputs to sustain action potentials. We conclude that neurons are mitotic cells in a reversible quiescent-like state, which is falsely portrayed as irreversible by mitotic checkpoints. In extension, neuronal death in lieu of cell-division reflects oncosuppressive checkpoint signaling.",

    "abstract": "How cells track their position during the segmentation of the vertebrate body remains elusive. For decades, this process has been interpreted according to the clock-and-wavefront model, where molecular oscillators set the frequency of somite formation while the positional information is encoded in signaling gradients. Recent experiments using ex vivo explants challenge this interpretation, suggesting that positional information is encoded in the properties of the oscillators. Here, we propose that positional information is encoded in the differential levels of neighboring oscillators. The differences gradually increase because both the oscillator amplitude and the period increase with time. When this difference exceeds a certain threshold, the segmentation program starts. Using this framework, we quantitatively fit experimental data from in vivo and ex vivo mouse segmentation, and propose mechanisms of somite scaling. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of spatial pattern formation based on the local interactions between dynamic molecular oscillators.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFatty acids (FAs) constitute a considerable fraction of all lipid molecules with a fundamental role in numerous physiological processes. In animals, the majority of complex lipid molecules are derived from the transformation of FAs through several biochemical pathways. Yet, for FAs to enroll in these pathways they require an activation step. FA activation is catalyzed by the rate limiting action of Acyl-CoA synthases. Several Acyl-CoA enzyme families have been previously described and classified according to the chain length of FA they process. Here, we address the evolutionary history of the ACSBG gene family which activates, FA with more than 16 carbons. Currently, two different ACSBG gene families, ACSBG1 and ACSBG2, are recognized in vertebrates. We provide evidence that a wider and unequal ACSBG gene repertoire is present in vertebrate lineages. We identify a novel ACSBG-like gene lineage which occurs specifically in amphibians, ray finned fish, coelacanths and chondrichthyes named ACSBG3. Also, we show that the ACSBG2 gene lineage duplicated in the Theria ancestor. Our findings, thus offer a far richer understanding on FA activation in vertebrates and provide key insights into the relevance of comparative and functional analysis to perceive physiological differences, namely those related with lipid metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease which arises from mutations in the dystrophin gene (DMD) that result in the absence or severe reduction of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. In addition to the primary dystrophin defect, secondary processes such as inflammation, calcium influx, dysregulated autophagy and fibrosis exacerbate dystrophic pathology and thus increase disease progression. While therapies to restore dystrophin deficiency are being developed, strategies which target these secondary processes could be of benefit to patients. Benfotiamine is a lipid soluble precursor to thiamine that can reduce secondary processes such as inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. As such we tested it in the mdx mouse model of DMD and found that benfotiamine reduced multiple markers of dystrophic pathology and improved grip strength. In addition, members of the utrophin and dystrophin glycoprotein complexes were significantly increased at the sarcolemma which could improve cell adhesion. We also demonstrated that benfotiamine treatment lowered the expression of macrophage markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that benfotiamine is reducing dystrophic pathology by acting on inflammatory processes.",

We aimed to use Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) gene editing technique to induce forced down-regulation of the circRNA which consequently modified miRNA expression in HepG2 cell line to prove the regulatory relationship between the RNA parts of an in silico-detected competing endogenous RNA network in HCC\\n\\nMethodWe first retrieved hsa_circ_0000064-miR-1285-TRIM2 mRNA from public microarray databases followed by in silico modelling to mimic the regulation kinetics of cirRNA associated ceRNA network.

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion is a pivotal organelle for energy production, and includes components encoded by both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. How these two genomes coevolve is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Here we initially investigate the evolutionary rates of mitochondrial components (oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and ribosomal RNAs) and nuclear-encoded proteins associated with mitochondria, across the major orders of holometabolous insects. There are significant evolutionary rate correlations (ERCs) between mitochondria and mitochondria-associated nuclear-encoded proteins, which is likely driven by different rates of mitochondrial sequence evolution and compensatory changes in the interacting nuclear-encoded proteins. The pattern holds after correction for phylogenetic relationships and considering protein conservation levels. Correlations are stronger for nuclear-encoded OXPHOS proteins in contact with mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS proteins and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal amino acids directly contacting the mitochondrial rRNA. Mitochondrial-associated proteins show apparent rate acceleration over evolutionary time, but we suspect this pattern to be due to artifacts (e.g. rate estimation or calibration bias). We find that ERC between mitochondrial and nuclear proteins is a strong predictor of nuclear proteins known to interact with mitochondria, and therefore ERCs can be used to predict new candidate nuclear proteins with mitochondrial function. Using this approach, we detect proteins with high ERCs but not with known mitochondrial function based on gene ontology (GO). Manual screening of the literature revealed potential mitochondrial function for some of these proteins in humans or yeast. Their holometabolous ERCs therefore indicate these proteins may have phylogenetically conserved mitochondrial function. Twenty three additional candidates warrant further study for mitochondrial function based on this approach, including ERC evidence that proteins in the minichromosome maintenance helicase (MCM) complex interact with mitochondria. We conclude that the ERC method shows promise for identifying new candidate proteins with mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "Microstructural changes of white matter (WM) tracts are known to be associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders/diseases. Heritability of structural changes of WM tracts has been examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in family-based studies for different age groups. The availability of genetic and DTI data from recent large population-based studies offers opportunity to further improve our understanding of genetic contributions. Here, we analyzed the genetic architecture of WM tracts using DTI and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of unrelated individuals in the UK Biobank (n [~] 8000). The DTI parameters were generated using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. We found that DTI parameters are substantially heritable on most WM tracts. We observed a highly polygenic or omnigenic architecture of genetic influence across the genome as well as the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Our bivariate analyses showed strong genetic correlations for several pairs of WM tracts as well as pairs of DTI parameters. We performed voxel-based analysis to illustrate the pattern of genetic effects on selected parts of the tract-based spatial statistics skeleton. Comparing the estimates from the UK Biobank to those from small population-based studies, we illustrated that sufficiently large sample size is essential for genetic architecture discovery in imaging genetics. We confirmed this finding with a simulation study.",

    "abstract": "Long-range descending projections from the auditory cortex play key roles in shaping response properties in the inferior colliculus. The auditory corticocollicular projection is massive and heterogeneous, with axons emanating from cortical layers 5 and 6, and plays a key role in directing plastic changes in the inferior colliculus. However, little is known about the cortical and thalamic networks within which corticocollicular neurons are embedded. Here, laser scanning photostimulation glutamate uncaging and photoactivation of channelrhodopsin-2 were used to probe the local and long-range network differences between pre-identified mouse layer 5 and layer 6 auditory corticocollicular neurons in vitro. Layer 5 corticocollicular neurons were found to vertically integrate supragranular excitatory and inhibitory input to a substantially greater degree than their layer 6 counterparts. In addition, all layer 5 corticocollicular neurons received direct and large thalamic inputs from channelrhodopsin-2 labeled thalamocortical fibers whereas such inputs were less common in layer 6 corticocollicular neurons. Finally, a new low calcium/synaptic blockade approach to separate direct from indirect inputs using laser photostimulation was validated. These data demonstrate that layer 5 and 6 corticocollicular neurons receive distinct sets of cortical and thalamic inputs, supporting the hypothesis that they have divergent roles in modulating the inferior colliculus. Furthermore, the direct connection between the auditory thalamus and layer 5 corticocollicular neurons reveals a novel and rapid link connecting ascending and descending pathways.",

    "abstract": "Axonal morphology displays large variability and complexity, yet the canonical regularities of the cortex suggest that such wiring is based on the repeated initiation of a small set of genetically encoded rules. Extracting underlying developmental principles can hence shed light on what genetically encoded instructions must be available during cortical development. Within a generative model, we investigate growth rules for axonal branching patterns in cat area 17, originating from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. This target area of synaptic connections is characterized by extensive ramifications and a high bouton density, characteristics thought to preserve the spatial resolution of receptive fields and to enable connections for the ocular dominance columns. We compare individual and global statistics, such as a newly introduced asymmetry index and the global segment-length distribution, of generated and real branching patterns as the benchmark for growth rules. We show that the proposed model surpasses the statistical accuracy of the Galton-Watson model, which is the most commonly employed model for biological growth processes. In contrast to the Galton-Watson model, our model can recreate the log-normal segment-length distribution of the experimental dataset and is considerably more accurate in recreating individual axonal morphologies. To provide a biophysical interpretation for statistical quantifications of the axonal branching patterns, the generative model is ported into the physically accurate simulation framework of Cx3D. In this simulation environment we demonstrate how the proposed growth process can be formulated as an interactive process between genetic growth rules and chemical cues in the local environment.",

In the current report, we develop a method for estimating semantic encoding models that generalize across individuals. Functional MRI was used to measure brain responses while participants freely viewed a naturalistic audiovisual movie. Word embeddings capturing agent-, action-, object-, and scene-related semantic content were assigned to each imaging volume based on an annotation of the film. We constructed both conventional within-subject semantic encoding models and between-subject models where the model was trained on a subset of participants and validated on a left-out participant. Between-subject models were trained using cortical surface-based anatomical normalization or surface-based whole-cortex hyperalignment. We used hyperalignment to project group data into an individuals unique anatomical space via a common representational space, thus leveraging a larger volume of data for out-of-sample prediction while preserving the individuals fine-grained functional-anatomical idiosyncrasies. Our findings demonstrate that anatomical normalization degrades the spatial specificity of between-subject encoding models relative to within-subject models. Hyperalignment, on the other hand, recovers the spatial specificity of semantic tuning lost during anatomical normalization, and yields model performance exceeding that of within-subject models.",

Defective signal transductions, which are associated with protein phosphorylation, have been revealed to link to many human diseases, such as cancer. Defining the organization of the phosphorylation-based signaling network and, in particular, identifying kinase-specific substrates can help reveal the molecular mechanism of the signaling network. Here, we present DeepSignal, a deep learning framework for predicting the substrate specificity for kinase/SH2 sequences with or without mutations. Empowered by the memory and selection mechanism of recurrent neural network, DeepSignal can identify important specificity-defining residues to predict kinase specificity and changes upon mutations. Evaluated on several public benchmark datasets, DeepSignal significantly outperforms current methods on predicting substrate specificity on both kinase and SH2 domains. Further analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrated that DeepSignal is able to aggregate mutations on both kinase/SH2 domains and substrates to quantify binding specificity changes, predict cancer genes related to signaling transduction, and identify novel perturbed pathways.\\n\\nAvailabilityImplementation of DeepSignal is at https://github.com/luoyunan/DeepSignal",

Based on the findings in a recent quantitative experiment on pancreatic cancer we developed a general evolutionary model, accounting for interactions between different cell populations through paracrine or juxtacrine factors. We show that the emergence of a stable heterogeneous state in a tumor requires an unequal allocation of paracrine growth factors (\\\"public goods\\\") between cells that produce them and those that merely consume them. Our model provides a quantitative explanation of recent in vitro experimental studies in pancreatic cancer in which insulin growth factor (IGF-II) plays the role of public goods. The calculated phase diagrams as a function of exogenous resources and fraction of growth factor producing cells show ITH persists only in a narrow range of concentration of exogenous IGF-II. Remarkably, maintenance of ITH requires cooperation among tumor cell subpopulations in harsh conditions, specified by lack of exogenous IGF-II, whereas surplus exogenous IGF-II elicits competition. The theory also quantitatively accounts for measured in vivo tumor growth in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The predictions for GBM tumor growth as a function of the fraction of tumor cells are amenable to experimental tests. The mechanism for ITH also provides hints for devising efficacious therapies.",

    "abstract": "Learning is a general mechanism of adaptive behavioural plasticity whose benefits and costs depend on the environment. Thus, seasonal oscillations in temperate environments between winter and summer might produce cyclical selection pressures that would drive rapid evolution of learning performance in multivoltine populations. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of learning ability over this rapid seasonal timescale in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster. Associative learning was tested in common garden-raised flies collected from nature in the spring and fall over three consecutive years. The spring flies consistently learned better than fall flies, revealing seasonal evolution of improved learning performance in nature. Fecundity showed the opposite seasonal pattern, suggesting a trade-off between learning and reproduction. This trade-off also held within population: more fecund individual females learned less well. This trade-off is mediated at least in part by natural polymorphism in the RNA binding protein couch potato (cpo), with a genotype favoured during summer showing poorer learning performance and higher fecundity than a genotype favoured over winter. Thus, seasonal environments can drive rapid cyclical evolution of learning performance, but the evolutionary dynamics may be driven by trade-offs generated by pleiotropic effects of causative alleles selected for other reasons.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a heterozygous diploid yeast that is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and a prevalent opportunistic pathogen. Here, whole-genome sequencing was performed on multiple C. albicans isolates passaged in different niches to characterize the complete spectrum of mutations arising during microevolution. We reveal that evolution during short time-scales (<600 generations) is driven by both de novo base substitutions and short-tract loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. In contrast, large-scale chromosomal changes are relatively rare, although chromosome 7 trisomies repeatedly emerged during passaging in one GI colonization model. Both strain background and chromosomal features affected mutational patterns, with mutation rates being greatly elevated in regions adjacent to emergent LOH tracts. Mutation rates were also elevated during host infection where genomes showed strong evidence of purifying selection. These results establish the genetic events driving C. albicans evolution and that this heterozygous diploid is extensively shaped by purifying selection.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region is widely used to survey microbial communities. Specialized ribosomal sequence databases have been developed to support this approach including Greengenes, SILVA and RDP. Most taxonomy annotations in these databases are predictions from sequence rather than authoritative assignments based on studies of type strains or isolates. Here, I investigate the error rates of taxonomy annotations in these databases. I found 253,485 sequences with conflicting annotations in SILVA v128 and Greengenes v13.5 at ranks up to phylum (9,644 conflicts), indicating that the annotation error rate in these databases is ~15%. I found that 34% of non-singleton genera have overlapping subtrees in the Greengenes tree from 2001 according to the RDP taxonomy, most of which are probably due to branching order errors in the Greengenes tree, which is therefore an unreliable guide to phylogeny. Using a blinded test, I estimated that the annotation error rate of the RDP database is ~10%.",

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer mediates viral entry into cells and is the major target for the host antibody response. In infected cells, the mature Env [(gp120/gp41)3] is produced by cleavage of a trimeric gp160 precursor. Proteolytic cleavage decreases Env conformational flexibility, allowing the mature Env to resist antibody binding to conserved elements. The conformational plasticity of the Env precursor skews the humoral immune response towards the elicitation of ineffectual antibodies, contributing to HIV-1 persistence in the infected host. The structural basis for the plasticity of the Env precursor remains elusive. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to visualize two coexisting conformational states of the full-length Env precursor at nominal resolutions of 5.5 and 8.0 [A]. The State-P2 conformation features a three-helix bundle of the gp41 heptad repeat region in the core, but has disordered membrane-interactive regions. State-P1 trimers lack the three-helix bundle and instead retain ordered transmembrane and membrane-proximal external regions embracing a central cavity. Our structural data shed light on the unusual plasticity of the Env precursor and provide new clues to Env immunogen discovery.",
