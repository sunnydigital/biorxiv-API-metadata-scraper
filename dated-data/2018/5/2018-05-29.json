    "abstract": "In the study of DNA methylation, genetic variation between species, strains, or individuals can result in CpG sites that are exclusive to a subset of samples, and insertions and deletions can rearrange the spatial distribution of CpGs. How to account for this variation in an analysis of the interplay between sequence variation and DNA methylation is not well understood, especially when the number of CpG differences between samples is large. Here we use whole-genome bisulfite sequencint data on two highly divergent inbred mouse strains to study this problem. We find that while the large number of strain-specific CpGs necessitates considerations regarding the reference genomes used during alignment, properties such as CpG density are surprisingly conserved across the genome. We introduce a method for including strain-specific CpGs in differential analysis, and show that accounting for strain-specific CpGs increases the power to find differentially methylated regions between the strains. Our method uses smoothing to impute methylation levels at strain-specific sites, thereby allowing strain-specific CpGs to contribute to the analysis, and also allowing us to account for differences in the spatial occurrences of CpGs. Our results have implications for analysis of genetic variation and DNA methylation using bisulfite-converted DNA.",

    "abstract": "Early prediction of complex disorders (e.g., autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders) is one of the fundamental goals of precision medicine and personalized genomics. An early prediction of complex disorders can have a significant impact on increasing the effectiveness of interventions and treatments in improving the prognosis and, in many cases, enhancing the quality of life in the affected patients. Considering the genetic heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders, we are proposing a novel framework for utilizing rare coding variation for early prediction of these disorders in subset of affected samples. We provide a novel formulation for the Ultra-Accurate Disorder Prediction (UADP) problem and develop a combinatorial framework for solving this problem. The primary goal of this framework, denoted as Odin (Oracle for DIsorder predictioN), is to make prediction for a subset of affected cases while having very low false positive rate prediction for unaffected samples. Note that in the Odin framework we will take advantage of the available functional information (e.g., pairwise coexpression of genes during brain development) to increase the prediction power beyond genes with recurrent variants. Application of our method accurately recovers an additional 8% of autism cases without a sever variant in a known recurrent mutated genes with a less than 1% false positive rate. Furthermore, Odin predicted a set of 391 genes that severe variants in these genes can cause autism or other developmental delay disorders.

    "abstract": "Although driver genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been investigated in various previous genetic studies, prevalence of key driver genes among heterogeneous populations is unknown. Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients overall survival. Some driver genes are significantly linked to HCC gender (CTNNB1, ALB, TP53 and AXIN1), race (TP53 and CDKN2A), and age (RB1) disparities. This study prioritizes a group of consensus drivers in HCC, which collectively show vast impacts on the phenotypes. These driver genes may warrant as valuable therapeutic targets of HCC.",

The objective of this study was to document migratory life histories of native galaxiids and introduced salmonids from a wide latitudinal range in Chilean Patagonia (39-48{degrees}S). Otolith microchemistry data were analysed using a recursive partitioning approach to test for diadromy. Based on annular analysis of Sr:Ca ratios, a diadromous life history was detected for populations of native Aplochiton taeniatus, A. marinus, and Galaxias maculatus. Lifetime residency in freshwater was suggested for populations of A. zebra and G. platei. Among introduced salmonids, populations of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. kisutch exhibited anadromous migratory patterns, whereas the population of O. mykiss screened appeared restricted to freshwater. Salmo trutta exhibited variable habitat use consistent with establishment of an ocean-type life history in some populations. The capacity and geographic scope of hydropower development is increasing and may disrupt migratory routes of diadromous fishes. Identification of diadromous species is a critical first step for preventing their loss due to hydropower development.",

    "abstract": "Stomata control gas exchanges between the plant and the atmosphere. How natural variation in stomata size and density contributes to resolve trade-offs between carbon uptake and water-loss in response to local climatic variation is not yet understood. We developed an automated confocal microscopy approach to characterize natural genetic variation in stomatal patterning in 330 fully-sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana accessions collected throughout the European range of the species. We compared this to variation in water-use efficiency, measured as carbon isotope discrimination ({delta}13C). We detect substantial genetic variation for stomata size and density segregating within Arabidopsis thaliana. A positive correlation between stomata size and {delta}13C further suggests that this variation has consequences on water-use efficiency. Genome-wide association analyses indicate a complex genetic architecture underlying not only variation in stomata patterning but also to its co-variation with carbon uptake parameters. Yet, we report two novel QTL affecting {delta}13C independently of stomata patterning. This suggests that, in A. thaliana, both morphological and physiological variants contribute to genetic variance in water-use efficiency. Patterns of regional differentiation and co-variation with climatic parameters indicate that natural selection has contributed to shape some of this variation, especially in Southern Sweden, where water availability is more limited in spring relative to summer. These conditions are expected to favor the evolution of drought avoidance mechanisms over drought escape strategies.",

    "abstract": "Oscillations are crucial to the sustenance of living organisms, across a wide variety of biological processes. In eukaryotes, oscillatory dynamics are thought to arise from interactions at the protein and RNA levels; however, the role of non-coding RNA in regulating these dynamics remains understudied. In this work, using a mathematical model, we show how non-coding RNA acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges in a conserved miRNA - transcription factor feedback motif, can give rise to oscillatory behaviour. Control of these non-coding RNA can dynamically create oscillations or stability, and we show how this behaviour predisposes to oscillations in the stochastic limit. These results, supported by emerging evidence for the role of miRNA sponges in development, point towards key roles of different species of miRNA sponges, such as circular RNA, potentially in the maintenance of yet unexplained oscillatory behaviour. These results help to provide a paradigm for understanding functional differences between the many redundant, but distinct RNA species thought to act as miRNA sponges in nature, such as long non-coding RNA, pseudogenes, competing mRNA, circular RNA, and 3 UTRs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe analyze the effects of a newly discovered species of non-coding RNA, acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, on intracellular signalling dynamics. We show that oscillatory behaviour can arise in a time-varying manner in an over-represented transcriptional feedback network.

    "abstract": "To discover novel genetic risk factors underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we aggregated exomes from 3,864 cases and 7,839 ancestry matched controls. We observed a significant excess of ultra-rare and rare protein-truncating variants (PTV) among ALS cases, which was primarily concentrated in constrained genes; however, a significant enrichment in PTVs does persist in the remaining exome. Through gene level analyses, known ALS genes, SOD1, NEK1, and FUS, were the most strongly associated with disease status. We also observed suggestive statistical evidence for multiple novel genes including DNAJC7, which is a highly constrained gene and a member of the heat shock protein family (HSP40). HSP40 proteins, along with HSP70 proteins, facilitate protein homeostasis, such as folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, and clearance of degraded proteins. When these processes are not regulated, misfolding and accumulation of degraded proteins can occur leading to aberrant protein aggregation, one of the pathological hallmarks of neurodegeneration.",

Plant-derived vesicles are receiving more and more attention due to their potential as nanovectors for the delivery of biologically active substances. We aimed to expand our understanding about the heterogeneity and the protein biocargo of citrus fruit juice sac cell-derived vesicles. Micro- and nano-sized vesicle fractions were isolated from four citrus species, C. sinensis, C. limon, C. paradisi and C. aurantium, characterized using physicochemical methods and protein cargos were compared using label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics. In each sample approximately 600-800 proteins were identified. Orthologues of most of the top-ranking proteins have previously been reported in extracellular vesicles of mammalian origin. High expression of patellin-3-like, clathrin heavy chain, HSPs, 14-3-3 protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 6 could be observed in all the vesicle samples while Aquaporin was highly expressed only in nanovesicles. Bioinformatics revealed more than hundred protein orthologues potentially implicated in vesicular trafficking. In particular, the presence of CCV, COPI and COPII coat proteins indicates the presence of highly heterogeneous populations of intracellular transport vesicles. Moreover, the differential expressions of hydrolases and oxidoreductases enabled us to gain insights into their functions in citrus fruit sac cells.",

The model can make reliable predictions for 3D structures of extensive dsRNAs with/without bulge/internal loops from their sequences, and the involvement of the structure-based electrostatic potential and corresponding ion condition can improve the predictions on 3D structures of dsRNAs in ion solutions. Furthermore, the model can make good predictions on thermal stability for extensive dsRNAs over the wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations, and our analyses show that thermally unfolding pathway of a dsRNA is generally dependent on its length as well as its sequence. In addition, the model was employed to examine the salt-dependent flexibility of a dsRNA helix and the calculated salt-dependent persistence lengths are in good accordance with experiments.",

At E15.5 when Ebf2-EGFP+ cells are mostly CR neurons, single-cell sequencing analysis of purified Ebf2-EGFP+ cells uncovers molecular heterogeneity in CR neurons, but without apparent clustering of cells with distinct regional origins. Along a pseudotemporal trajectory these cells are classified into three different developing states, revealing genetic cascades from early generic neuronal differentiation to late fate specification during the establishment of CR neuron identity and function. Further genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses at multiple early neurogenic stages have revealed the temporal gene expression dynamics of early neurogenesis and distinct histone modification patterns in early differentiating neurons. We have also identified a new set of coding genes and lncRNAs involved in early neuronal differentiation and validated with functional assays In Vitro and In Vivo. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms governing the early differentiation steps during cortical development, especially CR neuron biology, and help understand the developmental basis for cortical function and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Rare variants are of increasing interest to genetic association studies because of their etiological contributions to human complex diseases. Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal. Constructed under a kernel machine framework, POINT performs local association testing by borrowing information from neighboring variants in the 3-dimensional protein space in a data-adaptive fashion. Besides merely providing a list of promising variants, POINT assigns each variant a p-value to permit variant ranking and prioritization. We assess the selection performance of POINT using simulations and illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants in PCSK9 associated with low-density lipoprotein in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhile it is known that rare variants play an important role in understanding associations between genotype and complex diseases, pinpointing individual rare variants likely to be responsible for association is still a daunting task. Due to their low frequency in the population and reduced signal, localizing causal rare variants often requires additional information, such as type of DNA change or location of variant along the sequence, to be incorporated in a biologically meaningful fashion that does not overpower the genotype data. In this paper, we use the observation that important variants tend to cluster together on functional domains to propose a new approach for prioritizing rare variants: the protein structure guided local test (POINT). POINT uses a genes 3-dimensional protein folding structure to guide aggregation of information from neighboring variants in the protein in a robust manner. We show how POINT improves selection performance over single variant tests and sliding window approaches. We further illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants using the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data, finding five promising variants within PCSK9 in association with low-density lipoprotein, including three new mutations near the PCSK9-LDLR binding domain.",

    "abstract": "Although we are in the third decade of climate science communication as a discipline, and there is overwhelming scientific consensus and physical evidence for climate change, the general public continues to wrestle with climate change policy and advocacy. Early adolescence (12 to 13 years old) is a critical but under-researched demographic for the formation of attitudes related to climate change. This paper presents opinions on the worry, cause, and imminence of climate change that were collected from n=463 1st year secondary school students (12-13 years old) in public secondary schools in inner-urban centres in Austria and Australia. Overall, 86.83% of eligible respondents agreed that climate change was probably or definitely something we should worry about, 80.33% agreed that climate change was probably or definitely caused by humans, and 83.17% agreed that climate change was probably or definitely something that was happening now. The respondents opinions were also compared to their respective adult population, with Australian 12-13 year olds showing strong positive climate-friendly attitudes, both in comparison to their adult population, and to their Austrian peers. In addition, although the opinions of Austrian 12-13 year olds were quite high, they did not reflect the higher climate-friendly opinions of their adult community. Our results suggest that socio-cultural worldview or socio-cultural cognition theory may not have the influence on this age group as it does on the respective adult population - and, if they are affected, there are attitudes or factors in this age group which resist the opinion-influence from their mature community. These findings are significant as early adolescents may be pivotal in the climate science communication arena and investigating their opinions with regard to climate change may offer an unexplored and under-utilised target for future communication efforts and climate literacy programmes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeveloping guidelines and policies is critical to address HIV-related stigma and discrimination (SAD) in healthcare settings. To this end, a multidisciplinary panel developed a guideline to reduce SAD. This project evaluated the appropriateness of implementing the guideline in the Ethiopian context.\\n\\nMethodsA consensus of the expert panel was established through a Delphi technique which was followed by a panel meeting. Initial tentative recommendations were distributed to experts through e-mails to be evaluated using the modified guideline implementability appraisal (GLIA) v.2.0 checklist.\\n\\nResultsIn the first round of the Delphi survey, all (13) panel members evaluated the guideline. The overall score for the general domain of the modified GLIA checklist was 96.56%. The scores for individual recommendations ranged from 68.33% to 92.76%. Maximum and minimum scores were attained for measurability (97.71%) and flexibility (59.77%) domains respectively. Percentages mean score lower than 75% was obtained for flexibility and validity domains. Participants suggested that additional tools and training should be added to the guideline. In the second round of the survey, all the recommendations received endorsement with scores above 75%. Maximum and minimum scores were attained for measurability (100%) and flexibility (86.88%) domains respectively.

    "abstract": "Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is an important problem in many medical and biological applications since treatments may have different effects on the prognoses of different patients. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify the subgroups that with different responds to a treatment, and they rely on a fitness criterion to minimize the error between the estimated treatment effects and the unobservable true effects. In this paper, we propose that a heterogeneity criterion, which maximizes the differences of treatment effects among the subgroups, also needs to be considered. Moreover, we show that better performances can be achieved when the fitness and the heterogeneous criteria are considered simultaneously. Selecting the optimal splitting points then becomes a multi-objective problem; however, a solution that achieves optimal in both aspects are often not available. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-objective splitting procedure to balance both criteria. The proposed procedure is computationally efficient and fits naturally into the existing recursive partitioning framework. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-objective approach performs consistently better than existing ones.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe effects of a treatment are often not the same for different individuals with different gene expressions. Learning to predict the heterogeneous treatment effects from clinical and expression data is an important step towards personalized medical treatment. Existing computational methods are not ideal for the task because they do not address the interpretability of the model and do not consider the limited sample sizes in biological and medical applications. Our method addresses these issues and achieves superior performance in analyzing the treatment effects of radiotherapy on breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The fitness of spatially expanding species has been shown to decrease over time and space, but specialist species tracking their changing environment and shifting their range accordingly have been little studied. We use individual-based simulations and analytical modeling to compare the impact of range expansions and range shifts on genetic diversity and fitness loss, as well as the ability to recover fitness after either a shift or expansion. We find that the speed of a shift has a strong impact on fitness evolution. Fastest shifts show the strongest fitness loss per generation, but intermediate shift speeds lead to the strongest fitness loss per geographic distance. Range shifting species lose fitness more slowly through time than expanding species, however, their fitness compared at equivalent geographic distances spread can be considerably lower. These counter-intuitive results arise from the combination of time over which selection acts and mutations enter the system. Range shifts also exhibit reduced fitness recovery after a geographic shift and may result in extinction, whereas range expansions can persist from the core of the species range. The complexity of range expansions and range shifts highlights the potential for severe consequences of environmental change on species survival.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAs environments change through time across the globe, species must adapt or relocate to survive. Specialized species must track the specific moving environments to which they are adapted, as compared to generalists which can spread widely. During colonization of new habitat, individuals can accumulate deleterious alleles through repeated bottlenecks. We show through simulation and analytic modeling that the process by which these alleles accumulate changes depending upon the speed at which populations spread over a landscape. This is due to the increased efficacy of selection against deleterious variants at slow speeds of range shifts and decreased input of mutations at faster speeds of range shifts. Under some selective circumstances, shifting of a species range leads to extinction of the entire population. This suggests that the rate of environmental change across the globe will play a large role in the survival of specialist species as compared to more generalist species.",

    "abstract": "This work provides theoretical tools to analyse the transcriptional effects of certain biochemical mechanisms (i.e. affinity and cooperativity) that have been proposed in previous literature to explain the differential spatial expression of Hedgehog target genes involved in Drosophila development. Specifically we have focused on the expression of decapentaplegic and patched. The transcription of these genes is believed to be controlled by opposing gradients of the activator and repressor forms of the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). This study is based on a thermodynamic approach, which provides expression rates for these genes. These expression rates are controlled by transcription factors which are competing and cooperating for common binding sites. We have made mathematical representations of the different expression rates which depend on multiple factors and variables. The expressions obtained with the model have been refined to produce simpler equivalent formulae which allow for their mathematical analysis. Thanks to this, we can evaluate the correlation between the different interactions involved in transcription and the biological features observed at tissular level. These mathematical models can be applied to other morphogenes to help understand the complex transcriptional logic of opposing activator and repressor gradients.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMorphogenic differentiation is a complex process that involves emission, reception and cellular response to different signals. It is well known that the same morphogenic signal can give rise to different cellular transcriptional responses that usually depend, among other factors, on transcription factors. In concordance with the activator threshold model, classically it has been distinguished between high and low threshold target genes in order to explain how cells receiving the same signal can activate different genes. However, in particular cases where the transcription is controlled by two opposing transcription factors, it has been tested that this logic is not valid. This motivates the necessity for describing new theoretical models in order to understand better these cellular responses. By a theoretical analysis we have deduced different versions of transcriptional logic that are significantly determined by how the opposing transcription factors cooperate between them in the transcription process. We have also tested these different scenarios focussing on the Drosophila Hh target genes, and we have reproduced similar conclusions to the ones obtained by other methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Collective variables (CV), when chosen judiciously, can play an important role in recognizing rate-limiting processes and rare events in any biomolecular systems. However, high dimensionality and inherent complexities associated with such biochemical systems render the identification of an optimal CV a challenging task, which in turn precludes the elucidation of underlying conformational landscape in sufficient details. In this context, a relevant model system is presented by 16residue, {beta} hairpin of GB1 protein. Despite being the target of numerous theoretical and computational studies for understanding the protein folding, the set of CVs optimally characterizing the conformational landscape of, {beta} hairpin of GB1 protein has remained elusive, resulting in a lack of consensus on its folding mechanism. Here we address this by proposing a pair of optimal CVs which can resolve the underlying free energy landscape of GB1 hairpin quite efficiently. Expressed as a linear combination of a number of traditional CVs, the optimal CV for this system is derived by employing recently introduced Timestructured Independent Component Analysis (TICA) approach on a large number of independent unbiased simulations. By projecting the replica-exchange simulated trajectories along these pair of optimized CVs, the resulting free energy landscape of this system are able to resolve four distinct wellseparated metastable states encompassing the extensive ensembles of folded,unfolded and molten globule states. Importantly, the optimized CVs were found to be capable of automatically recovering a novel partial helical state of this protein, without needing to explicitly invoke helicity as a constituent CV. Furthermore, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of each constituent in the optimized CV provided key insights on the relative contributions of the constituent CVs in the overall free energy landscapes. Finally, the kinetic pathways con necting these metastable states, constructed using a Markov State Model, provide an optimum description of underlying folding mechanism of the peptide. Taken together, this work oers a quantitatively robust approach towards comprehensive mapping of the underlying folding landscape of a quintessential model system along its optimized collective variables.",

The lipid kinases and phosphatases regulating PIP3 levels are described but mechanisms controlling their activity remain unclear. We report that in Drosophila, phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K) function at the plasma membrane is required for normal PIP3 levels during insulin receptor activation. Depletion of PIP4K increases PIP3 levels and augments sensitivity to insulin through enhanced Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Animals lacking PIP4K show enhanced insulin signalling dependent phenotypes in vivo and are resistant to the metabolic consequences of a high-sugar diet, highlighting the importance of PIP4K in normal metabolism and development. Thus, PIP4KS are key regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase signalling with implications for growth factor dependent processes including tumour growth, T-cell activation and metabolism.",

This work focuses on set up protocols for alchemical free energy (AFE) scoring in the context of a Docking - MM/PBSA - AFE cascade. A dataset of 15 congeneric inhibitors of the ACK1 protein was used to evaluate the performance of AFE set up protocols that varied in the steps taken to prepare input files (using previously docked and best scored poses, manual selection of poses, manual placement of binding site water molecules). The main finding is that use of knowledge derived from X-ray structures to model binding modes, together with the manual placement of a bridging water molecule, improves the R2 from 0.45 {+/-} 0.06 to 0.76 {+/-} 0.02 and decreases the mean unsigned error from 2.11 {+/-} 0.08 to 1.24 {+/-} 0.04 kcal mol-1. By contrast a brute force automated protocol that increased the sampling time ten-fold lead to little improvements in accuracy. Besides, it is shown that for the present dataset hysteresis can be used to flag poses that need further attention even without prior knowledge of experimental binding affinities.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis, a disease marked by diarrhea in adults and stunted growth in children, is associated with the unicellular protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium; often the species parvum. Cryptopain-1, a cysteine protease characterized in the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, had been earlier shown to be inhibited by a vinyl sulfone compound called K11777 (or K-777). Cysteine proteases have long been established as valid drug targets, which can be covalently and selectively inhibited by vinyl sulfones. This computational study was initiated to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds, which could possibly inhibit cryptopain-1 with higher efficacy than K11777. Docking simulations screened a number of such possibly better inhibitors. The work was furthered to probe the enzymatic pocket of cryptopain-1, through in-silico mutations, to derive a map of receptor-ligand interactions in the docked complexes. The idea was to provide crucial clues to aid the design of inhibitors, which would be able to bind the protease well by making favorable interactions with important residues of the enzyme. The analyses dictated placement of ligands towards the front of the enzymatic cleft, and disfavored interactions deep within. The S1 and S2 subsites of the enzyme preferred to remain occupied by polar ligand subgroups. Reasonably distanced ring systems and polar backbones of ligands were desired across the cleft. Large as well as inflexible subgroups were not tolerated. Double ringed systems such as substituted napthalene, especially in S1, were exceptions though. The S2 subsite, which is typically a specificity determinant in papain (C1) family cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L-like cryptopain-1, can possibly accommodate polar and hydrophobic ligand subgroups alike.",

Through a combination of experiment and theoretical analysis of the organismal energy balance, we further show that the mass allometry is caused by body size dependent energy storage.

Expressed as a proNGF precursor, NGF is then matured by furin-mediated protease cleavage. Increasing evidence suggests that NGF and proNGF have distinct cellular partners which account for different functional roles. While the structure of mature NGF is available, little is known about the structure of the pro-domain within the context of proNGF because the dynamical and structural features of the protein have so far prevented its structure determination. We have exploited a new hybrid strategy based on nuclear magnetic resonance and modelling validated by small angle X-ray scattering to gain novel insights on the pro-domain, both in isolation and in the context of proNGF. We show that the isolated pro-domain is intrinsically unstructured but has a clear tertiary structure propensity and forms transient tertiary intramolecular contacts. It is also able to interact, albeit weakly, with mature NGF and has per se the ability to induce growth cone collapse, indicating functional independence. Based on paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data and advanced molecular modelling, we have then reconstructed the overall properties of the pro-domain in the context of proNGF and showed that it has a compact structure. Our data represent an important step towards the structural and functional characterization of the properties of proNGF and its pro-domain.",

    "abstract": "The immortal strand hypothesis poses that stem cells could produce differentiated progeny while conserving the original template strand, thus avoiding accumulating somatic mutations. However, quantitating the extent of non-random DNA strand segregation in human stem cells remains difficult in vivo. Here we show that the change of the mean and variance of the mutational burden with age in healthy human tissues allows estimating strand segregation probabilities and somatic mutation rates. We analysed deep sequencing data from healthy human colon, small intestine, liver, skin and brain. We found highly effective non-random DNA strand segregation in all adult tissues (mean strand segregation probability: 0.98, standard error bounds (0.97,0.99)). In contrast, non-random strand segregation efficiency is reduced to 0.87 (0.78,0.88) in neural tissue during early development, suggesting stem cell pool expansions due to symmetric self-renewal. Healthy somatic mutation rates differed across tissue types, ranging from 3.5x10-9 /bp/division in small intestine to 1.6x10-7/bp/division in skin.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCairn proposed in 1975 that upon proliferation, cells might not segregate DNA strands randomly into daughter cells, but preferentially keep the ancestral (blue print) template strand in stem cells. This mechanism would allow to drastically reduce the rate of mutation accumulation in human tissues. Testing the hypothesis in human stem cells within their natural tissue environment remains challenging. Here we show that the patterns of mutation accumulation in human tissues with age support highly effective non-random DNA strand segregation after adolescence. In contrast, during early development in infants, DNA strand segregation is less effective, likely because stem cell populations are continuing to grow.",

    "abstract": "We performed whole-genome sequencing for eight inbred rat strains commonly used in genetic mapping studies, and they are the founders of the NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) outbred colony. We provide their sequences and variant calls to the rat genomics community. When analyzing the variant calls we identified regions with unusually high heterozygosity. We show that these regions are consistent across the eight inbred strains, including the BN strain, which was the basis of the rat reference genome. These regions show significantly higher read depth than other regions in the genome. The evidence suggests that these regions may contain segmental duplications that are incorrectly overlaid in the reference genome. We provide masks for these suspected regions of mis-assembly as a resource for the community to flag potentially false interpretations of mapping results or functional data.",

    "abstract": "Herpesviruses utilize multiple mechanisms to redirect host proteins for use in viral processes and to avoid recognition and repression by the host. To investigate the dynamic interactions between HSV-1 DNA and viral and host proteins, we developed an approach to identify proteins that associate with the infecting viral genome from nuclear entry through packaging. We found that input viral DNA progressed within six hours through four temporal stages where the genomes: 1. interacted with intrinsic and DNA damage response proteins, 2. underwent a robust transcriptional switch mediated largely by ICP4, 3. engaged in replication, repair, and continued transcription, and then 4. transitioned to a more transcriptionally inert state engaging de novo synthesized viral structural components while maintaining interactions with replication proteins. Using a combination of genetic, imaging, and proteomic approaches, we provide a new and temporally compressed view of the HSV-1 life cycle based on genome-proteome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We live in a world of emerging new diseases and old diseases resurging in more aggressive forms. Drug development by pharmaceutical companies is a market-driven and costly endeavor, and thus it is often a challenge when drugs are needed for diseases endemic only to certain regions or which affect only a few patients. However, biomedical open data is accessible and reusable for reanalysis and generation of a new hypotheses and discovery. In this study, we leverage biomedical data and tools to analyze available data on Nipah Virus (NiV) infection. NiV infection is an emerging zoonosis that is transmissible to humans and is associated with high mortality rates. In this study, explored the application of computational drug repositioning and chemogenomic enrichment analyses using host transcriptome data to match drugs that could reverse the virus-induced gene signature. We performed analyses using two gene signatures: i) A previously published gene signature (n=34), and ii) a gene signature generated using the characteristic direction method (n= 5,533). Our predictive framework suggests that several drugs including FDA approved therapies like beclometasone, trihexyphenidyl, S-propranolol etc. could modulate the NiV infection induced gene signatures in endothelial cells. A target specific analysis of CXCL10 also suggests the potential application of Eldelumab, an investigative therapy for Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, as a putative candidate for drug repositioning. To conclude, we also discuss challenges and opportunities in clinical trials (n-of-1 and adaptive trials) for repositioned drugs. Further follow-up studies including biochemical assays and clinical trials are required to identify effective therapies for clinical use. Our proof-of-concept study highlights that translational bioinformatics methods including gene expression analyses and computational drug repositioning could augment epidemiological investigations in the context of an emerging disease with no effective treatment.",

    "abstract": "The creation of new neurons in adulthood has potential for treating a number of disorders that are characterized by neurodegeneration or impaired plasticity. Animal models of reduced neurogenesis, and studies of the volume and structural integrity of the hippocampus in humans, suggest a possible therapeutic role for adult neurogenesis in age-related cognitive decline, depression, and schizophrenia. Research over the past 20 years has identified a number of approaches for enhancing adult neurogenesis, such as exercise, NMDA receptor antagonists, antidepressant drugs and environmental enrichment. However, despite the chronic nature of many disorders that impact the human hippocampus, most animal studies have only examined the efficacy of neurogenic treatments over relatively short timescales ([~]1 month or less). Additionally, investigations into the regulation of neurogenesis typically include only 1 sex, even though many disorders that affect the hippocampus differentially impact males and females. Here, we therefore tested whether two known pro-neurogenic treatments, running and the NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine, could lead to long-term increases in neurogenesis in male and female rats. We found that continuous access to a running wheel (cRUN) initially increased neurogenesis in both sexes, but effects were minimal after 1 month (both sexes) and completely absent after 5 months (males). Similarly, a single injection of memantine (sMEM) only transiently increased adult neurogenesis in both males and females. To determine whether extended increases in neurogenesis were possible with 2 months of RUN and MEM treatments, we subjected rats to interval running (iRUN), weekly memantine injections (mMEM), or combined treatments (iRUN-mMEM, mMEM-iRUN). We found that 2 months of iRUN increased DCX+ cell density in females but iRUN-mMEM treatment increased DCX+ cell density in males. However, analyses with thymidine analogs revealed that neurogenesis was minimally increased during the initial phases of the 2 month treatments. Collectively, our findings identify sex differences in the efficacy of neurogenic manipulations, which may be relevant for designing plasticity-promoting treatments that target the hippocampus.",

Here, we wanted to explore the regulatory pathway responsible for EK silencing in the Ler ecotype and its effect on CMT1 transcription.\\n\\nResultsMethylome databases confirmed that EK retroelement is heavily methylated but methylation is extended toward CMT1 downstream region. Strong transcriptional activation of EK accompanied by significant reduction in non-CG methylation was found in cmt3 and kyp2, but not in ddm1 or RdDM mutants. EK activation in cmt3 and kyp2 did not interfere with upstream CMT1 expression but abolish transcription through the EK. We identified, in wild type Ler, three spliced variants in which the entire EK is spliced out; one variant (25% of splicing incidents) facilitates proper reconstitution of an intact CMT1 mRNA. We could recover very low amount of the full length CMT1 mRNA from WT Ler and Col but not from cmt3 mutant..\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings highlight CMT3-SUVH4/KYP as the major pathway silencing the intragenic EK via inducing non-CG methylation. Furthermore, retroelement insertion within exons (e.g., CMT1) may not lead to a complete abolishment of the gene product when the element is kept silent. Rather the element can be spliced out to bring about reconstruction of a very low level of an intact, functional mRNA and possibly to retrieval of an active protein.",

At higher temperature (30 {degrees}C), larvae preferred to pupate on food whereas at lower temperature (21 {degrees}C) pupation occurred on the cotton. Genetic basis of larval pupation behavior was studied by conducting reciprocal crosses for 30 generations on food-selected and on cotton-selected larvae. Results from genetic analysis between food-selected and cotton-selected strains suggested a single gene responsible for the pupation site preference, with F1 progeny pupated on cotton and F2 (F1x;F1) larvae pupated on both food as well on cotton. Although we found no change in morphological traits in food vs. cotton selected population, significantly different growth rate (body weight) between the two strains was observed.

    "abstract": "Microbial populations often assemble in dense populations in which proliferating individuals exert mechanical forces on the nearby cells. Here, we use yeast strains whose doubling times depend differently on temperature to show that physical interactions among cells affect the competition between different genotypes in growing yeast colonies. Our experiments demonstrate that these physical interactions have two related effects: they cause the prolonged survival of slower-growing strains at the actively-growing frontier of the colony and cause faster-growing strains to increase their frequency more slowly than expected in the absence of physical interactions. These effects also promote the survival of slower-growing strains and the maintenance of genetic diversity in colonies grown in time-varying environments. A continuum model inspired by overdamped hydrodynamics reproduces the experiments and predicts that the strength of natural selection depends on the width of the actively-growing layer at the colony frontier. We verify these predictions experimentally. The reduced power of natural selection observed here may favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells in microbial populations and could explain the apparent neutrality of inter-clone competition within tumors.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMicrobes often live in dense populations such as colonies and biofilms. We show that the success and extinction of yeast strains within a growing colony are determined by a combination of their relative fitness and the forces exerted by proliferating cells on their neighbors. These physical interactions prolong the survival of less-fit strains at the growing frontier of the colony and slow down the colonys takeover by fitter strains. This reduction in the power of natural selection favors the maintenance of genetic diversity in environments in which the strains relative growth rates vary with time. Growth-induced physical interactions may thus favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells, which are typically less-fit than non-resistant cells, within dense microbial populations.",

    "abstract": "The flagellar systems of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica exhibit a significant level of genetic and functional synteny. Both systems are controlled by the flagellar specific master regulator FlhD4C2. Since the early days of genetic analyses of flagellar systems it has been known that E. coli flhDC can complement a {Delta}flhDC mutant in S. enterica. The genomic revolution has identified how genetic changes to transcription factors and / or DNA binding sites can impact the phenotypic outcome across related species. We were therefore interested in asking: using modern tools to interrogate flagellar gene expression and assembly, what would the impact be of replacing the flhDC coding sequences in S. enterica for the E. coli genes at the flhDC S. entercia chromosomal locus? We show that even though all strains created are motile, flagellar gene expression is measurably lower when flhDCEC are present. These changes can be attributed to the impact of FlhD4C2 DNA recognition and the protein-protein interactions required to generate a stable FlhD4C2 complex. Furthermore, our data suggests that in E. coli the internal flagellar FliT regulatory feedback loop has a marked difference with respect to output of the flagellar systems. We argue due diligence is required in making assumptions based on heterologous expression of regulators and that even systems showing significant synteny may not behave in exactly the same manner.",

    "abstract": "Many neuroimaging studies have investigated reward processing dysfunction in major depressive disorder. These studies have led to the common idea that major depressive disorder is associated with blunted responses within the reward circuit, particularly in the ventral striatum. Yet, the link between major depressive disorder and reward-related responses in other regions remains inconclusive, thus limiting our understanding of the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. To address this issue, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 41 whole-brain neuroimaging studies encompassing reward-related responses from a total of 794 patients with major depressive disorder and 803 healthy controls. Our findings argue against the common idea that major depressive disorder is primarily linked to deficits within the reward system. Instead, our results demonstrate that major depressive disorder is associated with opposing abnormalities in the reward circuit: hypo-responses in the ventral striatum and hyper-responses in the orbitofrontal cortex. The current findings suggest that dysregulated corticostriatal connectivity may underlie reward-processing abnormalities in major depressive disorder, providing an empirical foundation for a more refined understanding of abnormalities in the reward circuitry in major depressive disorder.",

Furthermore, there is evidence of significant, but not complete, overlap in genetic risk between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It has been hypothesised that genetic variants conferring risk for these disorders do so by influencing brain development, leading to the later emergence of symptoms. The comparative profile of risk gene expression for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder across development over different brain regions however remains unclear. Using genotypes derived from genome wide associations studies of the largest available cohorts of patients and control subjects, we investigated whether genes enriched for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder association show a bias for expression across any of 13 developmental stages in prefrontal cortical and subcortical brain regions. We show that genes associated with schizophrenia have a strong bias towards increased expression in the prefrontal cortex during early midfetal development and early infancy, and decreased expression during late childhood which normalises in adolescence. Risk-associated genes for bipolar disorder shared this postnatal expression profile but did not exhibit a bias towards expression at any prenatal stage. These results emphasise the dynamic expression of genes harbouring risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder across prefrontal cortex development and support the view that prenatal neurodevelopmental events are more strongly associated with schizophrenia than bipolar disorder.",

To address this, we investigated ethanol-mediated compaction and crosslinking to enhance the ABNPs dynamic mechanical properties and degradation resistance while maintaining its cytocompatibility. First, volumetric and mechanical effects of compaction only were confirmed by evaluating scaffolds after various immersion times in buffered 28% ethanol. It was found that compaction reached equilibrium at [~]30% compaction after 45 min, and dynamic mechanical properties significantly increased 2-6x after 120 min of submersion. This was incorporated into a crosslinking treatment, through which scaffolds were subjected to 120 min pre-compaction in buffered 28% ethanol prior to carbodiimide crosslinking. Their dynamic mechanical properties were evaluated before and after accelerated degradation by ADAMTS-5 or MMP-13. Cytocompatibility was determined by seeding stem cells onto scaffolds and evaluating viability through metabolic activity and fluorescent staining. Compacted and crosslinked scaffolds showed significant increases in DMA properties without detrimentally altering their cytocompatibility, and these mechanical gains were maintained following enzymatic exposure.",

    "abstract": "Research of the central actions of prolactin is virtually restricted to females, but this hormone has also documented roles in male physiology and behaviour. Here, we provide the first description of the pattern of prolactin-derived signalling in the male mouse brain, employing the immunostaining of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) after exogenous prolactin administration. Next, we explore possible sexually dimorphic differences by comparing pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in prolactin-supplemented males and females. We also assess the role of testosterone in the regulation of central prolactin signalling in males by comparing intact with castrated prolactin-supplemented males.\\n\\nProlactin-supplemented males displayed a widespread pattern of pSTAT5 immunoreactivity, restricted to brain centres showing expression of the prolactin receptor. Immunoreactivity for pSTAT5 was present in several nuclei of the preoptic, anterior and tuberal hypothalamus, as well as in the septofimbrial nucleus or posterodorsal medial amygdala of the telencephalon. Conversely, non-supplemented control males were virtually devoid of pSTAT5-immunoreactivity, suggesting that central prolactin actions in males are limited to situations concurrent with substantial hypophyseal prolactin release (e.g. stress or mating). Furthermore, comparison of prolactin-supplemented males and females revealed a significant, female-biased sexual dimorphism, supporting the view that prolactin has a preeminent role in female physiology and behaviour. Finally, in males, castration significantly reduced pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in some structures, including the paraventricular and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei and the septofimbrial region, thus indicating a region-specific regulatory role of testosterone over central prolactin signalling.",

    "abstract": "Saccadic eye movements, which dramatically alter retinal images, are associated with robust peri-movement perceptual alterations. Such alterations, thought to reflect brain mechanisms for maintaining perceptual stability in the face of saccade-induced retinalimage disruptions, are often studied by asking subjects to localize brief stimuli presented around the time of horizontal saccades. However, other saccade directions are not usually explored. Motivated by recently discovered asymmetries in upper and lower visual field representations in the superior colliculus, a structure important for both saccade generation and visual analysis, here we observed significant differences in peri-saccadic perceptual alterations for upward saccades relative to other saccade directions. We also found that, even for purely horizontal saccades, perceptual alterations differ for upper versus lower retinotopic stimulus locations. Our results, coupled with conceptual modeling, suggest that peri-saccadic perceptual alterations might critically depend on neural circuits, like superior colliculus, that asymmetrically represent the upper and lower visual fields.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for the identification of RNA-protein interactions require a quantity and quality of sample that hinders their application, especially for dynamic biological systems or when sample material is limiting. Here, we present a new approach to enrich RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs): Orthogonal Organic Phase Separation (OOPS), which is compatible with downstream proteomics and RNA sequencing. OOPS enables recovery of RBPs and free protein, or protein-bound RNA and free RNA, from a single sample in an unbiased manner. By applying OOPS to human cell lines, we extract the majority of known RBPs, and importantly identify additional novel RBPs, including those from previously under-represented cellular compartments. The high yield and unbiased nature of OOPS facilitates its application in both dynamic and inaccessible systems. Thus, we have identified changes in RNA-protein interactions in mammalian cells following nocodazole cell-cycle arrest, and defined the first bacterial RNA-interactome. Overall, OOPS provides an easy-to-use and flexible technique that opens new opportunities to characterize RNA-protein interactions and explore their dynamic behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Breaking the anterior-posterior (AP) symmetry in mammals takes place at gastrulation. Much of the signaling network underlying this process has been elucidated in the mouse, however there is no direct molecular evidence of events driving axis formation in humans. Here, we use human embryonic stem cells to generate an in vitro 3D model of a human epiblast whose size, cell polarity, and gene expression are similar to a 10-day human epiblast. A defined dose of bone mor-phogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) spontaneously breaks axial symmetry, and induces markers of the primitive streak and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. By gene knockouts and live-cell imaging we show that, downstream of BMP4, WNT3 and its inhibitor DKK1 play key roles in this process. Our work demonstrates that a model human epiblast can break axial symmetry despite no asymmetry in the initial signal and in the absence of extraembryonic tissues or maternal cues. Our 3D model opens routes to capturing molecular events underlying axial symmetry breaking phenomena, which have largely been unexplored in model human systems.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality related to intellectual disabilities that affects 0.1% of live births worldwide. It occurs when an individual has a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. This chromosome trisomy results in the overexpression of genes that is believed to be sufficient to interfere normal pathways and normal responses to stimulation, causing learning and memory deficiency. Therefore, by studying these proteins and the disturbance in pathways that are involved in learning and memory, we can consider drugs that would correct the observed perturbations, and therefore assist in enhancing the memory and learning. Here, from genes based on an earlier study that identified 77 proteins differentially expressed in normal and trisomic wild mice exposed to context fear conditioning (CFC), we provide a quantitative protein selection based on different feature selection techniques to select the most important proteins related to learning and memory. These techniques include Fisher score, Chi score, and correlation-based subset. In addition, a deep feature selection is utilized to extract high order proteins using deep neural networks. Three main experiments are carried out:studying the control mices response, studying the trisomy mices response, and studying the control-trisomy mices response. In each experiment, support vector machine classifier is used to assess these selected proteins ability to distinguish between learned and not-learned mice to the fear conditioning event. By applying the deep feature selection, fifteen proteins were selected in control mice, nine in trisomy mice, and seven in control-trisomy mice achieving distinguishing accuracies of 93%, 99%, 84% respectively compared to 74%, 78%, and 71% average accuracies of other selection methods. Some of these proteins have important biological function in learning such as CaNA, NUMb, and NOS.",

At each 2 km a quadrate of 1 m-2 sizes was thrown in the field to collect a soil sample of 2kg from soil cores ranging 0-15 cm deep for the analysis of soil seed bank. Twenty different sites were sampled by throwing 6 quadrates at each site making a total of 120 samples. Three thousand seeds were obtained of 50 different species from all the collected samples.

In this study, a novel stretching modality was developed that provides repetitive small length changes to the plantar flexor muscles undergoing passive static stretching (\\\"local vibration stretching,\\\"). We investigated the effects of local vibration stretching on muscle strength, flexibility and its persistence. Plantar flexion strength and maximal ankle joint dorsiflexion angle (dorsiflexion range of motion) were measured for 10 healthy young males before (pre) and immediately after (post) three types of stretching: static stretching, local vibration stretching at 15 Hz, and no intervention (control). The dorsiflexion range of motion was measured also at 15, 30, and 60 min post-stretching. Elongation of the medial gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon was determined by ultrasonography. Plantar flexion strength significantly decreased by 4.3 {+/-} 3.5 % in static stretching but not in local vibration stretching. The dorsiflexion range of motion significantly increased both in static stretching (7.2 {+/-} 8.1 %) and local vibration stretching (11.2 {+/-} 14.6 %) which was accompanied by a significantly larger muscle elongation but not tendon elongation. Elevated dorsiflexion range of motion was maintained until 30 min after the local vibration stretching while it returned to baseline level (pre-intervention) in 15 min after the static stretching. All variables remained unchanged in the control condition. In conclusion, local vibration stretching improves extensibility of the muscle belly without decreasing strength, and the increased flexibility is retained longer than static stretching.",

    "abstract": "Keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis. They prevent desiccation and provide immunological and barrier defense against potential pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The study of this first line of immune defense is hindered by invasive isolation methods and insufficient techniques for long-term passage of primary keratinocytes in vitro. Primary keratinocytes have been successfully isolated from blister roofs induced by negative pressure, which separates the epidermis from the dermis in vivo in human subjects. This method allows collection of pure epidermal cells without dermal contamination in a minimally invasive manner. However, the isolated keratinocytes differentiate and senesce when cultured in vitro beyond five passages. Here, we present evidence that the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 can be used to effectively increase the proliferative capabilities of keratinocytes isolated using the suction blister method, similar to what has been previously reported for primary keratinocytes isolated using alternative methods. We show that the increase in passage number is directly correlated to delayed differentiation, and that cells passaged long term with the inhibitor retain their ability to stratify in organotypic raft cultures and respond to cytokine treatment; additionally, the late passage cells have a heterogeneous mix of differentiated and non-differentiated cells which may be predicted by a ratio of select differentiation markers. The described method presents a minimally invasive procedure for keratinocyte isolation and prolonged culture that allows analysis of keratinocyte function in both healthy volunteers and patients with dermatologic diseases.",

A possible link between child abuse and HIV infection has increasingly attracted attention. This paper investigated whether a history of child physical and sexual abuse is associated with HIV infection among adult women.\\n\\nMethodsA cross sectional survey was conducted among 2042 postnatal women (mean age=26y) attending six public primary health care clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe within 6 weeks post-delivery. Clinic records were reviewed for mothers antenatal HIV status. Participants were interviewed about childhood abuse including physical or sexual abuse before 15 years of age, forced first sex before 16, HIV risk factors such as age difference at first sex before age 16. Multivariate analyses assessed the associations between mothers HIV status and child physical and sexual abuse while controlling for confounding variables.\\n\\nResultsMore than one in four (26.6%) reported abuse before the age of 15: 14.6% physical abuse and 9.1% sexual abuse,14.3% reported forced first sex and 9.0% first sex before 16 with someone 5+ years older. Fifteen percent of women tested HIV positive during the recent antenatal care visit. In multivariate analysis, childhood physical abuse (aOR 3.30 95%CI 1.58- 6.90), sexual abuse (3.18 95%CI: 1.64-6.19), forced first sex (aOR 1.42, 95%CI: 1.00-2.02), and 5+ years age difference with first sex partner (aOR 1.66 95%CI 1.09-2.53) were independently associated with HIV infection.\\n\\nConclusionThis study confirms that child physical and/or sexual abuse increases risk for HIV acquisition. Further research is needed to assess the pathways to HIV acquisition from childhood to adulthood. Prevention of child abuse must form part of the HIV prevention agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "Faces play important roles in the social lives of humans. In addition to real faces, people also encounter numerous cartoon faces in daily life. These cartoon faces convey basic emotional states through facial expressions. Using a behavioral research methodology and event-related potentials (ERPs), we conducted a facial expression recognition experiment with 17 university students to compare the processing of cartoon faces with that of real faces. This study used face type (real vs. cartoon) and participant gender (male vs. female) as independent variables. Reaction time, recognition accuracy, and the amplitudes and latencies of emotion processing-related ERP components such as N170, vertex positive potential (VPP), and late positive potential (LPP) were used as dependent variables. The ERP results revealed that cartoon faces caused larger N170 and VPP amplitudes as well as a briefer N170 latency than did real faces; that real faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did cartoon faces; and that angry faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did happy faces. In addition, the results showed a significant difference in the brain regions associated with face processing as reflected in a right hemispheric advantage. The behavioral results showed that the reaction times for happy faces were shorter than those for angry faces; that females showed a higher facial expression recognition accuracy than did males; and that males showed a higher recognition accuracy for angry faces than happy faces. These results demonstrate differences in facial expression recognition and neurological processing between cartoon faces and real faces among adults. Cartoon faces showed a higher processing intensity and speed than real faces during the early processing stage. However, more attentional resources were allocated for real faces during the late processing stage.",

    "abstract": "Imitation and perspective taking are core features of non-verbal social interactions. We imitate one another to signal a desire to affiliate and consider others points of view to better understand their perspective. Prior research suggests that a relationship exists between prosocial behaviour and imitation. For example, priming prosocial behaviours has been shown to increase imitative tendencies in automatic imitation tasks. Despite its importance during social interactions, far less is known about how perspective taking might relate to either prosociality or imitation. The current study investigates the relationship between imitation and perspective taking by testing the extent to which these skills are similarly modulated by prosocial priming. Across all experimental groups, a surprising ceiling effect emerged in the perspective taking task (the Directors Task), which prevented the investigation prosocial priming on perspective taking. A comparison of other studies using the Directors Task shows wide variability in accuracy scores across studies and is suggestive of low task reliability. In addition, despite using a high-power design, and contrary to three previous studies, no effect of prosocial prime on imitation was observed. Meta-analysing all studies to date suggests that the effects of prosocial primes on imitation are variable and could be small. The current study, therefore, offers caution when using the Directors Task as a measure of perspective taking with adult populations, as it shows high variability across studies and may suffer from a ceiling effect. In addition, the results question the size and robustness of prosocial priming effects on automatic imitation. More generally, by reporting null results we hope to minimise publication bias and by meta-analysing results as studies emerge and making data freely available, we hope to move towards a more cumulative science of social cognition.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium found in aquatic environments and a human pathogen of global significance. Its transition between host-associated and environmental life styles involves the tight regulation of niche-specific phenotypes such as motility, biofilm formation and virulence. V. choleraes transition from the host to environmental dispersal usually involves suppression of virulence and dispersion of biofilm communities. In contrast to this naturally occurring transition, bacterial aggregation by cationic polymers triggers a unique response, which is to suppress virulence gene expression while also triggering biofilm formation by V. cholerae, an artificial combination of traits that is potentially very useful to bind and neutralize the pathogen from contaminated water. Here, we set out to uncover the mechanistic basis of this polymer-triggered bacterial behavior. We found that bacteria-polymer aggregates undergo rapid autoinduction and achieve quorum sensing at bacterial densities far below those required for autoinduction in the absence of polymers. We demonstrate this induction of quorum sensing is due both to a rapid formation of autoinducer gradients and local enhancement of autoinducer concentrations within bacterial clusters, as well as the stimulation of CAI-1 and AI-2 production by aggregated bacteria. We further found that polymers cause an induction of the biofilm specific regulator VpsR and the biofilm structural protein RbmA, bypassing the usual suppression of biofilm during autoinduction. Overall, this study highlights that synthetic materials can be used to cross-wire natural bacterial responses to achieve a combination of phenotypes with potentially useful applications.",

Phylogenetic analyses of these genes predict a \\\"punctuated burst\\\" of multiple gene up-regulation events occurring at early stages of tumor development, followed by minimal subsequent changes later in tumor progression. Remarkably, this punctuated burst of expressional changes is instigated by hypoxia-related molecular events, predominantly in two groups of genes that control chromosomal instability (CIN) and remodel tumor microenvironment (TME). We conclude that alterations in the transcriptome are not stochastic and that early stage hypoxia induces CIN and TME remodeling to permit further tumor evolution.",

    "abstract": "The flavivirus genus, which includes dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), are significant human pathogens and the prevalence of infected vectors continues to geographically expand. Both DENV and ZIKV rely on expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of autophagy to establish a productive viral infection. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the requirements for autophagy initiation during infection and the mechanisms used by these viruses to avoid clearance through the autophagic pathway. We recently showed that DENV and ZIKV inhibit reticulophagy (specific degradation of the ER through autophagy) by cleaving reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. These data suggest that DENV and ZIKV require specific autophagic pathways for their replication, while other autophagic pathways are antiviral. We previously identified BPI Fold Containing Family B Member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNAi-mediated silencing drastically inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. We show that BPIFB3 depletion enhances ER fragmentation, while its overexpression protects against autophagy-induced ER degradation, demonstrating that BPIFB3 serves as a specific regulator of ER turnover. We further show that the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion on flavivirus infection are reversed in RETREG1-depleted cells, and that BPIFB3 associates with RETREG1 within the ER, suggesting that BPIFB3 regulates a RETREG1-specific reticulophagy pathway. Collectively, these studies identify BPIFB3 as a regulator of the reticulophagy pathway and define the requirements for a novel host regulator of flavivirus infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFlaviviruses and other arthropod transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem with limited treatment options currently available. Thus, greater knowledge of the host factors required for replication and transmission is needed to provide a better understanding of the cellular requirements for infection. Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, BPIFB3 is required to facilitate flavivirus infection. Depletion of BPIFB3 in cells inhibits dengue virus and Zika virus infection prior to replication of the viral genome. Mechanistically, we show that BPIFB3 inhibits ER degradation in an autophagy-specific manner and that loss of BPIFB3 decreases the availability of ER membranes needed for flavivirus replication. We further show that BPIFB3 specifically regulates the RETREG1 pathway, but not other pathways of ER turnover. Together, our data define a previously uncharacterized method of regulating ER degradation and show that BPIFB3 is an essential host factor for a productive flavivirus infection.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of chromatin states through cell division is a potential contributor to the epigenetic maintenance of cellular memory of prior states. The macroH2A histone variant has properties of a regulator of epigenetic cell memory, including roles controlling gene silencing and cell differentiation. Its mechanisms of regional genomic targeting and maintenance through cell division are unknown. Here we combined in vivo imaging with biochemical and genomic approaches to show that human macroH2A is incorporated into chromatin in the G1 phase of the cell cycle following DNA replication. The newly-incorporated macroH2A re-targets the same, large heterochromatic domains where macroH2A was already enriched in the previous cell cycle. It remains heterotypic, targeting individual nucleosomes that do not already contain a macroH2A molecule. The pattern observed resembles that of new deposition of centromeric histone variants during the cell cycle, indicating mechanistic similarities for macrodomain-scale regulation of epigenetic properties of the cell.",

    "abstract": "Summary StatementMigrating Drosophila germ cells are attracted by a long range Hmgcr mediated signal which is aided and acts simultaneously with Wunens suggesting that these pathways converge on a single chemoattractant.\\n\\nAbstractIn a developing embryo, many cell types migrate from their point of specification to their final position. This usually involves highly stereotyped routes which are determined through deployment of cell surface or secreted guidance molecules. Whilst genetic techniques have been successful in identifying these molecules, the distances over which such signals operate in their native context can be difficult to determine. Here we have quantified the range of an attractive signal for the migration of Drosophila germ cells. Their migration is guided by an attractive signal generated by the expression of genes in the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr) pathway, and by a repulsive signal generated by the expression of Wunens. We demonstrate that the attractive signal downstream of Hmgcr operates over a long range and is sufficient to reach germ cells for the entirety of their migration. Furthermore, Hmgcr-mediated attraction and Wunen-mediated repulsion can operate simultaneously ruling out a model in which these pathways operate consecutively. Indeed, we show that Hmgcr-mediated attraction is boosted by Wunens suggesting the action of these two pathways is linked. Lastly, several papers have pointed to the secreted molecule Hedgehog (Hh) as being the germ cell attractant, whose secretion is increased by hmgcr. In this paper, we provide evidence that Hh is not downstream of hmgcr in germ cell migration.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the link between community composition and function is a major challenge in microbial ecology, with implications for the management of natural microbiomes and the design of synthetic consortia. For this purpose, it is critical to understand the extent to which community functions and properties can be predicted from species traits and what role is played by complex interactions. Inspired by the study of complex genetic interactions and fitness landscapes, here we have examined how the amylolytic function of combinatorial assemblages of seven starch-degrading soil bacteria depends on the functional contributions from each species and their interactions. Filtering our experimental results through the theory of enzyme kinetics, we show that high-order functional interactions dominate the amylolytic rate of our consortia, even though this function is biochemically simple, redundantly distributed in the community, and additive in the absence of inter-species interactions. As the community grows in size, the contribution of high-order functional interactions grows too, making the community function increasingly unpredictable. We can explain the prevalence of high order effects and their sign from the redundancy of ecological interactions in the network, in particular from redundant facilitation towards a high-performing community member. Our results suggest that even simple functions can be dominated by complex interactions, posing challenges for the predictability and bottom-up engineering of ecosystem function in complex multi-species communities.",
