    "abstract": "Resting state functional connectomes are massive and complex. It is an open question, however, whether connectomes differ across individuals in a correspondingly massive number of ways, or whether most differences take a small number of characteristic forms. We systematically investigated this question and found clear evidence of low-rank structure in which a modest number of connectomic components, around 50-150, account for a sizable portion of inter-individual connectomic variation. This number was convergently arrived at with multiple methods including estimation of intrinsic dimensionality and assessment of reconstruction of out-of-sample data. We demonstrate that these connectomic components enable prediction of a broad array of neurocognitive and clinical variables. In addition, using stochastic block modeling-based methods, we show these components exhibit extensive community structure reflecting interrelationships between intrinsic connectivity networks. We propose that these connectivity components form an effective basis set for quantifying and interpreting inter-individual connectomic differences, and for predicting behavioral/clinical phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins may play a critical role in gene regulation in various diseases or biological processes by controlling post-transcriptional events such as polyadenylation, splicing, and mRNA stabilization via binding activities to RNA molecules. Due to the importance of RNA-binding proteins in gene regulation, a great number of studies have been conducted, resulting in a large amount of RNA-Seq datasets. However, these datasets usually do not have structured organization of metadata, which limits their potentially wide use. To bridge this gap, the metadata of a comprehensive set of publicly available mouse RNA-Seq datasets with perturbed RNA-binding proteins were collected and integrated into a database called RBPMetaDB. This database contains 278 mouse RNA-Seq datasets for a comprehensive list of 163 RNA-binding proteins. These RNA-binding proteins account for only [~]10% of all known RNA-binding proteins annotated in Gene Ontology, indicating that most are still unexplored using high-throughput sequencing. This negative information provides a great pool of candidate RNA-binding proteins for biologists to conduct future experimental studies. In addition, we found that DNA-binding activities are significantly enriched among RNA-binding proteins in RBPMetaDB, suggesting that prior studies of these DNA- and RNA-binding factors focus more on DNA-binding activities instead of RNA-binding activities. This result reveals the opportunity to efficiently reuse these data for investigation of the roles of their RNA-binding activities. A web application has also been implemented to enable easy access and wide use of RBPMetaDB. It is expected that RBPMetaDB will be a great resource for improving understanding of the biological roles of RNA-binding proteins.\\n\\nDatabase URL: http://rbpmetadb.yubiolab.org",

    "abstract": "Throughout development, nuclei must be assembled following every cell division to establish a functional organelle from compact, mitotic chromatin. During nuclear organogenesis, chromatin expands to establish a nucleus of a given size seperate from the cytoplasm. Determining how nuclear organogenesis is regulated is particularly significant in the context of certain cancers in which scaling relationships between cell and nuclear sizes are not maintained. Controlling cell size in vitro using a microfluidics approach, we determined that neither nuclear volume nor surface area scale directly with cell size. Looking to explain differential nuclear scaling relationships, we developed a simple mechano-chemical mathematical model. In simulating biological perturbations in silico, our model predicted crucial roles for nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking in regulating nuclear expansion and in restricting the recruitment of a potential nuclear surface area factor. In mammalian tissue culture, inhibiting nuclear export increased nuclear expansion rates and reduced the amount of nuclear lamin, a candidate surface area factor, being recruited to assembling nuclei, supporting our models predictions. Targeting the principal nuclear export component in the Drosophila syncytial embryo, Embargoed, we show that nuclear expansion rates are also increased in this developmental context, consistent with our model. Using the MS2-reporter system in fly embryos, we demonstrate a role for nuclear export in regulating transcription activation timing and dynamics, suggesting that regulating nuclear assembly is crucial for downstream nuclear function. Taken together, we propose a simple model through which nuclear organogenesis is achieved and demonstrate a role for nuclear export in regulating nuclear assembly.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin formation during early embryogenesis is timed precisely, but it has been elusive how this process is regulated. Here we report the discovery of a histone methyltransferase complex whose nuclear accumulation and activation establishes the onset of heterochromatin formation in C. elegans embryos. We find that the inception of heterochromatin generation coincides with the accumulation of the Histone H3 Lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase MET-2 (SETDB) into nuclear hubs. The absence of MET-2 results in delayed and disturbed heterochromatin formation, whereas accelerated nuclear localization of the methyltransferase leads to precocious H3K9 methylation. We identify two factors that bind to and function with MET-2: LIN-65, which resembles ATF7IP, localizes MET-2 into nuclear hubs, and ARLE-14, orthologous to ARL14EP, promotes stable association of MET-2 with chromatin. These data reveal that nuclear accumulation of MET-2 in conjunction with LIN-65 and ARLE-14 regulates timing of heterochromatin domains during embryogenesis.\\n\\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYMET-2/SETDB1 and interactors LIN-65/ATF7IP and ARLE-14/ARL14EP initiate heterochromatin formation during embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular method to monitor brain activity, but it can be difficult to evaluate EEG-based analysis methods because no ground-truth brain activity is available for comparison. Therefore, in order to test and evaluate such methods, researchers often use simulated EEG data instead of actual EEG recordings, ensuring that it is known beforehand which e ects are present in the data. As such, simulated data can be used, among other things, to assess or compare signal processing and machine learn-ing algorithms, to model EEG variabilities, and to design source reconstruction methods. In this paper, we present SEREEGA, short for Simulating Event-Related EEG Activity. SEREEGA is a MATLAB-based open-source toolbox dedicated to the generation of sim-ulated epochs of EEG data. It is modular and extensible, at initial release supporting ve different publicly available head models and capable of simulating multiple different types of signals mimicking brain activity.

    "abstract": "Fast and accurate face processing is critical for everyday social interactions, but it declines and becomes delayed with age, as measured by both neural and behavioural responses. Here, we addressed the critical challenge of understanding how ageing changes neural information processing mechanisms to delay behaviour. Young (20-36 years) and older (60-86 years) adults performed the basic social interaction task detecting a face vs. noise while we recorded their electroencephalogram (EEG). In each participant, using a new information theoretic framework we reconstructed the features supporting face detection behaviour, and also where, when and how EEG activity represents them. We found that occipital-temporal pathway activity dynamically represents the eyes of the face images for behaviour [~]170 ms post-stimulus, with a 40 ms delay in older adults that underlies their 200 ms behavioural deficit of slower reaction times. Our results therefore demonstrate how ageing can change neural information processing mechanisms that underlie behavioural slow down.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOlder adults are consistently slower than young adults in a variety of behavioural perceptual tasks. So far, it has been unclear if the underlying cause of the behavioural delay relates to attentional or perceptual differences in encoding visual information, or slower neural processing speed, or other neural factors. Our study addresses these questions by showing that in a basic social interaction task (discriminating faces from noise), young and older adults encoded the same visual information (eyes of the face) to perform the task. Moreover, early brain activity (within 200 ms following stimulus onset) encoded the same visual information (again, eyes of the face) in both groups, but was delayed and weaker in older adults. These early delays in information encoding were directly related to the observed behavioural slowing in older adults, showing that differences in early perceptual brain processes can contribute to the motor response.",

    "abstract": "Foraging strategies that enable animals to locate food efficiently are composed of highly conserved behavioral states with characteristic features. Here, we identify parallel multimodal circuit modules that control an innate foraging state -- local search behavior -- after food removal in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Two parallel groups of chemosensory and mechanosensory glutamatergic neurons that detect food-related cues trigger local search by inhibiting separate integrating neurons through a metabotropic glutamate receptor, MGL-1. The chemosensory and mechanosensory modules are separate and redundant, as glutamate release from either can drive the full behavior. Spontaneous activity in the chemosensory module encodes information about the time since the last food encounter and correlates with the foraging behavior. In addition, the ability of the sensory modules to control local search is gated by the internal nutritional state of the animal. This multimodal circuit configuration provides robust control of an innate adaptive behavior.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA smartphone is a promising tool for daily cardiovascular measurement and mental stress monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and low-cost thermography can be used to create cheap, convenient and mobile systems. However, to achieve robustness, a person has to remain still for several minutes while a measurement is being taken. This is very cumbersome, and limits the usage in applications such producing instant measurements of stress.\\n\\nObjectiveWe propose to use smartphone-based mobile PPG and thermal imaging to provide a fast binary measure of stress responses to an event using dynamical physiological changes which occur within 20 seconds of the event finishing.\\n\\nMethodsWe propose a system that uses a smartphone and its physiological sensors to reliably and continuously measure over a short window of time a persons blood volume pulse, the time interval between heartbeats (R-R interval) and the 1D thermal signature of the nose tip. 17 healthy participants, involved in a series of stress-inducing mental activities, measured their physiological response to stress in the 20 second-window immediately following each activity. A 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale was used by them to self-report their level of mental stress. As a main labeling strategy, normalized K-means clustering is used to better treat interpersonal differences in ratings. By taking an array of the R-R intervals and thermal directionality as a low-level feature input, we mainly use an artificial neural network to enable the automatic feature learning and the machine learning inference process. To compare the automated inference performance, we also extracted widely used high level features from HRV (e.g., LF/HF ratio) and the thermal signature and input them to a k-nearest neighbor to infer perceived stress levels.\\n\\nResultsFirst, we tested the physiological measurement reliability. The measured cardiac signals were considered highly reliable (signal goodness probability used, Mean=0.9584, SD=0.0151). The proposed 1D thermal signal processing algorithm effectively minimized the effect of respiratory cycles on detecting the apparent temperature of the nose tip (respiratory signal goodness probability Mean=0.8998 to Mean=0). Second, we tested the 20 seconds instant perceived stress inference performance. The best results were obtained by using automatic feature learning and classification using artificial neural networks rather than using pre-crafted features. The combination of both modalities produced higher accuracy on the binary classification task using 17-fold leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation (accuracy: HRV+Thermal: 76.96%; HRV: 60.29%; Thermal: 61.37%). The results are comparable with the state of the art automatic stress recognition methods requiring long term measurements (a minimum of 2 minutes for up to around 80% accuracy from LOSO). Lastly, we explored the impact of different data labeling strategies used in the field on the sensitivity of our inference methods and the need for normalization within individual.\\n\\nConclusionsResults demonstrate the capability of smartphone biomedical imaging in instant mental stress recognition. Given that this approach does not require long measurements requiring attention and reduced mobility, it is more feasible for mobile mental healthcare solution in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Immune responses counteract infections and can also cause collateral damage to hosts. We investigated functional outcomes of variation in the rapidly evolving antiviral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing factor Oligoadenylate Synthetase 1 (OAS1) in primates as a model for understanding how individual immune pathways evolve to minimize deleterious effects on host fitness. Upon binding of dsRNAs, OAS1 polymerizes ATP into 2'-5' linked oligoadenylate (2-5A), which in turn activates Latent Ribonuclease (RNase L) to kill virus infected cells. OAS1 can undergo auto-activation by host encoded RNAs, raising the question of how it might evolve to mitigate RNase L-mediated cytotoxicity. Using a new yeast-based growth assay, we observed a pattern of frequent loss of 2-5A synthesis by OAS1 from several species. In gorillas, we identified a polymorphism in a conserved substrate binding residue that severely decreases catalytic function. In contrast, lowered 2-5A generation previously associated with variation in humans results from production of unstable OAS1 isoforms. Examination of OAS1 function in monkeys revealed a spectrum of activities, including the complete loss of 2-5A synthesis in tamarins. Frequent loss of catalytic activity in primates suggests that costs associated with OAS1 activation can be so detrimental to host fitness that its pathogen-protective effects are repeatedly forfeited.",
