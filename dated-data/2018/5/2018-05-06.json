    "abstract": "The discrete space, continuous time birth-death model is a key process for describing phylogenies in the absence of coalescent approximations. Extensively used in macroevolution for analysing diversification, and in epidemiology for estimating viral dynamics, the birth-death process (BDP) is an important null model for inferring the parameters of reconstructed phylogenies. In this paper we show how optimal, point process (Snyder) filtering techniques can be used for parametric inference on BDPs. Specifically, we introduce the Bayesian Snyder filter (SF) to estimate birth and death rate parameters, given a reconstructed phylogeny. Our estimation procedure makes use of the equivalent Markov birth process description for a reconstructed birth-death phylogeny (Nee et al, 1994). We first analyse the popular constant rate BDP and show that our method gives results consistent with previous work. Among these results is an analytic solution to the special case of the Yule-Furry model. We also find an equivalence between the SF Poisson likelihood and two standard conditioned birth-death model likelihoods. We then generalise our estimation problem to BDPs with time varying rates and numerically solve the SF for two illustrative cases. Our results compare well with a recent Markov chain Monte Carlo method by Hohna et al (2016) and we numericaly show that both methods are solving the same likelihood functions. Lastly we apply the SF to a model selection problem on empirical data. We use the Australian Agamid dataset and predict the same relative model fit as that of the original maximum likelihood technique developed and used by Rabosky (2006) for this dataset. While several capable parametric and non-parametric birth-death estimators already exist, ours is the first to take the Nee et al approach, and directly computes the posterior distribution of the parameters. The SF makes no approximations, beyond those required for parameter space discretisation and numerical integration, and is mean square error optimal. It is deterministic, easily implementable and flexible. We think SFs present a promising alternative parametric BDP inference engine.",

    "abstract": "Host receptor usage by KSHV has been best studied using primary microvascular endothelial and fibroblast cells, although the virus infects a wide variety of cell types in culture and in natural infections. In these two infection models, KSHV adheres to the cell though heparan sulfate (HS) binding, then interacts with a complex of EphA2, xct, and integrins 3{beta}1, V{beta}3, V{beta}5 to catalyze viral entry. We dissected this receptor complex at the genetic level with CRISPR-Cas9 to precisely determine receptor usage in two epithelial cell lines. Surprisingly, we discovered an infection mechanism that requires HS and EphA2 but is independent of V- and {beta}1-family integrin expression. Furthermore, infection appears to be independent of the EphA2 intracellular domain. We also demonstrated while two other endogenous Eph receptors were dispensable for KSHV infection, transduced EphA4 and EphA5 significantly enhanced infection of cells lacking EphA2.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEOur data reveals an integrin-independent route of KSHV infection and suggests that multiple Eph receptors besides EphA2 can promote and regulate infection. Since integrins and Eph receptors are large protein families with diverse expression patterns across cells and tissues, we propose that KSHV may engage with several proteins from both families in different combinations to negotiate successful entry into diverse cell types.",

    "abstract": "In Eukaryotic organisms, replication initiation follows a temporal program. Among the parameters that regulate this program in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromatin structure has been at the center of attention without considering the contribution of transcription. Here, we revisit the replication initiation program in the light of pervasive transcription. We find that noncoding RNA transcription termination in the vicinity of replication origins or ARS (Autonomously Replicating Sequences) maximizes replication initiation by restricting transcriptional readthrough into ARS. Consistently, high natural nascent transcription correlates with low ARS efficiency and late replication timing. High readthrough transcription is also linked to chromatin features such as high levels of H3K36me3 and deacetylated nucleosomes. Moreover, forcing ARS readthrough transcription promotes these histone modifications. Finally, replication initiation defects induced by increased transcriptional readthrough are partially rescued in the absence of H3K36 methylation. Altogether, these observations indicate that natural pervasive transcription into ARS influences replication initiation through chromatin remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Unwanted evolution of designed DNA sequences limits metabolic and genome engineering efforts. Engineered functions that are burdensome to host cells and slow their replication are rapidly inactivated by mutations, and unplanned mutations with unpredictable effects often accumulate alongside designed changes in large-scale genome editing projects. We developed a directed evolution strategy, Periodic Reselection for Evolutionarily Reliable Variants (PResERV), to discover mutations that prolong the function of a burdensome DNA sequence in an engineered organism. Here, we used PResERV to isolate E. coli cells that replicate ColE1 plasmids with higher fidelity. We found mutations in DNA polymerases I and IV and in RNase E that reduce plasmid mutation rates by 6-to 30-fold. The PResERV method implicitly selects to maintain the growth rate of host cells, and high plasmid copy numbers and gene expression levels are maintained in some of the evolved E. coli strains, indicating that it is possible to improve the genetic stability of cellular chassis without encountering trade-offs in other desirable performance characteristics. Utilizing these new antimutator E. coli and applying PResERV to other organisms in the future promises to prevent evolutionary failures and unpredictability to provide a more stable genetic foundation for synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Preprocessing of functional MRI (fMRI) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize data before statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each new dataset, building upon a large inventory of tools available for each step. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in MR data acquisition and image processing techniques. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for task-based and resting fMRI data. FMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing with no manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software-testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data collection comprising participants from 54 different studies in the OpenfMRI repository. We review the distinctive features of fMRIPrep in a qualitative comparison to other preprocessing workflows. We demonstrate that fMRIPrep achieves higher spatial accuracy as it introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than commonly used preprocessing tools. FMRIPrep has the potential to transform fMRI research by equipping neuroscientists with a high-quality, robust, easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of their results.",

However, patients with the same genetic defect can have different clinical presentation 2-4, and some individuals carrying known disease-causing variants can appear unaffected 5. What explains these differences? Here, we show in a cohort of 6,987 children with heterogeneous severe neurodevelopmental disorders expected to be almost entirely monogenic that 7.7% of variance in risk is attributable to inherited common genetic variation. We replicated this genome wide common variant burden by showing that it is over-transmitted from parents to children in an independent sample of 728 trios from the same cohort. Our common variant signal is significantly positively correlated with genetic predisposition to fewer years of schooling, decreased intelligence, and risk of schizophrenia. We found that common variant risk was not significantly different between individuals with and without a known protein-coding diagnostic variant, suggesting that common variant risk is not confined to patients without a monogenic diagnosis. In addition, previously published common variant scores for autism, height, birth weight, and intracranial volume were all correlated with those traits within our cohort, suggesting that phenotypic expression in individuals with monogenic disorders is affected by the same variants as the general population. Our results demonstrate that common genetic variation affects both overall risk and clinical presentation in disorders typically considered to be monogenic.",

We propose that MEF2C and SOX9 may show similar cooperative activity in other tissues, and across a range of adult murine tissues we found co-expression of both transcription factors in cartilage, trachea, brain, eyes and heart. Strikingly, all of these tissues are prone to calcification and further study of MEF2C/SOX9 cooperativity in these organs will be revealing.",

The peptide, SOCS1-KIR, is thus capable of downregulating overactive JAK/STAT or NF-kB signaling in somatic cells, including those in many compartments of the eye. Attachment of poly-arginine to this peptide (R9-SOCS1-KIR) allows it to penetrate the plasma membrane in aqueous media. R9-SOCS1-KIR was tested in ARPE-19 cells and was found to attenuate mediators of inflammation by blocking the inflammatory effects of IFN{gamma}, TNF, or IL-17A. R9-SOCS1-KIR also protected against TNF or IL-17A mediated damage to the barrier properties of ARPE-19 cells, as evidenced by immunostaining with the tight junction protein, zona occludin 1 (ZO-1), and measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER).

    "abstract": "A number of insects fly over long distances below the natural canopy where the physical environment is highly cluttered consisting of obstacles of varying shape, size and texture. While navigating within such environments animals need to perceive and disambiguate environmental features that might obstruct their flight. The most elemental aspect of aerial navigation through such environments is gap identification and passability evaluation. We used bumblebees to seek insights into the mechanisms used for gap identification when confronted with an obstacle in their flight path and behavioral compensations employed to assess gap properties. Initially, bumblebee foragers were trained to fly though an unobstructed flight tunnel that led to a foraging chamber. After the bees were familiar with this situation, we placed a wall containing a gap that unexpectedly obstructed the flight path on a return trip to the hive. The flight trajectories of the bees as they approached the obstacle wall and traversed the gap were analyzed in order to evaluate their behavior as a function of the distance between the gap and a background wall that was placed behind the gap. Bumblebees initially decelerate when confronted with an unexpected obstacle. Deceleration was first noticed when the obstacle subtended around 35{degrees} on the retina but also depended on the properties of the gap. Subsequently the bees gradually traded off their longitudinal velocity to lateral velocity and approached the gap increasing lateral displacements and lateral velocity. Bumblebees shaped their flight trajectory depending on the salience of the gap, in our case, indicated by the optic flow contrast between the region within the gap and on the obstacle, which increases with decreasing distance between the gap and the background wall. As the optic flow contrast decreased the bees spent increasing time moving laterally across the obstacles. During these repeated lateral maneuvers the bees are likely assessing gap geometry and passability.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus spectroscopy (31P) at 7T (300 MHz) enables clinically-relevant spatial resolutions and time scales with high potential for monitoring response to cancer treatment. However, at 7T collecting a radiological-grade anatomical image of the liver--which is required for performing localized 31P spectroscopy--presents a challenge. Unlike lower field-strength scanners, there is no body coil in the bore of the 7T and despite inadequate penetration depth (<10 cm), surface coils are the current state-of-the-art for acquiring anatomical (1H) images. Therefore, thus far, high field 31P spectroscopy has been limited to diffuse liver disease. However, the use of antennas enable improved penetration depths at 300 MHz, and when combined with parallel transmit, can enable body imaging at 7T. We have developed a protocol for imaging liver metastases of patients using parallel transmit and 31P spectroscopy at 7T. We used a custom-made liver coil consisting of eight 30-cm dipole antennas tuned to the proton (300 MHz) frequency, and two partially overlapping 20-cm-diameter loops tuned for 31P (120 MHz). The field of view afforded by the two antennas underneath the 31P loops is not sufficient to image the complete boundaries of the liver for chemical shift imaging (CSI) planning and region-of-interest-based B0 shimming. The liver and full axial slice of the abdomen was imaged with eight transmit/receive antennas using parallel transmit B1-shimming to overcome image voids. Through the use of antennas we overcome the challenges for multi-parametric body imaging, and can begin to explore the possibility of monitoring the response of patients with liver metastasis to cancer treatments.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium chelonae is a rapidly growing mycobacterium present in the environment. It is associated with skin and soft tissue infections including abscess, cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Other infections by this bacterium are post-operative/transplant-associated, catheter, prostheses and even concomitant to haemodialytic procedures. In this study, we employ a subtractive genomics approach to predict the potential therapeutic candidates, intended for experimental research against this bacterium. A computational workflow was devised and executed to procure core proteome targets essential to the pathogen but with no similarity to the human host. Initially, essential Mycobacterium chelonae proteins were predicted through homology searching of core proteome content from 19 different bacteria. Druggable proteins were then identified and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) was chosen as a case study from identified therapeutic targets, based on its important bifunctional role. Structure modeling was followed by virtual screening of phytochemicals (N > 10,000) against it. 4,4-[(1E)-5-hydroxy-4-(methoxymethyl)-1-pentene-1,5-diyl]diphenol, apigenin-7-O-beta-gluconopyranoside and methyl rosmarinate were screened as compounds having best potential for binding GlmU. Phytotherapy helps curb the menace of antibiotic resistance so treatment of Mycobacterium chelonae infection through this method is recommended.",

    "abstract": "The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most widespread human pathogens known today, yet its origin and evolutionary history are still unclear and controversial. Here, we report the analysis of three ancient HBV genomes recovered from human skeletons found at three different archaeological sites in Germany. We reconstructed two Neolithic and one medieval HBV genomes by de novo assembly from shotgun DNA sequencing data. Additionally, we observed HBV-specific peptides using paleo-proteomics. Our results show that HBV circulates in the European population for at least 7000 years. The Neolithic HBV genomes show a high genomic similarity to each other. In a phylogenetic network, they do not group with any human-associated HBV genome and are most closely related to those infecting African non-human primates. These ancient virus forms appear to represent distinct lineages that have no close relatives today and went possibly extinct. Our results reveal the great potential of ancient DNA from human skeletons in order to study the long-time evolution of blood borne viruses.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors are managers of the cellular factory, and key components to many diseases. Many non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms affect transcription factors, either by directly altering the protein or its functional activity at individual binding sites. Here we first briefly summarize high throughput approaches to studying transcription factor activity. We then demonstrate, using published chromatin accessibility data (specifically ATAC-seq), that the genome wide profile of TF recognition motifs relative to regions of open chromatin can determine the key transcription factor altered by a perturbation. Our method of determining which TF are altered by a perturbation is simple, quick to implement and can be used when biological samples are limited. In the future, we envision this method could be applied to determining which TFs show altered activity in response to a wide variety of drugs and diseases.",
