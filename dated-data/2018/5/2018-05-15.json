    "abstract": "Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) was proposed 20 years ago for study of task modulated connectivity on functional MRI (fMRI) data. A few modifications have since been made, but there remain misunderstandings on the method, as well as on its relations to a similar method named beta series correlation (BSC). Here, we explain what PPI measures and its relations to BSC. We first clarify that the interpretation of a regressor in a general linear model depends on not only itself but also on how other effects are modeled. In terms of PPI, it always reflects differences in connectivity between conditions, when the physiological variable is included as a covariate. Secondly, when there are multiple conditions, we explain how PPI models calculated from direct contrast between conditions could generate identical results as contrasting separate PPIs of each condition (a.k.a. \"generalized\" PPI). Thirdly, we explicit the deconvolution process that is used for PPI calculation, and how is it related to the trial-by-trial modeling for BSC, and illustrate the relations between PPI and those based upon BSC. In particular, when context sensitive changes in effective connectivity are present, they manifest as changes in correlations of observed trial-by-trial activations or functional connectivity. Therefore, BSC and PPI can detect similar connectivity differences. Lastly, we report empirical analyses using PPI and BSC on fMRI data of an event-related stop signal task to illustrate our points.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of chemical diversity in biological samples has greatly improved through recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based-imaging (MSI) techniques have further enhanced this by providing spatial information on the distribution of metabolites and their relative abundance.\\n\\nThis study aims to employ laser-assisted electrospray ionization (LAESI) MSI as a tool to profile and compare the root metabolome of two pairs of native and range expanding plant species.\\n\\nIt has been proposed that successful range-expanding plant species, like introduced exotic invaders, have a novel, or a more diverse secondary chemistry. Although some tests have been made using aboveground plant materials, tests using root materials are rare. We tested the hypothesis that range-expanding plants possess more diverse root chemistries than native plant species.\\n\\nTo examine the root chemistry of the selected plant species, LAESI-MSI was performed in positive ion mode and data was acquired in a mass range of m/z 50-1200 with a spatial resolution of 100 {micro}m. The acquired data was analyzed using in-house scripts, and differences in the spatial profiles were studied for discriminatory mass features. The results revealed clear differences in the metabolite profiles amongst and within both pairs of congeneric plant species, in the form of distinct metabolic fingerprints. The use of ambient conditions and the fact that no sample preparation was required, established LAESI-MSI as an ideal technique for untargeted metabolomics and for direct correlation of the acquired data to the underlying metabolomic complexity present in intact plant samples.",

    "abstract": "Newborn individuals are highly susceptible to infectious diseases. For better insights into age-specific host-pathogen interactions infection models are increasingly employed in neonatal mice. However, for newborn mice no measures are available to objectify the clinical disease state, particularly not in a longitudinal manner, to meet legal animal welfare requirements. We developed a scoring system for newborn mice that relies on observational and examination-based parameters and validated it by applying a Staphylococcus aureus-induced infection model in two different mouse strains.\\n\\nThe scoring results strongly correlated with the death kinetics independent of which mouse strain was used. A score above 7 predicted fatality. While the score values increased already at early sepsis stages the large majority of plasma cytokine levels remained comparable to those in uninfected control neonates. The levels of interleukin (Il)-6, chemokine C-C motif ligand 5, Il-1 and tumor necrosis factor  were not increased before 24 hours after infection and correlated only at this late stage of sepsis with the scored disease state.\\n\\nWe propose the first clinical scoring system that serves as important research tool to evaluate the clinical course of sepsis in newborn mice. It detects health impairments of newborn pups in a highly sensitive and longitudinal manner, providing information about the disease severity as well as prognosis.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoen-vironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used LO_SCPLOWOESSC_SCPLOW-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the LO_SCPLOWOESSC_SCPLOW fit (e.g. span width, degree of polynomial). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike LO_SCPLOWOESSC_SCPLOW, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter{delta} 15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3000-year alkenone record from Braya-S{phi}, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.",

    "abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has shown clinical potential for relieving the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinsons disease. While accurate localization of the STN is critical for consistent across-patients effective DBS, clear visualization of the STN under standard clinical MR protocols is still challenging. Therefore, intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER) are incorporated to accurately localize the STN. However, MER require significant neurosurgical expertise and lengthen the surgery time. Recent advances in 7T MR technology facilitate the ability to clearly visualize the STN. The vast majority of centers, however, still do not have 7T MRI systems, and fewer have the ability to collect and analyze the data. This work introduces an automatic STN localization framework based on standard clinical MRIs without additional cost in the current DBS planning protocol. Our approach benefits from a large database of 7T MRI and its clinical MRI pairs. We first model in the 7T database, using efficient machine learning algorithms, the spatial and geometric dependency between the STN and its adjacent structures (predictors). Given a standard clinical MRI, our method automatically computes the predictors and uses the learned information to predict the patient-specific STN. We validate our proposed method on clinical T2W MRI of 80 subjects, comparing with experts-segmented STNs from the corresponding 7T MRI pairs. The experimental results show that our framework provides more accurate and robust patient-specific STN localization than using state-of-the-art atlases. We also demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the proposed technique assessing the post-operative electrode active contact locations.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenging problems in the brain imaging research is a principled incorporation of information from different imaging modalities in association studies. Frequently, data from each modality is analyzed separately using, for instance, dimensionality reduction techniques, which result in a loss of mutual information. We propose a novel regularization method, griPEER (generalized ridgified Partially Empirical Eigenvectors for Regression) to estimate the association between the brain structure features and a scalar outcome within the generalized linear regression framework. griPEER provides a principled approach to use external information from the structural brain connectivity to improve the regression coefficient estimation. Our proposal incorporates a penalty term, derived from the structural connectivity Laplacian matrix, in the penalized generalized linear regression. We address both theoretical and computational issues and show that our method is robust to the incomplete information about the structural brain connectivity. We also provide a significance testing procedure for performing inference on the estimated coefficients in this model. griPEER is evaluated in extensive simulation studies and it is applied in classification of the HIV+ and HIV- individuals.",

    "abstract": "In response to insect herbivory, plants mobilize various defenses. Defense responses include the release of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that can serve as signals to alert undamaged tissues and to attract natural enemies of the herbivores. It has also been shown that some HIPVs can have a direct negative impact on herbivore survival, but it is not yet understood by what mechanism. Here we tested the hypothesis that exposure to HIPVs renders insects more susceptible to natural pathogens. Exposing caterpillars of the noctuid Spodoptera exigua to indole and linalool, but not exposure to (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate increased the susceptibility to its nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV). We also found that exposure to indole, but not exposure to linalool or (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, increased the pathogenicity of Bacillus thuringiensis. Additional experiments revealed significant changes on gut microbiota composition after forty-eight hours of larval exposure to indole. Overall, these results provide evidences that certain HIPVs can strongly enhance the susceptibility of caterpillars to pathogens, possibly through effects on the insects gut microbiota. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which HIPVs can protect plants from herbivorous insects.",

    "abstract": "Retrotransposons have played an important role in the evolution of host genomes1,2. Their impact on host chromosomes is mainly deduced from the composition of DNA sequences, which have been fixed over evolutionary time. These studies provide important \\\"snapshots\\\" reflecting historical activities of transposons but do not predict current transposition potential. We previously reported Sequence-Independent Retrotransposon Trapping (SIRT) as a methodology that, by identification of extrachromosomal linear DNA (eclDNA), revealed the presence of active LTR retrotransposons in Arabidopsis9. Unfortunately, SIRT cannot be applied to large and transposon-rich genomes of crop plants. We have since developed an alternative approach named ALE-seq (amplification of LTR of eclDNAs followed by sequencing). ALE-seq reveals sequences of 5 LTRs of eclDNAs after two-step amplification: in vitro transcription and subsequent reverse transcription. Using ALE-seq in rice, we detected eclDNAs for a novel Copia family LTR retrotransposon, Go-on, which is activated by heat stress. Sequencing of rice accessions revealed that Go-on has preferentially accumulated in indica rice grown at higher temperatures. Furthermore, ALE-seq applied to tomato fruits identified a developmentally regulated Gypsy family of retrotransposons. Importantly, a bioinformatic pipeline adapted for ALE-seq data analyses allows the direct and reference-free annotation of new active retroelements. This pipeline allows assessment of LTR retrotransposon activities in organisms for which genomic sequences and/or reference genomes are unavailable or are of low quality.",

    "abstract": "Modern synthetic biology depends on the manufacture of large DNA constructs from libraries of genes, regulatory elements or other genetic parts. Type IIS restriction enzyme-dependent DNA assembly methods (e.g., Golden Gate) enable rapid one-pot, ordered, multi-fragment DNA assembly, facilitating the generation of high-complexity constructs. The order of assembly of genetic parts is determined by the ligation of flanking Watson-Crick base-paired overhangs. The ligation of mismatched overhangs leads to erroneous assembly, and the need to avoid such pairings has typically been accomplished by using small sets of empirically vetted junction pairs, limiting the number of parts that can be joined in a single reaction. Here, we report the use of a comprehensive method for profiling end-joining ligation fidelity and bias to predict highly accurate sets of connections for ligation-based DNA assembly methods. This data set allows quantification of sequence-dependent ligation efficiency and identification of mismatch-prone pairings. The ligation profile accurately predicted junction fidelity in ten-fragment Golden Gate assembly reactions, and enabled efficient assembly of a lac cassette from up to 24-fragments in a single reaction. Application of the ligation fidelity profile to inform choice of junctions thus enables highly flexible assembly design, with >20 fragments in a single reaction.",

They are largely met in high-flow rate chromatographic systems for small molecules but these are not sufficiently sensitive for proteomics applications. Here we describe a new concept that delivers on these requirements while maintaining the sensitivity of current nano-flow LC systems. Low-pressure pumps elute the sample from a disposable trap column, simultaneously forming a chromatographic gradient that is stored in a long storage loop. An auxiliary gradient creates an offset, ensuring the re-focusing of the peptides before the separation on the analytical column by a single high-pressure pump. This simplified design enables robust operation over thousands of sample injections. Furthermore, the steps between injections are performed in parallel, reducing overhead time to a few minutes and allowing analysis of more than 200 samples per day. From fractionated HeLa cell lysates, deep proteomes covering more than 130,000 sequence unique peptides and close to 10,000 proteins were rapidly acquired. Using this data as a library, we demonstrate quantitation of 5200 proteins in only 21 min.

    "abstract": "Background: Overcoming systemic dormancy and initiating secondary tumor grow under unique microenvironmental conditions is a major rate-limiting step in metastatic progression. Disseminated tumor cells encounter major changes in nutrient supplies and oxidative stresses compared to the primary tumor and must demonstrate significant metabolic plasticity to adapt to specific metastatic sites. Recent studies suggest that differential utilization of pyruvate sits as a critical node in determining the organotropism of metastatic breast cancer. Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is key enzyme that converts pyruvate into oxaloacetate for utilization in gluconeogenesis and replenishment of the TCA cycle.\\n\\nMethods: Patient survival was analyzed with respect to gene copy number alterations and differential mRNA expression levels of PC. Expression of PC was analyzed in the MCF-10A, D2-HAN and the 4T1 breast cancer progression series under in vitro and in vivo growth conditions. PC expression was depleted via shRNAs and the impact on in vitro cell growth, mammary fat pad tumor growth, and pulmonary and non-pulmonary metastasis was assessed by bioluminescent imaging. Changes in glycolytic capacity, oxygen consumption and response to oxidative stress were quantified upon PC depletion.\\n\\nResults: Genomic copy number increases in PC were observed in 16-30% of metastatic breast cancer patients. High expression of PC mRNA was associated with decreased patient survival in the MCTI and METABRIC patient datasets. Enhanced expression of PC was not recapitulated in breast cancer progression models when analyzed under glucose-rich in vitro culture conditions. In contrast, PC expression was dramatically enhanced upon glucose deprivation and in vivo in pulmonary metastases. Depletion of PC led to a dramatic decrease in 4T1 pulmonary metastasis but did not affect orthotopic primary tumor growth. Tail vein inoculations confirmed the role of PC in facilitating pulmonary, but not extra-pulmonary tumor initiation. PC-depleted cells demonstrated a decrease in glycolytic capacity and oxygen consumption rates and an enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress.\\n\\nConclusions: Our studies indicate that PC is specifically required for the growth of breast cancer that has disseminated to the lungs. Overall, these findings point to the potential of targeting PC for the treatment of pulmonary metastatic breast cancer.",

Marine mammals and sea turtles comprise 36% of the 161 ESA-listed marine species, yet analyses of recovery trends after listing are lacking. Here we gather the best available annual population estimates for all marine mammals (n=33) and sea turtles (n=29) listed under the ESA as species. Of these, we quantitatively analyze population trends, magnitude of population change, and recovery status for representative populations of 23 marine mammals and 9 sea turtles, which were listed for more than five years, occur in U.S. waters, and have data of sufficient quality and span of time for trend analyses. Using generalized linear and non-linear models, we found that 78% of marine mammals (n=18) and 78% of sea turtles (n=7) significantly increased after listing; 13% of marine mammals (n=3) and 22% of sea turtles (n=2) showed non-significant changes; while 9% of marine mammals (n=2), but no sea turtles declined after ESA protection. Overall, species with populations that increased in abundance were listed for 20 years or more (e.g., large whales, manatees, and sea turtles). Conservation measures triggered by ESA listing such as ending exploitation, tailored species management, and fishery regulations, among others, appear to have been largely successful in promoting species recovery, leading to the delisting of some species and to increases in most. These findings underscore the capacity of marine mammals and sea turtles to recover from substantial population declines when conservation actions under the ESA are implemented in a timely and effective manner.",

    "abstract": "Following attachment to host receptors via {sigma}1, reovirus particles are endocytosed and disassembled to generate infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs). ISVPs undergo conformational changes to form ISVP*, releasing {sigma}1 and membrane-targeting peptides from the viral 1 protein. ISVP* formation is required for delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm for replication. We characterized the properties of T3DF/T3DCS1, a S1 gene monoreassortant between two laboratory isolates of prototype reovirus strain T3D: T3DF and T3DC. T3DF/T3DCS1 is poorly infectious. This deficiency is a consequence of inefficient encapsidation of S1-encoded {sigma}1 on T3DF/T3DCS1 virions. Additionally, in comparison to T3DF, T3DF/T3DCS1 undergoes ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion more readily, revealing an unexpected role for {sigma}1 in regulating ISVP* formation. The {sigma}1 protein is held within turrets formed by the {lambda}2 protein. To test if the altered properties of T3DF/T3DCS1 are due to a mismatch between {sigma}1 and {lambda}2 proteins from T3DF and T3DC, properties of T3DF/T3DCL2 and T3DF/T3DCS1L2, which express a T3DC-derived {lambda}2, were compared. The presence of T3DC {lambda}2 allowed more efficient {sigma}1 incorporation, producing particles that exhibit T3DF-like infectivity. In comparison to T3DF, T3DF/T3DCL2 prematurely converts to ISVP* uncovering a role for {lambda}2 in regulating ISVP* formation. Importantly, a virus with matching {sigma}1 and {lambda}2 displayed a more regulated conversion to ISVP* than either T3DF/T3DCS1 or T3DF/T3DCL2. In addition to identifying new regulators of ISVP* formation, our results highlight that protein mismatches produced by reassortment can alter virus assembly and thereby influence subsequent functions of the virus capsid.",

    "abstract": "Social impairment in schizophrenia is often thought to reflect poor social cognition. Here we examine responses to social rewards, an aspect of social functioning that is not featured prominently in the literature. The goal of this experiment was to explore whether people with schizophrenia (1) undervalue social rewards, and (2) whether the undervaluation of social rewards was related to social motivation and pleasure deficits in schizophrenia and decreased social functioning. People with schizophrenia and healthy participants completed a game (Shore & Heerey, 2011) to explore preferences for different types of social (polite and genuine smiles) and nonsocial (monetary) rewards from computerized opponents. Preferences for reward types were quantified for each participant based on choice behavior during the game. Participants also completed a smile discrimination task to assess their ability to discriminate these types of smiles. Analyses revealed that people with schizophrenia (N = 41) treated genuine smiles as significantly less rewarding than did healthy participants (N = 29), despite showing a similar preference for monetary rewards. Interestingly, the undervaluation of social rewards was not related to the ability to discriminate between the smiles. The current findings provide preliminary evidence of reduced social reward valuation among individuals with schizophrenia, which may have implications for behavior in face-to-face social interactions.\\n\\nGeneral Scientific SummarySocial cognitive deficits are well documented in schizophrenia. However, it is less clear how people with schizophrenia respond to social rewards. Our study yields initial evidence of a deficit in social reward valuation (operationalized as a preference for genuine smiles) despite similar preferences for monetary rewards.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system provides the ability to edit, repress, activate, or mark any gene (or DNA element) by pairing of a programmable single guide RNA (sgRNA) with a complementary sequence on the DNA target. Here we present a new method for small-molecule control of CRISPR-Cas9 function through insertion of RNA aptamers into the sgRNA. We show that CRISPR-Cas9-based gene repression (CRISPRi) can be either activated or deactivated in a dose-dependent fashion over a >10-fold dynamic range in response to two different small-molecule ligands. Since our system acts directly on each target-specific sgRNA, it enables new applications that require differential and opposing temporal control of multiple genes.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This disease, which primarily affects those living in tropical and subtropical regions, is caused by infection with Plasmodium parasites. The development of better drugs to combat malaria can be accelerated by improving our understanding of the biology of this complex parasite. Genetic manipulation of these parasites is key to understanding their biology, but historically, the genome of P. falciparum has been difficult to manipulate. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been utilized in malaria parasites, allowing for easier protein tagging, generation of conditional protein knockdowns, and deletion of genes. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has proven to be a powerful tool for advancing the field of malaria research. Here, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 method for generating glmS-based conditional knockdown mutants in P. falciparum. The method is highly adaptable to other types of genetic manipulations, including protein tagging and gene knockouts.",

    "abstract": "Change in hippocampal function is a major factor in lifespan development and decline of episodic memory. Evidence indicates a long-axis specialization where anterior hippocampus is more engaged during encoding and posterior during retrieval. We tested the lifespan trajectory of hippocampal long-axis episodic memory-related activity and functional connectivity (FC). 496 participants (6.8-80.8 years) were scanned with functional MRI while encoding and retrieving associative memories. We found clear evidence for a long-axis encoding-retrieval specialization. These long-axis effects declined linearly during development and aging, eventually vanishing in the older adults. This was mainly driven by age effects on retrieval. Retrieval was associated with gradually lower activity from childhood to adulthood, followed by positive age-relationships until 70 years. Interestingly, this pattern characterized task engagement regardless of memory success or failure. Children engaged posterior hippocampus more than anterior, while anterior hippocampus was more activated relative to posterior already in teenagers. Intra-hippocampal connectivity increased during task, and this increase declined with age. In sum, the results suggest that hippocampal long-axis differentiation and communication during episodic memory tasks develop rapidly during childhood and adolescence, are markedly different in older compared to younger adults, and are related to task engagement, not the successful completion of the task.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata is a highly polyphagous and invasive insect pest, causing vast economical damage in horticultural systems. A currently used control strategy is the sterile insect technique (SIT) that reduces pest populations through infertile matings with mass-released, sterilized insects. Transgenic approaches hold great promise to improve key aspects of a successful SIT program. However, there is strict or even prohibitive legislation regarding the release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), while novel CRISPR-Cas technologies might allow to develop genetically enhanced strains for SIT programs classified as non-transgenic.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe highly efficient homology-directed repair genome editing in C. capitata by injecting pre-assembled CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes using different guide RNAs and a short single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide donor to convert an enhanced green fluorescent protein in C. capitata into a blue fluorescent protein. Six out of seven fertile and individually backcrossed G0 individuals generated 57-90% knock-in rate within their total offspring and 70-96% knock-in rate within their phenotypically mutant offspring.\\n\\nConclusionConsidering the possibility that CRISPR-induced alterations in organisms could be classified as a non-GMO in the US and Europe, our approach to homology-directed repair genome editing can be used to genetically improve strains for pest control systems like SIT without the need to struggle with GMO directives. Furthermore, it can be used to recreate and use mutations, found in classical mutagenesis screens, for pest control systems.",
