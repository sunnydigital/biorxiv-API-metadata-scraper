    "abstract": "The crustacean Daphnia magna is an important model in multi-disciplinary scientific fields such as genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, toxicology, and ecology. Recently, draft genome sequence and transcriptome data became publicly available for this species. Genetic transformation by introduction of plasmid DNA into a genome has been achieved. To further advance D. magna functional genomics, identification of a screenable marker gene and generation of its mutant are indispensable. Because Daphnia is more closely related to insects among crustaceans, we hypothesized that eye color-related genes can function as a marker gene as used in Drosophila genetics. We searched orthologs of Drosophila eye pigment transporters White, Scarlet, and Brown in the genome of D. magna. Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that D. magna has six white and one scarlet orthologs, but lacks the brown ortholog. Due to a multiplicity of white orthologs, we analyzed function of the scarlet ortholog, DapmaSt, using RNA interference. DapmaSt RNAi embryos showed disappearance of black pigments both in the compound eye and in the ocellus, suggesting that DapmaSt is necessary for black pigmentation in Daphnia eyes. To disrupt DapmaSt by using the Crispr/Cas9 system, we co-injected DapmaSt-targeting gRNAs with Cas9 mRNAs into eggs and established white-eyed DapmaSt mutant lines that lack eye pigments throughout their lifespan. Our results suggest that DapmaSt can be used as a transformation marker in D. magng+a and the DapmaSt mutants would be an important resource for genetic transformation of this species in the future.",

    "abstract": "In color vision, the quantitative rules for mixing lights to make a target color are well understood. By contrast, the rules for mixing odorants to make a target odor remain elusive. A solution to this problem in vision relied on characterizing receptor responses to different wavelengths of light and subsequently relating these responses to perception. In olfaction, experimentally measuring receptor responses to a representative set of complex mixtures is intractable due to the vast number of possibilities. To meet this challenge, we develop a biophysical model that predicts mammalian receptor responses to complex mixtures using responses to single odorants. The dominant nonlinearity in our model is competitive binding (CB): only one odorant molecule can attach to a receptor binding site at a time. This simple framework predicts receptor responses to mixtures of up to twelve monomolecular odorants to within 15% of experimental observations and provides a powerful method for leveraging limited experimental data. Simple extensions of our model describe phenomena such as synergy, overshadowing, and inhibition. We demonstrate that the presence of such interactions can be identified via systematic deviations from the competitive binding model.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression studies suggest that differential ion channel expression contributes to differences in rodent versus human neuronal physiology. We tested whether h-channels more prominently contribute to the physiological properties of human compared to mouse supragranular pyramidal neurons. Single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing revealed ubiquitous HCN1-subunit expression in excitatory neurons in human, but not mouse supragranular layers. Using patch-clamp recordings, we found stronger h-channel-related membrane properties in supragranular pyramidal neurons in human temporal cortex, compared to mouse supragranular pyramidal neurons in temporal association area. The magnitude of these differences depended upon cortical depth and was largest in pyramidal neurons in deep L3. Additionally, pharmacologically blocking h-channels produced a larger change in membrane properties in human compared to mouse neurons. Finally, using biophysical modeling, we provided evidence that h-channels promote the transfer of theta frequencies from dendrite-to-soma in human L3 pyramidal neurons. Thus, h-channels contribute to between-species differences in a fundamental neuronal property.",

    "abstract": "Many studies of individual sites have revealed biotic changes consistent with climate warming (e.g., upward elevational distribution shifts), but our understanding of the tremendous variation among studies in the magnitude of such biotic changes is minimal. In this study we re-surveyed forest vegetation plots 40 years after the initial surveys in three protected areas along a west-to-east gradient of increasingly steep recent warming trends in eastern Canada (Quebec). Consistent with the hypothesis that climate warming has been an important driver of vegetation change, we found an increasing magnitude of changes in species richness and composition from west to east among the three parks. For the two mountainous parks, we found no changes in elevational species distributions in the eastern most park where warming has been minimal (Forillon Park), and significant upward distribution shifts in the centrally located park where the recent warming trend has been marked (Mont-Megantic). Community temperature indices (CTI), reflecting the average affinities of locally co-occurring to temperature conditions across their geographic ranges (\\\"species temperature indices\\\"), did not change over time as predicted. However, close examination of the underpinnings of CTI values suggested a high sensitivity to uncertainty in individual species temperature indices, and so a potentially limited responsiveness to warming. Overall, by testing a priori predictions concerning variation among parks in the direction and magnitude of vegetation changes, we have provided stronger evidence for a link between climate warming and biotic responses than otherwise possible, and provided a potential explanation for large variation among studies in warming-related biotic changes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the movement patterns of animals across different spatio-temporal scales, conditions, habitats and contexts is becoming increasingly important for addressing a series of questions in animal behaviour studies, such as mapping migration routes, evaluating resource use, modelling epidemic spreading in a population, developing strategies for animal conservation as well as understanding several emerging patterns related to feeding, growth and reproduction. In recent times, information theory has been successfully applied in several fields of science, in particular for understanding the dynamics of complex systems and characterizing adaptive social systems, such as dynamics of entities as individuals and as part of groups.\n\nIn this paper, we describe a series of non-parametric information-theoretic measures that can be used to derive new insights about animal behaviour with a specific focus on movement patterns, namely Shannon entropy, Mutual information, Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, we believe that the metrics presented in this paper can be used to formulate new hypotheses that can be verified potentially through a set of different observations and be complementary to existing techniques. We show how these measures can be used to characterize the movement patterns of several animals across different habitats and scales. Specifically, we show the effectiveness in using Shannon entropy to characterize the movement of sheep with Batten disease, mutual information to measure association in pigeons, Kullback-Leibler divergence to study the flights of Turkey vulture, and Kolmogorov complexity to find similarities in the movement patterns of animals across different scales and habitats. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods and we outline the challenges in this research area.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive reasoning is thought to require functional interactions between whole-brain networks. Such networks rely on both cerebral hemispheres, with the corpus callosum providing cross-hemispheric communication. Here we used high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), a well validated cognitive task, and brain network analyses to investigate the functional networks underlying cognitive reasoning in individuals with corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), an anatomical abnormality that affects the corpus callosum. Participants with CCD were asked to solve cognitive reasoning problems while their brain activity was measured using fMRI. The complexity of these problems was parametrically varied by changing the complexity of relations that needed to be established between shapes within each problem matrix. Behaviorally, participants showed a typical reduction in task performance as problem complexity increased. Task-evoked neural activity was observed in brain regions known to constitute two key cognitive control systems: the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks. Under low complexity demands, network topology and the patterns of local neural activity in the CCD group closely resembled those observed in neurotypical controls. By contrast, when asked to solve more complex problems, participants with CCD showed a reduction in neural activity and connectivity within the fronto-parietal network. These complexity-induced, as opposed to resting-state, differences in functional network activity help resolve the apparent paradox between preserved network architecture found at rest in CCD individuals, and the heterogeneous deficits they display in response to cognitive task demands [preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/312629].",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is a major public health concern and there is an urgent need to better understand its complex biology and develop effective therapies. AD progression can be tracked in patients though validated imaging and spinal fluid biomarkers of pathology and neuronal loss. We still, however, lack a coherent quantitative model that explains how these biomarkers interact and evolve over time. Such a model could potentially help identify the major drivers of disease in individual patients and simulate response to therapy prior to entry in clinical trials. A current theory of AD biomarker progression, known as the dynamic biomarker cascade model, hypothesizes AD biomarkers evolve in a sequential, but temporally overlapping manner. A computational model incorporating assumptions about the underlying biology of this theory and its variations would be useful to test and refine its accuracy with longitudinal biomarker data from clinical trials.\\n\\nMethodsWe implemented a causal model to simulate time-dependent biomarker data under the descriptive assumptions of the dynamic biomarker cascade theory. We modeled pathologic biomarkers (beta-amyloid and tau), neuronal loss biomarkers and cognitive impairment as non-linear first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include amyloid-dependent and non-dependent neurodegenerative cascades. We tested the feasibility of the model by adjusting its parameters to simulate three specific natural history scenarios in early-onset autosomal dominant AD and late-onset AD, and determine whether computed biomarker trajectories agreed with current assumptions of AD biomarker progression. We also simulated the effects of anti-amyloid therapy in late-onset AD.\\n\\nResultsThe computational model of early-onset AD demonstrated the initial appearance of amyloid, followed by biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration, followed by onset of cognitive decline based on cognitive reserve, as predicted by prior literature. Similarly, the late-onset AD computational models demonstrated the first appearance of amyloid or non-amyloid-related tauopathy, depending on the magnitude of comorbid pathology, and also closely matched the biomarker cascades predicted by prior literature. Forward simulation of anti-amyloid therapy in symptomatic late-onset AD failed to demonstrate any slowing in progression of cognitive decline, consistent with prior failed clinical trials in symptomatic patients.\\n\\nConclusionWe have developed and computationally implemented a mathematical causal model of the dynamic biomarker cascade theory in AD. We demonstrate the feasibility of this model by simulating biomarker evolution and cognitive decline in early and late-onset natural history scenarios, as well as in a treatment scenario targeted at core AD pathology. Models resulting from this causal approach can be further developed and refined using patient data from longitudinal biomarker studies, and may in the future play a key role in personalizing approaches to treatment.",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental problems in understanding the brain, in particular the cerebral cortex, is that we only have a partial understanding of the basic communication protocols that underlie signal transmission. This makes it difficult to interpret the significance of particular phenomena such as basic firing patterns and oscillations at different frequencies. There are, of course, useful models. Motivated by single-cell recording technology, Poisson statistics of cortical action potentials have long been a basic component in models of signal representation in the cortex. However, it is increasingly difficult to integrate Poisson spiking with spike timing signals in the gamma frequency spectrum. A potential way forward is being sparked by new technologies that allow the exploration of very low-level communication strategies. Specifically, the voltage potential of a cells soma now can be recorded with very high fidelity in vivo, allowing correlation of its fine structure to be correlated with behaviors. To interpret this data, we have developed a unified model (gamma spike multiplexing, or GSM) wherein a cells somatic gamma frequencies can modulate the generation of action potentials. Such spikes can be seen as the basis for a general-purpose method of modulating fast communication in cortical networks. In particular, the model has several important advantages over traditional formalisms: 1) It allows multiple, independent processes to run in parallel, greatly increasing the processing capability of the cortex 2) Its processing speed is 102 to 103 times faster than population coding methods 3) Its processes are not bound to specific locations, but migrate across cortical cells as a function of time, facilitating the maintenance of cortical cell calibration.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that wild animals have never existed without symbiotic interactions with microbiota. Therefore, investigating relationships between microbiota and their host is essential towards a full understanding of how animal evolve and adapt to their environment. The Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) is a well-documented model for the study of ecological speciation, where the dwarf species (limnetic niche specialist) evolved independently and repeatedly from the normal species (benthic niche specialist). In this study, we compared the transient intestinal microbiota among five wild sympatric species pairs of whitefish as well as captive representatives of dwarf and normal species and their reciprocal hybrids reared in identical controlled conditions. We sequenced the 16s rRNA gene V3-V4 regions of the transient intestinal microbiota present in a total of 185 whitefish to (i) test for parallelism in the transient intestinal microbiota among sympatric pairs of whitefish, (ii) test for transient intestinal microbiota differences among dwarf, normal and both hybrids reared under identical conditions and (iii) compare intestinal microbiota between wild and captive whitefish. A significant effect of host species on microbiota taxonomic composition was observed in the wild when all lakes where analyzed together, and species effect was observed in three of the five species pairs. In captive whitefish, an influence of host (normal, dwarf and hybrids) was also detected on microbiota taxonomic composition and tens of genera specific to dwarf, normal or hybrids were highlighted. Hybrid microbiota was not intermediate; instead its composition fell outside of that observed in the parental forms and this was observed in both reciprocal hybrid crosses. Interestingly, six genera formed a bacterial core which was present in captive and wild whitefish, suggesting a horizontal microbiota transmission. Although diet appeared to be a major driving force for microbiota evolution, our results suggested a more complex interaction among the host, the microbiota and the environment leading to three distinct evolutionary paths of the intestinal microbiota.",

    "abstract": "The co-deletion of a common tumor suppressor locus and neighboring metabolic gene is an attractive possible synthetic dependency of tumor suppression on metabolism. However, the general impact that these co-deletions have on metabolism, which also dependent on nutrient availability and the tissue of origin, is unknown. As a model to investigate this question, we considered a set of tissue-matched cancer cells with homozygous co-deletions in CDKN2a and MTAP, genes respectively encoding the most commonly deleted tumor suppressor p16 and an enzyme involved in methionine metabolism. A comparative metabolomics analysis revealed that while there exists a definite pan-cancer metabolic signature of MTAP-deletion, this signature was not preserved when cells were subjected to changes in the availability of methionine, serine, or cysteine, nutrients related to methionine metabolism. Notably, the heterogeneity exhibited by these cells in their responsiveness to nutrient availability dominated both MTAP status and tissue-of-origin. Furthermore, re-expression of MTAP exerted a modest effect on metabolism. Together these findings demonstrate that environmental factors, particularly nutrition and tissue identity, may overwhelm the genetic effects of collateral deletions of metabolic genes.",

    "abstract": "AimGlobal indicators of change in the state of terrestrial biodiversity are often derived by intersecting observed or projected changes in the distribution of habitat transformation, or of protected areas, with underlying patterns in the distribution of biodiversity. However the two main sources of data used to account for biodiversity patterns in such assessments - i.e. ecoregional boundaries, and vertebrate species ranges - are typically delineated at a much coarser resolution than the spatial grain of key ecological processes shaping both land-use and biological distributions at landscape scale. Species distribution modelling provides one widely used means of refining the resolution of mapped species distributions, but is limited to a subset of species which is biased both taxonomically and geographically, with some regions of the world lacking adequate data to generate reliable models even for better-known biological groups.\\n\\nInnovationMacroecological modelling of collective properties of biodiversity (e.g. alpha and beta diversity) as a correlative function of environmental predictors offers an alternative, yet highly complementary, approach to refining the spatial resolution with which patterns in the distribution of biodiversity can be mapped across our planet. Here we introduce a new capability - BILBI (the Biogeographic Infrastructure for Large-scaled Biodiversity Indicators) - which has implemented this approach by integrating advances in macroecological modelling, biodiversity informatics, remote sensing and high-performance computing to assess spatial-temporal change in biodiversity at ~1km grid resolution across the entire terrestrial surface of the planet. The initial implementation of this infrastructure focuses on modelling beta-diversity patterns using a novel extension of generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) designed to extract maximum value from sparsely and unevenly distributed occurrence records for over 400,000 species of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.\\n\\nMain conclusionsModels generated by BILBI greatly refine the mapping of beta-diversity patterns relative to more traditional biodiversity surrogates such as ecoregions. This capability is already proving of considerable value in informing global biodiversity assessment through: 1) generation of indicators of past-to-present change in biodiversity based on observed changes in habitat condition and protected-area coverage; and 2) projection of potential future change in biodiversity as a consequence of alternative scenarios of global change in drivers and policy options.",

We assessed the comparative effectiveness of the CCP by merging programmatic data on CCP clients with population-based surveillance data on all New York City PLWH. A non-CCP comparison group of similar PLWH who met CCP eligibility criteria was identified using surveillance data. The CCP and non-CCP groups were matched on propensity for CCP enrollment within four baseline treatment status groups (newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed and either consistently unsuppressed, inconsistently suppressed or consistently suppressed). We compared CCP to non-CCP proportions with viral load suppression at 12-month follow-up. Among the 13,624 persons included, 15{middle dot}3% were newly diagnosed; among the 84{middle dot}7% previously diagnosed, 14{middle dot}2% were consistently suppressed, 28{middle dot}9% were inconsistently suppressed, and 41 {middle dot}6% were consistently unsuppressed in the year prior to baseline.

CCP exposure shows benefits over no CCP exposure for persons newly diagnosed or consistently unsuppressed, but not for persons suppressed in the year prior to baseline.

    "abstract": "Basidiobolus spp. are a significant causal agent of infections in man and animals including gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis (GIB). Little information is available on how these infections are acquired or transmitted, apart from the postulation that environmental sources are implicated. This study aimed to identify Basidiobolus spp. from GIB patients and from the house gecko as a possible source of infection in Aseer, Saudi Arabia. Basidiobolus spp. were isolated from patient specimens (colonic mass biopsy) and from house gecko (gut contents) from Muhayil Aseer areas, in southern Saudi Arabia, using Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) which was incubated aerobically for up to three weeks at 30{degrees}C. Isolated fungi were initially identified using classical mycological tools and confirmed by sequence analysis of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Cultured specimens from humans and geckos revealed phenotypically similar zygomycete-like fungi which conform to those of Basidiobolus species. The strains formed a monophyletic clade in the 28S ribosomal RNA gene phylogenetic tree. They shared 99.97% similarity with B. haptosporus and 99.97% with B. haptosporus var. minor but have a relatively remote similarity to B. ranarum (99.925%). One isolates from a gecko (L3) fall within the sub-clade encompassing B. haptosporus strain NRRL28635. The study strongly suggests a new and a serious causal agent of GIB related to Basidiobolus haptosporus. The isolation of identical Basidiobolus haptosporus-like strains from humans and lizards from one area is an important step towards identifying risk factors for GIB. Research is underway to screen more environmental niches and fully describe the Basidiobolus strains.",

    "abstract": "In many countries Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) epidemics last approximately one to two years and occur every three to seven years. Poor understanding of the drivers of recurrent MP epidemics limits the predictability of and dynamic responses to the outbreak. Taking into account network structured contacts among people and co-circulating strains of MP, we propose a multi-strain SIRS network model of epidemics of MP where different strains interact during re-infection and within secondary infection. Simulations show that although strain interactions and network-mediated spatial correlations are two separate mechanisms for MP epidemics cycling, each requires very restricted model parameter values such as strong strain interactions and strong network contacts, respectively. When both mechanisms work collectively, MP recurrent epidemics become feasible within the plausible ranges of model parameters. This indicates that positively interacting strains that co-circulate within network contacts induce periodicity and dominant strain shift in observed MP incidence.",

Myeloid lineage cells predominate in this process. This study examined the role of Kruppel - like factor 2 (KLF2), a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates myeloid cell activation state, in muscle regeneration. Gastrocnemius muscles of wild-type and myeKlf2-/- mice, which lack KLF2 in all myeloid cells, were subjected to cardiotoxin injury and followed for 21 days. Injured muscles of myeKlf2-/- contained more infiltrating, inflammatory Ly6C+ monocytes, with elevated expression of inflammatory mediators. Infiltrating monocytes matured earlier into pro-inflammatory macrophages with phenotype Ly6C+, CD11b+, F4/80+. Inflammation resolved earlier and progressed to myogenesis, marked by an earlier decline of Ly6C+ macrophages and their replacement with anti-inflammatory Ly6C- populations, in association with elevated expression of factors that resolve inflammation and promote myogenesis. Overall, regeneration was completed earlier. These findings identify myeloid KLF2 as a central regulator of the innate immune response to acute skeletal muscle injury.

    "abstract": "Most research on phage therapy focused on planktonic bacteria, whereas bacteriophage activity against biofilms is limited. We evaluated the capability of Staphylococcus aureus-specific bacteriophage Sb-1 to eradicate biofilm alone and in combination with different classes of antibiotics, to degrade the extracellular matrix and target persister cells. Biofilm of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300 was treated with Sb-1 alone or in (simultaneous or staggered) combination with either fosfomycin, rifampin, vancomycin, daptomycin or ciprofloxacin. The matrix was visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy. Persister cells were treated with 104 and 107 PFU/mL Sb-1 for 3 hours in PBS, followed by CFU counting. Alternatively, bacteria were washed and incubated in fresh BHI medium and the bacterial growth assessed after further 24-hours. Pre-treatment with Sb-1 followed by the administration of sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic exerted a considerable synergistic effect in eradicating MRSA biofilm. Sb-1 determined a dose-dependent reduction of matrix exopolysaccharide. 107 PFU/mL Sb-1 showed direct killing activity on persisters. However, even a lower titer had lytic activity when phage-treated persister cells were inoculated in fresh medium, reverting to a normal-growing phenotype. This study provides valuable data regarding the capability of Sb-1 to enhance antibiotic efficacy, exhibiting specific antibiofilm features. Its ability to degrade the MRSA polysaccharide matrix and target persister cells makes Sb-1 suitable for the therapy of biofilm-associated infections.",

    "abstract": "Chagas disease remains a serious public health concern with unsatisfactory treatment outcomes due to strain-specific drug resistance and various side effects. To identify new therapeutic drugs against Trypanosoma cruzi, we evaluated both the in vitro and in vivo activity of the organometallic gold(III) complex [Au(Hdamp)(L14)]Cl (L1 = SNS- donating thiosemicarbazone), which was denoted 4-Cl. Our results demonstrated that 4- Cl was more effective than benznidazole (Bz) in eliminating both the extracellular trypomastigote and the intracellular amastigote forms of the parasite without cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells. In very-low-dose in vivo assays, 4-Cl reduced parasitaemia and tissue parasitism in addition to protecting the liver and heart from tissue damage. All these changes resulted in the survival of 100% of the mice treated with 4-Cl during the acute phase. We hypothesised that 4-Cl can act directly on the parasite and may participate in the modulation of IFN-{gamma} production at the acute stage of the disease. Molecular docking simulations showed that the compound may interact with cruzain, a thiol protease considered a possible antiparasitic drug target, primarily by hydrophobic interactions. These analyses predicted that the Cys25 residue in the cruzain binding site is approximately 3.0 [A] away from the S and Au atoms of the gold compound, which could suggest formation of a possible covalent bond between cruzain and the inhibitor. Overall, we confirmed the potential of 4-Cl as a new candidate for Chagas disease treatment.",

By doing so, Daple serves as a double-edged sword; earlier during oncogenesis it suppresses neoplastic transformation and tumor growth, but later it triggers epithelial messenchymal transition (EMT). We have identified and characterized two isoforms of the human Daple/CCDC88c gene. While both isoforms cooperatively suppress tumor growth via their GBA motif, only the full-length transcript triggers EMT and invasion. Aspirin suppresses the full-length transcript and protein but upregulates the short isoform. Both isoforms are suppressed during colon cancer progression, and their reduced expression carries additive prognostic significance. These findings provide insights into the opposing roles of Daple during cancer progression and define the G protein regulatory GBA motif as one of the minimal modules essential for Daples role as a tumor suppressor.",

    "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a human pathogen responsible for diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). EHEC infection is distributed worldwide and numerous outbreaks of diseases caused by enterohemorrhagic have been reported. To promote a comprehensive insight into the molecular basis of EHEC O157:H7 physiology and pathogenesis, the combined proteome of EHEC O157:H7 strains, Clade 8 and Clade 6 isolated from cattle in Argentina, and the standard EDL933 (clade 3) strain has been analyzed. TMT (Tandem Mass Tags)-based quantitative proteomic and emPAI analyses were performed to estimate the protein abundance in EHEC proteome. 2,234 non-redundant proteins of EHEC O157:H7 were identified. A comparison of this result with in silico data of EHEC O157:H7 genome showed that approximately 40% of the predicted proteome of this pathogen were covered. According to the emPAI analysis, 85 proteins were among the most abundant (e.g. GAPDH, FliC H-antigen, Enolase, and GroEL). Tellurite resistance proteins were also highly abundant. COG analysis showed that although most of the identified proteins are related to cellular metabolism, the majority of the most abundant proteins are associated with translation processes. A KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis was the most significant pathway. On the other hand, the less abundant detected proteins are those related to DNA processes, cell respiration and prophage. Among the proteins that composed the Type III Secretion System, the most abundant protein was EspA. Altogether, the results show a subset of important proteins that contribute to physiology and pathogenicity of EHEC O157:H7.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe study of the abundance of proteins present within a complex mixture of proteins in a cell, under different conditions, can provide important information about the activities of individual protein components and protein networks that are cornerstones for the comprehension of physiological adaptations in response to biological demands promoted by environmental changes.
