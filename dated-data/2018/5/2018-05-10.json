    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used to aid in understanding pathogen transmission [1]. Very often the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating isolates collected during an epidemiological study are used to identify sets of cases that are potentially linked by direct transmission. However, there is little agreement in the literature as to what an appropriate SNP cut-off threshold should be, or indeed whether a simple SNP threshold is appropriate for identifying sets of isolates to be treated as \\\"transmission clusters\\\". The SNP thresholds that have been adopted for inferring transmission vary widely even for one pathogen. As an alternative to reliance on a strict SNP threshold, we suggest that the key inferential target when studying the spread of an infectious disease is the number of transmission events separating cases. Here we describe a new framework for deciding whether two pathogen genomes should be considered as part of the same transmission cluster, based jointly on the number of SNP differences and the length of time over which those differences have accumulated. Our approach allows us to probabilistically characterize the number of inferred transmission events that separate cases. We show how this framework can be modified to consider variable mutation rates across the genome (e.g. SNPs associated with drug resistance) and we indicate how the methodology can be extended to incorporate epidemiological data such as spatial proximity. We use recent data collected from tuberculosis studies from British Columbia, Canada and the Republic of Moldova to apply and compare our clustering method to the SNP threshold approach. In the British Columbia data, different cases break off from the main clusters as cut-off thresholds are lowered; the transmission-based method obtains slightly different clusters than the SNP cut-offs. For the Moldova data, straightforward application of the methods shows no appreciable difference, but when we take into account the fact that resistance conferring sites likely do not follow the same mutation clock as most sites due to selection, the transmission-based approach differs from the SNP cut-off method. Outbreak simulations confirm that our transmission based method is at least as good at identifying direct transmissions as a SNP cut-off. We conclude that the new method is a promising step towards establishing a more robust identification of outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are immune system proteins that recognize noxious molecules for elimination. Their sequence diversity and binding versatility have made antibodies the primary class of biopharmaceuticals. Recently it has become possible to query their immense natural diversity using next-generation sequencing of immunoglobulin gene repertoires (Ig-seq). However, Ig-seq outputs are currently fragmented across repositories and tend to be presented as raw nucleotide reads, which means nontrivial effort is required to reuse the data for analysis. To address this issue, we have collected Ig-seq outputs from 53 studies, covering more than half a billion antibody sequences across diverse immune states, organisms and individuals. We have sorted, cleaned, annotated, translated and numbered these sequences and make the data available via our Observed Antibody Space (OAS) resource at antibodymap.org. The data within OAS will be regularly updated with newly released Ig-seq datasets. We believe OAS will facilitate data mining of immune repertoires for improved understanding of the immune system and development of better biotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genus Burkholderia consists of species that occupy remarkably diverse ecological niches. Its best known members are important pathogens, B. mallei and B. pseudomallei, which cause glanders and melioidosis, respectively. Burkholderia genomes are unusual due to their multichromosomal organization.\\n\\nResultsWe performed integrated genomic analysis of 127 Burkholderia strains. The pan-genome is open with the saturation to be reached between 86,000 and 88,000 genes. The reconstructed rearrangements indicate a strong avoidance of intra-replichore inversions that is likely caused by selection against the transfer of large groups of genes between the leading and the lagging strands. Translocated genes also tend to retain their position in the leading or the lagging strand, and this selection is stronger for large syntenies. Integrated reconstruction of chromosome rearrangements in the context of strains phylogeny reveals parallel rearrangements that may indicate inversion-based phase variation and integration of new genomic islands. In particular, we detected parallel inversions in the second chromosomes of B. pseudomallei with breakpoints formed by genes encoding membrane components of multidrug resistance complex, that may be linked to a phase variation mechanism. Two genomic islands, spreading horizontally between chromosomes, were detected in the B. cepacia group.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the power of integrated analysis of pan-genomes, chromosome rearrangements, and selection regimes. Non-random inversion patterns indicate selective pressure, inversions are particularly frequent in a recent pathogen B. mallei, and, together with periods of positive selection at other branches, may indicate adaptation to new niches. One such adaptation could be a possible phase variation mechanism in B. pseudomallei.",

    "abstract": "Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) bind DNA through an array of tandem 34-residue repeats. Here, we examine the kinetics of DNA binding for a set of TALE arrays with varying numbers of identical repeats using single molecule microscopy. Using a new deterministic modeling approach, we find evidence for conformational heterogeneity in both the free- and DNA-bound TALE arrays. Combined with previous work demonstrating populations of partly folded TALE states, our findings reveal a functional instability in TALE-DNA binding. For TALEs forming less than one superhelical turn around DNA, partly folded open states inhibit DNA binding. In contrast, for TALEs forming more than one turn, the partly folded open states facilitate DNA binding. Overall, we find that increasing repeat number results in significantly slower interconversion between the various DNA-free and DNA-bound states. These findings highlight the role of conformational heterogeneity and dynamics in facilitating macromolecular complex assembly.\\n\\nImpact StatementSingle molecule DNA-binding trajectories and deterministic modeling analyses demonstrate a functional role for high energy partly folded states in Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) that could improve future TALEN design.",

    "abstract": "Natural gas is a major source of global energy, and a large fraction is generated in subsurface coalbed deposits. Microbial communities within coalbed deposits impact methane production, and as a result contribute to global carbon cycling. The process of biogenic coal-to-methane conversion is not well understood. Here we demonstrate the first read- and assembly-based metagenome profiling of coal-associated formation waters, resulting in the recovery of over 40 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from eight individual coalbed methane wells in the Appalachian Basin. The majority of samples contained hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which were present in higher relative abundances than was previously reported for other coalbed basins. The abundance of Archaea and salinity were positively correlated, suggesting that salinity may be a controlling factor for biogenic coalbed methane. Low-abundance coalbed microbial populations were functionally diverse, while the most dominant organisms exhibit a high degree of genomic and functional similarities. Basin-specific pan-metagenome clustering suggests lower abundant and diverse bacterial communities are shaped by local basin parameters. Our analyses show Appalachian Basin coalbed microbial communities encode for the potential to convert coal into methane, which may be used as an indicator of potential biogenic methane production for future well performance and increased well longevity.",

    "abstract": "The 3D spatiotemporal organization of the human genome inside the cell nucleus remains a major open question in cellular biology. In the time between two cell divisions, chromatin - the functional form of DNA in cells - fills the nucleus in its uncondensed polymeric form. Recent in-vivo imaging experiments reveal that the chromatin moves coherently, having displacements with long-ranged correlations on the scale of microns and lasting for seconds. To elucidate the mechanism(s) behind these motions, we develop a novel coarse-grained active-polymer model where chromatin is represented as a confined flexible chain acted upon by molecular motors, which perform work by exerting dipolar forces on the system. Numerical simulations of this model account for steric and hydrodynamic interactions as well as internal chain mechanics. These demonstrate that coherent motions emerge in systems involving extensile dipoles and are accompanied by large-scale chain reconfigurations and nematic ordering. Comparisons with experiments show good qualitative agreement and support the hypothesis that self-organizing long-ranged hydrodynamic couplings between chromatin-associated active motor proteins are responsible for the observed coherent dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Boolean and multi-valued logical formalisms are increasingly used to model complex cellular networks. To ease the development and analysis of logical models, a series of software tools have been proposed, often with specific assets. However, combining these tools typically implies a series of cumbersome software installation and model conversion steps. In this respect, the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides a joint distribution of several logical modelling software tools, along with an interactive web Python interface easing the chaining of complementary analyses. In this protocol, we demonstrate the assets of this approach through the analysis of a computational model of biological network. Our computational workflow combines (1) the importation of a GINsim model and its display, (2) its format conversion using the Java library BioLQM, (3) the formal prediction of mutations using the OCaml software Pint, (4) the model checking using the C++ software NuSMV, (5) quantitative stochastic simulations using the C++ software MaBoSS, and (6) the visualisation of results using the Python library matplotlib. Starting with a recent Boolean model of the signalling network controlling tumour cell invasion and migration, our model analysis culminates with the prediction of sets of mutations presumably involved in a metastatic phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The enzymes GALNTs add GalNAc sugar to Ser and Thr residues, forming the Tn glycan. GALNTs are activated by trafficking from Golgi to ER, a process driven by the Src kinase and negatively regulated by ERK8. This GALNTs activation (aka GALA) pathway induces high Tn levels and is a key driver of liver tumor growth. Recently, Tabak and colleagues have contested our previous data that EGF stimulation can induce GALNTs relocation. Here, we show that relocation induced by EGF is actually detectable in the images acquired by Tabak et al. Furthermore, we show that expression of EGFR enhances relocation and appears required to drive relocation induced by ERK8 depletion. We also propose that quantification of O-glycosylation of the ER resident protein PDIA4 provides an alternative measure of GALA. In sum, we demonstrate that non-reproducibility was due to experimental errors, that EGFR is indeed a driver of GALA and propose additional markers to facilitate the study of this pathway.",
