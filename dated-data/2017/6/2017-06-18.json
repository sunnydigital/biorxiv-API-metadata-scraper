The ongoing and constant improvement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has facilitated the production of an ever-increasing number of genetic markers across genomes of non-model species.\\nC_LIO_LIThe study of variation in these markers across natural populations has deepened the understanding of how population history and selection act on genomes. Population genomics now provides tools to better integrate selection into a historical framework, and take into account selection when reconstructing demographic history. However, this improvement has come with a burst of analytical tools that can confuse users.\\nC_LIO_LISuch confusion can limit the amount of information effectively retrieved from complex genomic datasets. In addition, the lack of a unified analytical pipeline impairs the diffusion of the most recent analytical tools into fields like conservation biology.\\nC_LIO_LITo address this need, we describe possible analytical protocols and link these with more than 70 methods dealing with genome-scale datasets.

    "abstract": "RNA-seq is commonly used to identify genetic modules that respond to perturbations. In single cells, transcriptomes have been used as phenotypes, but this concept has not been applied to whole-organism RNA-seq. Linear models can quantify expression effects of individual mutants and identify epistatic effects in double mutants. To make interpretation of these high-dimensional measurements intuitive, we developed a single coefficient to quantify transcriptome-wide epistasis that accurately reflects the underlying interactions. To demonstrate our approach, we sequenced four single and two double mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans. From these mutants, we reconstructed the known hypoxia pathway. In addition, we uncovered a class of 56 genes that have opposing changes in expression in egl-9(lf) compared to vhl-1(lf) but the egl-9(lf); vhl-1(lf) mutant has the same phenotype as egl-9(lf). This class violates the classical model of HIF-1 regulation, but can be explained by postulating a role of hydroxylated HIF-1 in transcriptional control.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTranscriptome profiling is a way to quickly and quantitatively measure gene expression level. Because of their quantitative nature, there is widespread interest in using transcriptomic profiles as a phenotype for genetic analysis. However, a source of major concern is that whole-animal transcriptomic profiles mix the expression signatures of multiple cellular states, making it hard to accurately reconstruct genetic interactions. Additionally, it has been difficult to quantify epistasis, the signature of genetic interaction between two genes, in these molecular phenotypes. Here, we show that it is possible to accurately reconstruct genetic interactions between genes using whole-animal RNA sequencing, and we demonstrate a powerful new way to measure and understand epistasis arising from these measurements. This suggests that whole-organism RNA-seq can be a powerful tool with which to understand genetic interactions in entire organisms and not only in isolated cells. With the advent of genome engineering tools, generating mutants has become easier and faster for many organisms. As mutants become easier to create, phenotyping them has become a major bottleneck in understanding the biological functions of the genes in question. Our work presents a possible solution to this problem, because transcriptome profiling is fast and sensitive to genetic perturbations regardless of the context they operate in.",

    "abstract": "Can genetic adaptation in reef-building corals keep pace with the current rate of sea surface warming? Here we combine population genomic, biophysical modeling, and evolutionary simulations to predict future adaptation of the common coral Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef. Loss of coral cover in recent decades did not yet have detectable effect on genetic diversity in our species. Genomic analysis of migration patterns closely matched the biophysical model of larval dispersal in favoring the spread of existing heat-tolerant alleles from lower to higher latitudes. Given these conditions we find that standing genetic variation could be sufficient to fuel rapid adaptation of A. millepora to warming for the next 100-200 years, although random thermal anomalies would drive increasingly severe mortality episodes. However, this adaptation will inevitably cease unless the warming is slowed down, since no realistic mutation rate could replenish adaptive genetic variation fast enough.",

    "abstract": "Tubulins, the building block of microtubules (MTs), play a critical role in both supporting and regulating neurite growth. Eukaryotic genomes contain multiple tubulin isotypes, and their missense mutations cause a range of neurodevelopmental defects. Using the C. elegans touch receptor neurons, we analyzed the effects of 67 tubulin missense mutations on neurite growth. Three types of mutations emerged: 1) loss-of-function mutations, which cause mild defects in neurite growth; 2) antimorphic mutations, which map to the GTP binding site and intradimer and interdimer interfaces, significantly reduce MT stability, and cause severe neurite growth defects; and 3) neomorphic mutations, which map to the exterior surface, increase MT stability, and cause ectopic neurite growth. Structure-function analysis reveals a causal relationship between tubulin structure and MT stability. This stability affects neuronal morphogenesis. As part of this analysis, we engineered several disease-associated human tubulin mutations into C. elegans genes and examined their impact on neuronal development at the cellular level. We also discovered an -tubulin (TBA-7) that appears to destabilize MTs. Loss of TBA-7 led to the formation of hyperstable MTs and the generation of ectopic neurites; the lack of potential sites for polyamination and polyglutamination on TBA-7 may be responsible for this destabilization.\\n\\nTable of Content (TOC) Highlight SummaryDifferent tubulin isotypes perform different functions in the regulation of MT structure and neurite growth, and missense mutations of tubulin genes have three types of distinct effects on MT stability and neurite growth. One -tubulin isotype appears to induce relative instability due to the lack of potential post-translational modification sites.",

To expand this toolset, we have developed a screening strategy for the direct engineering of self-complementing split FPs. Via this strategy, we have generated a yellow-green split-mNeonGreen21-10/11 that improves the ratio of complemented signal to the background of FP1-10-expressing cells compared to the commonly used split-GFP1-10/11, as well as a 10-fold brighter red-colored split-sfCherry21-10/11. Based on split-sfCherry2, we have engineered a photoactivatable variant that enables single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy. We have demonstrated dual-color endogenous protein tagging with sfCherry211 and GFP11, revealing that endoplasmic reticulum translocon complex Sec61B has reduced abundance in certain peripheral tubules. These new split FPs not only offer multiple colors for imaging interaction networks of endogenous proteins, but also hold the potential to provide orthogonal handles for biochemical isolation of native protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnalysis of microbiome data involves identifying co-occurring groups of taxa associated with sample features of interest (e.g., disease state). But elucidating key associations is often difficult since microbiome data are compositional, high dimensional, and sparse. Also, the configuration of co-occurring taxa may represent overlapping subcommunities that contribute to, for example, host status. Preserving the configuration of co-occurring microbes rather than detecting specific indicator species is more likely to facilitate biologically meaningful interpretations. In addition, analyses that utilize both taxonomic and predicted functional abundances typically independently characterize the taxonomic and functional profiles before linking them to sample information. This prevents investigators from identifying the specific functional components associate with which subsets of co-occurring taxa.\\n\\nResultsWe provide an approach to explore co-occurring taxa using \\\"topics\\\" generated via a topic model and then link these topics to specific sample classes (e.g., diseased versus healthy). Rather than inferring predicted functional content independently from taxonomic abundances, we instead focus on inference of functional content within topics, which we parse by estimating pathway-topic interactions through a multilevel, fully Bayesian regression model. We apply our methods to two large publically available 16S amplicon sequencing datasets: an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dataset from Gevers et al. and data from the American Gut (AG) project. When applied to the Gevers et al. IBD study, we demonstrate that a topic highly associated with Crohns disease (CD) diagnosis is (1) dominated by a cluster of bacteria known to be linked with CD and (2) uniquely enriched for a subset of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis genes. In the AG data, our approach found that individuals with plant-based diets were enriched with Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, Blautia, and Ruminococcaceae, as well as fluorobenzoate degradation pathways, whereas pathways involved in LPS biosynthesis were depleted.\\n\\nConclusionsWe introduce an approach for uncovering latent thematic structure in the context of sample features for 16S rRNA surveys. Using our topic-model approach, investigators can (1) capture groups of co-occurring taxa termed topics, (2) uncover within-topic functional potential, and (3) identify gene sets that may guide future inquiry.

Through an integrative analysis of Hi-C and ChIP-seq data, we find that a significant fraction of SEs are hierarchically organized, containing both hub and non-hub enhancers. Hub enhancers share similar histone marks with non-hub enhancers, but are distinctly associated with cohesin and CTCF binding sites and disease-associated genetic variants. Genetic ablation of hub enhancers results in profound defects in gene activation and local chromatin landscape. As such, hub enhancers are the major constituents responsible for SE functional and structural organization.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions due to biotic and abiotic factors involve reprogramming of gene expression at the transcription level. The bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), which catalyzes transcription, can thus be considered as the major mediator of cellular adaptive strategies. But how do bacteria respond if a stress factor directly compromises the activity of the RNAP? We used a phage-derived small protein to specifically perturb bacterial RNAP activity in exponentially growing Escherichia coli. Using cytological profiling, tracking RNAP behavior at single-molecule level and transcriptome analysis, we reveal that adaptation to conditions that directly perturb bacterial RNAP performance can result in a biphasic growth behavior and thereby confer the  adapted bacterial cells an enhanced ability to tolerate diverse antibacterial stresses. The results imply that while synthetic transcriptional rewiring may confer bacteria with the intended desirable properties, such approaches may also collaterally allow them to acquire undesirable traits.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple host intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the relative contribution of host genetic compared to environmental factors remains elusive. Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive. Overall, our results suggest that human microbiome composition is dominated by environmental factors rather than by host genetics.",

    "abstract": "Descending signals from the brain play critical roles in controlling and modulating locomotion kinematics. In the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system, descending AVB premotor interneurons exclusively form gap junctions with B-type motor neurons that drive forward locomotion. We combined genetic analysis, optogenetic manipulation, and computational modeling to elucidate the function of AVB-B gap junctions during forward locomotion. First, we found that some B-type motor neurons generated intrinsic rhythmic activity, constituting distributed central pattern generators. Second, AVB premotor interneurons drove bifurcation of B-type motor neuron dynamics, triggering their transition from stationary to oscillatory activity. Third, proprioceptive couplings between neighboring B-type motor neurons entrained the frequency of body oscillators, forcing coherent propagation of bending waves. Despite substantial anatomical differences between the worm motor circuit and those in higher model organisms, we uncovered converging principles that govern coordinated locomotion.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA deep understanding of the neural basis of motor behavior must integrate neuromuscular dynamics, mechanosensory feedback, as well as global command signals, to predict behavioral dynamics. Here, we report on an integrative approach to defining the circuit logic underlying coordinated locomotion in C. elegans. Our combined experimental and computational analysis revealed that (1) motor neurons in C. elegans could function as intrinsic oscillators; (2) Descending inputs and proprioceptive couplings work synergistically to facilitate the sequential activation of motor neuron activities, allowing bending waves to propagate efficiently along the body. Our work thus represents a key step towards an integrative view of animal locomotion.",

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is becoming a prevalent approach to quantify gene expression, and is expected to gain better insights to a number of biological and biomedical questions, compared to the DNA microarrays. Most importantly, RNA-Seq allows to quantify expression at the gene and alternative splicing isoform levels. However, leveraging the RNA-Seq data requires development of new data mining and analytics methods. Supervised machine learning methods are commonly used approaches for biological data analysis, and have recently gained attention for their applications to the RNA-Seq data.\\n\\nIn this work, we assess the utility of supervised learning methods trained on RNA-Seq data for a diverse range of biological classification tasks. We hypothesize that the isoform-level expression data is more informative for biological classification tasks than the gene-level expression data. Our large-scale assessment is done through utilizing multiple datasets, organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analysis pipelines. Overall, we performed and assessed 61 biological classification problems that leverage three independent RNA-Seq datasets and include over 2,000 samples that come from multiple organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analyses. These 61 problems include predictions of the tissue type, sex, or age of the sample, healthy or cancerous phenotypes and, the pathological tumor stage for the samples from the cancerous tissue. For each classification problem, the performance of three normalization techniques and six machine learning classifiers was explored. We find that for every single classification problem, the isoform-based classifiers outperform or are comparable with gene expression based methods. The top-performing supervised learning techniques reached a near perfect classification accuracy, demonstrating the utility of supervised learning for RNA-Seq based data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular signaling pathways not only control cell proliferation and survival, but also regulate the provision of cellular energy and building blocks through mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial metabolism. Wild-type and oncogenic RAF kinases have been shown to prevent apoptosis following the removal of interleukin 3 (IL-3) from mouse pro-myeloid 32D cells by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. To study primary effects of RAF on mitochondrial energy metabolism, we applied high-resolution respirometry after short-term IL-3 deprivation (8 h), before 32D cells show detectable signs of cell death. Respiration in intact 32D cells was suppressed as an early event following removal of IL-3, but remained more stable in 32D cells expressing the v-RAF oncogene. In permeabilized 32D cells deprived of IL-3, respiratory capacities of the NADH-pathway, the convergent NADH&succinate-pathway, and Complex IV activity were decreased compared to cells grown in the presence of IL-3, whereas succinate-supported respiration remained unchanged, consistent with control by Complex IV. The apparent Complex IV excess capacity was zero above NADH&succinate-pathway capacity reconstituting tricarboxylic acid cycle function. In comparison, electron flow reached only 60% when supported by succinate alone through Complexes II, III and IV, and was therefore relatively insensitive to Complex IV injuries up to a threshold of 40% inhibition. A slight increase in respiration following addition of cytochrome c, a marker of mitochondrial outer membrane leakage, was present after IL-3 depletion, indicating mitochondrial fragility. Our results highlight a novel link between the key mitogenic and survival kinase CRAF and mitochondrial energy homeostasis.",

Altering cell identity is possible through overexpression of transcription factors (TFs); for example, fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into muscle cells by introducing MYOD1. How TFs dynamically orchestrate genome architecture and transcription as a cell adopts a new identity during reprogramming is not well understood. Here we show that MYOD1-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts into the myogenic lineage undergoes a critical transition, which we refer to as a bifurcation point, where cell identity definitively changes. By integrating knowledge of genome-wide dynamical architecture and transcription, we found significant chromatin reorganization prior to transcriptional changes that marked activation of the myogenic program. We also found that the local architectural and transcriptional dynamics of endogenous MYOD1 and MYOG reflected the global genomic bifurcation event. These TFs additionally participate in entrainment of biological rhythms. Understanding the system-level genome dynamics underlying a cell fate decision is a step toward devising more sophisticated reprogramming strategies that could be used in cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Two species predator-prey with stage structure of mature and immature mathematical models are studied over the last few decades. Xin-an Zhang et al studied a mathematical model with stage structure of two species in 2010. In this article, an attempt has been made to comprehend the coupled predator-prey dynamics with mature-immature stage structure and compare the dynamics with the existing model. The present model studied by Xin-an Zhang et al is purely realistic with assumptions of positive parameters. From the mathematical curiosity, we wonder to investigate the same with complex parameters and compared with the foreseen results. In addition, the present model is slightly modified to see some new dynamics of some additional fixed point including the previous fixed points.",

    "abstract": "The relative importance of different modes of evolution in shaping phenotypic diversity remains a hotly debated question. Fossil data suggest that stasis may be a common mode of evolution, while modern data suggest very fast rates of evolution. One way to reconcile these observations is to imagine that evolution is punctuated, rather than gradual, on geological time scales. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel maximum likelihood framework for fitting Levy processes to comparative morphological data. This class of stochastic processes includes both a gradual and punctuated component. We found that a plurality of modern vertebrate clades examined are best fit by punctuated processes over models of gradual change, gradual stasis, and adaptive radiation. When we compare our results to theoretical expectations of the rate and speed of regime shifts for models that detail fitness landscape dynamics, we find that our quantitative results are broadly compatible with both microevolutionary models and with observations from the fossil record.",

In order to determine the frequency of both medically actionable and non-actionable but medically relevant exome findings in the general population we assessed the exomes of 70 participants who have been extensively characterized over the past several years as part of a longitudinal integrated multi-omics profiling study at Stanford University. We assessed exomes for rare likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants in genes associated with Mendelian disease in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. We used American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines were used for the classification of rare sequence variants, and additionally we assessed pharmacogenetic variants. Twelve out of 70 (17%) participants had medically actionable findings in Mendelian disease genes, including 6 (9%) with mutations in genes not currently included in the ACMGs list of 59 actionable genes. This number is higher than that reported in previous studies and suggests added benefit from utilizing expanded gene lists and manual curation to assess actionable findings. A total of 60 participants (89%) had non-actionable findings identified including 57 who were found to be mutation carriers for recessive diseases and 21 who have increased Alzheimers disease risk due to heterozyg ous or homozygous APOE e4 alleles (18 participants had both).

Placental insufficiency (PI), inadequate nutrient delivery to the fetus, is associated with preeclampsia (PE), a maternal hypertensive disorder, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), pathologically poor fetal growth. PI is more common in early-onset PE (EOPE) than late-onset PE (LOPE). However, the relationship between these disorders remains unclear. While DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been identified in PE and IUGR, these entities can overlap and few studies have analyzed these separately. This study aims to identify altered DNAm in EOPE, LOPE, and normotensive IUGR, validate these alterations, and use them to better understand the relationships between these related disorders.\\n\\nPlacental samples from a discovery cohort (43 controls, 22 EOPE, 18 LOPE, 11 IUGR) and validation cohort (15 controls, 22 EOPE, 11 LOPE) were evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. To minimize gestational age (GA) effects, EOPE samples were compared to pre-term controls (GA <37 weeks), while LOPE and IUGR were compared to term controls (GA >37 weeks). There were 1703 differentially methylated (DM) sites (FDR<0.05, {Delta}{beta}>0.1) in EOPE, 5 in LOPE, and 0 in IUGR. Of the 1703 EOPE sites, 599 were validated in the second cohort. These sites cluster samples from both cohorts into 3 distinct methylation clusters. Interestingly, LOPE samples diagnosed between 34-36 weeks with co-occurring IUGR clustered with the EOPE methylation cluster. DNAm profiling may provide an independent tool to refine clinical diagnoses into subgroups with more uniform pathology. The challenges in reproducing genome-wide DNAm studies are also discussed.",

Multiple and correlated sources contribute to gene expression variation in single cells, which makes their estimation difficult with the existing methods developed for bulk measurements (e.g., surrogate variable analysis (SVA)) that estimate orthogonal transformations of these sources. We developed iteratively adjusted surrogate variable analysis (IA-SVA) that can estimate hidden and correlated sources of variation by identifying a set of genes affected with each hidden factor in an iterative manner. Analysis of scRNA-seq data from human cells showed that IA-SVA could accurately capture hidden variation arising from technical (e.g., stacked doublet cells) or biological sources (e.g., cell type or cell-cycle stage). Furthermore, IA-SVA delivers a set of genes associated with the detected hidden source to be used in downstream data analyses. As a proof of concept, IA-SVA recapitulated known marker genes for islet cell subsets (e.g., alpha, beta), which improved the grouping of subsets into distinct clusters. Taken together, IA-SVA is an effective and novel method to dissect multiple and correlated sources of variation in scRNA-seq data.",

We show here that in sparsely plated 4T1 cells, E-cadherin levels are moderately reduced (~50%), leading to the development of collective migration, whereby cells translocate in loose clusters, interconnected by thin membrane tethers. Knocking down E-cadherin blocked tether formation in these cells, leading to enhancement of migration rate and, at the same time, to suppression of lung metastases formation in vivo, and inhibition of infiltration into fibroblast monolayers ex vivo. These findings suggest that the moderate E-cadherin levels, present in wild-type 4T1 cells, play a key role in promoting cancer invasion and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Exometabolomics enables analysis of metabolite utilization of low molecular weight organic substances by soil isolates. Environmentally-based defined media are needed to examine ecologically relevant patterns of substrate utilization. Here, we describe an approach for the construction of defined media using untargeted characterization of water soluble soil metabolites. To broadly characterize soil metabolites, both liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were used. With this approach, 96 metabolites were identified, including amino acids, amino acid derivatives, sugars, sugar alcohols, mono- and di-carboxylic acids, osmolytes, nucleobases, and nucleosides. From this pool of metabolites, 25 were quantified. Water soluble organic carbon was fractionated by molecular weight and measured to determine the fraction of carbon accounted for by the quantified metabolites. This revealed that, community structures, these soil metabolites have an uneven quantitative distribution, with a single metabolite, trehalose accounting for 9.9 percent of much like soil microbial the (< 1 kDa) water extractable organic carbon. This quantitative information was used to formulate two soil defined media (SDM), one containing 23 metabolites (SDM1) and one containing 46 (SDM2). To evaluate SDM for supporting the growth of bacteria found at this field site, we examined the growth of 30 phylogenetically diverse soil isolates obtained using standard R2A medium. The simpler SDM1 supported the growth of up to 13 isolates while the more complex SDM2 supported up to 25 isolates. One isolate, Pseudomonas corrugata strain FW300-N2E2 was selected for a time-series exometabolomics analysis to investigate SDM1 substrate preferences. Interestingly, it was found that this organism preferred lower-abundance substrates such as guanine, glycine, proline and arginine and glucose and did not utilize the more abundant substrates maltose, mannitol, trehalose and uridine. These results demonstrate the viability and utility of using exometabolomics to construct a tractable environmentally relevant media. We anticipate that this approach can be expanded to other environments to enhance isolation and characterization of diverse microbial communities.\\n\\nHighlights O_LILC/MS and GC/MS analyses of soil extracts revealed a diversity of 96 metabolites.\\nC_LIO_LISoil defined media were constructed based on water extractable soil metabolomics data.\\nC_LIO_LIThe defined media supported the growth of 25 out of 30 bacterial isolates.\\nC_LIO_LIExometabolomics demonstrated preferential consumption of amino acids for one isolate.\\nC_LIO_LIThese media can be used to understand environmentally relevant microbial substrate preferences.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviationsDOM dissolved organic matter; SOM soil organic matter; WEOC water extractable organic carbon; LMWOS low molecular weight organic substances; SDM(1/2) soil defined media (1 and 2); R2A Reasoners 2A agar medium; ORFRC Oak Ridge Field Research Center; LC/MS liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; GC/MS gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry; TOC total organic carbon; HILIC hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography",

We investigated the relationships between endogenous plasma oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) - neuropeptides that have been linked to affiliative and aggressive behavior in other mammalian species - and aggression in domestic dogs. We first validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the measurement of free (unbound) and total (free + bound) OT and AVP in dog plasma. In Experiment 1 we evaluated behavioral and neuroendocrine differences between a population of pet dogs with a history of chronic aggression toward conspecifics and a matched control group. Dogs with a history of aggression exhibited more aggressive behavior during simulated encounters with conspecifics, and had lower free, but higher total plasma AVP than matched controls, but there were no group differences for OT. In Experiment 2 we compared OT and AVP concentrations between pet dogs and a population of assistance dogs that have been bred for affiliative and non-aggressive temperaments, and investigated neuroendocrine predictors of individual differences in social behavior within the assistance dog population. Compared to pet dogs, assistance dogs had higher free and total OT, but there were no differences in either measure for AVP. Within the assistance dog population, dogs who behaved more aggressively toward a threatening stranger had higher total AVP than dogs who did not. Collectively these data suggest that endogenous OT and AVP may play critical roles in shaping dog social behavior, including aspects of both affiliation and aggression.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT) and Vasopressin (AVP) are neuropeptides with diverse effects on social behavior, cognition and stress responses. Recent studies suggest that OT facilitates and responds to affiliative forms of human-animal interaction (HAI). However, previous studies measuring OT and AVP in dogs have been limited to measures from blood or urine, which present concerns related to the invasiveness of sample collection, the potential for matrix interference in immunoassays, and whether samples can be collected at precise time points to assess event-linked endocrine responses. Previous studies from our laboratory validated salivary measures of OT and AVP in dogs, however, it is currently unknown whether these measures respond dynamically to aspects of HAI. Here, we investigated the effects of affiliative forms of HAI on both plasma and salivary OT and AVP in dogs. We employed a between-subjects design with a group of Labrador retrievers and Labrador retriever X golden retriever crosses (23 females, 15 males). Half of the dogs engaged in 10 minutes of free-form friendly interaction with a human experimenter (HAI condition), and the other half rested quietly in the same environment, without human interaction (control condition). We collected blood and saliva samples before, and immediately following both experimental conditions, and all samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) following previously validated protocols. Dogs participating in HAI exhibited a significant increase in both salivary OT (+39%) and plasma OT (+5.7%) whereas dogs in the control group did not. Salivary AVP showed no change in the HAI group but increased significantly (+33%) in the control group. Plasma AVP decreased significantly following HAI (-13%) but did not change across time in the control condition. Within the dogs exposed to HAI, increases in salivary OT, and decreases in plasma AVP, were predicted by the extent of affiliative behaviour between the dog and human (indexed by scores from a principal components analysis of social behaviours between the dog and human). Collectively our results suggest that measures of salivary OT and AVP provide useful biomarkers in studies of HAI, and afford a flexible and noninvasive toolkit than can be employed in diverse research contexts.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration-capable flatworms are informative research models to study the mechanisms of stem cell regulation, regeneration and tissue patterning. However, the lack of transgenesis methods significantly hampers their wider use. Here we report development of a transgenesis method for Macrostomum lignano, a basal flatworm with excellent regeneration capacity. We demonstrate that microinjection of DNA constructs into fertilized one-cell stage eggs, followed by a low dose of irradiation, frequently results in random integration of the transgene in the genome and its stable transmission through the germline. To facilitate selection of promoter regions for transgenic reporters, we assembled and annotated the M. lignano genome, including genome-wide mapping of transcription start regions, and showed its utility by generating multiple stable transgenic lines expressing fluorescent proteins under several tissue-specific promoters. The reported transgenesis method and annotated genome sequence will permit sophisticated genetic studies on stem cells and regeneration using M. lignano as a model organism.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundObesity and its co-morbidities are characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, uncontrolled expression of metabolic measurements and dis-regulation of various forms of stress response. However, the contribution and correlation of inflammation, metabolism and stress responses to the disease are not fully elucidated. In this paper a cross-sectional case study was conducted on clinical data comprising 117 human male and female subjects with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Characteristics such as anthropometric, clinical and bio-chemical measurements were collected.\\n\\nMethodsAssociation of these variables with T2D and BMI were assessed using penalized hierarchical linear and logistic regression. In particular, elastic net, hdi and glinternet were used as regularization models to distinguish between cases and controls. Differential network analysis using closed-form approach was performed to identify pairwise-interaction of variables that influence prediction of the phenotype.\\n\\nResultsFor the 117 participants, physical variables such as PBF, HDL and TBW had absolute coefficients 0.75, 0.65 and 0.34 using the glinternet approach, biochemical variables such as MIP, ROS and RANTES were identified as determinants of obesity with some interaction between inflammatory markers such as IL4, IL-6, MIP, CSF, Eotaxin and ROS. Diabetes was associated with a significant increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) which are considered as an index of endogenous lipid peroxidation and an increase in two inflammatory markers, MIP-1 and RANTES. Furthermore, we obtained 13 pairwise effects. The pairwise effects include pairs from and within physical, clinical and biochemical features, in particular metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers.\\n\\nConclusionsWe showcase that markers of oxidative stress (derived from lipid peroxidation) such as MIP-1 and RANTES participate in the pathogenesis of diseases such as diabetes and obesity in the Arab population.",

    "abstract": "The genome is three-dimensionally organized in the cell, and the mammalian genome DNA is partitioned into submegabase-sized chromatin domains. Genome functions are regulated within and across the domains according to their organization, whereas the chromatin itself is highly dynamic. However, the details of such dynamic organization of chromatin domains in living cells remain unclear. To unify chromatin dynamics and organization, we recently demonstrated that structural information of chromatin domains in living human cells can be extracted from analyses of the subdiffusive nucleosome movement using mathematical modeling. Our mathematical analysis suggested that as the chromatin domain becomes smaller and more compact, nucleosome movement becomes increasingly restricted. Here, we show the implication of these results for bridging the gap between chromatin dynamics and organization, and provide physical insight into chromatin domains as efficient units to conduct genome functions in the thermal noisy environment of the cell.\\n\\nExtra View toShinkai S, Nozaki T, Maeshima K, Togashi Y.

We demonstrate that Boi1/2 are required for a late step in the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane of the growing bud. Cells lacking Boi1/2 accumulate secretory vesicles and are defective in bud growth. In contrast, Boi2 is specifically required for abscission inhibition in cells with chromatin bridges. The SH3 domain of Boi2, which is dispensable for bud growth and targets Boi2 to the site of abscission, is essential for abscission inhibition. Gain of function of the exocyst, a conserved protein complex involved in tethering of exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane, rescued secretion and bud growth defects in boi mutant cells, and abrogated NoCut checkpoint function. Thus, Boi2 functions redundantly with Boi1 to promote the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane at sites of polarized growth, and acts as an abscission inhibitor during cytokinesis in response to chromatin bridges.",

    "abstract": "The coalescent process for prokaryote species is theoretically considered. Prokaryotes undergo homologous recombination not only with other individuals within the same species (intra-specific recombination) but also with other species (inter-specific recombination). This work particularly focuses the latter because the former has been well incorporated in the framework of the coalescent. We here developed a simulation framework for generating patterns of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) allowing integration of external DNA out of the focal species, and a simulator named msPro was developed. We found that the joint work of intra- and inter-specific recombination creates a complex pattern of SNPs. The direct effect of inter-specific recombination is to increase the amount of polymorphism. Because inter-specific recombination is very rare in general, it creates a regions with an exceptionally high level of polymorphisms. Following an inter-specific recombination event, intra-specific recombination chop the integrated foreign DNA into small pieces, making a complicated pattern of SNPs that looks as if foreign DNAs were integrated multiple times. This work with the msPro simulator would be useful to understand and evaluate the relative contribution of intra- and inter specific recombination to creating complicated patterns of SNPs in prokaryotes.",

In human neonates at high familial risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a lack of such predispositions has been recently reported. Prompted by these observations, we modeled ASD behavioral deficit in newborn chicks, using embryonic exposure to valproic acid (VPA), the histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor that in humans is associated with an increased risk for developing ASD. We assessed spontaneous predispositions in newly-hatched, visually-naive chicks, by comparing responses to a stuffed hen vs. a scrambled version of it. We found that social predispositions were abolished in VPAtreated chicks. In contrast, experience-dependent learning mechanisms associated with filial imprinting were not affected. Our results indicate a specific effect of VPA on the development of biologically-predisposed social orienting mechanisms, opening new perspectives to investigate the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms involved in early ASD symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The formation of complex yet highly organized neural circuits requires interactions between neurons and glia. During the assembly of the Drosophila olfactory circuit, 50 olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) classes and 50 projection neuron (PN) classes form synaptic connections in 50 glomerular compartments in the antennal lobe, each of which represents a discrete olfactory information processing channel. Each compartment is separated from the adjacent compartments by membranous processes from ensheathing glia. Here we show that Thisbe, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) released from olfactory neurons, particularly local interneurons, instructs ensheathing glia to wrap each glomerulus. The Heartless FGF receptor acts cell-autonomously in ensheathing glia to regulate process extension so as to insulate each neuropil compartment. Overexpressing Thisbe in ORNs or PNs causes over-wrapping of glomeruli to which their axons or dendrites target. Failure to establish the FGF-dependent glia structure disrupts precise ORN axon targeting and discrete glomerular formation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis research reports that reciprocal interactions between Drosophila olfactory neurons and ensheathing glia mediate the formation of neuronal compartments--groups of synapses that are packed into discrete structures called glomeruli that carry specific olfactory information. Ensheathing glia respond to a neuronal cue, the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) Thisbe, to pattern the boundaries of the nascent compartments. Neural compartments in turn require such glial barriers to separate themselves from neighboring compartments, so as to ensure the correct organization of the olfactory circuit. These findings highlight the importance of glia in the assembly and maintenance of neural circuits and the functions of FGF signaling in these processes.",

We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task.

    "abstract": "Perceiving an external stimulus not only depends on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha oscillations. Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual acuity, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task-independent. We found that detection was optimal in trials in which excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval, consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.",

    "abstract": "Within reflex circuits, specific anatomical projections allow central neurons to relay sensations to effectors that generate movements. A major challenge is to relate anatomical features of central neural populations -- such as asymmetric connectivity -- to the computations the populations perform. To address this problem, we mapped the anatomy, modeled the function, and discovered a new behavioral role for a genetically-defined population of central vestibular neurons in rhombomeres 5-7 of larval zebrafish. First, we found that neurons within this central population project preferentially to motoneurons that move the eyes downward. Concor-dantly, when the entire population of asymmetrically-projecting neurons was stimulated collectively, only downward eye rotations were observed, demonstrating a functional correlate of the anatomical bias. When these neurons are ablated, fish failed to rotate their eyes following either nose-up or nose-down body tilts. This asymmetrically-projecting central population thus participates in both up and downward gaze stabilization. In addition to projecting to motoneurons, central vestibular neurons also receive direct sensory input from peripheral afferents. To infer whether asymmetric projections can facilitate sensory encoding or motor output, we modeled differentially-projecting sets of central vestibular neurons. Whereas motor command strength was independent of projection allocation, asymmetric projections enabled more accurate representation of nose-up stimuli. The model shows how asymmetric connectivity could enhance the representation of imbalance during nose-up postures while preserving gaze-stabilization performance. Finally, we found that central vestibular neurons were necessary for a vital behavior requiring maintenance of a nose-up posture: swim bladder inflation. These observations suggest that asymmetric connectivity in the vestibular system facilitates representation of ethologically-relevant stimuli without compromising reflexive behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementInterneuron populations use specific anatomical projections to transform sensations into reflexive actions. Here we examined how the anatomical composition of a genetically-defined population of balance interneurons in the larval zebrafish relates to the computations it performs. First, we found that the population of interneurons that stabilize gaze preferentially project to motoneurons that move the eyes downward. Next, we discovered through modeling that such projection patterns can enhance the encoding of nose-up sensations without compromising gaze stabilization. Finally we found that loss of these interneurons impairs a vital behavior, swim bladder inflation, that relies on maintaining a nose-up posture. These observations suggest that anatomical specialization permits neural circuits to represent relevant features of the environment without compromising behavior.",

We preliminarily found 32 cases of vitiligo patients with certain aggregation of mental factors. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients, transcriptome analyses revealed that the circulation expression of a type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent genes was induced. Also, serum IFN was elevated in vitiligo patients with depression. Therefore, our hypothesis is whether IFN levels predict the occurrence of psychiatric vitiligo. Through the establishment of stress-induced depigmentation model, serum IFN also showed increase. Intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous IFN injection can both elicit not only depressive behavior but also vitiligo-like characteristics. Mechanistically, central IFN induces the release of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) substance P (SP) to inhibit melanogenesis. Peripheral IFN disturbs cutaneous-neuro-endocrine microenvironment.

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis needs to adjust to dynamically changing light intensities in order to maximize its efficiency, notably by the employment of alternative electron pathways. One of them is chlororespiration - initially described in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This electron transfer pathway, found in all photosynthetic lineages, consists of a reduction of plastoquinone (PQ) through an NAD(P)H:PQ oxidoreductase and quinol (PQH2) oxidation by Plastid Terminal Oxidase, PTOX. Hence, chlororespiration constitutes an electron pathway potentially antagonistic to the linear photosynthetic electron flow from H2O to CO2. However, the limited flow chlororespiratory enzymes can sustain suggests that their relative contribution, at least in the light and in steady-state conditions, is insubstantial. Here, we focused on the involvement of PTOX in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during transitions from dark to light and vice versa. We show that the kinetics of redox relaxation of the chloroplast in the dark was greatly affected when PTOX2, the major plastoquinol oxidase in Chlamydomonas, is lacking. Importantly, we show that this has a direct physiological relevance, as the growth of a PTOX2-lacking mutant is markedly slower in intermittent light. The latter can be rationalized in terms of a decreased flux sustained by photosystem II due to a redox limitation at the acceptor side of the PSI during the illumination periods. We finally show that the long-term regulation of cyclic electron flow around PSI is strongly affected in the PTOX2 mutant, substantiating an important role of chlororespiration in the maintenance of chloroplast redox balance.",
