    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence of a \\\"set-point\\\" for body weight in the brain, that is regulated by the hypothalamus. This system modifies feeding behavior and metabolic rate, to keep body fat within predetermined parameters. It is also known that animals subjected to chronic centrifugation show a reduction in body fat. Experiments with mutant mice found that this loss of fat appears to be mediated by a vestibulo-hypothalamic pathway. Vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), also known as galvanic vestibular stimulation, involves non-invasively stimulating the vestibular system by applying a small electrical current between two electrodes placed over the mastoid processes. We suggest that any means of repeatedly stimulating the otolith organs in humans would cause a reduction in total body fat, and that VeNS would be a useful technique to use in this regard. Below we provide pilot data to support this idea.",

    "abstract": "The storage and persistence of memories depends on plasticity in the hippocampus. Adult neurogenesis produces new neurons that mature through critical periods for plasticity and cellular survival, which determine their contributions to learning and memory. However, most granule neurons are generated prior to adulthood; the maturational timecourse of these neurons is poorly understood compared to adult-born neurons, but is essential to identify how the dentate gyrus, as a whole, contributes to behavior. To characterize neurons born in the early postnatal period, we labeled dentate gyrus neurons born on postnatal day 6 (P6) with BrdU and quantified maturation and survival across early (1 hour to 8 weeks old) and late (2-6 months old) cell ages. We find that the dynamics of developmentally-born neuron survival is essentially the opposite of neurons born in adulthood: P6-born neurons did not go through a period of cell death during their immature stages (from 1-8 weeks). In contrast, 17% of P6-born neurons died after reaching maturity, between 2-6 months of age. Delayed death was evident from the loss of BrdU+ cells as well as pyknotic BrdU+caspase3+ neurons within the superficial granule cell layer. Patterns of DCX, NeuN and activity-dependent Fos expression indicate that developmentally-born neurons mature over several weeks and a sharp peak in zif268 expression at 2 weeks suggests that developmentally-born neurons mature faster than adult-born neurons (which peak at 3 weeks). Collectively, our findings are relevant for understanding how developmentally-born dentate gyrus neurons contribute to memory and disorders throughout the lifespan. High levels of early survival and zif268 expression may promote learning, while also rendering neurons sensitive to insults at defined stages. Late neuronal death in young adulthood may result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dentate gyrus neurons, which could impact memory persistence and contribute to hippocampal/dentate gyrus atrophy in disorders such as depression.",

    "abstract": "The human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is resistant to malaria control strategies maintaining high genetic diversity even when transmission is low. To investigate whether declining P. vivax transmission leads to increasing P. vivax population structure that would facilitate elimination, we genotyped samples from a wide range of transmission intensities and spatial scales in the Southwest Pacific, including two time points at one site (Tetere, Solomon Islands) during intensified control. Analysis of 887 P. vivax microsatellite haplotypes from hyperendemic Papua New Guinea (PNG, n = 443), meso-hyperendemic Solomon Islands (n= 420), and hypoendemic Vanuatu (n=24) revealed increasing population structure and multilocus linkage disequilibrium and a modest decline in diversity as transmission decreases over space and time. In Solomon Islands, which has had sustained control efforts for 20 years, and Vanuatu, which has experienced sustained low transmission for many years, significant population structure was observed at different spatial scales. We conclude that control efforts will eventually impact P. vivax population structure and with sustained pressure, populations may eventually fragment into a limited number of clustered foci that could be targeted for elimination.",

    "abstract": "Archaeogenomic research has proven to be a valuable tool to trace migrations of historic and prehistoric individuals and groups, whereas relationships within a group or burial site have not been investigated to a large extent. Knowing the genetic kinship of historic and prehistoric individuals would give important insights into social structures of ancient and historic cultures. Most archaeogenetic research concerning kinship has been restricted to uniparental markers, while studies using genome-wide information were mainly focused on comparisons between populations. Applications which infer the degree of relationship based on modern-day DNA information typically require diploid genotype data. Low concentration of endogenous DNA, fragmentation and other post-mortem damage to ancient DNA (aDNA) makes the application of such tools unfeasible for most archaeological samples. To infer family relationships for degraded samples, we developed the software READ (Relationship Estimation from Ancient DNA). We show that our heuristic approach can successfully infer up to second degree relationships with as little as 0.1x shotgun coverage per genome for pairs of individuals. We uncover previously unknown relationships among prehistoric individuals by applying READ to published aDNA data from several human remains excavated from different cultural contexts. In particular, we find a group of five closely related males from the same Corded Ware culture site in modern-day Germany, suggesting patrilocality, which highlights the possibility to uncover social structures of ancient populations by applying READ to genome-wide aDNA data.",

    "abstract": "Theta rhythms govern rodent sniffing and whisking, and human language processing. Human psychophysics suggests a role for theta also in visual attention. Yet, little is known about theta in visual areas and its attentional modulation. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from areas V1, V2, V4 and TEO of two macaque monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. We found a {approx}4 Hz theta rhythm within both the V1-V2 and the V4-TEO region, and theta synchronization between them, with a predominantly feedforward directed influence. ECoG coverage of large parts of these regions revealed a surprising spatial correspondence between theta and visually induced gamma. Furthermore, gamma power was modulated with theta phase. Selective attention to the respective visual stimulus strongly reduced these theta-rhythmic processes, leading to an unusually strong attention effect for V1. Microsaccades (MSs) were partly locked to theta. Yet, neuronal theta rhythms tended to be even more pronounced for epochs devoid of MSs. Thus, we find an MS-independent theta rhythm specific to visually driven parts of V1-V2, which rhythmically modulates local gamma and entrains V4-TEO, and which is strongly reduced by attention. We propose that the less theta-rhythmic and thereby more continuous processing of the attended stimulus serves the exploitation of this behaviorally most relevant information. The theta-rhythmic and thereby intermittent processing of the unattended stimulus likely reflects the ecologically important exploration of less relevant sources of information.",

In four additional cohorts (1,817-mother-child pairs), we meta-analysed the association between maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and blood methylation in adolescents.\\n\\nIn newborns, maternal BMI was associated with modest (<0.2% per BMI unit (1kg/m2), P<1.06*10-7) methylation variation at 9,044 sites throughout the genome. Adjustment for estimated cell proportions attenuated the number of significant CpGs to 104, including 86 sites common to the unadjusted model. These 86 sites map to several genes reported to be associated with adiposity-related and/or neuropsychiatric traits.

The authors of this counterintuitive idea have published only verbal models to support their claims.\\n\\nHere we present the results of individual-based stochastic modelling of competition between two asexual species differing only by their evolvability. They show that, in changeable environments, less evolvable species could outperform their more evolvable competitors in a broad area of a parameter space, regardless of whether the conditions fluctuated periodically or aperiodically. Highly evolvable species prospered better nearly all the time; however, they sustained a higher probability of extinction during rare events of the rapid transient change of conditions.\\n\\nOur results offer an explanation of why sexually reproducing species, with their reduced capacity to respond adaptively to local or temporal environmental changes, prevail in most eukaryotic taxa in nearly all biotopes on the surface of Earth.

    "abstract": "Estimating the polygenicity (proportion of causally associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) and discoverability (effect size variance) of causal SNPs for human traits is currently of considerable interest. SNP-heritability is proportional to the product of these quantities. We present a basic model, using detailed linkage disequilibrium structure from an extensive reference panel, to estimate these quantities from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. We apply the model to diverse phenotypes and validate the implementation with simulations. We find model polygenicities ranging from [~=] 2 x 10-5 to [~=] 4 x 10-3, with discoverabilities similarly ranging over two orders of magnitude. A power analysis allows us to estimate the proportions of phenotypic variance explained additively by causal SNPs reaching genome-wide significance at current sample sizes, and map out sample sizes required to explain larger portions of additive SNP heritability. The model also allows for estimating residual inflation (or deflation from over-correcting of z-scores), and assessing compatibility of replication and discovery GWAS summary statistics.\n\nAuthor SummaryThere are ~10 million common variants in the genome of humans with European ancestry. For any particular phenotype a number of these variants will have some causal effect. It is of great interest to be able to quantify the number of these causal variants and the strength of their effect on the phenotype.\n\nGenome wide association studies (GWAS) produce very noisy summary statistics for the association between subsets of common variants and phenotypes. For any phenotype, these statistics collectively are difficult to interpret, but buried within them is the true landscape of causal effects. In this work, we posit a probability distribution for the causal effects, and assess its validity using simulations. Using a detailed reference panel of ~11 million common variants - among which only a small fraction are likely to be causal, but allowing for non-causal variants to show an association with the phenotype due to correlation with causal variants - we implement an exact procedure for estimating the number of causal variants and their mean strength of association with the phenotype. We find that, across different phenotypes, both these quantities - whose product allows for lower bound estimates of heritability - vary by orders of magnitude.",

We investigated associations of prenatal (birth weight and length) and postnatal growth in infancy and childhood with circulating IGF-I measured at 11.5 years of age.\\n\\nMethodsWe analysed 11.5-year follow-up data from 17,046 Belarusian children who participated in the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) since birth.\\n\\nResultsComplete data were available for 5422 boys and 4743 girls (60%). We stratified the analyses by sex, as there was evidence of interaction between growth and sex in their associations with IGF-I. Weight and length/height velocity during childhood were positively associated with IGF-I at 11.5 years; associations increased with age at growth assessment and were stronger for length/height gain than for weight gain. The change in internal run-normalized IGF-I z-score at 11.5 years was 0.038 (95% CI -0.004,0.080) per standard deviation (SD) increase in length gain at 0-3 months amongst girls and 0.025 (95% CI - 0.011,0.060) amongst boys, increasing to 0.336 (95% CI 0.281,0.391;) and 0.211 (95% CI 0.165,0.256) for girls and boys, respectively, for growth during 6.5-11.5 years.\\n\\nConclusionPostnatal growth velocities in childhood are positively associated with levels of circulating IGF-I in pre-adolescents.

    "abstract": "Pharmacological interventions that target human ageing would extend individual healthspan and result in dramatic economic benefits to rapidly ageing societies worldwide. For such interventions to be contemplated they need to comprise drugs that are efficacious when given to adults and for which extensive human safety data are available. Here we show that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved in C.elegans by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved ageing pathways using drugs that are already in human use. By targeting multiple synergistic ageing pathways, we are able to slow ageing rate, double lifespan and improves healthspan while minimize developmental and fitness trade-offs. Moreover, we established that there is no synergistic benefit in a daf-2 or daf-7 background, implying the involvement of the TGF{beta} and IGF pathways in this synergy. Employing lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis we found lipid metabolism to be affected resulting in increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and decrease membrane peroxidation index. Our best drug combination showed a conserved lifespan extension in fruit flies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest lifespan effect ever reported for any adult-onset drug treatment in C. elegans. This drug-repurposing approach, using drugs already approved for humans to target multiple conserved aging pathways simultaneously, could lead to interventions that prevent age-related diseases and overall frailty in a rapidly ageing population.",

To understand how balance between SCPs controls the dynamics of whole cell responses we studied neurite outgrowth in rat primary cortical neurons in culture. We used a combination of dynamical models and experiments to understand the conditions that permitted growth at a specified velocity and when aberrant growth could lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We hypothesized that dystrophic bulb formation is due to quantitative imbalances between SCPs. Simulations predict redundancies between lower level sibling SCPs within each type of high level SCP. In contrast, higher level SCPs, such as vesicle transport and exocytosis or microtubule growth characteristic of each type need to be strictly coordinated with each other and imbalances result in stalling of neurite outgrowth. From these simulations, we predicted the effect of changing the activities of SCPs involved in vesicle exocytosis or microtubule growth could lead to formation of dystrophic bulbs. siRNA ablation experiments verified these predictions. We conclude that whole cell dynamics requires balance between the higher-level SCPs involved and imbalances can terminate whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth.",

Although vastly outnumbered by mature granule cells, adult-generated newborn granule cells play a unique role in hippocampal function, which has largely been attributed to their enhanced excitability and plasticity (Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004; Ge et al., 2007). Inputs from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex carry different informational content, thus the distribution of inputs onto newly integrated granules will affect their function in the circuit. Therefore we examined the functional innervation and synaptic maturation of newly-generated dentate granule cells using retroviral labeling in combination with selective optogenetic activation of medial or lateral entorhinal inputs. Our results indicate that lateral entorhinal inputs provide nearly all the functional innervation of newly integrated granule cells. Despite preferential functional targeting, the dendritic spine density of immature granule cells was not increased in the outer molecular layer compared to the middle molecular layer. However, chronic blockade of neurotransmitter release in medial entorhinal axons with tetanus toxin disrupted normal synapse development from both medial and lateral entorhinal inputs. Our results support a role for preferential lateral perforant path input onto newly generated neurons in mediating pattern separation, but also indicates that medial perforant path input is necessary for normal synaptic development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe formation of episodic memories involves the integration of contextual and spatial information. Newly integrated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus play a critical role in this process, despite constituting only a minor fraction of total granule cells. Here we demonstrate that these neurons preferentially receive information thought to convey the context of an experience - a unique role that each newly integrated granule cell serves for about a month before reaching maturity.",

    "abstract": "Given the same sensory stimuli in the same task, human observers do not always make the same response. Well-known sources of behavioral variability are sensory noise and guessing. Visual short-term memory studies have suggested that the precision of the sensory noise is itself variable. However, it is unknown whether precision is also variable in perceptual tasks without a memory component. We searched for evidence for variable precision in 11 visual perception tasks with a single relevant feature, orientation. We specifically examined the effect of distractor stimuli: distractors were absent, homogeneous and fixed across trials, homogeneous and variable, or heterogeneous and variable. We first considered four models: with and without guessing, and with and without variability in precision. We quantified the importance of both factors using six metrics: factor knock-in difference, factor knock-out difference, and log factor posterior ratio, each based on AIC or BIC. According to all six metrics, we found strong evidence for variable precision in five experiments. Next, we extended our model space to include potential confounding factors: the oblique effect and decision noise. This left strong evidence for variable precision in only one experiment, in which distractors were homogeneous but variable. Finally, when we considered suboptimal decision rules, the evidence also disappeared in this experiment. Our results provide little evidence for variable precision overall and only a hint when distractors are variable. Methodologically, the results underline the importance of including multiple factors in factorial model comparison: testing for only two factors would have yielded an incorrect conclusion.",

    "abstract": "Cell autonomous cancer dependencies are now routinely identified using CRISPR loss-of-function screens. However, a bias exists that makes it difficult to assess the true essentiality of genes located in amplicons, since the entire amplified region can exhibit lethal scores. These false-positive hits can either be discarded from further analysis, which in cancer models can represent a significant number of hits, or methods can be developed to rescue the true-positives within amplified regions. We propose two methods to rescue true positive hits in amplified regions by correcting for this copy number artefact. The Local Drop Out (LDO) method uses the relative lethality scores within genomic regions to assess true essentiality and does not require additional orthogonal data (e.g. copy number value). LDO is meant to be used in screens covering a dense region of the genome (e.g. a whole chromosome or the whole genome). The General Additive Model (GAM) method models the screening data as a function of the known copy number values and removes the systematic effect from the measured lethality. GAM does not require the same density as LDO, but does require prior knowledge of the copy number values. Both methods have been developed with single sample experiments in mind so that the correction can be applied even in smaller screens. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of both methods at removing the copy number effect and rescuing hits from some of the amplified regions. We estimate a 70-80% decrease of false positive hits in regions of high copy number with either method.",

Molecular studies of the myocilin N-terminal coiled coil demonstrate a unique tripartite architecture: a disulfide-linked, parallel dimer-of-dimers Y-shaped molecule, with distinct tetramer and dimer regions. The structure of the C-terminal 7-heptad dimer elucidates an unexpected repeat pattern involving electrostatic inter-strand stabilization. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal an alternate conformation in which the terminal inter-strand disulfide bond limits the extent of unfolding and results in a kinked configuration.

Selected variants within the N-terminal region alter the apparent quaternary structure of myocilin but do so without compromising stability or causing aggregation.

    "abstract": "Biological collagenous tissues comprised of networks of collagen fibers are suitable for a broad spectrum of medical applications owing to their attractive mechanical properties. In this study, we developed a noninvasive approach to estimate collagenous tissue elastic properties directly from microscopy images using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium (GLBP) tissue, widely used in the fabrication of bioprosthetic heart valves and vascular patches, was chosen as a representative collagenous tissue. A Deep Learning model was designed and trained to process second harmonic generation (SHG) images of collagen networks in GLBP tissue samples, and directly predict the tissue elastic mechanical properties. The trained model is capable of identifying the overall tissue stiffness with a classification accuracy of 84%, and predicting the nonlinear anisotropic stress-strain curves with average regression errors of 0.021 and 0.031. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using the Deep Learning approach for fast and noninvasive assessment of collagenous tissue elastic properties from microstructural images.",

    "abstract": "Quantum calculations on much of the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of the Kv1.2 potassium channel (pdb: 3Lut) have been carried out on a 904 atom subset of the VSD, plus 24 water molecules (total, 976 atoms). Those side chains that point away from the center of the VSD were truncated; in all calculations, S1,S2,S3 end atoms were fixed; in some calculations, S4 end atoms were also fixed, while in other calculations they were free. After optimization at Hartree-Fock level, single point calculations of energy were carried out using DFT (B3LYP/6-31G**), allowing accurate energies of different cases to be compared. Open conformations (i.e., zero or positive membrane potentials) are consistent with the known X-ray structure of the open state when the salt bridges in the VSD are not ionized (H+ on the acid), whether S4 end atoms were fixed or free (closer fixed than free). Based on these calculations, the backbone of the S4 segment, free or not, moves no more than 2.5 [A] upon switching from positive to negative membrane potential, and the movement is in the wrong direction for closing the channel. This leaves H+ motion as the principal component of gating current. Groups of 3-5 side chains are important for proton transport, based on the calculations. Our calculations point to a pair of steps in which a proton transfers from a tyrosine, Y266, through arginine (R300), to a glutamate (E183); this would account for approximately 20-25% of the gating charge. The calculated charges on each arginine and glutamate are appreciably less than one. Groupings of five amino acids appear to exchange a proton; the group is bounded by the conserved aromatic F233. Dipole rotations appear to also contribute. Alternate interpretations of experiments usually understood in terms of the standard model are shown to be plausible.",

Here, we show that endocytic coat proteins with prion-like domains (PLDs) form hemispherical puncta in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. These puncta have the hallmarks of biomolecular condensates and enable membrane remodeling to drive actin-independent endocytosis. The puncta, which we refer to as endocytic condensates, form and dissolve reversibly in response to changes in temperature and solution conditions. The condensates are organized around dynamic protein-protein interaction networks, which involve interactions among PLDs with high glutamine contents. The endocytic coat protein Sla1 is at the hub of the protein-protein interaction network. Using active rheology, we indirectly characterized the material properties of endocytic condensates. These experiments show that endocytic condensates are viscoelastic materials and allow us to estimate the interfacial tension between endocytic condensates and their surroundings. We then adapt the physics of contact mechanics, specifically the contact theory of Hertz, to develop a quantitative framework for describing how interfacial tensions among condensates, the membrane, and the cytosol can deform the plasma membrane to enable actin independent endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is common on Earth, forms the major commercial natural gas reservoirs, and is a key component of the global carbon cycle, but its natural sources are not well-characterized. We present a geochemical dataset acquired from a red wood-ant (RWA; Formica polyctena) nest in the Neuwied Basin, a part of the East Eifel Volcanic Field (EEVF), focusing on methane (CH4), stable carbon isotope of methane ({delta}13C-CH4), RWA activity patterns, earthquakes, and earth tides. Nest gas and ambient air were continuously sampled in-situ and analyzed to detect microbial, thermogenic, and abiotic fault-related micro-seepage. Methane degassing was not synchronized with earth tides. Elevated CH4 concentrations in nest gas appear to result from a combination of microbial activity and fault-related emissions moving via through fault networks through the RWA nest. Two {delta}13C-CH4 signatures were identified in nest gas: -69{per thousand} and -37{per thousand}. The -69{per thousand} signature of {delta}13C-CH4 within the RWA nest is attributed to microbial decomposition of organic matter. This finding supports previous findings that RWA nests are hot-spots of microbial CH4. Additionally, the -37% {delta}13C-CH4 signature is the first evidence that RWA nests also serve as traps for fault-related emissions of CH4. The -37{per thousand} {delta}13C-CH4 signature can be attributed either to thermogenic/fault-related or to abiotic/fault-related CH4 formation originating from e.g. low-temperature gas-water-rock reactions in a continental setting at shallow depths (microseepage). Sources of these micro-seeps could be Devonian schists (\\\"Sphaerosiderith Schiefer\\\") with iron concretions (\\\"Eisengallen\\\"), sandstones, or the iron-bearing \\\"Klerf Schichten\\\". We cannot exclude overlapping micro-seepage of magmatic CH4 from the Eifel plume. Given the abundance of RWA nests on the landscape, their role as sources of microbial CH4 and traps for abiotically-derived CH4 should be included in estimation of methane emissions that are contributing to climatic change.",

An underlying assumption in aging research has been that DR mimetics extend both lifespan and healthspan jointly, though this has not been rigorously tested in different genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, nutrient response genes important for lifespan or healthspan extension remain underexplored, especially in natural populations. To address these gaps, we utilized over 150 DGRP strains to measure nutrient-dependent changes in lifespan and age-related climbing ability to measure healthspan. DR extended lifespan and delayed decline in climbing ability on average, but there was no evidence of correlation between these traits across individual strains. Through GWAS, we then identified and validated jughead and Ferredoxin as determinants of diet-dependent lifespan, and Daedalus for diet-dependent physical activity. Modulating these genes produced independent effects on lifespan and climbing ability, further suggesting that these age-related traits are likely to be regulated through distinct genetic mechanisms.",

We find strong genetic correlation for ADHD across sex and no mean difference in polygenic burden across sex. In contrast, siblings of female probands are at an increased risk of ADHD, compared to siblings of male probands. The results also suggest that females with ADHD are at especially high risk of comorbid developmental conditions. Overall, this study supports a greater familial burden of risk in females with ADHD and some clinical and etiological heterogeneity. However, autosomal common variants largely do not explain the sex bias in ADHD prevalence.",

These two practices are also heavily carried out in Anatolia and Thrace where 5 subspecies reside naturally.Here, we carried out an analysis of population structure of honey bees sampled from six different regions (n = 250) in order to test the genetic impacts of migratory beekeeping, queen and colony trade and conservation efficacy of isolated regions. A total of 30 microsatellite markers were used in four multiplex reactions.Direct genetic impact of migratory beekeeping was demonstrated first time based on a comparison of assignment of individuals to their geographically native populations where migratory colonies showed less fidelity. We found genetic evidence for them acting as a hybrid zone mobile in space and time, becoming vectors of otherwise local gene combinations.The effects of honey bee trade were revealed by the presence of very high introgression levels from the highly commercial Caucasian bees naturally limited to a narrow range. We also measured the direction and magnitude of this gene flow connected with bee trade.Comparison between regions that are either open to migratory beekeeping or not let us evaluate the status of isolated regions as centers of limited gene flow and showed the importance of establishing such regions.Despite signs of gene flow, our findings confirm high levels of geographically structured genetic diversity of four subspecies of honey bees in Turkey and emphasize the need to develop policies to maintain this diversity.Our overall results might potentially bear a wider interest to the community since they constitute an important attempt to quantify the effects of anthropogenic impacts on established patterns of honey bee diversity. Our measurable and justified findings on migratory beekeeping, queen and colony replacements as well as conservation implications will hopefully be of use for the decision makers and other stakeholders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "We previously reported the equilibrium dimerization reaction of the CLC-ec1 Cl-/H+ transporter in 2:1 POPE/POPG membranes (Chadda et al. 2016). This was determined by measuring the probability distributions of subunit capture into extruded liposomes by single-molecule photobleaching analysis across a wide range of subunit/lipid mole fraction densities. In this approach, knowledge of the liposome size distribution is necessary in order to correct the data for random co-capture events and extract the underlying dimerization reaction. For this we used a previously reported cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) measured size distribution of 400 nm extruded liposomes made of E. coli polar lipids (Walden et al. 2007). While the model and data agreed at low densities, we observed systematic inaccuracies at higher densities limiting our ability to extract FDimer in this range. To address this issue, we measured the 400 nm extruded 2:1 POPE/POPG liposome size distribution by cryo-EM and found that there is a small, but significant amount of larger liposomes in the population. Re-analysis of the I201W/I422W  WW photobleaching data using this distribution shows that the protein is monomeric in the membrane and can serve as an experimental control. Dimer controls were constructed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking of C85A/H234C  WT or introducing R230C/L249C, which forms a spontaneous disulfide bond. Determination of FDimer based on the experimental controls yields improved fits and no change in the previously reported{Delta} G{degrees} values, providing an alternate model-free approach to measuring CLC-ec1 dimerization in membranes.",

    "abstract": "Aberrations in signaling pathways that regulate tissue growth often lead to tumorigenesis. Homeodomain interacting protein kinase (Hipk) family members are reported to have distinct and contradictory effects on cell proliferation and tissue growth. From these studies it is clear that much remains to be learned about the roles of Hipk family protein kinases in proliferation and cell behaviour. Previous work has shown that Drosophila Hipk is a potent growth regulator, thus we predicted that it could have a role in tumorigenesis. In our study of Hipk-induced phenotypes, we observed the formation of tumor-like structures in multiple cell types in larvae and adults. Furthermore, elevated Hipk in epithelial cells induces cell spreading, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the imaginal disc. Further evidence comes from cell culture studies in which we expressed Drosophila Hipk in human breast cancer cells and show that it enhances proliferation and migration. Past studies have shown that Hipk can promote the action of conserved pathways implicated in cancer and EMT, such as Wnt/Wingless, Hippo, Notch and JNK. We show that Hipk-phenotypes are not likely due to activation of a single target, but rather through a cumulative effect on numerous target pathways. Most Drosophila tumor models involve mutations in multiple genes, such as the well-known RasV12 model, in which EMT and invasiveness occur after the additional loss of the tumor suppressor gene scribble. Our study reveals that elevated levels of Hipk on their own can promote both hyperproliferation and invasive cell behaviour, suggesting that Hipks could be potent oncogenes and drivers of EMT.\\n\\nSummary statementThe protein kinase Hipk can promote proliferation and invasive behaviors, as well as synergize with known cancer pathways, in a novel Drosophila model for tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Anteroposterior axis extension during vertebrate gastrulation requires cell proliferation, embryonic patterning, and morphogenesis to be spatiotemporally coordinated, but the underlying genetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we define a role for the conserved chromatin factor Gon4l, encoded by ugly duckling (udu), in coordinating tissue patterning and axis extension during zebrafish gastrulation. Although identified as a recessive enhancer of short axis phenotypes in planar cell polarity (PCP) mutants, we found that Gon4l functions in a genetically independent, partially overlapping fashion with PCP signaling to regulate mediolateral cell polarity underlying axis extension in part by promoting notochord boundary formation. We identified direct genomic targets of Gon4l and found that it acts as both a positive and negative regulator of gene expression, including limiting expression of the cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules EpCAM and Integrin3b. Excess epcam or itga3b in wild-type gastrulae phenocopied notochord boundary defects of udu mutants, while downregulation of itga3b suppressed them. By promoting formation of this anteroposteriorly aligned boundary and associated cell polarity, Gon4l cooperates with PCP signaling to coordinate morphogenesis with the anteroposterior embryonic axis.",

Here, using a thorough DNA-based census of the whole soil biota in a large tropical forest plot, we show that soil aluminium, topography, and plant species identity are all important drivers of soil richness and community composition. Body size emerges as an important feature of the comparative ecology of the different taxa at the studied spatial scale, with microorganisms being more importantly controlled by environmental factors, while soil mesofauna rather display random spatial distribution. We infer that niche-based processes contribute differently to community assembly across trophic levels due to spatial scaling.

    "abstract": "Conflict between organisms can lead to reciprocal adaptation that manifests itself as an increased evolutionary rate in the genes mediating the conflict. This adaptive signature has been observed in RNA interference (RNAi) pathway genes involved in the suppression of viruses and transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that a subset of Drosophila RNAi genes may be locked into an arms race with these parasites. However, it is not known whether rapid evolution of RNAi genes is a general phenomenon across invertebrates, or which RNAi genes generally evolve adaptively. Here we use population genomic data from eight invertebrate species to infer rates of adaptive sequence evolution, and to test for past and ongoing selective sweeps in RNAi genes. We assess rates of adaptive protein evolution across species by using a formal meta-analytic framework to combine data across species, and by implementing a multispecies generalised linear mixed model of mutation counts. In all species, we find that RNAi genes display a greater rate of adaptive protein substitution than other genes, and that this is primarily mediated by positive selection acting on the subset of genes that are most likely to defend against viruses and transposable elements. In contrast, evidence for recent selective sweeps is broadly spread across functional classes of RNAi genes and differs substantially among species. Finally, we identify genes that exhibit elevated adaptive evolution across the analysed insect species combined, perhaps due to concurrent parasite-mediated arms races.",

    "abstract": "A survey of bacterial and archaeal genomes shows that many Tn7-like transposons contain  minimal type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems that consist of fused cas8f and cas5f, cas7f and cas6f genes, and a short CRISPR array. Additionally, several small groups of Tn7-like transposons encompass similarly truncated type I-B CRISPR-Cas systems. This gene composition of the transposon-associated CRISPR-Cas systems implies that they are competent for pre-crRNA processing yielding mature crRNAs and target binding but not target cleavage that is required for interference. Here we present phylogenetic analysis demonstrating that evolution of the CRISPR-Cas containing transposons included a single, ancestral capture of a type I-F locus and two independent instances of type I-B loci capture. We further show that the transposon-associated CRISPR arrays contain spacers homologous to plasmid and temperate phage sequences, and in some cases, chromosomal sequences adjacent to the transposon. A hypothesis is proposed that the transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems generate displacement (R-loops) in the cognate DNA sites, targeting the transposon to these sites and thus facilitating their spread via plasmids and phages. This scenario fits the \\\"guns for hire\\\" concept whereby mobile genetic elements can capture host defense systems and repurpose them for different stages in the life cycle of the element.\\n\\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immunity system that protects bacteria and archaea from mobile genetic elements. We present comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of degenerate CRISPR-Cas variants associated with distinct families of transposable elements and develop the hypothesis that such repurposed defense systems contribute to the transposable element propagation by facilitating transposition into specific sites. Such recruitment of defense systems by mobile elements supports the \\\"guns for hire\\\" concept under which the same enzymatic machineries can be alternately employed for transposon proliferation or host defense.",

We find that passenger pigeons large population size allowed for faster adaptive evolution and removal of harmful mutations, but that this drove a huge loss in neutral genetic diversity.

    "abstract": "The multicopy 45S ribosomal DNA (45S rDNA) array gives origin to the nucleolus, the first discovered nuclear organelle, site of Poll I 45S rRNA transcription and key regulator of cellular metabolism, DNA repair response, genome stability, and global epigenetic states. The multicopy 5S ribosomal DNA array (5S rDNA) is located on a separate chromosome, encodes the 5S rRNA transcribed by Pol III, and exhibits concerted copy number variation (cCNV) with the 45S rDNA array in human blood. Here we combined genomic data from >700 tumors and normal tissues to provide a portrait of ribosomal DNA variation in human tissues and cancers of diverse mutational signatures. We show that most cancers undergo coupled 5S rDNA array amplification and 45S rDNA loss, with abundant inter-individual variation in rDNA copy number of both arrays, and concerted modulation of 5S-45S copy number in some but not all tissues. Analysis of genetic context revealed associations between the presence of specific somatic alterations, such as P53 mutations in stomach and lung adenocarcinomas, and coupled 5S gain / 45S loss. Finally, we show that increased proliferation rates along cancer lineages can partially explain contrasting copy number changes in the 5S and 45S rDNA arrays. We suggest that 5S rDNA amplification facilitates increased ribosomal synthesis in cancer, whereas 45S rDNA loss emerges as a byproduct of transcription-replication conflict in highly proliferating tumor cells. Our results highlight the tissue- specificity of concerted copy number variation and uncover contrasting changes in 5S and 45S rDNA copy number along rapidly proliferating cell lineages.\\n\\nLay SummaryThe 45S and 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays contain hundreds of rDNA copies, with substantial variability across individuals and species. Although physically unlinked, both arrays exhibit concerted copy number variation. However, whether concerted copy number is universally observed across all tissues is unknown. It also remains unknown if rDNA copy number may vary in tissues and cancer lineages. Here we showed that most cancers undergo coupled 5S rDNA array amplification and 45S rDNA loss, and concerted 5S-45S copy number variation in some but not all tissues. The coupled 5S amplification and 45S loss is associated with the presence of certain somatic genetic variations, as well as increased cancerous cell proliferation rate. Our research highlights the tissue- specificity of concerted copy number variation and uncover contrasting changes in rDNA copy number along rapidly proliferating cell lineages. Our observations raise the prospects of using 5S and 45S ribosomal DNA states as indicators of cancer status and targets in new strategies for cancer therapy.",

How does the brain reorganize when one of these channels is absent? Here we explore this question by combining behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging measures (magneto-encephalography and functional imaging) in a group of early deaf humans. We show enhanced selective neural response for faces and for individual face coding in a specific region of the auditory cortex that is typically specialized for voice perception in hearing individuals. In this region, selectivity to face signals emerges early in the visual processing hierarchy, shortly following typical face-selective responses in the ventral visual pathway. Functional and effective connectivity analyses suggest reorganization in long-range connections from early visual areas to the face-selective temporal area in individuals with early and profound deafness. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that regions that typically specialize for voice processing in the hearing brain preferentially reorganize for face processing in born deaf people. Our results support the idea that cross-modal plasticity in case of early sensory deprivation relates to the original functional specialization of the reorganized brain regions.",

However, the effects of elevated [O3] on C4 crops including maize (Zea mays L.) are poorly understood in terms of physiological mechanism and genetic variation in sensitivity. Using Free Air gas Concentration Enrichment (FACE), we investigated the photosynthetic response of 18 diverse maize inbred and hybrid lines to season-long exposure to elevated [O3] (~100 nL L-1) in the field. Gas exchange was measured on the leaf subtending the ear throughout the grain filling period. On average over the lifetime of the leaf, elevated [O3] led to reductions in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation of both inbred (-22%) and hybrid (-33%) genotypes. There was significant variation among both inbred and hybrid lines in the sensitivity of photosynthesis to elevated [O3], with some lines showing no change in photosynthesis at elevated [O3]. Based on analysis of inbred line B73, the reduced CO2 assimilation at elevated [O3] was associated with accelerated senescence decreasing photosynthetic capacity, and not altered stomatal limitation. These findings across diverse maize genotypes could advance the development of more ozone tolerant maize, and provide experimental data for parameterization and validation of studies modeling how O3 impacts crop performance.",

This review highlights the methodological diversity in existing longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on structural brain development during childhood and adolescence, and addresses how such variation might contribute to inconsistencies in the literature. We discuss the impact of method choices at multiple decision points across the research process, from study design and sample selection, to image processing and statistical analysis. We also highlight the extent to which different methodological considerations have been empirically examined, drawing attention to specific areas that would benefit from future investigation. Where appropriate, we recommend certain best practices that would be beneficial for the field to adopt, including greater completeness and transparency in reporting methods, in order to ultimately develop an accurate and detailed understanding of normative child and adolescent brain development.",

    "abstract": "The metazoan protein BCL2-associated athanogene cochaperone 6 (Bag6) forms a hetero-trimeric complex with ubiquitin-like 4A (Ubl4A) and transmembrane domain recognition complex 35 (TRC35). This Bag6 complex is involved in tail-anchored protein targeting and various protein quality control pathways in the cytosol as well as regulating transcription and histone methylation in the nucleus. Here we present a crystal structure of Bag6 and its cytoplasmic retention factor TRC35, revealing that TRC35 is remarkably conserved throughout opisthokont lineage except at the C-terminal Bag6-binding groove, which evolved to accommodate a novel metazoan factor Bag6. Remarkably, while TRC35 and its fungal homolog guided entry of tail-anchored protein 4 (Get4) utilize a conserved hydrophobic patch to bind their respective C-terminal binding partners Bag6 and Get5, Bag6 wraps around TRC35 on the opposite face relative to the Get4-5 interface. We further demonstrate that the residues involved in TRC35 binding are not only critical for occluding the Bag6 nuclear localization sequence from karyopherin  binding to retain Bag6 in the cytosol, but also for preventing TRC35 from succumbing to RNF126-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation. The results provide a mechanism for regulation of Bag6 nuclear localization and the functional integrity of the Bag6 complex in the cytosol.",

Several genes have been associated with eyespot development but few have been tested for function. One of these genes is the signaling ligand, wingless, which is expressed in the eyespot centers during early pupation and may function in eyespot signaling and color ring differentiation. Here we tested the function of wingless in wing and eyespot development by down-regulating it in transgenic Bicyclus anynana butterflies via RNAi driven by an inducible heat-shock promoter. Heat-shocks applied during larval and early pupal development led to significant decreases in wingless mRNA levels and to decreases in eyespot size and wing size in adult butterflies. We conclude that wingless is a positive regulator of eyespot and wing development in B. anynana butterflies.",

    "abstract": "E. Coli AlkB catalyzes the direct dealkylation of various alkylated bases in damaged DNA. The diffusion of molecular Oxygen to the active site in AlkB is an essential step for the oxidative dealkylation activity. Despite detailed studies on the stepwise oxidation mechanism of AlkB, there is no conclusive picture of how O2 molecules reach the active site of the protein. Yu et al. (Nature, 439, 879) proposed the existence of an intra-molecular tunnel based on their initial crystal structures of AlkB. We have employed computational simulations to investigate possible migration pathways inside AlkB for O2 molecules. Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including explicit ligand sampling and potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, have been performed to provide a microscopic description of the O2 delivery pathway in AlkB. Analysis of intra-molecular tunnels using the CAVER software indicates two possible pathways for O2 to diffuse into the AlkB active site. Explicit ligand sampling simulations suggests that only one of these tunnels provides a viable route. The free energy path for an oxygen molecule to travel along each of these tunnels has been determined with AMBER and AMOEBA. Both PMFs indicate passive transport of O2 from the surface of the protein. However, the inclusion of explicit polarization shows a very large barrier for diffusion of the co-substrate out of the active site, compared with the non-polarizable potential. In addition, our results suggest that the mutation of a conserved residue along the tunnel, Y178, has dramatic effects on the dynamics of AlkB and on the transport of O2 along the tunnel.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution images reconstructed from single-molecule localizations can reveal cellular structures close to the macromolecular scale and are now being used routinely in many biomedical research applications. However, because of their coordinate-based representation, a widely applicable and unified analysis platform that can extract a quantitative description and biophysical parameters from these images is yet to be established. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for correlation analysis of coordinate-based super-resolution images using distance histograms. We demonstrate the application of this concept in multiple scenarios including image alignment, tracking of diffusing molecules, as well as for quantification of colocalization.\\n\\nSignificance statementCorrelation analysis is one of the most widely used image processing method. In the quantitative analysis of localization-based super-resolution images, there still lacks a generalized coordinate-based correlation analysis framework to take fully advantage of the super-resolution information. We show a coordinate-based correlation analysis framework for localization-based super-resolution microscopy. This framework is highly general and flexible in that it can be easily extended to model the effect of localization uncertainty, to the time domain and other distance definitions, enabling it to be adapted for a wide range of applications. Our work will greatly benefit the quantitative interpretation of super-resolution images and thus the biological application of super-resolution microscopy.",

The question of how nucleosome-positioning information from a parent chromatin gets transferred to the daughter chromatin is highly intriguing. Accounting for experimentally known coupling between replisome movement and nucleosome dynamics, we propose a model that can explain the inheritance of nucleosome positioning. Simulating nucleosome dynamics during replication we argue that short pausing of the replication fork, associated with nucleosome disassembly, can be the event crucial for communicating nucleosome positioning information from parent to daughter. We show that the interplay of timescales between nucleosome disassembly ({tau}p) at the replication fork and nucleosome sliding behind the fork ({tau}s) can give rise to a rich \\\"phase diagram\\\" having different inherited patterns of nucleosome organization.

    "abstract": "Adaptive desensitization and inactivation are common properties of most ion channels and receptors. The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance MscS, which serves as a low-threshold osmolyte release valve in most bacteria, is unusual because it slowly inactivates not from the open, but from the resting state under moderate tensions. The manifestation of this mechanism is the channels ability to discriminate the rate of tension application, i.e., to ignore slow tension ramps but fully respond to abruptly applied stimuli. In this work, we present a reconstruction of the landscape for tension-dependent MscS transitions based on patch current kinetics recorded under specially designed pressure protocols. The data are analyzed with a three-state continuous time Markov model of gating, where the tension-dependent transition rates are governed by Arrhenius-type relations. The analysis provides assignments to the intrinsic opening, closing, inactivation, and recovery rates as well as their tension dependencies. These parameters, which define the spatial (areal) distances between the energy wells and the positions of barriers, describe the tension-dependent distribution of the channel population between the three states and quantitatively predict the experimentally observed dynamic pulse and ramp responses. Our solution also provides an analytic expression for the area of the inactivated state in terms of two experimentally accessible parameters: the tension at which inactivation probability is maximized, {gamma}*, and the midpoint tension for activation, {gamma}0.5. The analysis initially performed on Escherichia coli MscS shows its applicability to the previously uncharacterized MscS homolog from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MscS inactivation minimizes metabolic losses during osmotic permeability response and thus contributes to the environmental fitness of bacteria.",

    "abstract": "A central component of malaria control initiatives throughout the world is the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparium malaria. Despite the well-documented clinical efficacy of ACTs, the population-level effects of ACT case management on malaria transmission have not been studied thoroughly until recently. An ideal case study for the population-level effects of artemisinin use can be found in Vietnam, where a major increase of malaria cases in the 1980s was followed by the gradual adoption of artemisinin-based clinical case management. We assembled annual data from Vietnams National Institutes for Malariology, Parasitology, and Entomology showing the degree to which artemisinin therapies were adopted in different provinces, the effort placed on vector control, and the funding available to provincial malaria control programs, from 1991 to 2014. Data on urbanization were also collected for this period. We found that a 10% increase in the artemisinin proportion of treatments procured by a provincial control program corresponded to a 32.8% (95% CI: 27.7 - 37.5%) decline in estimated malaria cases; the association persisted and the effect size was nearly unchanged if confirmed cases or suspected cases were used. There was no consistent effect of vector control on malaria cases in Vietnam as a whole, nor was any effect found when the data were broken up regionally. The association between urbanization and malaria was generally negative and sometimes statistically significant. This was most pronounced in the central region of Vietnam, where a 10% increase in urbanization corresponded to a 43.3% (95% CI: 21.6 - 58.9%) decrease in suspected malaria incidence; this association was not statistically significant if confirmed cases or estimated cases were used. The decline of malaria in Vietnam from 1991 to 2014 can largely be attributed to the rapid adoption of artemisinin-based drugs. Recent analyses of aggregated data from Africa have shown that insecticide-treated nets have had the greatest effect on lowering malaria prevalence over the past fifteen years, suggesting that the success of different types of malaria interventions is region specific. Continuing global efforts on malaria elimination should focus on both vector control measures and increased access to artemisinin-combination therapies.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100039). The efficiency of plant resistance to fungal pathogen populations is expected to decrease over time, due to its evolution with an increase in the frequency of virulent or highly aggressive strains. This dynamics may differ depending on the scale investigated (annual or pluriannual), particularly for annual crop pathogens with both sexual and asexual reproduction cycles. We assessed this time-scale effect, by comparing aggressiveness changes in a local Zymoseptoria tritici population over an eight-month cropping season and a six-year period of wheat monoculture. We collected two pairs of subpopulations to represent the annual and pluriannual scales: from leaf lesions at the beginning and end of a single annual epidemic, and from crop debris at the beginning and end of a six-year period. We assessed two aggressiveness traits - latent period and lesion size - on sympatric and allopatric host varieties. A trend toward decreased latent period concomitant with a significant loss of variability was established during the course of the annual epidemic, but not over the six-year period. Furthermore, a significant cultivar effect (sympatric vs. allopatric) on the average aggressiveness of the isolates revealed host adaptation, arguing that the observed patterns could result from selection. We thus provide an experimental body of evidence of an epidemiological trade-off between the intra- and inter-annual scales in the evolution of aggressiveness in a local plant pathogen population. More aggressive isolates were collected from upper leaves, on which disease severity is usually lower than on the lower part of the plants left in the field as crop debris after harvest. We suggest that these isolates play little role in sexual reproduction, due to an Allee effect (difficulty finding mates at low pathogen densities), particularly as the upper parts of the plant are removed from the field, explaining the lack of transmission of increases in aggressiveness between epidemics.",

Therefore, this study addresses the issue of applying NGS microbial diagnostics directly to blood samples. To demonstrate the potential of direct from blood sequencing a bacteria spiked blood model was developed. Horse blood was spiked with clinical samples of E. coli and S. aureus, and a process developed to isolate bacterial cells whilst removing the majority of host DNA. One sample of each isolate was then amplified using {phi}29 multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and sequenced. The total processing time, from sample to amplified DNA ready for sequencing was 3.5 hours, significantly faster than the 18-hour overnight culture step which is typically required. Both bacteria showed 100% survival through the processing. The direct from sample sequencing resulted in greater than 92% genome coverage of the pathogens whilst limiting the sequencing of host genome (less than 7% of all reads). Analysis of de novo assembled reads allowed accurate genotypic antibiotic resistance prediction. The sample processing is easily applicable to multiple sequencing platforms. Overall this model demonstrates potential to rapidly generate whole genome bacterial data directly from blood.",

    "abstract": "Encounters between transcription and DNA replication machineries lead to conflicts that shape genomes, influence evolution, and lead to genetic diseases in humans. Although unclear why, head-on transcription (lagging strand genes) is especially disruptive to replication, increases DNA breaks, and promotes mutagenesis. Here, we show that head-on replication-transcription conflicts lead to pervasive RNA:DNA hybrid formation in Bacillus subtilis. We find that replication beyond head-on conflict regions requires the activity of a RNA:DNA hybrid processing enzyme, RNase HIII. Remarkably, pervasive RNA:DNA hybrid formation at head-on genes completely stops replication and inhibits gene expression in a replication-dependent manner. Accordingly, we find that resolution of head-on conflicts by RNase HIII is crucial for survival upon exposure to various stresses, as many stress response genes are encoded head-on to replication. We conclude that R-loops, RNA:DNA hybrids formed outside of the transcription bubble, exacerbate head-on replication-transcription conflicts, thereby threatening life, especially upon exposure to environmental stresses.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed movements of the hand are often directed straight at the target, e.g. when swatting a fly; but when drawing or avoiding obstacles, hand trajectories can also become quite complex. Studies on movement planning have largely neglected the latter case and the question of whether the same neural machinery is planning straight, saccade-like vs. complex hand trajectories. Using time-resolved fMRI during delayed response tasks we examined planning activity in human superior parietal lobule (SPL) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). We show that the recruitment of both areas in trajectory planning differs significantly: PMd represented both straight and complex hand trajectories while SPL only those that led straight to the target. This implies that complex and computationally demanding reach planning is governed by a frontal pathway while a parietal route could warrant an alternative and faster way to put simple plans into action.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) continues to grow in popularity as a useful neuroimaging method to study brain development, and longitudinal studies that track the same individuals over time are emerging. Over the last decade, seminal work using dMRI has provided new insights into the development of brain white matter (WM) microstructure, connections and networks throughout childhood and adolescence. This review provides an introduction to dMRI, both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and other dMRI models, as well as common acquisition and analysis approaches. We highlight the difficulties associated with ascribing these imaging measurements and their changes over time to specific underlying cellular and molecular events. We also discuss selected methodological challenges that are of particular relevance for studies of development, including critical choices related to image acquisition, image analysis, quality control assessment, and the within-subject and longitudinal reliability of dMRI measurements. Next, we review the exciting progress in the characterization and understanding of brain development that has resulted from dMRI studies in childhood and adolescence, including brief overviews and discussions of studies focusing on sex and individual differences. Finally, we outline future directions that will be beneficial to the field.",

Many advances in our understanding of vocal learning result from research using the zebra finch, a close-ended vocal learner. We review some of the manipulations used in zebra finch research, such as isolate housing, transient/irreversible impairment of hearing/vocal organs, implantation of small devices for chronic electrophysiology, head fixation for imaging, aversive song conditioning using sound playback, and mounting of miniature backpacks for behavioral monitoring. We highlight the use of these manipulations in scientific research, and estimate their impact on animal welfare, based on the literature and on data from our past and ongoing work. The assessment of harm-benefits tradeoffs is a legal prerequisite for animal research in Switzerland. We conclude that a diverse set of known stressors reliably lead to suppressed singing rate, and that by contraposition, increased singing rate may be a useful indicator of welfare.

The secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in dorsal tongue epithelium from the initial developmental stage. In this study, we utilized a series of genetic approaches to investigate the role of Shh during mouse tongue formation. Temporal-specific global deletion of Shh demonstrated a functional requirement for normal patterning of the intrinsic tongue muscles and establishment of the lingual tendon. These defects were reproduced in the mutant with a specific loss of signaling in oropharyngeal epithelium by a Shh cis-enhancer. In these mutants, Ptch1 was lost in the underlying cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived mesenchymal lineage. The importance of Shh was confirmed by generating tissue-specific deletions in the ciliopathy gene Ofd1, which transduces Shh signaling. These results revealed Shh roles in patterning of the mesodermal intrinsic tongue muscles through CNC-derived mesenchyme, including the lingual tendon.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibiotic resistance poses a threat to public health and a burden to healthcare systems. Escherichia coli causes more bacteraemia cases in England than any other bacterial species, these infections, in part due to their high incidence, also pose a significant antibiotic resistance burden. The main aim of this study was to estimate the impact of E. coli bacteraemia on patient in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Secondarily, this study also aimed to estimate the effect of antibiotic resistance on these outcomes.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsCase patients were adult E. coli bacteraemia patients infected between July 2011 and June 2012, as reported in an English national mandatory surveillance database, with susceptibility data taken from a national laboratory surveillance database. Control patients were all non-case, adult patients with an English hospital admission record. Case and control patient characteristics and admission information were taken from NHS Digital Datasets.  Resistance was defined as non-susceptible and intermediate isolates, whilst  susceptible was defined as susceptible and non-tested isolates. Time to in-hospital mortality and discharge was investigated through Cox proportional hazards models. To acquire estimates of excess length of stay, multistate models were constructed, with a unit bed day cost applied to estimate cost burden. The total number of case and control hospital spells was 14,051 and 8,919,275 respectively. Acquisition of E. coli bacteraemia was associated with a statistically significant increased daily risk of in-hospital mortality, especially for the first eight days of someones hospital admission [Hazard Ratio = 2.77 (95% confidence interval; 2.61-2.94)]. Antibiotic resistance did not seem to significantly increase this risk further, though did significantly reduce risk of experiencing a discharge event (dead or alive). E.coli bacteraemia was estimated to cost {pound}14,340,900 over the study period (rounded to the nearest {pound}100), with resistance associated with excess costs per infection of {pound}220 - {pound}420 dependent on resistance type, for those where a significant impact was found (rounded to the nearest {pound}10).\\n\\nConclusionsE. coli bacteraemia places a significant burden on patient health and on the hospital sector in England. Resistance is an important factor on length of stay with regards to such infections.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe transmission of malaria in the extra-Amazonian regions of Brazil, although interrupted in the 1960s, has persisted to the present time in some areas of dense Atlantic Forest, with reports of cases characterized by particular transmission cycles and clinical presentations. Bromeliad-malaria, as it is named, is particularly frequent in the state of Espirito Santo, with Plasmodium vivax being the parasite commonly recognized as the etiologic agent of human infections. With regard to the spatial and temporal distances between cases reported in this region, the transmission cycle does not fit the traditional malaria cycle. The existence of a zoonosis, with infected simians participating in the epidemiology, is therefore hypothesized. In the present study, zoonotic transmission of bromeliad-malaria in Espirito Santo is investigated, based on the complete mitochondrial genome of DNA extracted from isolates of Plasmodium species which had infected humans, a simian from the genus Allouata, and Anopheles mosquitoes. Plasmodium vivax/simium was identified in the samples by both nested-PCR and real-time PCR. After amplification, the mitochondrial genome was completely sequenced and compared in a haplotype network, including all sequences of P. vivax/simium mitochondrial genomes sampled from humans and simians from all regions in Brazil.\\n\\nResultsThe haplotype network demonstrates that humans and simians from the Atlantic Forest share the same haplotype, but some isolates from humans are not identical to the simian isolate. In addition, the plasmodial DNA extracted from mosquitoes revealed sequences different from those obtained from simians, but similar to two isolates from humans.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings reinforce the hypothesis that in the Atlantic Forest, and especially in the state with the highest frequency of bromeliad-malaria in Brazil, the same parasite species is shared by humans and simians, at least in part. The difference between the sequences of mosquitoes and simians raises two hypotheses: (1) two distinct transmission cycles for human malaria exist in the study area, one of them involving simians and the other exclusive to human hosts, or (2) there is only one transmission cycle involving humans and simians, but the identification of variations among simians was not possible due to a lack of other samples.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearch over the last 10 years highlights the increasing importance of hybridization between species as a major force structuring the evolution of genomes and potentially providing raw material for adaptation by natural and/or sexual selection. Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity dxy and Pattersons D. The resulting statistic, the Basic distance fraction (Bdf), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published fd and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on CRAN. The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework.\\n\\nConclusionWe present a new distance based statistic Bdf that avoids the pitfalls of Pattersons D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.",

Netrin-dependent morphogenesis is preceded by multimerization of DCC, activation of FAK and Src family kinases, and increases in exocytic vesicle fusion, yet how these occurrences are linked is unknown. Here we demonstrate that TRIM9-dependent ubiquitination of DCC blocks the interaction with and phosphorylation of FAK. Upon netrin-1 stimulation TRIM9 promotes DCC multimerization, but TRIM9-dependent ubiquitination of DCC is reduced, which promotes an interaction with FAK and subsequent FAK activation. We found that inhibition of FAK activity blocks elevated frequencies of exocytosis in vitro and elevated axon branching in vitro and in vivo. Although FAK inhibition decreased SNARE-mediated exocytosis, assembled SNARE complexes and vesicles adjacent to the plasma membrane were increased, suggesting a novel role for FAK in the progression from assembled SNARE complexes to vesicle fusion in developing murine neurons.\\n\\nAbbreviations used in this paper",

However, its roles on the development of motor neuron have still remained uncovered. Here, we provided evidences that insmla was a vital regulator of motor neuron development and provide a mechanistic understanding of how it contributes to this process. Firstly, we showed the localization of insmla in spinal cord and primary motor neurons (PMNs) of zebrafish embryos by in situ hybridization and imaging analysis of transgenic reporter line Tg(insmla: mCherry) ntu805. Then we demonstrated that the deficiency of insmla in zebrafish larvae lead to the defects of PMNs development, including the reduction of caudal primary motor neurons (CaP) and middle primary motor neurons (MiP), the excessive branching of motor axons, and the disorganized distance between adjacent CaPs. Additionally, knockout of insm1 impaired motor neuron differentiation in the spinal cord. Locomotion analysis showed that insmla-null zebrafish significantly reduced the swimming activity. Furthermore, we proved that the insmla loss of function significantly decreased the transcripts levels of both olig2 and nkx6.1. Microinjection of olig2 and nkx6.1 mRNA rescued the motor neuron defects in insmla deficient embryos. Taken together, these data indicate that insmla regulates the motor neuron development, at least in part, through modulation of the expressions of olig2 and nkx6.1.",

Pruning back the tree of life around us will lead to our species being among those with the fewest close relatives. We will erase our evolutionary history, forcing its uniqueness.

    "abstract": "Background: Among the four bases, guanine is the most susceptible to damage from oxidative stress. Replication of DNA containing damaged guanines result in G to T mutations. Therefore, the mutations resulting from oxidative DNA damage are generally expected to predominantly consist of G to T (and C to A when the damaged guanine is not in the reference strand) and result in decreased GC content. However, the opposite pattern was reported 16 years ago in a study of prokaryotic genomes. Although that result has been widely cited and confirmed by nine later studies with similar methods, the omission of the effect of shared ancestry requires a re-examination of the reliability of the results.\\n\\nResults: We retrieved 70 aerobe-anaerobe pairs of prokaryotes, and members of each pair were adjacent on the phylogenetic tree. Pairwise comparisons of either whole-genome GC content or the GC content at 4-fold degenerate sites of orthologous genes among these 70 pairs did not show significant differences between aerobes and anaerobes. The signature of guanine oxidation on GC content evolution has not been detected even after extensive controlling of other influencing factors. Furthermore, the anaerobes were not different from the aerobes in the rate of either G to T, C to A, or other directions of substitutions. The presence of the enzymes responsible for guanine oxidation in anaerobic prokaryotes provided additional evidence that guanine oxidation might be prevalent in anaerobic prokaryotes. In either aerobes or anaerobes, the rates of G:C to T:A mutations were not significantly higher than the reverse mutations.\\n\\nConclusions: The previous counterintuitive results on the relationship between oxygen requirement and GC content should be attributed to the methodological artefact resulting from phylogenetically non-independence among the analysed samples. Our results showed that aerobiosis does not increase or decrease GC content in evolution. Furthermore, our study challenged the widespread belief that abundant G:C to T:A transversions are the signature of oxidative stress in prokaryotic evolution.",

In that framework, Felsensteins bootstrap tends to yield very low supports, especially on deep branches.

The Electronic Health Record linked dataset is a key component of GS:SFHS, a biobank conceived in 1999 for the purpose of studying the genetics of health areas of current and projected public health importance. Over 24,000 adults were recruited from 2006 to 2011, with broad and enduring written informed consent for biomedical research. Consent was obtained from 23,603 participants for GS:SFHS study data to be linked to their Scottish National Health Service (NHS) records, using their Community Health Index (CHI) number. This identifying number is used for NHS Scotland procedures (registrations, attendances, samples, prescribing and investigations) and allows healthcare records for individuals to be linked across time and location. Here, we describe the NHS EHR dataset on the sub-cohort of 20,032 GS:SFHS participants with consent and mechanism for record linkage plus extensive genetic data. Together with existing study phenotypes, including family history and environmental exposures such as smoking, the EHR is a rich resource of real world data that can be used in research to characterise the health trajectory of participants, available at low cost and a high degree of timeliness, matched to DNA, urine and serum samples and genome-wide genetic information.",

    "abstract": "European forests are experiencing extensive invasion from the Ash pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, an ecological niche competitor to the non-pathogenic native congener H. albidus. We report the genome-wide diversity and population structure in Asia (native) and Europe (the introduced range). We show H. fraxineus underwent a dramatic bottleneck upon introduction to Europe around 30-40 generations ago, leaving a genomic signature, characterized by long segments of fixation, interspersed with \\\"diversity islands\\\" that are identical throughout Europe. This means no effective secondary contact with other populations has occurred. Genome-wide variation is consistently high within sampled locations in Japan and the Russian Far East, and lack of differentiation amongst Russian locations suggests extensive gene flow, similar to Europe. A local ancestry analysis supports Russia as a more likely source population than Japan. Negligible latency, rapid host-range expansion and viability of small founding populations specify strong biosecurity forewarnings against new introductions from outside Europe.",

    "abstract": "Diet is a crucial determinant of organismal biology. Here we demonstrate the dramatic impact of a subtle shift in diet on the ability of Caenorhabditis elegans to survive pathogenic or abiotic stress. Interestingly, this shift occurs independently of canonical host defense pathways, arising instead from improvements in mitochondrial health. Using a variety of assays, we reveal that the most common C. elegans food source (E. coli OP50) results in a vitamin B12 deficiency that compromises mitochondrial homeostasis. Increasing B12 supply by feeding on E. coli HT115 or by supplementing bacterial media with methylcobalamin restored mitochondrial function, even if the bacteria were dead. B12 supplementation also efficiently increased host health without adversely affecting lifespan. Our study forges a molecular link between a dietary deficiency (nutrition/microbiota) and a physiological consequence (host sensitivity), using the host-microbiota-diet framework. The ubiquity of B12 deficiency (~10-40% of US adults) highlights the importance of our findings.",

Cracking the code whereby these LFP oscillations coordinate in time and space (spatiotemporal dynamics) to represent complex behaviors would provide fundamental insights into how the brain signals emotional processes at the network level. Here we use machine learning to integrate LFP activity acquired concurrently from seven cortical and subcortical brain regions into an analytical model that predicts the emergence of depression-related behavioral dysfunction across individual mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress. We uncover a spatiotemporal dynamic network in which activity originates in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc, ventral striatum), relays through amygdala and ventral tegmental area (VTA), and converges in ventral hippocampus (VHip). The activity of this network correlates with acute threat responses and brain-wide cellular firing, and it is enhanced in three independent molecular-, physiological-, and behavioral-based models of depression vulnerability. Finally, we use two antidepressant manipulations to demonstrate that this vulnerability network is biologically distinct from the networks that signal behavioral dysfunction after stress. Thus, corticostriatal to VHip-directed spatiotemporal dynamics organized at the network level are a novel convergent depression vulnerability pathway.",

ATP acts as universal cellular energy cofactor fuelling all life processes, including gene expression, metabolism, and transport. Despite a mechanistic understanding of ATP biochemistry, ATP dynamics in the living plant have been largely elusive. Here we establish live MgATP2- assessment in plants using the fluorescent protein biosensor ATeam1.03-nD/nA. We generate Arabidopsis sensor lines and investigate the sensor in vitro under conditions appropriate for the plant cytosol. We establish an assay for ATP fluxes in isolated mitochondria, and demonstrate that the sensor responds rapidly and reliably to MgATP2- changes in planta.

    "abstract": "Despite substantial experimental and computational efforts, mechanistic modeling remains more predictive in engineering than in systems biology. The reason for this discrepancy is not fully understood. Although randomness and complexity of biological systems play roles in this concern, we hypothesize that significant and overlooked challenges arise due to specific features of single-molecule events that control crucial biological responses. Here we show that modern statistical tools to disentangle complexity and stochasticity, which assume normally distributed fluctuations or enormous datasets, don't apply to the discrete, positive, and non-symmetric distributions that characterize spatiotemporal mRNA fluctuations in single-cells. We demonstrate an alternate approach that fully captures discrete, non-normal effects within finite datasets. As an example, we integrate single-molecule measurements and these advanced computational analyses to explore Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase induction of multiple stress response genes. We discover and validate quantitatively precise, reproducible, and predictive understanding of diverse transcription regulation mechanisms, including gene activation, polymerase initiation, elongation, mRNA accumulation, spatial transport, and degradation. Our model-data integration approach extends to any discrete dynamic process with rare events and realistically limited data.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSystems biology seeks to combine experiments with computation to predict complex biological behaviors. However, despite tremendous data and knowledge, most biological models make terrible predictions. By analyzing single-cell-single-molecule measurements of mRNA in yeast during stress response, we explore how prediction accuracy is controlled by experimental distributions shapes. We find that asymmetric data distributions, which arise in measurements of positive quantities, can cause standard modeling approaches to yield excellent fits but make meaningless predictions. We demonstrate advanced computational tools that solve this dilemma and achieve predictive understanding of many spatiotemporal mechanisms of transcription control including RNA polymerase initiation and elongation and mRNA accumulation, transport and decay.

    "abstract": "In many prokaryotes, type III CRISPR-Cas systems detect and degrade invasive genetic elements by an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting multisubunit interference complex that possesses dual RNase and DNase activities. The CRISPR-associated protein Csm6 additionally contributes to interference by functioning as a standalone ribonuclease that degrades invader RNA transcripts, but the mechanism linking invader sensing to Csm6 activity is not understood. Here we show that Csm6 proteins are activated through a second messenger generated by the type III interference complex. Upon target RNA binding by the type III interference complex, the Cas10 subunit converts ATP into a cyclic oligoadenylate product, which allosterically activates Csm6 by binding to its CARF domain. CARF domain mutations that abolish allosteric activation inhibit Csm6 activity in vivo, and mutations in the Cas10 Palm domain phenocopy loss of Csm6. Together, these results point to a hitherto unprecedented mechanism for regulation of CRISPR interference that bears striking conceptual similarity to oligoadenylate signalling in mammalian innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Binding of peptides to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins is a critical step in immune response. Peptides bound to MHCs are recognized by CD8+ (MHC Class I) and CD4+ (MHC Class II) T-cells. Successful prediction of which peptides will bind to specific MHC alleles would benefit many cancer immunotherapy appications. Currently, supervised machine learning is the leading computational approach to predict peptide-MHC binding, and a number of methods, trained using results of binding assays, have been published. Many clinical researchers are dissatisfied with the sensitivity and specificity of currently available methods and the limited number of alleles for which they can be applied. We evaluated several recent methods to predict peptide-MHC Class I binding affinities and a new method of our own design (MHCnuggets). We used a high-quality benchmark set of 51 alleles, which has been applied previously. The neural network methods NetMHC, NetMHCpan, MHCflurry, and MHCnuggets achieved similar best-in-class prediction performance in our testing, and of these methods MHCnuggets was significantly faster. MHCnuggets is a gated recurrent neural network, and the only method to our knowledge which can handle peptides of any length, without artificial lengthening and shortening. Seventeen alleles were problematic for all tested methods. Prediction difficulties could be explained by deficiencies in the training and testing examples in the benchmark, suggesting that biological differences in allele-specific binding properties are not as important as previously claimed. Advances in accuracy and speed of computational methods to predict peptide-MHC affinity are urgently needed. These methods will be at the core of pipelines to identify patients who will benefit from immunotherapy, based on tumor-derived somatic mutations. Machine learning methods, such as MHCnuggets, which efficiently handle peptides of any length will be increasingly important for the challenges of predicting immunogenic response for MHC Class II alleles.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMachine learning methods are a popular approach for predicting whether a peptide will bind to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins, a critical step in activation of cytotoxic T-cells. The input to these methods is a peptide sequence and an MHC allele of interest, and the output is the predicted binding affinity. MHC Class I and II proteins bind peptides of 8-11 amino acids and 16-26 amino acids respectively. This has been an obstacle for machine learning, because the methods used to date can only handle fixed-length inputs. We show that a recently developed technique known as gated recurrent neural networks can handle peptides of variable length and predict peptide-MHC binding as well or better than existing methods, at substantially faster speeds. Our results have implications for the hundreds of MHC alleles that cannot be predicted with current methods.",

Again, parents were not available for either the Capn5 nor Fblim1 CRISPR-edited mouse lines, so strain controls were examined. Additionally, we also include verification of variants detected in the initial mouse line.

This requires a conversion host that is able to both efficiently assimilate the major lignocellulose-derived carbon sources and divert their metabolites toward specific bioproducts.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, the carotenogenic yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides was examined for its ability to convert lignocellulose into two non-native sesquiterpenes with biofuel (bisabolene) and pharmaceutical (amorphadiene) applications. We found that R. toruloides can efficiently convert a mixture of glucose and xylose from hydrolyzed lignocellulose into these bioproducts, and unlike many conventional production hosts, its growth and productivity were enhanced in lignocellulosic hydrolysates relative to purified substrates. This organism was demonstrated to have superior growth in corn stover hydrolysates prepared by two different pretreatment methods, one using a novel biocompatible ionic liquid (IL) choline -ketoglutarate, which produced 261 mg/L of bisabolene at bench-scale, and the other using an alkaline pretreatment, which produced 680 mg/L of bisabolene in a high gravity fed-batch bioreactor. Interestingly, R. toruloides was also observed to assimilate p-coumaric acid liberated from acylated grass lignin in the IL hydrolysate, a finding we verified with purified substrates. R. toruloides was also able to consume several additional compounds with aromatic motifs similar to lignin monomers, suggesting that this organism may have the metabolic potential to convert depolymerized lignin streams alongside lignocellulosic sugars.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study highlights the natural compatibility of R. toruloides with bioprocess conditions relevant to lignocellulosic biorefineries and demonstrates its ability to produce non-native terpenes.",

Using genetics, cell biology, biophysics and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that unlike myosin II that responds to dilation deformation, spectrin exhibits a mechanosensitive accumulation in response to shear deformation, which is highly elevated at the fusogenic synapse. The accumulated spectrin forms an uneven network, which functions as a \\\"sieve\\\" to constrict the invasive fingerlike protrusions, thus putting the fusogenic synapse under high mechanical tension to promote cell membrane fusion. Taken together, our study has revealed a previously unrecognized function of spectrin as a dynamic mechanoresponsive protein that shapes the architecture of intercellular invasion.

    "abstract": "The combined actions of proteins in networks underlie all fundamental cellular functions. Deeper insights into the dynamics of network composition across species and their functional consequences are crucial to fully understand protein network evolution. Large-scale comparative studies with high phylogenetic resolution are now feasible through the recent rise in available genomic datasets of both model and non-model species. Here we focus on the polarity network, which is universally essential for cell proliferation and studied in great detail in the model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We examine 34 proteins, directly related to cell polarization, across 200 fungal strains/species to determine evolution of the composition of the network and patterns of conservation and diversification.\\n\\nWe observe strong protein conservation for a group of 16 core proteins: 95% of all strains/species possess at least 75% of these proteins, albeit in varying compositions. We find high levels of variation in prevalence and sequence identity in the remaining 18 proteins, resulting in distinct lineage-specific compositions of the network in the majority of strains/species. We test if the observed diversification in network composition correlates with potential underlying factors and find that lineage, lifestyle, and genetic distance co-vary with network size. Yeast, filamentous and basal unicellular fungi form distinctive groups based on these analyses, with substantial differences to their polarization network. Our study shows that evolution of the fungal polarization network is highly dynamic, even between closely related species, and that functional conservation is achieved by varying structural conservation of the fungal polarization proteins.\\n\\nData DepositionSequence alignments used are available upon request.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between herbivorous insects and their host-plants are a central component of terrestrial food webs and a critical topic in agriculture, where a substantial fraction of potential crop yield is lost annually to pests. Important insights into plant-insect interactions have come from research on specific plant defenses and insect detoxification mechanisms. Yet, much remains unknown about the molecular mechanisms that mediate plant-insect interactions. Here we use multiple genome-wide approaches to map the molecular basis of herbivory from both plant and insect perspectives, focusing on butterflies and their larval host-plants. Parallel genome-wide association studies in the Cabbage White butterfly, Pieris rapae, and its host-plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, pinpointed a small number of butterfly and plant genes that influenced herbivory. These genes, along with much of the genome, were regulated in a dynamic way over the time course of the feeding interaction. Comparative analyses, including diverse butterfly/plant systems, showed a variety of genome-wide responses to herbivory, yet a core set of highly conserved genes in butterflies as well as their host-plants. These results greatly expand our understanding of the genomic causes and evolutionary consequences of ecological interactions across two of Natures most diverse taxa, butterflies and flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSReindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is the only fully domesticated species in the Cervidae family, and is the only cervid with a circumpolar distribution. Unlike all other cervids, female reindeer regularly grow cranial appendages (antlers, the defining characteristics of cervids), as well as males. Moreover, reindeer milk contains more protein and less lactose than bovids milk. A high quality reference genome of this specie will assist efforts to elucidate these and other important features in the reindeer.\\n\\nFindingsWe obtained 723.2 Gb (Gigabase) of raw reads by an Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform, and a 2.64 Gb final assembly, representing 95.7% of the estimated genome (2.76 Gb according to k-mer analysis), including 92.6% of expected genes according to BUSCO analysis. The contig N50 and scaffold N50 sizes were 89.7 kilo base (kb) and 0.94 mega base (Mb), respectively. We annotated 21,555 protein-coding genes and 1.07 Gb of repetitive sequences by de novo and homology-based prediction. Homology-based searches detected 159 rRNA, 547 miRNA, 1,339 snRNA and 863 tRNA sequences in the genome of R. tarandus. The divergence time between R. tarandus, and ancestors of Bos taurus and Capra hircus, is estimated to be 29.55 million years ago (Mya).\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide the first high-quality reference genome for the reindeer, and a valuable resource for studying evolution, domestication and other unusual characteristics of the reindeer.",

    "abstract": "As model organism-based research shifts from forward to reverse genetics approaches, largely due to the ease of genome editing technology, allow frequency of abnormal phenotypes is being observed in lines with mutations predicted to lead to deleterious effects on the encoded protein. In zebrafish, this low frequency is in part explained by compensation by genes of redundant or similar function, often resulting from the additional round of teleost-specific whole genome duplication within vertebrates. Here we offer additional explanations for the low frequency of mutant phenotypes. We analyzed mRNA processing in seven zebrafish lines with mutations expected to disrupt gene function, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 or ENU mutagenesis methods. Five of the seven lines showed evidence of genomic compensation by means of altered mRNA processing: one through a skipped exon that did not lead to a frame shift, one through nonsense-associated splicing that did not lead to a frame shift, and three through the use of cryptic splice sites. These results highlight the need for a methodical analysis of the mRNA produced in mutant lines before making conclusions or embarking on studies that assume loss of function as a result of a given genomic change. Furthermore, recognition of the types of genomic adaptations that can occur may inform the strategies of mutant generation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe recent rise of reverse genetic, gene targeting methods has allowed researchers to readily generate mutations in any gene of interest with relative ease. Should these mutations have the predicted effect on the mRNA and encoded protein, we would expect many more abnormal phenotypes than are typically being seen in reverse genetic screens. Here we set out to explore some of the reasons for this discrepancy by studying seven separate mutations in zebrafish. We present evidence that thorough cDNA sequence analysis is a key step in assessing the likelihood that a given mutation will produce hypomorphic or null alleles. This study reveals that alternative mRNA processing in the mutant background often produces transcripts that escape nonsense-mediated decay, thereby potentially preserving gene function. By understanding the ways that cells avoid the deleterious consequences of mutations, researchers can better design reverse genetic strategies to increase the likelihood of gene disruption.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)--an aggressive form of brain cancer--are minimally effective and yield a median survival of 14.6 months and a two-year survival rate of 30%. Given the severity of GBM and the limitations of its treatment, there is a need for the discovery of novel drug targets for GBM and more personalized treatment approaches based on the characteristics of an individuals tumor. Most receptor tyrosine kinases--such as EGFR--act as oncogenes, but publicly available data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) indicates copy number loss in the ERBB4 RTK gene across dozens of GBM cell lines, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. This loss is mutually exclusive with loss of its cognate ligand NRG1 in CCLE as well, more strongly suggesting a functional role. The availability of higher resolution copy number data from clinical GBM patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that a region in Intron 1 of the ERBB4 gene was deleted in 69.1% of tumor samples harboring ERBB4 copy number loss; however, it was also found to be deleted in the matched normal tissue samples from these GBM patients (n = 81). Using the DECIPHER Genome Browser, we also discovered that this mutation occurs at approximately the same frequency in the general population as it does in the disease population. We conclude from these results that this loss in Intron 1 of the ERBB4 gene is neither a de novo driver mutation nor a predisposing factor to GBM, despite the indications from CCLE. A biological role of this significantly occurring genetic alteration is still unknown. While this is a negative result, the broader conclusion is that while copy number data from large cell line-based data repositories may yield compelling hypotheses, careful follow up with higher resolution copy number assays, patient data, and general population analyses are essential to codify initial hypotheses.",

Thus, these regions are important in maintaining GDF8 latency.

    "abstract": "Myostatin, a key regulator of muscle mass in vertebrates, is biosynthesised as a latent precursor in muscle and is activated by sequential proteolysis of the pro-domain. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which pro-myostatin remains latent, we have solved the structure of unprocessed promyostatin and analysed the properties of the protein in its different forms. Crystal structures and SAXS analyses show that pro-myostatin adopts an open, V-shaped structure with a domain-swapped arrangement. The pro-mature complex, after cleavage of the furin site, has significantly reduced activity compared with mature growth factor and persists as a stable complex that is resistant to the natural antagonist follistatin. The latency appears to be conferred by a number of distinct features that collectively stabilise the interaction of the pro-domains with the mature growth factor, enabling a regulated step-wise activation process, distinct from the prototypical pro-TGF-{beta}1. These results provide a basis for understanding the effect of missense mutations in pro-myostatin and pave the way for the design of novel myostatin inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Lipid-based particles are used worldwide in clinical trials as carriers of hydrophobic paclitaxel (PTXL) for cancer chemotherapy, albeit with little improvement over the standard-of-care. Improving efficacy requires an understanding of intramembrane interactions between PTXL and lipids to enhance PTXL solubilization and suppress PTXL phase separation into crystals. We studied the solubility of PTXL in cationic liposomes (CLs) composed of positively charged 2,3-dioleyloxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP) and neutral 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a function of PTXL membrane content and its relation to efficacy. Time-dependent kinetic phase diagrams were generated from observations of PTXL crystal formation by differential-interference-contrast microscopy. Furthermore, a new Synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering in situ methodology applied to DOTAP/DOPC/PTXL membranes condensed with DNA enabled us to detect the time-dependent depletion of PTXL from membranes by measurements of variations in the membrane interlayer and DNA interaxial spacings. Our results revealed three regimes with distinct time scales for PTXL membrane solubility: hours for > 3 mol% PTXL (low), days for {approx} 3 mol% PTXL (moderate), and [&ge;] 20 days for < 3 mol% PTXL (long-term). Cell viability experiments on human cancer cell lines using CLPTXL nanoparticles (NPs) in the distinct CLPTXL solubility regimes reveal an unexpected nonmonotonic dependence of efficacy on PTXL content in NPs delivered at short time scales (hours) after liposome hydration, where we see two distinct high-efficacy regimes at low (< 2 mol%) and high (9 mol%) drug loading. These newly identified high-efficacy regimes flank the membrane solubility limit ({approx} 3 mol%, where efficacy declines), which has been the focus of most previous physicochemical studies (and clinical trials) of PTXL-loaded CLs. At longer times scales (days), CLPTXL NPs with [&ge;] 3 mol% PTXL lose efficacy while formulations with 1-2 mol% PTXL maintain high efficacy. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the relationship of the kinetic phase behavior and physicochemical properties of CLPTXL NPs to efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Integrated analyses of regulated effector genes, cellular processes, and extrinsic signals are required to understand how transcriptional networks coordinate fate specification and cell behavior during embryogenesis. Migratory pairs of cardiac progenitors in the tunicate Ciona provide the simplest model of collective migration in chordate embryos. Ciona cardiopharyngeal progenitors (aka trunk ventral cells, TVCs) polarize as leader and trailer cells, and migrate between the ventral epidermis and trunk endoderm, which influences collective polarity. Using functional perturbations and quantitative analyses, we show that the TVC-specific and collagen-binding Discoidin-domain receptor (Ddr) cooperates with Integrin-{beta}1 to promote cell-matrix adhesion to the epidermis. We found that endoderm cells secrete a collagen, Col9-a1, that is deposited in the basal epidermal matrix and activates Ddr at the ventral membrane of migrating TVCs. A functional antagonism between Ddr/Int{beta}1-mediated cell-matrix adhesion and Vegfr signaling appears to modulate the position of cardiopharyngeal progenitors between the endoderm and epidermis. Finally, we show that Ddr activity promotes leader-trailer-polarized BMP-Smad signaling independently of its role in cell-matrix adhesion. We propose that dual functions of Ddr act downstream of cardiopharyngeal-specific transcriptional inputs to coordinate subcellular processes underlying collective polarity and directed migration.",

Members of the betaproteobacterial genera Curvibacter, Aquabacterium, and Polaromonas (Comamonadaceae) grew in most waters and represent ubiquitous, mesophilic, heterotrophic aerobes in bottled waters. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry of DOM in bottled waters and their corresponding source waters identified thousands of molecular formulae characteristic of mostly refractory, soil-derived DOM.\\n\\nConclusionsThe bottle environment, including source water physicochemistry, selected for growth of a similar low-diversity microbiota across various bottled waters. Relative abundance changes of hundreds of multi-carbon molecules were related to growth of less than ten abundant OTUs.

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of corticocortical signaling is needed to understand and model information processing in cerebral networks. However, higher-order pathways, hodologically remote from sensory input, are not amenable to spatiotemporally precise activation by sensory stimuli. Here, we combined parametric channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) photostimulation with multi-unit electrophysiology to study corticocortical driving in a parietofrontal pathway from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) to posterior secondary motor cortex (M2) in mice in vivo. Ketamine anesthesia was used both to eliminate complex activity associated with the awake state and to enable stable recordings of responses over a wide range of stimulus parameters. Photostimulation of ChR2-expressing neurons in RSC, the upstream area, produced local activity that decayed quickly. This activity in turn drove downstream activity in M2 that arrived rapidly (5-10 ms latencies), and scaled in amplitude across a wide range of stimulus parameters as an approximately constant fraction (~0.2) of the upstream activity. A model-based analysis could explain the corticocortically driven activity with exponentially decaying kernels (~20 ms time constant) and small delay. Reverse (antidromic) driving was similarly robust. The results show that corticocortical signaling in this pathway drives downstream activity rapidly and scalably, in a mostly linear manner. These properties, identified in anesthetized mice and represented in a simple model, suggest a robust basis for supporting complex non-linear dynamic activity in corticocortical circuits in the awake state.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe signaling properties of corticocortical connections are not well understood, particularly for higher-order inter-areal pathways. Here, we developed a paradigm based on parametric optogenetic photostimulation, linear-array electrophysiology, and mathematical modeling to characterize signaling along corticortical connections linking retrosplenial cortex to posterior secondary motor cortex (M2) in anesthetized mice. The results indicate that corticocortically driven activity in the downstream area followed the optogenetically evoked upstream activity in a rapid and scalable manner, and could be described with a simple linear integrator model. These findings suggest that this pathway, when activated selectively in the unconscious state, supports intrinsically linear inter-areal communication.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCardiac precursor cells (CPCs) in the first heart field (FHF) and the second heart field (SHF) present at both arterial and venous poles assemble to form a cardiac tube in zebrafish. Hippo kinase cascade is essential for proper heart formation; however, it remains elusive how Hippo signal contributes to early cardiac fate determination. We here demonstrate that mutants of large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (lats1/2) exhibited an increase in a SHF marker, Islet1 (Isl1)-positive and hand2 promoter-activated venous pole atrial cardiomyocytes (CMs) and that those showed expansion of the domain between between the anterior and the posterior lateral plate mesoderm. Consistently, TEAD-8 dependent transcription was activated in caudal region of the left ALPM cells that gave rise to the venous pole atrial CMs. Yap1/Wwtr1-promoted bmp2b expression was essential for Smad-regulated hand2 expression in the left ALPM, indicating that Hippo signaling restricts the SHF cells originating from the left ALPM that move toward the venous pole.",

    "abstract": "Gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons migrate from the developing olfactory pit into the hypothalamus during embryonic development. Migration of the GnRH-1 neurons is required for mammalian reproduction as these cells control release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary gland. Disturbances in GnRH-1 cell migration, GnRH-1 synthesis, secretion or signaling lead to varying degrees of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), which impairs pubertal onset and fertility. HH associated with congenital olfactory defects is clinically defined as Kallmann Syndrome (KS).\\n\\nThe association of olfactory defects with HH in KS suggested potential direct relationship between defective olfactory axonal routing, lack of olfactory bulbs and aberrant GnRH-1 cell migration. However, it has never been experimentally proven that the formation of axonal connections of the olfactory and vomeronasal neurons to their functional targets are necessary for the migration GnRH-1 neurons to the hypothalamus. Loss-of-function of the Arx-1 homeobox gene leads to the lack of proper formation of the olfactory bulbs with abnormal axonal termination of olfactory sensory neurons (Yoshihara et al., 2005). We exploited the Arx-1null mouse line to investigate the role of the olfactory system (olfactory/vomeronasal fibers and OBs) in controlling GnRH-1 migration to the hypothalamus. Our data proves that correct development of the OBs, and axonal connection of the olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons to the forebrain are not needed for GnRH-1 neuronal migration. Moreover, we prove that the terminal nerve, which forms the GnRH-1 migratory scaffold, follows different guidance cues and differs in its genetic expression from olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGonadotropin Releasing Hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons control the reproductive axis of vertebrates. During embryonic development, these neurons migrate from the olfactory pit to the hypothalamus. GnRH-1 cell migration is commonly believed to take place along the olfactory axons. Our work reveals that correct olfactory bulb development and targeting of the olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons to the brain are not required for this migration. Our work challenges the idea that GnRH-1 neuronal migration to the hypothalamus relies on correct routing of the olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons. We provide a new basis for interpreting genetic correlations between anosmia, lack of olfactory bulbs, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in Kallmann Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area use glutamate as a cotransmitter. To elucidate the behavioral role of the cotransmission, we targeted the glutamate-recycling enzyme glutaminase (gene GLS1). In mice with a DAT-driven conditional heterozygous (cHET) reduction of GLS1 in their dopamine neurons, dopamine neuron survival and transmission were unaffected, while glutamate cotransmission at phasic firing frequencies was reduced, enabling focusing the cotransmission. DAT GLS1 cHET mice showed normal emotional and motor behaviors, and an unaffected response to acute amphetamine. Strikingly, amphetamine sensitization was reduced and latent inhibition potentiated. These behavioral effects, also seen in global GLS1 HETs with a schizophrenia resilience phenotype, were not seen in mice with an Emx1-driven forebrain reduction affecting most brain glutamatergic neurons. Thus, a reduction in dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission appears to mediate significant components of the GLS1 HET schizophrenia resilience phenotype, and glutamate cotransmission appears to be important in attribution of motivational salience.",

    "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein expressed on microglia within the brain. Several rare mutations in TREM2 cause an early-onset form of neurodegeneration when inherited homozygously. Here we investigate how these mutations affect the intracellular transport of TREM2. We find that most pathogenic TREM2 mutant proteins fail to undergo normal maturation in the Golgi complex and show markedly reduced cell surface expression. Prior research has suggested that two such mutants are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but we find, using a cell-free COPII vesicle budding reaction, that mutant TREM2 is exported efficiently from the ER. In addition, mutant TREM2 becomes sensitive to cleavage by endoglycosidase D under conditions that inhibit recycling to the ER, indicating that it normally reaches a post-ER compartment. Maturation-defective TREM2 mutants are also efficiently bound by a lectin that recognizes O-glycans added in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and cis Golgi cisterna. Finally, mutant TREM2 accumulates in the ERGIC in cells depleted of COPI. These results indicate that efficient ER export is not sufficient to enable normal cell surface expression of TREM2. Moreover, our findings suggest that the ERGIC may play an underappreciated role as a quality-control center for mutant and/or malformed membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin (5-HT) transporter (5-HTT) regulates 5-HT availability at the synapse. Low or null 5-HTT expression results in increased 5-HT availability and has been reported to produce anxious and depressive phenotypes, although this remains highly controversial despite two decades of investigation. Paradoxically, SSRIs, which also increase 5-HT availability, reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression. An emerging  network plasticity theory of 5-HT function argues that, rather than influencing mood directly, increasing 5-HT availability enhances learning about emotionally-significant events but evidence supporting this theory is inconclusive. Here, we tested one key prediction of this theory: that increased 5-HT availability enhances aversive learning. In experiment 1, we trained 5-HTT knock-out mice (5-HTTKO), which have increased 5-HT availability, and wild-type mice (WT) on an aversive discrimination learning task in which one auditory cue was paired with an aversive outcome whereas a second auditory cue was not. Simultaneously we recorded neuronal and hemodynamic responses from the amygdala, a brain region necessary for aversive learning. 5-HTTKO mice exhibited superior discrimination learning than WTs, and had stronger theta-frequency neuronal oscillations and larger amygdala hemodynamic responses to the aversive cues, which predicted the extent of learning. In experiment 2, we found that acute SSRI treatment (in naive non-transgenic mice), given specifically before fear learning sessions, enhanced subsequent fear memory recall. Collectively, our data demonstrate that reducing 5-HTT activity (and thereby increasing 5-HT availability) enhances amygdala responsivity to aversive events and facilitates learning for emotionally-relevant cues. Our findings support the network plasticity theory of 5-HT function.",
