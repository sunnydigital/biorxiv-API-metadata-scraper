    "abstract": "BackgroundThe high-dose hook effect (also called prozone effect) refers to the observation that if a multivalent protein acts as a linker between two parts of a protein complex, then increasing the amount of linker protein in the mixture does not always increase the amount of fully formed complex. On the contrary, at a high enough concentration range the amount of fully formed complex actually decreases. It has been observed that allosterically regulated proteins seem less susceptible to this effect. The aim of this study was two-fold: First, to investigate the mathematical basis of how allostery mitigates the prozone effect. And second, to explore the consequences of allostery and the high-dose hook effect using the example of calmodulin, a calcium-sensing protein that regulates the switch between long-term potentiation and long-term depression in neurons.\\n\\nResultsWe use a combinatorial model of a \\\"perfect linker protein\\\" (with infinite binding affinity) to mathematically describe the hook effect and its behaviour under allosteric conditions. We show that allosteric regulation does indeed mitigate the high-dose hook effect. We then turn to calmodulin as a real-life example of an allosteric protein. Using kinetic simulations, we show that calmodulin is indeed subject to a hook effect. We also show that this effect is stronger in the presence of the allosteric activator Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), because it reduces the overall cooperativity of the calcium-calmodulin system. It follows that, surprisingly, there are conditions where increased amount of allosteric activator actually decrease the activity of a protein.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that cooperative binding can indeed act as a protective mechanism against the hook effect. This will have implications in vivo where the extent of cooperativity of a protein can be modulated, for instance, by allosteric activators or inhibitors. This can result in counterintuitive effects of decreased activity with increased concentrations of both the allosteric protein itself and its allosteric activators.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered as a major source of innovation in bacteria, and as such is expected to drive adaptation to new ecological niches. However, among the many genes acquired through HGT along the diversification history of genomes, only a fraction may have actively contributed to sustained ecological adaptation. We used a phylogenetic approach accounting for the transfer of genes (or groups of genes) to estimate the history of genomes in Agrobacterium biovar 1, a diverse group of soil and plant-dwelling bacterial species. We identified clade-specific blocks of co-transferred genes encoding coherent biochemical pathways that may have contributed to the evolutionary success of key Agrobacterium clades. This pattern of gene co-evolution rejects a neutral model of transfer, in which neighbouring genes would be transferred independently of their function and rather suggests purifying selection on collectively coded acquired pathways. The acquisition of these synapomorphic blocks of co-functioning genes probably drove the ecological diversification of Agrobacterium and defined features of ancestral ecological niches, which consistently hint at a strong selective role of host plant rhizospheres.",

    "abstract": "High throughput RNA sequencing technologies have provided invaluable research opportunities across distinct scientific domains by producing quantitative readouts of the transcriptional activity of both entire cellular populations and single cells. The majority of RNA-Seq analyses begin by mapping each experimentally produced sequence (i.e., read) to a set of annotated reference sequences for the organism of interest. For both biological and technical reasons, a significant fraction of reads remains unmapped. In this work, we develop Read Origin Protocol (ROP) to discover the source of all reads originating from complex RNA molecules, recombinant T and B cell receptors, and microbial communities. We applied ROP to 8,641 samples across 630 individuals from 54 tissues. A fraction of RNA-Seq data (n=86) was obtained in-house; the remaining data was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v6) project. To generalize the reported number of accounted reads, we also performed ROP analysis on thousands of different, randomly selected, and publicly available RNA-Seq samples in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Our approach can account for 99.9% of 1 trillion reads of various read length across the merged dataset (n=10641). Using in-house RNA-Seq data, we show that immune profiles of asthmatic individuals are significantly different from the profiles of control individuals, with decreased average per sample T and B cell receptor diversity. We also show that immune diversity is inversely correlated with microbial load. Our results demonstrate the potential of ROP to exploit unmapped reads in order to better understand the functional mechanisms underlying connections between the immune system, microbiome, human gene expression, and disease etiology. ROP is freely available at https://github.com/smangul1/rop and currently supports human and mouse RNA-Seq reads.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic processes in eukaryotic cells depend on interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear gene products (mitonuclear interactions). These interactions could play a direct role in population divergence. We studied the evolution of mitonuclear interactions in a widespread passerine that experienced population divergence followed by bi-directional mitochondrial introgression into different nuclear backgrounds. Using >60,000 SNPs, we quantified patterns of nuclear genetic differentiation between populations that occupy different climates and harbour deeply divergent mitolineages despite ongoing nuclear gene flow. Analyses were performed independently for two sampling transects intersecting mitochondrial divergence in different nuclear backgrounds. In both transects, low genome-wide nuclear differentiation was accompanied by strong differentiation at a ~15.4 Mb region of chromosome 1A. This region is enriched for genes performing mitochondrial functions. Molecular signatures of selective sweeps in this region alongside those in the mitochondrial genome suggest a history of adaptive mitonuclear co-introgression. The chromosome 1A region has elevated linkage disequilibrium, suggesting that selection on genomic architecture may favour low recombination among nuclear-encoded genes with mitochondrial functions. In this system, mitonuclear interactions appear to maintain the geographic separation of two mitolineages in the face of nuclear gene flow, supporting mitonuclear co-evolution as an important vehicle for climatic adaptation and population divergence.",

    "abstract": "Marine regions that have seasonal to long-term low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, sometimes called  dead zones, are increasing in number and severity around the globe with deleterious effects on ecology and economics. One of the largest of these coastal dead zones occurs on the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), which results from eutrophication-enhanced bacterioplankton respiration and strong seasonal stratification. Previous research in this dead zone revealed the presence of multiple cosmopolitan bacterioplankton lineages that have eluded cultivation, and thus their metabolic roles in this ecosystem remain unknown. We used a coupled shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to determine the metabolic potential of Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, SAR406, and SAR202. We recovered multiple high-quality, nearly complete genomes from all three groups as well as those belonging to Candidate Phyla usually associated with anoxic environments-Parcubacteria (OD1) and Peregrinibacteria. Two additional groups with putative assignments to ACD39 and PAUC34f supplement the metabolic contributions by uncultivated taxa. Our results indicate active metabolism in all groups, including prevalent aerobic respiration, with concurrent expression of genes for nitrate reduction in SAR406 and SAR202, and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia and sulfur reduction by SAR406. We also report a variety of active heterotrophic carbon processing mechanisms, including degradation of complex carbohydrate compounds by SAR406, SAR202, ACD39, and PAUC34f. Together, these data help constrain the metabolic contributions from uncultivated groups in the nGOM during periods of low DO and suggest roles for these organisms in the breakdown of complex organic matter.\\n\\nImportanceDead zones receive their name primarily from the reduction of eukaryotic macrobiota (demersal fish, shrimp, etc.) that are also key coastal fisheries. Excess nutrients contributed from anthropogenic activity such as fertilizer runoff result in algal blooms and therefore ample new carbon for aerobic microbial metabolism. Combined with strong stratification, microbial respiration reduces oxygen in shelf bottom waters to levels unfit for many animals (termed hypoxia). The nGOM shelf remains one of the largest eutrophication-driven hypoxic zones in the world, yet despite its potential as a model study system, the microbial metabolisms underlying and resulting from this phenomenon--many of which occur in bacterioplankton from poorly understood lineages--have received only preliminary study. Our work details the metabolic potential and gene expression activity for uncultivated lineages across several low DO sites in the nGOM, improving our understanding of the active biogeochemical cycling mediated by these \\\"microbial dark matter\\\" taxa during hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "In metagenome analysis, computational methods for assembly, taxonomic profiling and binning are key components facilitating downstream biological data interpretation. However, a lack of consensus about benchmarking datasets and evaluation metrics complicates proper performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their programs on datasets of unprecedented complexity and realism. Benchmark metagenomes were generated from ~700 newly sequenced microorganisms and ~600 novel viruses and plasmids, including genomes with varying degrees of relatedness to each other and to publicly available ones and representing common experimental setups. Across all datasets, assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes, while performance was substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below the family level. Parameter settings substantially impacted performances, underscoring the importance of program reproducibility. While highlighting current challenges in computational metagenomics, the CAMI results provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.",

    "abstract": "Numerous brain lesion and fMRI studies have linked individual differences in executive abilities and fluid intelligence to brain regions of the fronto-parietal \"multiple-demand\" (MD) network. Yet, fMRI studies have yielded conflicting evidence as to whether better executive abilities are associated with stronger or weaker MD activations and whether this relationship is restricted to the MD network. Here, in a large-sample (n=216) fMRI investigation, we found that stronger activity in MD regions - functionally defined in individual participants - was robustly associated with more accurate and faster responses on a spatial working memory task performed in the scanner, as well as fluid intelligence measured independently (n=114). In line with some prior claims about a relationship between language and fluid intelligence, we also found a weak association between activity in the brain regions of the left fronto-temporal language network during an independent passive reading task, and performance on the working memory task. However, controlling for the level of MD activity abolished this relationship, whereas the MD activity-behavior association remained highly reliable after controlling for the level of activity in the language network. Finally, we demonstrate how unreliable MD activity measures, coupled with small sample sizes, could falsely lead to the opposite, negative, association that has been reported in some prior studies. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a core component of individual differences variance in executive abilities and fluid intelligence is selectively and robustly positively associated with the level of activity in the MD network, a result that aligns well with lesion studies.",

Here we show that when cellular states are described using a Boolean network model, one can exactly simulate the dynamics of non-interacting, highly heterogeneous populations directly, without having to model the various subpopulations. This strategy captures even the rarest outcomes of the model with no sampling error. Our method can incorporate heterogeneity in both cell state and, by augmenting the model, the underlying rules of the network as well (i.e. mutations).

We demonstrate long-term imaging of synaptic vesicle dynamics in cultured neurons as well as in intact zebrafish. We found axon initial segment utilizes a  waterfall mechanism gating synaptic vesicle transport polarity by promoting anterograde transport processivity. Long-time observation also reveals that transcription factor hops between clustered binding sites in spatially-restricted sub-nuclear regions, suggesting that topological structures in the nucleus shape local gene activities by a sequestering mechanism. This strategy thus greatly expands the spatiotemporal length scales of live-cell single-molecule measurements, enabling new experiments to quantitatively understand complex control of molecular dynamics in vivo.",

The central problem is that it affects patients suffering from AIDS, cystic fibrosis, cancer, burn victims etc. P. aeruginosa creates and inhabits surface-associated biofilms. Biofilms increase resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses, because of those current treatments are not effective. It is imperative to find new antibacterial treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa, but detailed molecular properties of the LasR protein are not clearly known to date. In the present study, we tried to analyse the molecular properties of the LasR protein as well as the mode of its interactions with autoinducer (AI) the N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3-0-C12-HSL).\\n\\nResultsWe performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the LasR protein of P. aeruginosa with the 3-0-C12-HSL ligand.

Using live-imaging and perturbation experiments we show that leaf orientation, morphology and position are pre-patterned by HD-ZIPIII and KAN gene expression in the shoot, leading to a model in which dorsoventral genes coordinate to regulate plant development by localizing auxin response between their expression domains. However we also find that auxin levels feedback on dorsoventral patterning by spatially organizing HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression in the shoot periphery.

    "abstract": "Across the animal kingdom, environmental light cues are widely involved in regulating gamete release, but the molecular and cellular bases of the photoresponsive mechanisms are poorly understood. In hydrozoan jellyfish, spawning is triggered by dark-light or light-dark transitions acting on the gonad, and is mediated by oocyte maturation-inducing neuropeptide hormones (MIHs) released from the ectoderm. We determined in Clytia hemisphaerica that blue-cyan light triggers spawning in isolated gonads. A candidate opsin (Opsin9) was found co-expressed with MIH within specialised ectodermal cells. Opsin9 knockout jellyfish generated by CRISPR/Cas9 failed to undergo oocyte maturation and spawning, a phenotype reversible by synthetic MIH. Gamete maturation and release in Clytia is thus regulated by gonadal photosensory-neurosecretory cells that secrete MIH in response to light via Opsin9. Similar cells in ancestral eumetazoans may have allowed tissue-level photo-regulation of diverse behaviours, a feature elaborated in cnidarians in parallel with expansion of the opsin gene family.",

We have found that colonic cells isolated from stool samples (SCSR-010 Fecal Cell Isolation Kit, NonInvasive Technologies, Elkridge, MD), preserved at room temperature for up to one week, with viability of >85% and low levels of apoptosis (8% - 10%) exhibit two distinct cell size subpopulations, in the 2.5M- 5.0 M and 5.0M-8.0M range. In addition to IgA, about 60% of the cells expressed a novel heterodimeric IgA/IgG immunoglobulin that conferred a broad-spectrum cell mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells. In a cohort of 58 subjects the exclusive absence of this immunoglobulin in two African-Americans was suggestive of a germline deletion. Serial cultures in stem cell medium retained the expression of this heterodimer. Since a majority of the cystic cells expressed the stem cell markers Lgr5 and Musashi-1 we termed these cells as gastrointestinal progenitor stem cells (GIP-C**). CXCR-4, the cytokine co-receptor for HIV was markedly expressed. These cells also expressed CD20, IgA, IgG, CD45, and COX-2. We assume that they originated from mature columnar epithelium by dedifferentiation. Our observations indicate that we have a robust noninvasive method to study mucosal pathophysiology and a direct method to create a database for applications in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers must be properly patterned to ensure accurate disjunction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. Disruption of the spatial distribution of crossovers can lead to nondisjunction, aneuploidy, gamete dysfunction, miscarriage, or birth defects. One of the earliest identified genes in involved proper crossover patterning is textitDrosophila mei-41, which encodes the ortholog of the checkpoint kinase ATR. Analysis of hypomorphic mutants suggested the existence of crossover patterning defects, but it was not possible to assess this in null mutants because of maternal-effect embryonic lethality. To overcome this lethality, we constructed mei-41 null mutants in which we expressed wild-type Mei-41 in the germline after completion of meiotic recombination, allowing progeny to survive. We find that crossovers are decreased to about one third of wild-type levels, but the reduction is not uniform, being less severe in the proximal regions of 2L than in medial or distal 2L or on the X chromosome. None of the crossovers formed in the absence of Mei-41 require Mei-9, the presumptive meiotic resolvase, suggesting that Mei-41 functions everywhere, despite the differential effects on crossover frequency. Interference appears to be significantly reduced or absent in mei-41 mutants, but the reduction in crossover density in centromere-proximal regions is largely intact. We propose that crossover patterning is achieved in a stepwise manner, with the crossover suppression related to proximity to the centromere occurring prior to and independently of crossover designation and enforcement of interference. In this model, Mei-41 has an essential after the centromere effect is established but before crossover designation and interference occur.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage lambda makes a decision between lysis and lysogeny based on the number of coinfecting phages, namely the multiplicity of infection (MoI): lysis at low MoIs; lysogeny at high MoIs. Here, by evaluating various rationally designed models on their ability a) to make the lytic decision at MoI of 1 and the lysogeny decision at MoI of 2, b) to exhibit bistability at both MoIs, and c) to perform accurately in the presence of noise, it is demonstrated that lambdas lysis/lysogeny decision is based on three features, namely a) mutual repression, b) cooperative positive autoregulation of CI, and c) cooperative binding of the activator protein, not basal expression, triggering positive autoregulatory loop of CI. Cro and CI are sufficient to acquire the first two features. CII is required to acquire the third feature. The quasi-minimal two-protein model for the switch is justified by showing its qualitative equivalence, except for Cro repression of pRM, to the lambdas gene regulatory network responsible for the decision. A three-protein simplified version of the lambdas switch is shown to possess all the three design features. Bistability at MoI of 1 is responsible for lysogen stability, whereas bistability at MoI of 2 imparts stability to lytic development post-infection and especially during prophage induction.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated activity of muscles is produced in part by spinal rhythmogenic neural circuits, termed central pattern generators (CPGs). A classical CPG model, proposed conceptually by T.G. Brown in 1911, is a system of coupled oscillators that transform locomotor drive into coordinated and gait-specific patterns of muscle recruitment. A system of ordinary differential equations with a physiologically-inspired coupling locus of interactions captures the timing relationship for bilateral coordination of limbs in locomotion and is typically solved numerically. Consequently, it is intriguing to have a full analytical description of this plausible CPG architecture to illuminate the functionality within this structure. Here, we provided a closed-form analytical solution contrasted against the previous numerical method. The computational load of the analytical solution was decreased by an order of magnitude when compared to the numerical approach (relative errors, <0.01%). The analytical solution tested and supported the previous finding that the input to the model can be expressed in units of the desired limb locomotor speed. Furthermore, we performed parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of controlling asymmetric locomotion and documented two possible mechanisms associated with either an external drive or intrinsic CPG parameters. The results support the idea that many different combinations of network states, even within the same anatomical CPG structure, may generate the same behavioral outcomes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUsing a simple process of leaky integration, we developed an analytical solution to a robust model of spinal pattern generation. We analyzed the ability of this neural element to exert locomotor control of the signal associated with limb speeds, which represent high-level modality within the motor system. Furthermore, we tested the ability of this simple structure to embed steering control using the velocity signal in the models inputs or within the internal connectivity of its elements. Both mechanisms can produce the same behavioral outcome, pointing to the methodological challenges of modeling central pattern generators and demonstrating the possibility of spinal circuit adaptations to asymmetric short- or long-term conditions in health and disease.",

Recent behavioral results suggest theta-band oscillations contribute to this prediction process, however litter is known about the underlying neural mechanism. Here, we combine fMRI and a time-resolved psychophysical paradigm to access fine temporal-scale profiles of the fluctuations of brain activation patterns corresponding to visual object priming. Specifically, multi-voxel activity patterns in the fusiform face area (FFA) and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) show temporal fluctuations at a theta-band (~5 Hz) rhythm. Importantly, the theta-band power in the FFA negatively correlates with reaction time, further indicating the critical role of the observed cortical theta oscillations. Moreover, alpha-band (~10 Hz) shows a dissociated spatial distribution, mainly linked to the occipital cortex. These findings, to our knowledge, are the first fMRI study that indicates temporal fluctuations of multi-voxel activity patterns and that demonstrates theta and alpha rhythms in relevant brain areas.",

For example, in heart muscle, CaMKII regulates Ca2+ homeostasis while in neurons CaMKII regulates activity-dependent dendritic remodeling and Long Term Potentiation (LTP), a biological correlate of learning and memory. Previously, we identified the noncanonical GTPase Rem2 as a critical regulator of dendrite branching and synapse formation in the vertebrate nervous system. Here, we report that Rem2 directly interacts with CaMKII and potently inhibits the activity of the intact holoenzyme, a previously undescribed function for the Rem2 protein. To date, only one other endogenous inhibitor of CaMKII has been described: CaMKIIN, which blocks CaMKII activity through binding to the catalytic domain. Our data suggest that Rem2 inhibits CaMKII through a novel mechanism, as inhibition requires the presence of the association domain of CaMKII. Our biochemical finding that Rem2 is a direct, endogenous inhibitor of CaMKII activity, coupled with known functions of Rem2 in neurons, provides a framework which will enable future experiments probing the physiological role of CaMKII inhibition in a cellular context.",

    "abstract": "Cancer gene therapy is a great promising tool for cancer therapeutics due to the specific targeting based on the cancerous gene expression background. Binary systems based on site-specific recombination are one of the most effective potential approaches for cancer gene therapy. In these systems, a cancer specific promoter expresses a site-specific recombinase/integrase that in turn controls the expression of a toxin gene. In the current study, we have developed a new HK022 bacteriophage Integrase (Int) based binary system activating a Diphtheria toxin (DTA) gene expression specifically in cancer cells. We have demonstrated the efficiency, and the high specificity of the system in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in a lung cancer mouse model. Strikingly, different apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors demonstrated a remarkable efficacy killing capability of the Int-based binary system compared to the conventional hTERT-DTA mono system in the LLC-Kat lung cancer mice model; we observed that the active hTERT promoter down regulation by the transcription factors Mad-1 is the cornerstone of this phenomenon. The new Int-based binary system offers advantages over already known counterparts and may therefore be developed into a safer and efficient cancer treatment technology.",

    "abstract": "Gene fusions are an important class of cancer-driving events with therapeutic and diagnostic values, yet their underlying genetic mechanisms have not been systematically characterized. Here by combining RNA and whole genome DNA sequencing data from 1188 donors across 27 cancer types we obtained a list of 3297 high-confidence tumour-specific gene fusions, 82% of which had structural variant (SV) support and 2372 of which were novel. Such a large collection of RNA and DNA alterations provides the first opportunity to systematically classify the gene fusions at a mechanistic level. While many could be explained by single SVs, numerous fusions involved series of structural rearrangements and thus are composite fusions. We discovered 75 fusions of a novel class of inter-chromosomal composite fusions, termed bridged fusions, in which a third genomic location bridged two different genes. In addition, we identified 522 fusions involving non-coding genes and 157 ORF-retaining fusions, in which the complete open reading frame of one gene was fused to the UTR region of another. Although only a small proportion (5%) of the discovered fusions were recurrent, we found a set of highly recurrent fusion partner genes, which exhibited strong 5 or 3 bias and were significantly enriched for cancer genes. Our findings broaden the view of the gene fusion landscape and reveal the general properties of genetic alterations underlying gene fusions for the first time.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genetic variability of the artemisinin resistance (AR) molecular marker kelch13 has been extensively investigated in Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites from symptomatic infections in South East (SE) Asia where AR is highly prevalent, as well as in Africa where evidence of AR has emerged only recently. However, molecular surveillance and risk of transmission of AR also require monitoring asymptomatic infection. Here, molecular analyses were used to investigate polymorphisms in kelch13 and their potential for transmission in asymptomatic adults in Bolifamba, Cameroon in Central Africa.\\n\\nMethodsUsing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we amplified and sequenced the full length of kelch13 from P. falciparum infections detected in the blood of 33 asymptomatic adults (age: 18-55 years-old) collected in a cross-sectional study from July 2008 to October 2009. Risk of increased transmission was assessed by quantifying gametocytes by qPCR. Quantitative ELISA was used to detect plasma levels of PfHRP2 to establish total parasite burdens associated with asymptomatic infection.\\n\\nResultsOut of 33 isolates tested, 14 (42.4%) presented at least a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in kelch13. Five non-synonymous SNPs were detected (K189T/N, N217H, R393K and E433K). None were located in the beta-propeller domain, where AR mutations have been detected in both SE Asian and, more recently, African parasites. K189T/N and N217H have been previously reported in African strains, but R393K and E433K are new polymorphisms. Gametocytes were detected in 24.2% of infections, without a significant association with detected Kelch13 polymorphisms. Notably, polymorphisms detected in kelch13 were associated with a significant increase of PfHRP2 plasma levels.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides the baseline prevalence of kelch13 polymorphisms in asymptomatic infection for molecular surveillance in tracking AR, and suggests the need for additional studies to explore the association of kelch13 polymorphisms with P. falciparum burden independent of AR, in this region of Cameroon.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which could be alleviated by rapid diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic administration. However, currently available laboratory tests for sepsis diagnosis lacks sensitivity and specificity; they also have long turn-around times. In this proof-of-concept study, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was used as a biological sensor to detect urine of sepsis patients in an assay designated as the C. elegans Sepsis Detection Assay (CESDA). From January to June 2016, 45 patients who were admitted to the Emergency Department of a university hospital due to suspected sepsis were included into the study. Urine samples were obtained from these patients and healthy controls and spotted onto CESDA assay plates. Subsequently, C. elegans were aliquoted onto the centre of the plates and allowed to migrate freely. Number of worms found in either spots or quadrants of the plates containing control or suspected sepsis samples were scored in 10 minute intervals in a 60-minute duration. The CESDA index was then calculated for each sample, where an index near +1 represented attraction of the worms towards the sample, while an index near -1 signified repulsion. Confirmatory diagnosis for suspected sepsis samples was determined using a combination of clinical criteria assessment and standard laboratory protocols. All patients who were positive for sepsis were found to have a CESDA index of > 0.1 (positive predictive value, PPV [&ge;]87%). In addition, the worms were able to differentiate urine of sepsis patients from control as early as 20 minutes (p=0.012). Interestingly, the assay was also able to identify infection within 40 minutes of the test (AUROC = 0.80, p= 0.016). The rapidity of CESDA in sepsis and infection identification as well as the usability of urine samples which are non-invasive towards the patient in this method makes it an interesting protocol to be further explored for sepsis diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Localizing touch relies on the activation of skin-based and externally defined spatial frames of references. Psychophysical studies have demonstrated that early visual deprivation prevents the automatic remapping of touch into external space. We used fMRI to characterize how visual experience impacts on the brain circuits dedicated to the spatial processing of touch. Sighted and congenitally blind humans (male and female) performed a tactile temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, either with the hands uncrossed or crossed over the body midline. Behavioral data confirmed that crossing the hands has a detrimental effect on TOJ judgments in sighted but not in blind. Crucially, the crossed hand posture elicited more activity in a fronto-parietal network in the sighted group only. Psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that the congenitally blind showed enhanced functional connectivity between parietal and frontal regions in the crossed versus uncrossed hand postures. Our results demonstrate that visual experience scaffolds the neural implementation of touch perception.\\n\\nSignificance statementAlthough we seamlessly localize tactile events in our daily life, it is not a trivial operation because the hands move constantly within the peripersonal space. To process touch correctly, the brain has therefore to take the current position of the limbs into account and remap them to their location in the external world. In sighted, parietal and premotor areas support this process. However, while visual experience has been suggested to support the implementation of the automatic external remapping of touch, no studies so far have investigated how early visual deprivation alters the brain network supporting touch localization. Examining this question is therefore crucial to conclusively determine the intrinsic role vision plays in scaffolding the neural implementation of touch perception.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that determine drug sensitivity of distinct cancer types is poorly understood for most cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this study, we elucidated a new resistance mechanism to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic through modulation of p53 dynamics. While both sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines activated similar p53 oscillation followed by cell-cycle arrest in response to low dose of DNA damaging drug, they switched in a bimodal manner to monotonic or single pulse dynamics at high drug dose. Cell lines with monotonically increasing p53 underwent rapid and extensive drug-induced apoptosis, while those exhibiting a single p53 pulse mostly survived. By combining single cell imaging with computational modeling, we characterized a regulatory module involving ATM, p53, Mdm2 and Wip1, which generates bimodal p53 dynamics through coupled feed-forward and feedback, and we found that basal expression of ATM determined the differential modular output between drug sensitive and resistant lines. Moreover, we showed combinatorial inhibition of Mdm2 and Wip1 was an effective strategy to alter p53 dynamics in resistant cancer cells and sensitize their apoptotic response. Our results point to p53 pulsing as a potentially druggable mechanism that mediates resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy.",

We applied a systems-pharmacology approach by integrating network-based analyses with multiple bioinformatic resources to design a drug combination regimen reversing EMT phenotype in aggressive cancers. We observed that histone deacetylases were critical targets to tune expression of multiple epithelial versus mesenchymal genes. Moreover, SRC and IKBK were the principal intracellular kinases regulating multiple signaling pathways. To validate the anti-EMT efficacy of the target combinations, we inhibited the pinpointed proteins with already prescribed drugs and observed that whereas low dose mono-therapy failed to limit cell dispersion from collagen spheroids in a microfluidic device as a metric of EMT, the combination fully inhibited dissociation and invasion of cancer cells toward co-cultured endothelial cells. Given the approval status and safety profiles of the suggested drugs, the proposed combination set can be considered in clinical trials.",

We then used a virtual reality (VR) headset as well as a standard 3D display to test these predictions in both traditional psychophysical and more naturalistic settings. We found evidence that people make many of the predicted errors, including a lateral bias in the perception of motion trajectories, a dependency of this bias on stimulus contrast, viewing distance, and eccentricity, and a surprising tendency to misreport approaching motion as receding and vice versa.

    "abstract": "1 AbstractBayesian multiple regression methods are widely used in whole-genome analyses to solve the problem that the number p of marker covariates is usually larger than the number n of observations. Inferences from most Bayesian methods are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, where statistics are computed from a Markov chain constructed to have a stationary distribution equal to the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters. In practice, chains of about fifty thousand steps are typically used in whole-genome Bayesian regression analyses, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we have shown how the sampling of marker effects can be made independent within each step of the chain. This is done by augmenting the marker covariate matrix by adding p new rows to it such that columns of the augmented marker covariate matrix are orthogonal. The phenotypes corresponding to the augmented rows of marker covariate matrix are considered missing. Ideally, the computations at each step of the MCMC chain, can be speeded up by the number k of computer processors up to the number p of markers. Addressing the heavy computational burden associated with Bayesian methods by parallel computing will lead to greater use of these methods.",

    "abstract": "SummaryGenomic sequences are assembled into a variable, but large number of contigs that should be scaffolded (ordered and oriented) for facilitating comparative or functional analysis. Finding scaffolding is computationally challenging due to misassemblies, inconsistent coverage across the genome, and long repeats. An accurate assessment of scaffolding tools should take into account multiple locations of the same contig on the reference scaffolding rather than matching a repeat to a single best location. This makes mapping of inferred scaffoldings onto the reference a computationally challenging problem. This paper formulates the repeat-aware scaffolding evaluation problem which is to find a mapping of the inferred scaffolding onto the reference maximizing number of correct links and proposes a scalable algorithm capable of handling large whole-genome datasets. Our novel scaffolding validation pipeline has been applied to assess the most of state-of-the-art scaffolding tools on the representative subset of GAGE datasets.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe source code of this evaluation framework is available at https://github.com/mandricigor/repeat-aware.

    "abstract": "Spatial heterogeneity is believed to be an evolutionary driver of biodiversity. Variability in the distribution of resource patches can allow an environment to support a wider variety of phenotypes for selection to act upon at the ecosystem level, which may lead to more species. However, the generality of this principle has not been thoroughly tested, as the relevant adaptive dynamics occur on evolutionary timescales. We overcame this challenge by performing experiments on populations of digital organisms in the Avida Digital Evolution Platform, in which we investigated the impact of spatial resource heterogeneity on phenotypic diversity. Since an important benefit of diversity may be increased evolutionary potential, we also tracked the probability of a complex trait evolving in the context of various levels of spatial heterogeneity. We found that spatial entropy and phenotypic diversity have a strong positive correlation and this relationship is consistent across various spatial configurations. Diversity also increases evolutionary potential, but has a much smaller impact than other components of environmental composition. The most important of these components was the mean number of resources present in locations across the environment, likely owing to the importance of building blocks for the evolution of complex features. These results suggest that a general relationship exists between spatial heterogeneity and diversity, beyond the specific ecosystems and timescales in which it has previously been studied. By examining this relationship in the context of phenotypic evolution, we advance a mechanistic understanding of the resulting dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that the likelihood of evolving various traits can be impacted by the spatial configuration of patches in which these traits are advantageous. These findings have implications for both evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation, as generating and maintaining diversity is critical to all forms of evolution.",

DNA profilling revealed a little genetic but much epigenetic differences among S0, S1 and S2 generations. Genetic alteration was relatively stable, because only 8.09% and 3.21% alleles inheriated from ACC were changed in S2 and S1, respectively. While on average of 52.44 {+/-} 5.32% DNA methylation site inherited from ACC were detected in S1, and 41.52 {+/-} 9.04% in S2 due to dramatic epigenetic variance among early generations. New DNA methylation sites occurred in S0 would inheritated into the successive generations, but the frequency was decreased because some new site might be recovered. It demonstrated that much DNA methylation but a little DNA sequence variance was occurred in hexaploid early generation.",

In this study, we identified eight NF-Y encoding genes, including OsNF-YA8, OsNF-YB1,9, and OsNF-YC8,9,10,11,12, which predominantly express in the rice endosperm. Interestingly, the closest homologs of these OsNF-Ys are present only in the monocot species. All the genes are preferentially expressed in the endosperm, suggesting their roles in the regulation of endosperm development. A systemic analysis of the interactions between rice endosperm-preferential NF-Ys in yeast revealed that NF-YBs and NF-YCs could interact with each other. OsNF-YA8 is a recently evolved NF-YA in rice. Generally, NF-YA does not interact with NF-YB monomers in plants; however, in the present study, we found that OsNY-YA8 interacts with OsNF-YB9. Our results also indicated that the endosperm-preferential OsNF-YBs and OsNF-YCs could interact with some ethylene response factors (ERFs) of rice. Unlike the OsNF-YC8,9,10, the members of OsNF-YB1, 9 or OsNF-YC 11 and 12 showed lack of transcriptional activation when present alone. However, they displayed functional activity while in dimer form. In addition, OsNF-YB1 knockout lines showed significant changes in the seed morphology, further confirms its role in endosperm development.

However, the amygdala also responds more to fear with direct gaze during longer exposures. Here we examined previously unexplored brain oscillatory responses to characterize the neurodynamics and connectivity during brief ([~]250 ms) and longer ([~]883 ms) exposures of fearful faces with direct or averted eye gaze. We replicated the exposure time by gaze direction interaction in fMRI (N=23), and observed greater early phase locking to averted-gaze fear (congruent threat signal) with MEG (N=60) in a network of face processing regions, with both brief and longer exposures. Phase locking to direct-gaze fear (incongruent threat signal) then increased significantly for brief exposures at [~]350 ms, and at [~]700 ms for longer exposures. Our results characterize the stages of congruent and incongruent facial threat signal processing and show that stimulus exposure strongly affects the onset and duration of these stages.",

Hence we devised a computational approach to predict DSBs using the epigenomic and chromatin context, for which public data are available from the ENCODE project. We achieved excellent prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.97) at high resolution (< 1 kb), and showed that only chromatin accessibility and H3K4me1 mark were sufficient for highly accurate prediction (AUC = 0.95). We also demonstrated the better sensitivity of DSB predictions compared to BLESS experiments. We identified chromatin accessibility, activity and long-range contacts as best predictors.

Monitoring of environmental media (e.g., wastewater, agricultural waste, food, and water) is of particular interest as these media can serve as sources of potential novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as hot spots for ARG exchange, and as pathways for the spread of ARGs and human exposure. Next-generation sequence-based monitoring has recently enabled direct access and profiling of the total metagenomic DNA pool, where ARGs are identified or predicted based on the \\\"best hits\\\" of homology searches against existing databases. Unfortunately, this approach tends to produce high rates of false negatives. To address such limitations, we propose here a deep leaning approach, taking into account a dissimilarity matrix created using all known categories of ARGs. Two models, deepARG-SS and deepARG-LS, were constructed for short read sequences and full gene length sequences, respectively. Performance evaluation of the deep learning models over 30 classes of antibiotics demonstrates that the deepARG models can predict ARGs with both high precision (>0.97) and recall (>0.90) for most of the antibiotic resistance categories. The models show advantage over the traditional best hit approach by having consistently much lower false negative rates and thus higher overall recall (>0.9). As more data become available for under-represented antibiotic resistance categories, the deepARG models performance can be expected to be further enhanced due to the nature of the underlying neural networks. The deepARG models are available both in command line version and via a Web server at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/deeparg. Our newly developed ARG database, deepARG-DB, containing predicted ARGs with high confidence and high degree of manual curation, greatly expands the current ARG repository. DeepARG-DB can be downloaded freely to benefit community research and future development of antibiotic resistance-related resources.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the methods for reconstruction of cancer evolutionary trajectories opened up the prospects of deciphering the subclonal populations and their evolutionary architectures within cancer ecosystems. An important challenge of the cancer evolution studies is how to connect genetic aberrations in subclones to a clinically interpretable and actionable target in the subclones for individual patients. In this study, our aim is to develop a novel method for constructing a model of tumor subclonal progression in terms of cancer hallmark acquisition using multiregional sequencing data. We prepare a subclonal evolutionary tree inferred from variant allele frequencies and estimate pathway alteration probabilities from large-scale cohort genomic data. We then construct an evolutionary tree of pathway alterations that takes into account selectivity of pathway alterations via selectivity score. We show the effectiveness of our method on a dataset of clear cell renal cell carcinomas.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid zones are a valuable tool for studying the process of speciation and for identifying the genomic regions undergoing divergence and the ecological (extrinsic) and non-ecological (intrinsic) factors involved. Here, we explored the genomic and geographic landscape of divergence in a hybrid zone between Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis. Using a genome scan of 28,417 ddRAD SNPs, we identified genomic regions under possible selection and examined their distribution in the context of previously identified candidate genes for ecological adaptations. We showed that differentiation was genome-wide, including multiple candidate genes for ecological adaptations, particularly those involved in seasonal adaptation and host plant detoxification. The Z-chromosome and four autosomes showed a disproportionate amount of differentiation, suggesting genes on these chromosomes play a potential role in reproductive isolation. Cline analyses of significantly differentiated genomic SNPs, and of species diagnostic genetic markers, showed a high degree of geographic coincidence (81%) and concordance (80%) and were associated with the geographic distribution of a climate-mediated developmental threshold (length of the growing season). A relatively large proportion (1.3%) of the outliers for divergent selection were not associated with candidate genes for ecological adaptations and may reflect the presence of previously unrecognized intrinsic barriers between these species. These results suggest that exogenous (climate-mediated) and endogenous (unknown) clines may have become coupled and act together to reinforce reproductive isolation. This approach of assessing divergence across both the genomic and geographic landscape can provide insight about the interplay between the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and endogenous and exogenous selection.",

    "abstract": "Many components of host-parasite interactions have been shown to affect the way virulence (i.e., parasite-induced harm to the host) evolves. However, coevolution of multiple parasite traits is often neglected. We explore how an immunosuppressive mechanism of parasites affects and co-evolves with virulence through multiple infections. Applying the adaptive dynamics framework to epidemiological models with coinfection, we show that immunosuppression is a double-edged-sword for the evolution of virulence. On one hand, it amplifies the adaptive benefit of virulence by increasing the abundance of coinfections through epidemiological feedbacks. On the other hand, immunosuppression hinders host recovery, prolonging the duration of infection and elevating the cost of killing the host. The balance between the cost and benefit of immunosuppression varies across different background mortality rates of hosts. In addition, we find that immunosuppression evolution is influenced considerably by the precise trade-off shape determining the effect of immunosuppression on host recovery and susceptibility to further infection. These results demonstrate that the evolution of virulence is shaped by immunosuppression while highlighting that the evolution of immune evasion mechanisms deserves further research attention.",

    "abstract": "Species tree estimation from loci sampled from multiple genomes is now common, but is challenged by the heterogeneity across the genome due to multiple processes, such as gene duplication and loss, horizontal gene transfer, and incomplete lineage sorting. Although methods for estimating species trees have been developed that address gene tree heterogeneity due to incomplete lineage sorting, many of these methods operate by combining estimated gene trees and are hence vulnerable to gene tree quality. There is also the added concern that missing data, which is frequently encountered in genome-scale datasets, will impact species tree estimation.\\n\\nOur study addresses the impact of gene filtering on species trees inferred from multi-gene datasets. We address these questions using a large and heterogeneous collection of simulated datasets both with and without missing data. We compare several established coalescent-based methods (ASTRAL, ASTRID, MP-EST, and SVDquartets within PAUP*) as well as unpartitioned concatenation using maximum likelihood (RAxML).\\n\\nOur study shows that gene tree error and missing data impact all methods (and some methods degrade more than others), but the degree of incomplete lineage sorting and gene tree estimation error impacts the absolute and relative performance of methods as well as their response to gene filtering strategies. We find that filtering genes based on the degree of missing data is either neutral or else reduces the accuracy of all five methods examined, and so is not recommended. Filtering genes based on gene tree estimation error shows somewhat different trends. Under low levels of incomplete lineage sorting, removing genes with high gene tree estimation error can improve the accuracy of summary methods, but only if not too many genes are removed. Otherwise, filtering genes tends to increase error, especially under high levels of incomplete lineage sorting. Hence, while filtering genes based on missing data is not recommended, there are conditions under which removing high error gene trees can improve species tree estimation. This study provides insights into prior studies and suggests approaches for analyzing phylogenomic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Highlights- First study to highlight parallel epigenetic modifications induced by hatchery rearing as a potential explanatory mechanism for rapid change in fitness\\n\\nSummaryA puzzling question in conservation biology is how to maintain overall fitness of individuals bred in captive environment upon release into the wild, especially for rehabilitating declining or threatened species [1,2]. For salmonid species, a heritable change in fitness related traits and gene expression has been reported to occur in a single generation of captivity in hatchery environment [3-5]. Such rapid changes are congruent with models of inadvertent domestication selection which may lead to maladaptation in the natural environment [4]. Arguably, the underlying mechanism by which captivity may induce fitness difference between wild and captive congeners is still poorly understood. Short-term selection on complex phenotypic traits is expected to induce subtle changes in allele frequency over multiple loci [7-9]. Yet, most studies investigating the molecular basis for rapid change in fitness related traits occurring in hatchery have concentrated their effort on finding evidence for selection at the genome level by identifying loci with large effect.\\n\\nNumerous wild stocks of Pacific anadromous salmon and trout (genus Oncorhynchus and Salmo) have experienced fluctuating abundance over the past century, with a series of sharp declines [6-8]. With the objectives of preserving ecosystem integrity, enhancing declining populations and sustaining fisheries, conservation hatcheries have been flourishing. This is particularly true along the North American Pacific coast where billions of salmonids, all species included, are released each year. Despite substantial improvement of production management, the beneficial ecological role of hatcheries in enhancing and restoring wild stocks is still debated, mainly because of the reduced fitness and maladaptation of hatchery-fish when released in the wild [3,5,9]. Although previous studies showed that domestication selection was involved in such fitness impairment, they also observed that different environmental conditions (e.g. reduced fish density) significantly modulated the physiological acclimation to hatchery environment [4].\\n\\nEnvironmental stimuli are especially relevant during early embryonic development, which also correspond to a sensitive methylation reprogramming window in vertebrates [10,11]. It is therefore plausible that differences in rearing environment during early development may result in epigenetic modifications that could in turn impact on fitness. However, the only epigenetic study to date pertaining to captive rearing in salmonids and performed using methylation-sensitive amplified fragments (MSAP) failed to identify significant changes in methylation profile associated with hatchery rearing [12]\\n\\nHere, we used a higher resolution approach to compare the genome-wide pattern of methylation in hatchery-reared juvenile (smolt) Coho Salmon with that of their wild counterparts in two geographically distant rivers in British Columbia, Canada. Using a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) approach covering an average per individual of about 70 million cytosines in CpG context, we identified 100 methylated regions (DMRs) that differed in parallel between hatchery and natural origin salmon in both rivers. The total variance of epigenetic variation among individuals explained by river or origin and rearing environment in a RDA model was 16% (adj.R2=0.16), and both variables equally explained about 8% of the variance after controlling for each other. The gene ontology analysis revealed that regions with different methylation levels between hatchery and natural origin salmon showed enrichment for ion homeostasis, synaptic and neuromuscular regulation, immune and stress response, and control of locomotion functions. We further identified 15,044 SNPs that allowed detection of significant differences between either rivers or sexes. However, no effect of rearing environment was observed, confirming that hatchery and natural origin fish of a given river belong to the same panmictic population, as expected based on the hatchery programs applied in these rivers (see Supplementary experimental procedures). Moreover, neither a standard genome-scan approach nor a polygenic statistical framework allowed detection of selective effects within a single generation between hatchery and natural origin salmon. Therefore, this is the first study to demonstrate that parallel epigenetic modifications induced by hatchery rearing during early development may represent a potential explanatory mechanism for rapid change in fitness-related traits previously reported in salmonids.",

The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has introns in only 5% of its genes, characteristically at the start of the coding region, and lacks proteins essential for EJC assembly, is not expected to undergo splicing-dependent NMD. However, we found that the presence of an intron near a PTC can also enhance NMD in this organism, regardless of whether it is downstream or upstream.

    "abstract": "The onset of the headache phase during attacks of migraine with aura, which occur in about 30% of migraineurs, is believed to involve cortical spreading depression (CSD) and the ensuing activation and sensitization of primary afferent neurons that innervate the intracranial meninges, and their related large vessels. The mechanism by which CSD enhances the activity and mechanosensitivity of meningeal afferents remains poorly understood, but may involve cortical metabolic perturbations. We employed extracellular single-unit recording of meningeal afferent activity and monitored changes in cortical blood flow and tissue partial pressure of oxygen (tpO2) in anesthetized male rats to test whether the prolonged cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tissue oxygenation that occur in the wake of CSD contribute to meningeal nociception. Suppression of CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor naproxen blocked the reduction in cortical tpO2, but had no effect on the activation of meningeal afferents. Naproxen, however, distinctly prevented CSD-induced afferent mechanical sensitization. Counteracting the CSD-evoked persistent hypoperfusion and reduced tpO2 by preemptively increasing cortical blood flow using the K(ATP) channel opener levcromakalim did not inhibit the sensitization of meningeal afferents, but prevented their activation. Our data show that the cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tpO2 that occur in the wake of CSD can be dissociated from the activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferent responses suggesting that the metabolic changes do not contribute directly to these neuronal nociceptive responses.\\n\\nSignificance statementCSD-evoked activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents is thought to mediate the headache phase in migraine with aura. We report that blocking the CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion and reduced tpO2 by cyclooxygenase inhibition is associated with the inhibition of the afferent sensitization but not their activation. Normalization of these CSD-evoked metabolic perturbations by activating K(ATP) channels is, however, associated with the inhibition of afferent activation but not sensitization. These results question the contribution of cortical metabolic perturbations to the triggering mechanism underlying meningeal nociception and the ensuing headache in migraine with aura, further point to distinct mechanisms underlying the activation and sensitization of meningeal afferents in migraine and highlight the need to target both processes for an effective migraine therapy.",

In order to better evaluate missense variation, we leveraged the exome sequencing data of 60,706 individuals from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) dataset to identify sub-genic regions that are depleted of missense variation. We further used this depletion as part of a novel missense deleteriousness metric named MPC. We applied MPC to de novo missense variants and identified a category of de novo missense variants with the same impact on neurodevelopmental disorders as truncating mutations in intolerant genes, supporting the value of incorporating regional missense constraint in variant interpretation.",

These spatial structures are often associated with collaboration and quorum sensing between the bacteria. Here we investigate the mutual protection provided by spherical growth of a monoclonal colony during exposure to phages that proliferate on its surface. As a proof of concept we exposed growing colonies of Escherichia coli to a virulent mutant of phage P1. When the colony consists of less than ~ 50000 members it is eliminated, while larger initial colonies allow long-term survival because the growth of bacteria throughout the spherical colony exceeds the killing of bacteria on the surface. A mathematical model pinpoints how this critical colony size depends on key parameters in the phage infection cycle. Surprisingly, we predict that a higher phage adsorption rate would allow substantially smaller colonies to survive a virulent phage.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBacteria are repeatedly exposed to an excess of phages, and carry evidence of this in terms of multiple defense mechanisms encoded in their genome. In addition to molecular mechanisms, bacteria may exploit the defense of spatial refuges. Here we demonstrate how bacteria can limit the impact of a virulent phage attack by growing as a colony which only exposes its surface to phages. We identify a critical size of the initial colony, below which the phages entirely eliminates the colony, and above which the colony continues to grow despite the presence of phages. Our study suggests that coexistence of phages and bacteria is strongly influenced by the spatial composition of microcolonies of susceptible bacteria.",

Here we identify Daple, a modulator of trimeric G-proteins and a Dishevelled (Dvl)-binding protein as an unexpected point of convergence for all three cascades. Daple-dependent activation of Gi and enhancement of non-canonical Wnt signals is not just triggered by Wnt5a/FZD to suppress tumorigenesis, but also hijacked by growth factor-RTKs to stoke tumor progression. Phosphorylation of Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs triggers Gi activation and potentiates non-canonical Wnt signals that trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In patients with colorectal cancers, concurrent upregulation of Daple and the prototype RTK, EGFR, carried poor prognosis.

Using LD Hub, a web tool that performs LD Score Regression, identified two phenotypes with significant genetic overlap: schizophrenia (rG =0.19, p=0.0007 and ulcerative colitis (rG=0.22, p= 0.0061). We further showed that the genetic overlap between HIV acquisition and schizophrenia is likely driven in part by their shared overlap with cannabis use and sexual behavior. BUMHBOX analyses suggested that these genetic overlaps were driven by genome-wide pleiotropy with HIV acquisition rather than heterogeneity within the HIV acquisition sample. The two diseases identified as genetically overlapping with HIV-1 acquisition have >100 associated variants, and we tested if any of them significantly associated with HIV acquisition. We observed three variants that exceeded our threshold for statistical significance. Two of these were eQTLs in whole blood for genes coding for proteins suspected to be involved in HIV biology: rs1819333 in CCR6 (p=0.0002) and rs4932178 in FURIN (p=0.00033). However, no signal was found for these variants in two smaller African samples totaling 1015 cases and 963 controls, though the mode of acquisition and genetic architecture of these populations differed.\\n\\nThese results highlight the ability to use polygenic methods to gain new insights into complex diseases and identify potential associations with individual variants. Crucially, the leveraging of existing, publically available data makes these methods a cost-effective approach. In this case, our results add to the evidence for the role of risk taking behavior and inflammation of the bowel in HIV acquisition.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe biology of what puts certain individuals at greater risk of HIV acquisition is poorly understood. Using several novel polygenic methods, we identify supporting evidence for two important factors leading to acquisition. First, the role of an individuals genetic predisposition to risk taking behaviours such as number of sexual partners, age at first sexual intercourse drug use, and mental health problems. Second, the role of gut inflammation, in particular a genetic overlap between HIV acquisition with inflammatory bowel disease and the potential role of CCR6 during infection.",
