    "abstract": "Predicting the course of evolution is critical for solving current biomedical challenges such as cancer and the evolution of drug resistant pathogens. One approach to studying evolutionary predictability is to observe repeated, independent evolutionary trajectories of similar organisms under similar selection pressures in order to empirically characterize this adaptive fitness landscape. As this approach is infeasible for many natural systems, a number of recent studies have attempted to gain insight into the adaptive fitness landscape by testing the plausibility of different orders of appearance for a specific set of adaptive mutations in a single adaptive trajectory. While this approach is technically feasible for systems with very few available adaptive mutations, the usefulness of this approach for predicting evolution in situations with highly polygenic adaptation is unknown. It is also unclear whether the presence of stable adaptive polymorphisms can influence the predictability of evolution as measured by these methods. In this work, we simulate adaptive evolution under Fishers geometric model to study evolutionary predictability. Remarkably, we find that the predictability estimated by these methods are anti-correlated, and that the presence of stable adaptive polymorphisms can both qualitatively and quantitatively change the predictability of evolution.",

    "abstract": "Injury of CNS nerve tracts remodels circuitry through dendritic spine loss and hyper-excitability, thus influencing recovery. Due to the complexity of the CNS, a mechanistic understanding of injury-induced synaptic remodeling remains unclear. Using microfluidic chambers to separate and injure distal axons, we show that axotomy causes retrograde dendritic spine loss at directly injured pyramidal neurons followed by retrograde presynaptic hyper-excitability. These remodeling events require activity at the site of injury, axon-to-soma signaling, and transcription. Similarly, directly injured corticospinal neurons in vivo also exhibit a specific increase in spiking following axon injury. Axotomy-induced hyper-excitability of cultured neurons coincides with elimination of inhibitory inputs onto injured neurons, including those formed onto dendritic spines. Netrin-1 downregulation occurs following axon injury and exogenous netrin-1 applied after injury normalizes spine density, presynaptic excitability, and inhibitory inputs at injured neurons. Our findings show that intrinsic signaling within damaged neurons regulates synaptic remodeling and involves netrin-1 signaling.",

    "abstract": "During transcription, RNA polymerase competes for space on the DNA with other DNA binding proteins and higher order DNA structures acting as roadblocks. Though it is known that individual polymerases often slow down when forcing roadblocks, the effect of crowding on transcription as a whole is not clear. Based on quantitative theoretical modeling, we show that interactions with roadblocks induce a strong kinetic attraction between polymerases, causing them to self-organize into pelotons. Peloton formation explains observed nucleosome and polymerase density profiles close to the initiation site on highly transcribed genes, and how these densities depend on induction levels. At termination, pelotons translate into transcriptional bursts that dispaly the same characteristics as those observed in vivo. Our model thus unifies common spatial and temporal transcription patterns as arising from a non-specific interaction between roadblocks and polymerases. The generality of our model suggests that peloton formation might be ubiquitous in systems where molecular motors interact with dynamic roadblocks.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection is well recognized as a driver of reproductive isolation between lineages. However, selection for increased reproductive isolation could reciprocally change the outcomes of sexual selection, when these processes share a genetic basis. Direct selection for reproductive isolation occurs in the context of  reinforcement, where selection acts to increase prezygotic barriers to reduce the cost of heterospecific matings. Many studies of reinforcement focus on premating reproductive barriers, however postmating traits-such as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP)-can also respond to reinforcing selection. We tested whether i) CSP responded to reinforcing selection, and ii) this response in sympatric populations altered intraspecific sperm competition (ISC) and the strength of sexual selection, with the sister species Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. We used sperm competition experiments to evaluate differences in CSP and ISC between two sympatric and two allopatric populations of D. pseudoobscura. Using multiple genotypes for each population allowed us to estimate not only patterns of phenotype divergence, but also the opportunity for sexual selection within each population. Consistent with a pattern of reinforcement, the sympatric populations had higher mean CSP. Moreover, ISC was altered in sympatric populations, where we observed decreased average offensive sperm competitive ability against conspecific males, allowing less opportunity for sexual selection to operate within these populations. These data demonstrate that strong reinforcing selection for reproductive isolation can have consequences for sexual selection and sexual interactions within species, in these important postmating sperm competition traits.",

    "abstract": "The impact of inherited genetic variation on gene expression in humans is well-established. The majority of known expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impact expression of local genes (cis-eQTLs). More research is needed to identify effects of genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand their biological mechanisms. One common trans-eQTLs mechanism is \\\"mediation\\\" by a local (cis) transcript. Thus, mediation analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in order to identify transcripts that are \\\"cis-mediators\\\" of trans-eQTLs, including those \\\"cis-hubs\\\" involved in regulation of many trans-genes. Identifying such mediators helps us understand regulatory networks and suggests biological mechanisms underlying trans-eQTLs, both of which are relevant for understanding susceptibility to complex diseases. The multi-tissue expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program provides a unique opportunity to study cis-mediation across human tissue types. However, the presence of complex hidden confounding effects in biological systems can make mediation analyses challenging and prone to confounding bias, particularly when conducted among diverse samples. To address this problem, we propose a new method: Genomic Mediation analysis with Adaptive Confounding adjustment (GMAC). It enables the search of a very large pool of variables, and adaptively selects potential confounding variables for each mediation test. Analyses of simulated data and GTEx data demonstrate that the adaptive selection of confounders by GMAC improves the power and precision of mediation analysis. Application of GMAC to GTEx data provides new insights into the observed patterns of cis-hubs and trans-eQTL regulation across tissue types.",

    "abstract": "Small fly eyes should not see fine image details. Because flies exhibit saccadic visual behaviors and their compound eyes have relatively few ommatidia (sampling points), their photoreceptors would be expected to generate blurry and coarse retinal images of the world. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila see the world far better than predicted from the classic theories. By using electrophysiological, optical and behavioral assays, we found that R1-R6 photoreceptors encoding capacity in time is maximized to fast high-contrast bursts, which resemble their light input during saccadic behaviors. Whilst over space, R1-R6s resolve moving objects at saccadic speeds beyond the predicted motion-blur-limit. Our results show how refractory phototransduction and rapid photomechanical photoreceptor contractions jointly sharpen retinal images of moving objects in space-time, enabling hyperacute vision, and explain how such microsaccadic information sampling exceeds the compound eyes optical limits. These discoveries elucidate how acuity depends upon photoreceptor function and eye movements.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is the largest single cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial community which protects from C. difficile colonization. Multiple antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility; many leading to distinct community structures stemming from variation in bacterial targets of action. These community structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difficile. Therefore we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments. Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated C. difficile highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difficile spore formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C. difficile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C. difficile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C. difficile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm integrating network architecture. This platform identified nutrients C. difficile used preferentially between pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the hypothesis that C. difficile inhabits alternative nutrient niches across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for nitrogen-containing carbon sources, particularly Stickland fermentation substrates and host-derived glycans.\\n\\nImportanceInfection by the bacterium Clostridium difficile causes an inflammatory diarrheal disease which can become life-threatening, and has grown to be the most prevalent nosocomial infection. Susceptibility to C. difficile infection is strongly associated with previous antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the gut microbiota and reduces its ability to prevent colonization. In this study we demonstrated that C. difficile altered pathogenesis between hosts pretreated with antibiotics from separate classes, and exploited different nutrient sources across these environments. Our metabolite score calculation also provides a platform to study nutrient requirements of pathogens during an infection. Our results suggest that C. difficile colonization resistance is mediated by multiple groups of bacteria competing for several subsets of nutrients and could explain why total reintroduction of competitors through fecal microbial transplant currently is the most effective treatment for recurrent CDI. This work could ultimately contribute to the identification of targeted, context-dependent measures that prevent or reduce C. difficile colonization including pre- and probiotic therapies.",

The unsupervised Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in STRUCTURE is amongst the most frequently use of these methods, but its ability to provide reliable information about introduction routes has never before been assessed. We used computer simulations of microsatellite datasets to evaluate the extent to which the clustering results provided by STRUCTURE were misleading for the inference of introduction routes for two invasive populations independently introduced from a native population. For this simple scenario of independent introductions, the assumption of two clusters (i.e. K=2) would not be expected to result in STRUCTURE assigning the native population to one cluster, with both invasive populations assigned to the second cluster. We investigated the influence of two demographic parameters (effective size and bottleneck severity) and different numbers of loci on the type and frequency of misleading results. We showed that misleading STRUCTURE results were obtained for 10% of our simulated datasets and at a frequency of up to 37% for some combinations of parameters. Our results highlighted two different categories of misleading output. The first occurs in situations in which the native population has a low level of diversity. In this case, the two introduced populations may be very similar, despite their independent introduction histories. The second category results from convergence issues in STRUCTURE for K=2, with strong bottleneck severity and/or large numbers of loci resulting in high levels of differentiation between the three populations.",

    "abstract": "Humans exhibit considerable motor variability even across trivial reaching movements. This variability can be separated into specific kinematic components such as extent and direction, which are thought to be governed by distinct neural processes. Here, we report that individual subjects exhibit different magnitudes of kinematic variability, which are consistent (within individual) across movements to different targets and regardless of which arm (right or left) was used to perform the movements. Simultaneous fMRI recordings revealed that the same subjects also exhibited different magnitudes of fMRI variability across movements in a variety of motor system areas. These fMRI variability magnitudes were also consistent across movements to different targets when performed with either arm. Cortical fMRI variability in the posterior-parietal cortex of individual subjects predicted their movement-extent variability. This relationship was apparent only in posterior-parietal cortex and not in other motor system areas, thereby suggesting that individuals with more variable movement preparation exhibit larger kinematic variability. We, therefore, propose that neural and kinematic variability are reliable and interrelated individual characteristics that may predispose individual subjects to exhibit distinct motor capabilities.",

    "abstract": "We accurately perceive the visual scene despite moving our eyes ~3 times per second, an ability that requires incorporation of eye position and retinal information. We assessed how this neural computation unfolds across three interconnected structures: frontal eye fields (FEF), intraparietal cortex (LIP/MIP), and the superior colliculus (SC). Single unit activity was assessed in head-restrained monkeys performing visually-guided saccades from different initial fixations. As previously shown, the receptive fields of most LIP/MIP neurons shifted to novel positions on the retina for each eye position, and these locations were not clearly related to each other in either eye- or head-centered coordinates (hybrid coordinates). In contrast, the receptive fields of most SC neurons were stable in eye-centered coordinates. In FEF, visual signals were intermediate between those patterns: around 60% were eye-centered, whereas the remainder showed changes in receptive field location, boundaries, or responsiveness that rendered the response patterns hybrid or occasionally head-centered. These results suggest that FEF may act as a transitional step in an evolution of coordinates between LIP/MIP and SC. The persistence across cortical areas of hybrid representations that do not provide unequivocal location labels in a consistent reference frame has implications for how these representations must be read-out.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyHow we perceive the world as stable using mobile retinas is poorly understood. We compared the stability of visual receptive fields across different fixation positions in three visuomotor regions. Irregular changes in receptive field position were ubiquitous in intraparietal cortex, evident but less common in the frontal eye fields, and negligible in the superior colliculus (SC), where receptive fields shifted reliably across fixations. Only the SC provides a stable labelled-line code for stimuli across saccades.",

After salient chemosensory encounters, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) experiences changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition at reciprocal synapses between mitral cells (MCs) and local interneurons. The mechanisms underlying these changes remain controversial. Moreover, it remains unclear whether MC-interneuron plasticity is unique to specific behaviors, such as mating, or whether it is a more general feature of the AOB circuit. Here, we describe targeted electrophysiological studies of AOB inhibitory internal granule cells (IGCs), many of which upregulate the immediate-early gene Arc after male-male social experience. Following the resident-intruder paradigm, Arc-expressing IGCs in acute AOB slices from resident males displayed stronger excitation than non-expressing neighbors when sensory inputs are stimulated. The increased excitability of Arc-expressing IGCs was not correlated with changes in the strength or number of excitatory synapses with MCs, but is instead associated with increased intrinsic excitability and decreased HCN channel-mediated IH currents. Consistent with increased inhibition by IGCs, MCs responded to sensory input stimulation with decreased depolarization and spiking following resident-intruder encounters. These results reveal that non-mating behaviors drive AOB inhibitory plasticity, and indicate that increased MC inhibition involves intrinsic excitability changes in Arc-expressing interneurons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) is a site of experience-dependent plasticity between excitatory mitral cells (MCs) and inhibitory internal granule cells (IGCs), but the physiological mechanisms and behavioral conditions driving this plasticity remain unclear. Here, we report studies of AOB neuronal plasticity following male-male social chemosensory encounters. We show that the plasticity-associated immediate-early gene Arc is selectively expressed in IGCs from resident males following the resident-intruder assay. Following behavior, Arc-expressing IGCs are more strongly excited by sensory input stimulation and MC activation is suppressed. Arc-expressing IGCs do not show increased excitatory synaptic drive, but instead show increased intrinsic excitability. These data indicate that MC-IGC plasticity is induced after male-male social chemosensory encounters, resulting in MC suppression by Arc-expressing IGCs.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arboviral infection globally, infecting an estimated 390 million people each year. We employed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify host dependency factors required for DENV propagation, and identified the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex as an essential host factor for DENV infection. Mammalian cells express two OSTs containing either STT3A or STT3B. We found that the canonical catalytic function of the OSTs as oligosaccharyltransferases is not necessary for DENV infection, as cells expressing catalytically inactive STT3A or STT3B are able to support DENV propagation. However, the OST subunit MAGT1, which associates with STT3B, is also required for DENV propagation. MAGT1 expression requires STT3B, and a catalytically inactive STT3B also rescues MAGT1 expression, supporting the hypothesis that STT3B serves to stabilize MAGT1 in the context of DENV infection. We found that the oxidoreductase CxxC active site motif of MAGT1 was necessary for DENV propagation as cells expressing an AxxA MAGT1 mutant were unable to support DENV infection.\\n\\nInterestingly, cells expressing single-cysteine CxxA or AxxC mutants of MAGT1 were able to support DENV propagation.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTargeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of proteins that are encoded by genes critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSGenes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings provide a relevant towards better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenotyping and whole-genome sequencing data have been collected in many cattle breeds. The compilation of large reference panels facilitates imputing sequence variant genotypes for animals that have been genotyped using dense genotyping arrays. Association studies with imputed sequence variant genotypes allow characterization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) at nucleotide resolution particularly when individuals from several breeds are included in the mapping populations.\\n\\nResultsWe imputed genotypes for more than 28 million sequence variants in 17,229 animals of the Braunvieh (BV), Fleckvieh (FV) and Holstein (HOL) cattle breeds in order to generate large mapping populations that are required to identify sequence variants underlying milk production traits. Within-breed association tests between imputed sequence variant genotypes and fat and protein percentages in milk uncovered between six and thirteen QTL (P<1e-8) per breed. Eight of the detected QTL were significant in more than one breed. We combined the association studies across three breeds using meta-analysis and identified 25 QTL including six that were not significant in the within-breed association studies. Closer inspection of the QTL revealed that two well-known causal missense mutations in the ABCG2 (p.Y581S, rs43702337, P=4.3e-34) and GHR (p.F279Y, rs385640152, P=1.6e-74) genes were the top variants at two QTL on chromosomes 6 and 20. Another true causal missense mutation in the DGAT1 gene (p.A232K, rs109326954, P=8.4e-1436) was the second top variant at a QTL on chromosome 14 but its allelic substitution effects were not consistent across three breeds analyzed. It turned out that the conflicting allelic substitution effects resulted from flaws in the imputed genotypes due to the use of a multi-breed reference population for genotype imputation.\\n\\nConclusionsMany QTL for milk production traits segregate across breeds. Metaanalysis of association studies across breeds has greater power to detect such QTL than within-breed association studies. True causal mutations can be readily detected among the most significantly associated variants at QTL when the accuracy of imputation is high. However, true causal mutations may show conflicting allelic substitution effects across breeds when the imputed sequence variant genotypes contain flaws. Validating the effect of known causal variants is highly recommended in order to assess the ability to detect true causal mutations in association studies with imputed sequence variant genotypes.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, ubiquitous expression of a short Cyclin G isoform generates extreme developmental noise estimated by fluctuating asymmetry (FA), providing a model to tackle developmental stability. This transcriptional cyclin interacts with chromatin regulators of the Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb (ETP) and Polycomb families. We investigate here the importance of these interactions in developmental stability. Deregulation of Cyclin G highlights an organ intrinsic control of developmental noise, linked to the ETP-interacting domain, and enhanced by mutations in genes encoding members of the Polycomb Repressive complexes PRC1 and PR-DUB. Deep-sequencing of wing imaginal discs deregulating CycG reveals that high developmental noise correlates with up-regulation of genes involved in translation and down-regulation of genes involved in energy production. Most Cyclin G direct transcriptional targets are also direct targets of PRC1, ASX and RNAPolII in the developing wing. Altogether, our results suggest that Cyclin G, PRC1 and PR-DUB cooperate for developmental stability.",

    "abstract": "The recently discovered comammox bacteria have the potential to completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate. These microorganisms are part of the Nitrospira genus and are present in a variety of environments, including Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) systems. However, the physiological traits within and between comammox- and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB)-like Nitrospira species have not been analyzed in these ecosystems. In this study, we identified Nitrospira strains dominating the nitrifying community of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) performing BNR under micro-aerobic conditions. We recovered metagenomes-derived draft genomes from two Nitrospira strains: (1) Nitrospira sp. UW-LDO-01, a comammox-like organism classified as Candidatus Nitrospira nitrosa, and (2) Nitrospira sp. UW-LDO-02, a nitrite oxidizing strain belonging to the Nitrospira defluvii species. A comparative genomic analysis of these strains with other Nitrospira-like genomes identified genomic differences in Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa mainly attributed to each strains niche adaptation. Traits associated with energy metabolism also differentiate comammox from NOB-like genomes. We also identified several transcriptionally regulated adaptive traits, including stress tolerance, biofilm formation and micro-aerobic metabolism, which might explain survival of Nitrospira under multiple environmental conditions. Overall, our analysis expanded our understanding of the genetic functional features of Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa, and identified genomic traits that further illuminate the phylogenetic diversity and metabolic plasticity of the Nitrospira genus.",

For decades, researchers have argued that this finding is consistent with a self-terminating backward scanning model (Muter, 1979; Hacker, 1980; Hockley, 1984; McElree & Dosher, 1993). This finding has taken on new importance in light of recent proposal that many forms of memory depend on a compressed representation of the past (Howard, Shankar, Aue, & Criss, 2015). This paper replicates and extends the results of the classic papers. A Bayesian t-test showed substantial evidence for the null effect of lag to the less recent item on correct RT. In addition, this paper reports that correct RT is a sub-linear function of lag to the more recent probe and replicates the classic finding that error RT depends on lag to the less recent probe. These findings place new constraints on models of short-term memory scanning.",

    "abstract": "Varroa destructor is the most economically damaging honey bee pest, weakening colonies by simultaneously parasitizing bees and transmitting harmful viruses. Despite these impacts on honey bee health, surprisingly little is known about its fundamental molecular biology. Here we present a Varroa protein atlas crossing all major developmental stages (egg, protonymph, deutonymph and adult) for both male and female mites as a web-based interactive tool (http://foster.nce.ubc.ca/varroa/index.html). By intensity-based label-free quantitation, 1,433 proteins were differentially expressed across developmental stages, including two distinct viral polyproteins. Enzymes for processing carbohydrates and amino acids were among many of these differences as well as proteins involved in cuticle formation. Lipid transport involving vitellogenin was the most significantly enriched biological process in the foundress (reproductive female) and young mites. In addition, we found that 101 proteins were sexually regulated and functional enrichment analysis suggests that chromatin remodeling may be a key feature of sex determination. In a proteogenomic effort, we identified 519 protein-coding regions (169 of which were differentially expressed) supported by 1,464 peptides which were previously unannotated. Since this is a recurring trend with annotating genomes of non-model species, we analyzed their amino acid and nucleotide composition as well as their orthology to other species to suggest reasons why they may have been missed initially. Overall, this work provides a first-of-its-kind interrogation of the patterns of gene expression that govern the Varroa life cycle and the tools we have developed will support further research on this threatening honey bee pest.",

    "abstract": "Although the contribution of B-cell derived autoreactive antibodies to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been studied extensively, the autoantibody-independent roles of B cells in the progression of the disease is not well-defined. Here we present the first comprehensive transcriptome profile of human autoreactive B cells in an autoimmune disease by performing RNA-sequencing of citrulline-specific B cells from RA patients. In order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the profile of these citrulline-specific (RA-CCPPOS) B cells, we performed comparative analyses to both citrulline-negative (RA-CCPNEG) B cells from the same donors, and identified 431 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); and hemagglutinin-specific (HA) B cells from healthy individuals and identified 1658 DEGs. Three-way comparisons of these B cell populations demonstrated that RA-CCPPOS B cells, in comparison to the RA-CCPNEG B cells, demonstrate a potential role in protein citrullination and inflammation; RA-CCPPOS B cells in comparison to HA-specific B cells demonstrate RA-specific signatures like the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules and B-cell activation cascades; and all B cells from RA patients demonstrated a significant impact of the multitude of TNF signaling pathways. Furthermore, transcription factor profiling suggested that cyclic AMP (cAMP) related pathways and downstream signaling molecules are selectively enriched in RA-CCPPOS cells in comparison to the other two B cell subsets. We advanced the understanding of the citrulline reactive B cells in RA pathophysiology by documenting and validating two novel observations in independent cohorts of patients: (1) the expression of IL15R is restricted to citrulline-specific cells within RA patients and the concentration of soluble IL15R is elevated in the sera of RA patients, (2) B cells from RA patients are capable of producing epidermal growth factor ligand, amphiregulin (AREG) which in turn has a direct impact on the mechanistic effectors of RA, osteoclasts and fibroblastlike synoviocytes (FLS). Overall, our comprehensive dataset identifies several existing FDA-approved drugs that can potentially be repurposed for RA and can serve as a foundation for studying the multi-faceted roles of B cells in other autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Externally deposited eggs begin development with an immense cytoplasm and a single overwhelmed nucleus. Rapid mitotic cycles restore normality as the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm (N/C) increases. At the 14th cell cycle in Drosophila embryos, the cell cycle slows, transcription increases, and morphogenesis begins at the Mid-Blastula Transition (MBT). To explore the role of N/C in MBT timing, we blocked N/C-increase by downregulating cyclin/Cdk1 to arrest early cell cycles. Embryos arrested in cell cycle 12 cellularized, initiated gastrulation movements and activated transcription of genes previously described as N/C dependent. Thus, occurrence of these events is not directly coupled to N/C-increase. However, N/C might act indirectly. Increasing N/C promotes cyclin/Cdk1 downregulation which otherwise inhibits many MBT events. By experimentally inducing downregulation of cyclin/Cdk1, we bypassed this input of N/C-increase. We describe a regulatory cascade wherein the increasing N/C downregulates cyclin/Cdk1 to promote increasing transcription and the MBT.\\n\\nImpact statementBy showing that cell-cycle arrest allows early Drosophila embryos to progress to later stages, this work eliminates numerous models for embryonic timing and shows the dominating influence of cell-cycle slowing.",

Here, we explain the concept of SS propensity and analyze dSPP entries of therapeutic relevance, -synuclein, MOAG-4, and the ZIKA NS2B-NS3 complex to show: (1) how propensity mapping generates novel structural insights into intrinsically disordered regions of pathologically relevant proteins, (2) how computational biophysics tools can benefit from propensity mapping, and (3) how the residual disorder estimation based on NMR chemical shifts compares with sequence-based disorder predictors.

    "abstract": "Genomes contain rare guanine-rich sequences capable of assembling into four-stranded helical structures, termed G-quadruplexes, with potential roles in gene regulation and chromosome stability. Their mechanical unfolding has only been reported to date by all-atom simulations, which cannot dissect the major physical interactions responsible for their cohesion. Here, we propose a mesoscopic model to describe both the mechanical and thermal stability of DNA G-quadruplexes, where each nucleotide of the structure, as well as each central cation located at the inner channel, is mapped onto a single bead. In this framework we are able to simulate loading rates similar to the experimental ones, which are not reachable in simulations with atomistic resolution. In this regard, we present single-molecule force-induced unfolding experiments by a high-resolution optical tweezers on a DNA telomeric sequence capable of forming a G-quadruplex conformation. Fitting the parameters of the model to the experiments we find a correct prediction of the rupture-force kinetics and a good agreement with previous near equilibrium measurements. Since G-quadruplex unfolding dynamics is halfway in complexity between secondary nucleic acids and tertiary protein structures, our model entails a nanoscale paradigm for non-equilibrium processes in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Key points1. TDAG8 (GPR65) gene expression is down-regulated in hematological malignancies.\\n\\n2. Restoration of TDAG8 gene expression in blood cancer cells suppresses tumor growth and metastasis.\\n\\nAbstractExtracellular acidosis is a condition found within the tumor microenvironment due to inadequate blood perfusion, hypoxia, and altered tumor cell metabolism. Acidosis has pleiotropic effects on malignant progression; therefore it is essential to understand how acidosis exerts its diverse effects. In this study a bioinformatics analysis revealed the expression of the proton sensing G-protein-coupled receptor TDAG8 is significantly reduced in human blood cancers in comparison to normal blood cells. To understand how TDAG8 functions in hematological malignancies, TDAG8 expression was restored in U937 acute myeloid leukemia cells and other blood cancer cells. It was discovered that severe acidosis, pH 6.4, inhibited U937 cell proliferation while mild acidosis, pH 6.9, stimulated cell proliferation. However, restoring TDAG8 gene expression modulated the U937 cell response to mild extracellular acidosis and physiological pH by reducing cell proliferation. Tumor xenograft experiments further revealed that restoring TDAG8 expression in U937 and Ramos cancer cells reduced tumor growth. It was also shown U937 cells with restored TDAG8 expression attached less to Matrigel, migrated slower toward a chemoattractant, and metastasized less in severe combined immunodeficient mice. These effects correlated with a reduction in c-myc oncogene expression. The mechanistic investigation indicated that G13/RhoA signaling arbitrated the TDAG8-mediated c-myc oncogene repression in response to acidosis. Overall, this study provides compelling data to support the concept that TDAG8 functions as a contextual tumor suppressor in hematological malignancies and sensitizes blood cancer cells to acidotic stress.",

    "abstract": "The secreted growth factor Activin-A of the TGF{beta} family and its receptors can promote or inhibit several cancer hallmarks including tumor cell proliferation and differentiation, vascularization, lymphangiogenesis and inflammation. However, a role in immune evasion and its relationship with tumor-induced muscle wasting and tumor vascularization, and the relative contributions of autocrine versus paracrine Activin signaling remain to be evaluated. To address this, we compared the effects of truncated soluble Activin receptor II B as a ligand trap, or constitutively active mutant type IB receptor versus secreted Activin-A or the related ligand Nodal in mouse and human melanoma cell lines and tumor grafts. We found that while cell-autonomous receptor activation arrested tumor cell proliferation, Activin-A secretion stimulated melanoma cell dedifferentiation and tumor vascularization by functional blood vessels, and it increased primary and metastatic tumor burden and muscle wasting. Importantly, in mice with impaired adaptive immunity, the tumor-promoting effect of Activin-A was lost despite sustained vascularization and cachexia, suggesting that Activin-A promotes melanoma progression by inhibiting anti-tumor immunity. Paracrine Activin-A signaling emerges as a potential target for personalized therapies, both to reduce cachexia and to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Tango1 helps the efficient delivery of large proteins to the cell surface. We show here that loss of Tango1, in addition to interfering with protein secretion, causes ER stress and defects in cell and ER/Golgi morphology. We find that the previously observed dependence of smaller cargos on Tango1 is a secondary effect, due to an indirect requirement: if large cargos like Dumpy, which we identify here as a new Tango1 cargo, are removed from the cell, non-bulky proteins re-enter the secretory pathway. Removal of the blocking cargo also attenuates the ER-stress response, and cell morphology is restored. Thus, failures in the secretion of non-bulky proteins, ER stress and defective cell morphology are secondary consequences of the retention of cargo. By contrast, the ERES defects in Tango1-depleted cells persist in the absence of bulky cargo, showing that they are due to a secretion-independent function of Tango1. Therefore, the maintenance of proper ERES architecture may be a primary function for Tango1.",

    "abstract": "Stable isotopes have been used to estimate migratory connectivity in many species. Estimates are often greatly improved when coupled with species distribution models (SDMs), which temper estimates in relation to occurrence. SDMs can be constructed using from point locality data from a variety of sources including extensive monitoring data typically collected by citizen scientists. However, one potential issue with SDM is that these data oven have sampling bias. To avoid this potential bias, an approach using SDMs based on marsh bird monitoring program data collected by citizen scientists and other participants following protocols specifically designed to maximize detections of species of interest at locations representative of the species range. We then used the SDMs to refine isotopic assignments of breeding areas of autumn-migrating and wintering Sora (Porzana Carolina), Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola), and Yellow Rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) based on feathers collected from individuals caught at various locations in the United States from Minnesota south to Louisiana and South Carolina. Sora were assigned to an area that included much of the western U.S. and prairie Canada, covering parts of the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi Flyways. Yellow Rails were assigned to a broad area along Hudson and James Bay in northern Manitoba and Ontario, as well as smaller parts of Quebec, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including parts of the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways. Virginia Rails were from several discrete areas, including parts of Colorado, New Mexico, the central valley of California, and southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba in the Pacific and Central Flyways. Our study demonstrates extensive data from organized citizen science monitoring programs are especially useful for improving isotopic assignments of migratory connectivity in birds, which can ultimately lead to better informed management decisions and conservation actions.",

However, morphology-based species identifications remain a low-throughput, and sometimes ambiguous, approach. Despite metabarcoding methodologies have been applied for above-species taxa inventories in marine meiofaunal communities, a comprehensive approach providing species-level identifications for estuarine macrobenthic communities is still lacking. Here we report a combination of experimental and field studies demonstrating the aptitude of COI metabarcoding to provide robust species-level identifications within a framework of high-throughput monitoring of estuarine macrobenthic communities. To investigate the ability to recover DNA barcodes from all species present in a bulk DNA extract, we assembled 3 phylogenetically diverse communities, using 4 different primer pairs to generate PCR products of the COI barcode region. Between 78 and 83% of the species in the tested communities were recovered through HTS. Subsequently, we compared morphology and metabarcoding-based approaches to determine the species composition from four distinct sites of an estuary. Our results indicate that the species richness would be considerably underestimated if only morphological methods were used. Although further refinement is required for improving the efficiency and output of this approach, here we show the great aptitude of COI metabarcoding to provide high quality and auditable species identifications in macrobenthos monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The city of Sydney, Australia, experienced a persistent outbreak of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) pneumonia in 2016. To elucidate the source and bring the outbreak to a close we examined the genomes of clinical and environmental Lp1 isolates recovered over 7 weeks. A total of 48 isolates from patients and cooling towers were sequenced and compared using SNP-based, core-genome MLST and pangenome approaches. All three methods confirmed phylogenetic relatedness between isolates associated with outbreaks in the Central Business District (March and May) and Suburb 1. These isolates were designated \\\"Main cluster\\\" and consisted of isolates from two patients from the CBD March outbreak, one patient and one tower isolate from Suburb 1 and isolates from two cooling towers and three patients from the CDB May outbreak. All main cluster isolates were sequence type ST211 which has only ever been reported in Canada. Significantly, pangenome analysis identified mobile genetic elements containing a unique T4ASS that was specific to the main cluster and co-circulating clinical strains, suggesting a potential mechanism for increased fitness and persistence of the outbreak clone. Genome sequencing was key in deciphering the environmental sources of infection among the spatially and temporally coinciding cases of legionellosis in this highly populated urban setting. Further, the discovery of a unique T4ASS emphasises the potential contribution of genome recombination in the emergence of successful Lp1 clones.",

    "abstract": "Some nematode species are economically important parasites of livestock, while others are important human pathogens causing some of the most important neglected tropical diseases. In both humans and animals, anthelmintic drug administration is the main control strategy, but the emergence of drug-resistant worms has stimulated the development of alternative control approaches. Among these, vaccination is considered to be a sustainable and cost effective strategy. Currently, Barbervax(R) for the ruminant strongylid Haemonchus contortus is the only registered subunit vaccine for a nematode parasite, although a vaccine for the human hookworm Necator americanus is undergoing clinical trials (HOOKVAC consortium). As both these vaccines comprise a limited number of proteins there is potential for selection of nematodes with altered sequence or expression of the vaccine antigens. Here we compared the transcriptome of H. contortus populations from sheep vaccinated with Barbervax(R) with worms from control animals. Barbervax(R) antigens are native integral membrane proteins isolated from the brush border of the intestinal cells of the adult parasite and many of them are proteases. Our findings provide no evidence for changes in expression of genes encoding Barbervax(R) antigens in the surviving parasite populations. However, surviving parasites from vaccinated animals showed increased expression of other proteases and regulators of lysosome trafficking, and displayed up-regulated lipid storage and defecation abilities that may have circumvented the vaccine effect. Implications for other potential vaccines for human and veterinary nematodes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Molecular variants of vitamin B12, siderophores and glycans occur. To take up variant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants of vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of receptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution. Competition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient diversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates, whereas species such as B. thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex glycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provide opportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another important process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such fluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information about environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often adjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular carbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake receptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to control the response to fluctuations? That question about regulatory wiring relates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence. Control theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation to the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning studies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory wiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify environmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in cellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence. I connect those broad conceptual aspects to many testable hypotheses for bacterial uptake of vitamin B12, siderophores and glycans.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSeveral conditions associated with reduced gastric acid secretion confer an altered risk of developing a gastric malignancy. Helicobacter pylori-induced atrophic gastritis predisposes to gastric adenocarcinoma, autoimmune atrophic gastritis is a precursor of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumours, whereas proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use does not affect stomach cancer risk. We hypothesised that each of these conditions was associated with specific alterations in the gastric microbiota and that this influenced subsequent tumour risk.\\n\\nDesign95 patients (in groups representing normal stomach, PPI treated, H. pylori gastritis, H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis and autoimmune atrophic gastritis) were selected from a cohort of 1400. RNA extracted from gastric corpus biopsies was analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing (MiSeq).\\n\\nResultsSamples from normal stomachs and patients treated with PPIs demonstrated similarly high microbial diversity. Patients with autoimmune atrophic gastritis also exhibited relatively high microbial diversity, but with samples dominated by Streptococcus. H. pylori colonisation was associated with decreased microbial diversity and reduced complexity of co-occurrence networks. H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis resulted in lower bacterial abundances and diversity, whereas autoimmune atrophic gastritis resulted in greater bacterial abundance and equally high diversity compared to normal stomachs. Pathway analysis suggested that glucose-6-phospahte1-dehydrogenase and D-lactate dehydrogenase were over represented in H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis versus autoimmune atrophic gastritis, and that both these groups showed increases in fumarate reductase.\\n\\nConclusionAutoimmune and H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis were associated with different gastric microbial profiles.

To further explore how actin impacts yeast prions, we turned to a set of actin point mutants. We found that the disruption of actin cables, either by an actin destabilizing drug or the act1-101 mutant, can enhance prion formation during the later stages of prion formation. Our data suggest that under normal conditions, actin cables play a role in limiting the inheritance of newly made prion particles to daughter cells. We also found actin can impact prion propagation. The act1-122 mutant, which contains a substitution in the fimbrin binding region, destabilized the [PIN+] prion over time. This is the first evidence that actin has a role in [PIN+] propagation.

Here we characterize the colonization dynamics and abundance of nine species of Caenorhabditis nematodes in neotropical French Guiana, the most speciose known assemblage of this genus, with resource use overlap and notoriously similar outward morphology despite deep genomic divergence.\\n\\nMethodsTo characterize the dynamics and specificity of colonization and exploitation of ephemeral resource patches, we conducted manipulative field experiments and the largest sampling effort to date for Caenorhabditis outside of Europe. This effort provides the first in-depth quantitative analysis of substrate specificity for Caenorhabditis in natural, unperturbed habitats.\\n\\nResultsWe amassed a total of 626 strain isolates from nine species of Caenorhabditis among 2865 substrate samples. With the two new species described here (C. astrocarya and C. dolens), we estimate that our sampling procedures will discover few additional species of these microbivorous animals in this tropical rainforest system. We demonstrate experimentally that the two most prevalent species (C. nouraguensis and C. tropicalis) rapidly colonize fresh resource patches, whereas at least one rarer species shows specialist micro-habitat fidelity.\\n\\nDiscussionDespite the potential to colonize rapidly, these ephemeral patchy resources of rotting fruits and flowers are likely to often remain uncolonized by Caenorhabditis prior to their complete decay, implying dispersal-limited resource exploitation. We hypothesize that a combination of rapid colonization, high ephemerality of resource patches, and species heterogeneity in degree of specialization on micro-habitats and life histories enables dynamic co-existence of so many morphologically cryptic species of Caenorhabditis.",

    "abstract": "Visual neglect is a frequent and disabling consequence of right hemisphere damage. Previous work demonstrated a probable role of posterior callosal dysfunction in the chronic persistence of neglect signs. Prism adaptation is a non-invasive and convenient technique to rehabilitate chronic visual neglect, but it is not effective in all patients. Here we aimed to assess the hypothesis that prism adaptation improves left neglect by facilitating compensation through the contribution of the left, undamaged hemisphere. We assessed the relationship between prism adaptation effects, cortical thickness and white matter integrity in a group of 14 patients with unilateral right-hemisphere strokes and chronic visual neglect. Results showed that patients who benefitted from prism adaptation had thicker cortex in temporo-parietal, prefrontal and cingulate areas of the left, undamaged hemisphere. Additionally, these patients had a higher fractional anisotropy value in the body and genu of the corpus callosum. Results from normal controls show that these callosal regions connect temporo-parietal, sensorimotor and prefrontal areas. Finally, shorter time intervals from the stroke tended to improve patients response to prism adaptation. We concluded that prism adaptation may improve left visual neglect by promoting the contribution of the left hemisphere to neglect compensation. These results support current hypotheses on the role of the healthy hemisphere in the compensation for stroke-induced, chronic neuropsychological deficits, and suggest that prism adaptation can foster this role by exploiting sensorimotor/prefrontal circuits, especially when applied at early stages post-stroke.",

    "abstract": "Collagen is the predominant structural protein in vertebrates, where it contributes to connective tissues and the extracellular matrix; it is also widely used in biomaterials and tissue engineering. Dysfunction of this protein and its processing can lead to a wide variety of developmental disorders and connective tissue diseases. Recombinantly engineering the protein is challenging due to posttranslational modifications generally required for its stability and secretion from cells. Introducing end labels into the protein is problematic, because the N- and C-termini of the physiologically relevant tropocollagen lie internal to the initially flanking N- and C-propeptide sequences. Here, we introduce mutations into human type II procollagen in a manner that address these concerns, and purify the recombinant protein from a stably transfected HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line. Our approach introduces chemically addressable groups into the N- and Ctelopeptide termini of tropocollagen. Simultaneous overexpression of formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) allows the endogenous production of an aldehyde tag in a defined, substituted sequence in the N-terminus of the mutated collagen, while the C-terminus of each chain presents a sulfhydryl group from an introduced cysteine. These modifications are designed to enable specific covalent end-labelling of collagen. We find that the doubly-mutated protein folds and is secreted from cells, while higher-order assembly into well-ordered collagen fibrils is demonstrated through transmission electron microscopy. Chemical tagging of thiols is successful, however background from endogenous aldehydes present in wildtype collagen has thus far obscured the desired specific N-terminal labelling. Strategies to overcome this challenge are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Blood is arguably the most important bodily fluid and its analysis provides crucial health status information. A first routine measure to narrow down diagnosis in clinical practice is the differential blood count, determining the frequency of all major blood cells. What is lacking to advance initial blood diagnostics is an unbiased and quick functional assessment of blood that can narrow down the diagnosis and generate specific hypotheses. To address this need, we introduce the continuous, cell-by-cell morpho-rheological (MORE) analysis of whole blood, without labeling, enrichment or separation, at rates of 1,000 cells/sec. In a drop of blood we can identify all major blood cells and characterize their pathological changes in several disease conditions in vitro and in patient samples. This approach takes previous results of mechanical studies on specifically isolated blood cells to the level of application directly in whole blood and adds a functional dimension to conventional blood analysis.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STR) mutations may be responsible for more than half of the mutations in eukaryotic coding DNA, yet STR variation is rarely examined as a contributor to complex traits. We assess the scope of this contribution across a collection of 96 strains of Arabidopsis thaliana by massively parallel STR genotyping. We found that 95% of examined STRs are polymorphic, with a median of six alleles per STR in these strains. Modest STR expansions are found in most strains, some of which have evident functional effects. For instance, three of six intronic STR expansions are associated with intron retention. Coding STRs are depleted of variation relative to non-coding STRs, consistent with the action of purifying selection, and some STRs show hypervariable patterns consistent with diversifying selection. Finally, we detect dozens of novel STR-phenotype associations that could not be detected with SNPs alone, validating several with follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that STRs comprise a large, unascertained reservoir of functionally relevant genomic variation.",
