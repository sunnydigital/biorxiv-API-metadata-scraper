    "abstract": "The dynamic organization of genes inside the nucleus is an important determinant for their function. Using ultra-fast microscopy in S. cerevisiae cells and improved analysis of mean square displacements, we quantified DNA motion at time scales ranging from 10 milliseconds to minutes and found that following DNA damage, DNA exhibits distinct sub-diffusive regimes. In response to double-strand breaks, chromatin is more mobile at large time scales but, surprisingly, its mobility is dramatically reduced at short time scales. This effect is even more pronounced at the break. Such pattern of dynamics is consistent with a global increase in chromatin persistence length following DNA damage. Scale-dependent nuclear exploration is regulated by the Rad51 repair protein, both at the break and throughout the genome. We propose a model in which stiffening of the damaged ends by the repair complex, combined with global increased stiffness, act like a \\\"needle in a decompacted ball of yarn\\\", enhancing the ability of the break to traverse the chromatin meshwork.",

    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response.

    "abstract": "Camera trapping surveys frequently capture individuals whose identity is only known from a single flank. The most widely used methods for incorporating these partial identity individuals into density analyses discard some of the partial identity capture histories, reducing precision, and while not previously recognized, introducing bias. Here, we present the spatial partial identity model (SPIM), which uses the spatial location where partial identity samples are captured to probabilistically resolve their complete identities, allowing all partial identity samples to be used in the analysis. We show that the SPIM out-performs other analytical alternatives. We then apply the SPIM to an ocelot data set collected on a trapping array with double-camera stations and a bobcat data set collected on a trapping array with single-camera stations. The SPIM improves inference in both cases and in the ocelot example, individual sex determined from photographs is used to further resolve partial identities, one of which is resolved to near certainty. The SPIM opens the door for the investigation of trapping designs that deviate from the standard 2 camera design, the combination of other data types between which identities cannot be deterministically linked, and can be extended to the problem of partial genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Most mutations are deleterious and cause a reduction in population fitness known as the mutational load. In small populations, weakened selection against slightly-deleterious mutations results in an additional fitness reduction. Many studies have established that populations can evolve a reduced mutational load by evolving mutational robustness, but it is uncertain whether small populations can evolve a reduced susceptibility to drift-related fitness declines. Here, using mathematical modeling and digital experimental evolution, we show that small populations do evolve a reduced vulnerability to drift, or \\\"drift robustness\\\". We find that, compared to genotypes from large populations, genotypes from small populations have a decreased likelihood of small-effect deleterious mutations, thus causing small-population genotypes to be drift-robust. We further show that drift robustness is not adaptive, but instead arises because small populations preferentially adapt to drift-robust fitness peaks. These results have implications for genome evolution in organisms with small population sizes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeleterious alleles have long been proposed to play an important role in patterning phenotypic variation and are central to commonly held ideas explaining the hybrid vigor observed in the offspring by crossing two inbred parents. We test these ideas using evolutionary measures of sequence conservation to ask whether incorporating information about putatively deleterious alleles can inform genomic selection (GS) models and improve phenotypic prediction. We measured a number of agronomic traits in both the inbred parents and hybrids of an elite maize partial diallel population and re-sequenced the parents of the population. Inbred elite maize lines vary for more than 350,000 putatively deleterious sites, but show a lower burden of such sites than a comparable set of traditional landraces. Our modeling reveals widespread evidence for incomplete dominance at these loci, and supports theoretical models that more damaging variants are usually more recessive. We identify haplotype blocks using an identity-by-decent (IBD) analysis and perform genomic prediction analyses in which we weigh blocks on the basis of segregating putatively deleterious variants. Cross-validation results show that incorporating sequence conservation in genomic selection improves prediction accuracy for grain yield and other fitness-related traits as well as heterosis for those traits. Our results provide empirical support for an important role for incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in explaining heterosis and demonstrate the utility of incorporating functional annotation in phenotypic prediction and plant breeding.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA key long-term goal of biology is understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. Although most new mutations are likely disadvantageous, their prevalence and importance in explaining patterns of phenotypic variation is controversial and not well understood. In this study we combine whole genome-sequencing and field evaluation of a maize mapping population to investigate the contribution of deleterious mutations to phenotype. We show that a priori prediction of deleterious alleles correlates well with effect sizes for grain yield and that variants predicted to be more damaging are on average more recessive. We develop a simple model allowing for variation in the heterozygous effects of deleterious mutations and demonstrate its improved ability to predict both phenotypes and hybrid vigor. Our results help reconcile alternative explanations for hybrid vigor and highlight the use of leveraging evolutionary history to facilitate breeding for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Changes in environmental conditions can lead to rapid shifts in the state of an ecosystem (\\\"regime shifts\\\"), which, even after the environment has returned to previous conditions, subsequently recovers slowly to the previous state (\\\"hysteresis\\\"). Large spatial and temporal scales of dynamics, and the lack of frameworks linking observations to models, are challenges to understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to perturbations. The naturally-occurring microecosystem inside leaves of the northern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) exhibits oligotrophic and eutrophic states that can be induced by adding insect prey. Here, we further develop a model for simulating these dynamics, parameterize it using data from a prey addition experiment and conduct a sensitivity analysis to identify critical zones within the parameter space. Simulations illustrate that the microecosystem model displays regime shifts and hysteresis. Parallel results were observed in the plant itself after experimental enrichment with prey. Decomposition rate of prey was the main driver of system dynamics, including the time the system remains in an anoxic state and the rate of return to an oxygenated state. Biological oxygen demand in fluenced the shape of the systems return trajectory. The combination of simulated results, sensitivity analysis and use of empirical results to parameterize the model more precisely demonstrates that the Sarracenia microecosystem model displays behaviors qualitatively similar to models of larger ecological systems.",

Integration of epigenetic information with ASD genetic results may elucidate functional insights not possible via either source of information in isolation. We used concurrent genotype and DNA methylation (DNAm) data from cord blood and peripheral blood from preschool-aged children to identify SNPs associated with DNA methylation, or methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), and combined this with publicly available fetal brain and lung meQTL lists to assess enrichment of ASD GWAS results for tissue-specific meQTLs. ASD-associated SNPs were enriched for fetal brain (OR = 3.55; p < 0.001) and peripheral blood meQTLs (OR = 1.58; p < 0.001). The CpG site targets of ASD meQTLs across cord, blood, and brain tissues were enriched for immune-related pathways, consistent with other expression and DNAm results in ASD, and revealing pathways not implicated by genes identified from ASD rare variant work. Further, DNaseI hypersensitive sites and the STAT1 and TAF1 transcription factor binding sites were enriched for meQTL target CpGs of SNPs associated with psychiatric conditions. This joint analysis of genotype and DNAm demonstrates the potential utility of both brain and blood-based DNAm for insights into ASD and psychiatric phenotypes more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Over 90% of genetic variants associated with complex human traits map to non-coding regions, but little is understood about how they modulate gene regulation in health and disease. One possible mechanism is that genetic variants affect the activity of one or more cis-regulatory elements leading to gene expression variation in specific cell types. To identify such cases, we analyzed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq profiles from activated CD4+ T cells of up to 105 healthy donors. We found that regions of accessible chromatin (ATAC-peaks) are co-accessible at kilobase and megabase resolution, in patterns consistent with the 3D organization of chromosomes measured by in situ Hi-C in T cells. 15% of genetic variants located within ATAC-peaks affected the accessibility of the corresponding peak through disrupting binding sites for transcription factors important for T cell differentiation and activation. These ATAC quantitative trait nucleotides (ATAC-QTNs) have the largest effects on co-accessible peaks, are associated with gene expression from the same aliquot of cells, are rarely affecting core binding motifs, and are enriched for autoimmune disease variants. Our results provide insights into how natural genetic variants modulate cis- regulatory elements, in isolation or in concert, to influence gene expression in primary immune cells that play a key role in many human diseases.",

    "abstract": "The antisaccade task is a classic paradigm used to study the voluntary control of eye movements. It requires participants to suppress a reactive eye movement to a visual target and to concurrently initiate a saccade in the opposite direction. Although several models have been proposed to explain error rates and reaction times in this task, no formal model comparison has yet been performed. Here, we describe a Bayesian modeling approach to the antisaccade task that allows us to formally compare different models on the basis of their evidence. First, we provide a formal likelihood function of actions (pro- and antisaccades) and reaction times based on previously published models. Second, we introduce the Stochastic Early Reaction, Inhibition, and late Action model (SERIA), a novel model postulating two different mechanisms that interact in the antisaccade task: an early GO/NO-GO race decision process and a late GO/GO decision process. Third, we apply these models to a data set from an experiment with three mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials. Bayesian model comparison demonstrates that the SERIA model explains the data better than competing models that do not incorporate a late decision process. Moreover, we show that the race decision processes postulated by the SERIA model are, to a large extent, insensitive to the cue presented on a single trial. Finally, we use parameter estimates to demonstrate that changes in reaction time and error rate due to the probability of a trial type (prosaccade or antisaccade) are best explained by faster or slower inhibition and the probability of generating late voluntary prosaccades.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOne widely replicated finding in schizophrenia research is that patients tend to make more errors in the antisaccade task, a psychometric paradigm in which participants are required to look in the opposite direction of a visual cue. This deficit has been suggested to be an endophenotype of schizophrenia, as first order relatives of patients tend to show similar but milder deficits. Currently, most models applied to experimental findings in this task are limited to fit average reaction times and error rates. Here, we propose a novel statistical model that fits experimental data from the antisaccade task, beyond summary statistics. The model is inspired by the hypothesis that antisaccades are the result of several competing decision processes that interact nonlinearly with each other. In applying this model to a relatively large experimental data set, we show that mean reaction times and error rates do not fully reflect the complexity of the processes that are likely to underlie experimental findings. In the future, our model could help to understand the nature of the deficits observed in schizophrenia by providing a statistical tool to study their biological underpinnings.",

The current study aimed to understand the developmental signaling cues that regulate bud tip progenitor cells in the human fetal lung, which are present during branching morphogenesis, and to use this information to induce a bud tip progenitor-like population from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro. We identified that FGF7, CHIR-99021 and RA maintained isolated human fetal lung epithelial bud tip progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state in vitro, and led to the induction of a 3-dimensional lung-like epithelium from hPSCs. 3-dimensional hPSC-derived lung tissue was initially patterned, with airway-like interior domains and bud tip-like progenitor domains at the periphery. Epithelial bud tip-like domains could be isolated, expanded and maintained as a nearly homogeneous population by serial passaging. Comparisons between human fetal lung epithelial bud tip cells and hPSC-derived bud tip-like cells were carried out using immunostaining, in situ hybridization and transcriptome-wide analysis, and revealed that in vitro derived tissue was highly similar to native lung. hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip-like structures survived in vitro for over 16 weeks, could be easily frozen and thawed and maintained multi-lineage potential. Furthermore, hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip progenitors successfully engrafted in the proximal airways of injured immunocompromised NSG mouse lungs, where they persisted for up to 6 weeks and gave rise to several lung epithelial lineages.",

    "abstract": "An impressive number of researchers have devoted a great amount of effort toward examining various predictors of criminal justice processing outcomes. Indeed, a vast amount of research has examined various individual- and aggregate-level predictors of arrests, incarceration, and sentencing decisions. To this point, less attention has been devoted toward uncovering the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on variation in risk for criminal justice processing. As a result, the current study employs a behavioral genetic design in order to help fill this void in the existing literature. Using twin data from a national sample of youth, the current study produced evidence suggesting that genetic factors accounted for at least a portion of variance in risk for incarceration among female twins and probation among male twins. Shared and nonshared environmental influences accounted for the variance in risk for arrest among both female and male twins, probation among female twins, and incarceration among male twins. Ultimately, it appears that risk for contact with the criminal justice system and criminal justice processing is structured by a combination of factors beyond shared cultural and neighborhood environments, and appear to also include genetic factors as well. Moving forward, continuing to not use genetically sensitive research designs capable of estimating the role of genetic and nonshared environmental influences on criminal justice outcomes may result in misleading results.",

Reproductive interference is considered a strong ecological force, potentially leading to species exclusion. This supposes that the net effect of reproductive interactions is strongly negative for one of the species involved. Testing this requires a comprehensive analysis of interspecific reproductive interactions, accounting for the order and timing of mating events, and for their effects on either fertility or fecundity. To this aim, we measured reproductive interactions between a focal species, Tetranychus urticae, and an invasive (T.evansi) and a resident (T. ludeni) species, varying the mating sequence and interval, and measuring the effect of such crosses on fecundity and offspring sex ratio (a measure of fertility, as these species are haplodiploid). We found that mating with heterospecifics affected fecundity and sex ratio negatively, but also positively, depending on the species involved, and on the order and timing of mating events. Overall, the net effect of reproductive interactions was weak despite strong effects of particular events. In natural situations, the outcome of reproductive interactions will thus hinge upon the frequency of each event.",

Examples are cytoplasmic elements such as maternally inherited bacteria that cause feminization, male-killing, parthenogenesis and cytoplasmic incompatibility. We demonstrate, for the first time, that segregation distortion, a phenomenon so far seen only for nuclear genetic elements, can also be caused by a cytoplasmic element, the ubiquitous endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia. For Eurema mandarina butterfly lineages with a Z0 sex chromosome constitution, we provide direct and conclusive evidence that Wolbachia induces production of all-female progeny by a dual role: the compensation for the female-determining function that is absent in Z0 lineages (feminization) and the prevention of maternal sex chromosome inheritance to offspring as a specific type of segregation distortion. Therefore, our findings highlight that both sex determination and chromosome inheritance -- crucially important developmental processes of higher eukaryotes -- can be manipulated by cytoplasmic parasites.",

In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION platform to perform long amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using a multi-locus approach.\\n\\nResultsAfter compiling a robust database by parsing and extracting the rrn bacterial region from more than 67,000 complete or draft bacterial genomes, we demonstrated that the data obtained during sequencing of the long amplicon in the MinION device using R9 and R9.4 chemistries was sufficient to study two mock microbial communities in a multiplex manner and to almost completely reconstruct the microbial diversity contained in the HM782D and D6305 mock communities.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, we presented a novel approach consisting of multi-locus and long amplicon sequencing using the MinION MkIb DNA sequencer and R9 and R9.4 chemistries that help to overcome the main disadvantage of this portable sequencing platform. Furthermore, the nanopore sequencing library constructed with the last releases of pore chemistry (R9.4) and sequencing kit (SQK-LSK108) permitted to retrieve the higher level of 1D read accuracy sufficient to characterize the microbial species present in each mock community analysed. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and new library protocols able to produce rapid 1D libraries, will provide more reliable information in near future. Such data will be useful for more comprehensive and faster specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems.",

An invariant cross-subunit Gly-cisPro motif forms the mechanistic basis of strict L-amino acid rejection from the catalytic site. Here, we present the identification of a DTD variant, named ATD (Animalia-specific tRNA deacylase), that harbors a Gly-transPro motif. The cis-to-trans switch causes a \\\"gain of function\\\" through L-chiral selectivity in ATD resulting in the clearing of L-alanine mischarged on tRNAThr(G4*U69) by eukaryotic AlaRS. The biochemical proofreading activity of ATD is conserved across diverse classes of phylum Chordata. Animalia genomes enriched in tRNAThr(G4*U69) genes are in strict association with the presence of ATD, underlining the mandatory requirement of a dedicated factor to proofread tRNA misaminoacylation. The study highlights the emergence of ATD during genome expansion as a key event associated with the evolution of Animalia.",

    "abstract": "Sheep are a key source of meat, milk and fibre for the global livestock sector, and an important biomedical model. Global analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues has aided genome annotation and supported functional annotation of mammalian genes. We present a large-scale RNA-Seq dataset representing all the major organ systems from adult sheep and from several juvenile, neonatal and prenatal developmental time points. The Ovis aries reference genome (Oar v3.1) includes 27,504 genes (20,921 protein coding), of which 25,350 (19,921 protein coding) had detectable expression in at least one tissue in the sheep gene expression atlas dataset. Network-based cluster analysis of this dataset grouped genes according to their expression pattern. The principle of  guilt by association was used to infer the function of uncharacterised genes from their co-expression with genes of known function. We describe the overall transcriptional signatures present in the sheep gene expression atlas and assign those signatures, where possible, to specific cell populations or pathways. The findings are related to innate immunity by focusing on clusters with an immune signature, and to the advantages of cross-breeding by examining the patterns of genes exhibiting the greatest expression differences between purebred and crossbred animals. This high-resolution gene expression atlas for sheep is, to our knowledge, the largest transcriptomic dataset from any livestock species to date. It provides a resource to improve the annotation of the current reference genome for sheep, presenting a model transcriptome for ruminants and insight into gene, cell and tissue function at multiple developmental stages.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySheep are ruminant mammals kept as livestock for the production of meat, milk and wool in agricultural industries across the globe. Genetic and genomic information can be used to improve production traits such as disease resiliance. The sheep genome is however missing important information relating to gene function and many genes, which may be important for productivity, have no informative gene name. This can be remedied using RNA-Sequencing to generate a global expression profile of all protein-coding genes, across multiple organ systems and developmental stages. Clustering genes based on their expression profile across tissues and cells allows us to assign function to those genes. If for example a gene with no informative gene name is expressed in macrophages and is found within a cluster of known macrophage related genes it is likely to be involved in macrophage function and play a role in innate immunity. This information improves the quality of the reference genome and provides insight into biological processes underlying the complex traits that influence the productivity of sheep and other livestock species.",

Here we perform in vivo single molecule imaging in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos of the transcription factor Bicoid that forms a gradient and initiates patterning along the anteroposterior axis. We observe that Bicoid binds to DNA with a rapid off-rate, such that its average occupancy at target loci is on-rate dependent, a property required for concentration-sensitive regulation. Surprisingly, we also observe abundant specific DNA binding in posterior nuclei, where Bicoid levels are vanishingly low. Live embryo imaging reveals spatiotemporal \\\"hubs\\\" of local high Bicoid concentration that are dependent on the ubiquitous maternal factor Zelda. We propose that localized modulation of transcription factor on-rates via clustering, provides a general mechanism to facilitate binding to low-affinity targets, and that this may be a prevalent feature directing other developmental transcription networks.",

    "abstract": "Executive function (EF) is a regulatory construct of learning and general cognitive abilities. Genetic variations underlying the architecture of cognitive phenotypes are likely to affect EF and associated behaviors. Mice lacking one of Ntng gene paralogs, encoding the vertebrate brain-specific presynaptic Netrin-G proteins, exhibit prominent deficits in the EF control. Brain areas responsible for gating the bottom-up and top-down information flows differentially express Ntng1 and Ntng2, distinguishing neuronal circuits involved in perception and cognition. As a result, high and low cognitive demand tasks (HCD and LCD, respectively) modulate Ntng1 and Ntng2 associations either with attention and impulsivity (AI) or working memory (WM), in a complementary manner. During the LCD Ntng2supported neuronal gating of AI and WM dominates over the Ntng1-associated circuits. This is reversed during the HCD, when the EF requires a larger contribution of cognitive control, supported by Ntng1, over the Ntng2 pathways. Since human NTNG orthologs have been reported to affect human IQ (1), and an array of neurological disorders (2), we believe that mouse Ntng gene paralogs serve an analogous role but influencing brain executive functioning.",

Exceptions to this universal plastid genome architecture are very few and include the dinoflagellates where genes are located on DNA minicircles. Here we report on the highly deviant chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae, which is entirely fragmented into hairpin plasmids. Short and long read high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are encoded on 1-7 kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC-content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes and conserved non-coding regions putatively involved in replication and/or expression. We propose that these contigs correspond to linear single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin plasmids. The Boodlea chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their corresponding orthologs. The origin of this highly deviant chloroplast genome likely occurred before the emergence of the Cladophorales, and coincided with an elevated transfer of chloroplast genes to the nucleus. A chloroplast genome that is composed only of linear DNA molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes and highlights unexpected variation in the plastid genome architecture.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the key obstacle to malaria elimination in Asia and Latin America, largely attributed to its ability to form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper-cells) in the host liver that escape treatment and cause relapsing infections. The decision to form hypnozoites is made early in the liver infection and may already be set in sporozoites prior to invasion. To better understand these early stages of infection, we undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic and histone epigenetic characterization of P. vivax sporozoites. The salivary-gland sporozoite transcriptome is heavily composed of transcripts associated with functions needed for early infection of the vertebrate host and development within hepatocytes. Through comparisons to recently published proteome data for the P. vivax sporozoite, our study finds that although highly transcribed, these transcripts are not detectable as proteins and may be regulated through translational repression; a finding we test for a small subset of transcripts and proteins through immunofluorescent microscopy of sporozoites and liver stages in humanized mice. We identify differential transcription between the sporozoite and published transcriptomes of asexual blood-stages and mixed versus hypnozoite-enriched liver stages. These comparisons point to multiple layers of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational control that appear active in sporozoites and to a lesser extent hypnozoites, but largely absent in replicating liver schizonts or mixed blood-stages. Common transcripts up-regulated in sporozoites and hypnozoites compared to mixed (i.e., schizont) liver-stages identify genes linked to dormancy/persistence in bacteria, amoebae and plants. We also characterise histone epigenetic modifications in the P. vivax sporozoite and explore their role in regulating transcription. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the sporozoite as a tightly programmed stage primed to infect the human host and identifies potential mechanisms for hypnozoite-formation that may be further explored in liver stage models.",

For a typical cell line with a doubling time of 12 hours (or longer), a standard cell proliferation assay conducted over 24 hours provides excellent information about the low-density exponential growth rate, but limited information about crowding effects that occur at higher densities. To explore how we can best detect and quantify crowding effects, we present a suite of in silico proliferation assays where cells proliferate according to a generalised logistic growth model. Using approximate Bayesian computation we show that data from a standard cell proliferation assay cannot reliably distinguish between classical logistic growth and more general non-logistic growth models. We then explore, and quantify, the trade-off between increasing the duration of the experiment and the associated decrease in uncertainty in the crowding mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) has been previously used to investigate peptide and protein binding to lipid membranes, as it allows for very low amounts of sample, short measurement times and equilibrium binding conditions. Labeling only one of the binding partners however comes with certain drawbacks, as it relies on identifying binding events by a change in diffusion coefficient. Since peptide and protein aggregation can obscure specific binding and since non-stoichiometric binding necessitates the explicit choice of a statistical distribution for the number of bound ligands, we additionally label the liposomes and perform dual-color Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (dcFCCS). We develop a theoretical framework showing that dcFCCS amplitudes allow calculation of the degree of ligand binding and the concentration of unbound ligand, leading to a binding model-independent binding curve. As the degree of labeling of the ligands does not factor into the measured quantities, it is permissible to mix labeled and unlabeled ligand, thereby extending the range of usable protein concentrations and accessible dissociation constants KD. The total protein concentration, but not the fraction of labeled protein needs to be known. In this work, we apply our dcFCCS analysis scheme to Sar1p, a protein of the COPII complex, which binds  major-minor-mix liposomes. A Langmuir isotherm model yields KD = (2.1{+/-}1.1)M as the single site dissociation constant. The dual-color FCCS framework presented here is highly versatile for biophysical analysis of binding interactions. It may be applied to many types of fluorescently labeled ligands and small diffusing particles, including nanodiscs and liposomes containing membrane protein receptors.",

One such path is Akt/mTORC1/S6K1 that controls protein synthesis, cell survival, and proliferation. Here we show that a negative feedback controls activation of S6K1 through this pathway. Due to this negative feedback, a sustained phospho-Akt signal generates a transient pulse of phospho-S6K1. We have created a mathematical model for this circuit. Analysis of this model shows that the negative feedback acts as a filter and preferentially allows a signal, with sharp and faster rise of phospho-Akt, to induce pronounced activation of S6K1. It blocks an input with a fast oscillation of phospho-Akt to flow through this path. We show that this negative feedback leads to differential activation of S6K1 by Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor 1. Such differential effect may explain the difference in the mitogenic effect of these two molecules.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInvestigators often interpret genome-wide data by analyzing the expression levels of genes within pathways. While this within-pathway analysis is routine, the products of any one pathway can affect the activity of other pathways. Past efforts to identify relationships between biological processes have evaluated overlap in knowledge bases or evaluated changes that occur after specific treatments. Individual experiments can highlight condition-specific pathway-pathway relationships; however, constructing a complete network of such relationships across many conditions requires analyzing results from many studies.\n\nResultsWe developed PathCORE-T framework by implementing existing methods to identify pathway-pathway transcriptional relationships evident across a broad data compendium. PathCORE-T is applied to the output of feature construction algorithms; it identifies pairs of pathways observed in features more than expected by chance as functionally co-occurring. We demonstrate PathCORE-T by analyzing an existing eADAGE model of a microbial compendium and building and analyzing NMF features from the TCGA dataset of 33 cancer types. The PathCORE-T framework includes a demonstration web interface, with source code, that users can launch to (1) visualize the network and (2) review the expression levels of associated genes in the original data. PathCORE-T creates and displays the network of globally co-occurring pathways based on features observed in a machine learning analysis of gene expression data.\n\nConclusionsThe PathCORE-T framework identifies transcriptionally co-occurring pathways from the results of unsupervised analysis of gene expression data and visualizes the relationships between pathways as a network. PathCORE-T recapitulated previously described pathway-pathway relationships and suggested experimentally testable additional hypotheses that remain to be explored.",

    "abstract": "The island of Madagascar has a unique biodiversity, mainly located in the tropical forests of the island. This biodiversity is highly threatened by anthropogenic deforestation. Existing historical forest maps at national level are scattered and have substantial gaps which prevent an exhaustive assessment of long-term deforestation trends in Madagascar. In this study, we combined historical national forest cover maps (covering the period 1953-2000) with a recent global annual tree cover loss dataset (2001-2014) to look at six decades of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Madagascar (from 1953 to 2014). We produced new forest cover maps at 30 m resolution for the year 1990 and annually from 2000 to 2014 over the full territory of Madagascar. We estimated that Madagascar has lost 44% of its natural forest cover over the period 1953-2014 (including 37% over the period 1973-2014). Natural forests cover 8.9 Mha in 2014 (15% of the national territory) and include 4.4 Mha (50%) of moist forests, 2.6 Mha (29%) of dry forests, 1.7 Mha of spiny forests (19%) and 177,000 ha (2%) of mangroves. Since 2005, the annual deforestation rate has progressively increased in Madagascar to reach 99,000 ha/yr during 2010-2014 (corresponding to a rate of 1.1%/yr). Around half of the forest (46%) is now located at less than 100 m from the forest edge. Our approach could be replicated to other developing countries with tropical forest. Accurate forest cover change maps can be used to assess the effectiveness of past and current conservation programs and implement new strategies for the future. In particular, forest maps and estimates can be used in the REDD+ framework which aims at \\\"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation\\\" and for optimizing the current protected area network.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms by which P. knowlesi and P. vivax invade human red blood cells have long been studied. Malaria parasite erythrocytic stages comprise of repeated bursts of parasites via cyclical invasion of host RBCs using dedicated receptor-ligand interactions. A family of erythrocyte-binding proteins (EBPs) from P. knowlesi and P. vivax attach to human Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) via their Duffy binding-like domains (Pv-DBL and Pk-DBL respectively) for invasion. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview that presents new insights on the atomic resolution interactions that underpin the binding of human DARC with Pk/Pv-DBLs. Based on extensive structural and biochemical data, we provide a novel, testable and overarching interaction model that rationalizes even contradictory pieces of evidence that have so far existed in the literature on Pk/Pv-DBL/DARC binding determinants. We address the conundrum of how parasite-encoded Pk/Pv-DBLs recognize human DARC via its two sulfated tyrosine residues. We collate evidence for two distinct DARC integration sites on Pk/Pv-DBLs that together likely engage the DARCs sulfated extracellular domain. These analyses are important for both malaria vaccine and inhibitor development efforts that are targeted at abrogating Pk/Pv-DBL/DARC coupling as one avenue to prevent invasion of P. vivax into human red blood cells.",

    "abstract": "An ideal observer will give equivalent weight to sources of information that are equally reliable. However, when averaging visual information, human observers tend to downweight or discount features that are relatively outlying or deviant ( robust averaging). Why humans adopt an integration policy that discards important decision information remains unknown. Here, observers were asked to judge the average tilt in a circular array of high-contrast gratings, relative to an orientation boundary defined by a central reference grating. Observers showed robust averaging of orientation, but the extent to which they did so was a positive predictor of their overall performance. Using computational simulations, we show that although robust averaging is suboptimal for a perfect integrator, it paradoxically enhances performance in the presence of \\\"late\\\" noise, i.e. which corrupts decisions during integration. In other words, robust decision strategies increase the brains resilience to noise arising in neural computations during decision-making.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHumans often make decisions by averaging information from multiple sources. When all the sources are equally reliable, they should all have equivalent impact (or weight) on the decisions of an \\\"ideal\\\" observer, i.e. one with perfect memory. However, recent experiments have suggested that humans give unequal weight to sources that are deviant or unusual, a phenomenon called \\\"robust averaging\\\". Here, we use computer simulations to try to understand why humans do this. Our simulations show that under the assumption that information processing is limited by a source of internal uncertainty that we call \\\"late\\\" noise, robust averaging actually leads to improved performance. Using behavioural testing, we replicate the finding of robust averaging in a cohort of healthy humans, and show that those participants that engage in robust averaging perform better on the task. This study thus provides new information about the limitations on human decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Among neuromodulatory systems, the noradrenergic system remains one of the least understood. Several theories have pointed out its implication in behavioural flexibility and more recently in motivation, with a strong role in effort processing. Here, we designed a sequential cost/benefit decision task to test the causal role of noradrenaline in these two functions. We manipulated noradrenaline using clonidine, an alpha-2 noradrenergic receptor agonist, which reduces central noradrenaline levels. Clonidine had two distinct effects: it decreased choice volatility (without affecting the cost/benefit trade off) and reduced force production. Because the effects were independent, they cannot be accounted for by a non-specific effect on arousal. Altogether, these results support the global implication of noradrenaline in facing challenging situations in two complementary ways: by modulating behavioural volatility, which would facilitate adaptation depending on the lability of the environment, and by modulating the mobilization of resources to face immediate challenges.",

The data structure has a single parameter k, is straightforward to implement and is tractable for large genomes with high sequencing depth. It also enables representation of multiple samples simultaneously to facilitate comparison. However, unlike the string graph, a de Bruijn graph does not retain long range information that is inherent in the read data. For this reason, applications that rely on de Bruijn graphs can produce sub-optimal results given their input.\\n\\nResultsWe present a novel assembly graph data structure: the Linked de Bruijn Graph (LdBG). Constructed by adding annotations on top of a de Bruijn graph, it stores long range connectivity information through the graph. We show that with error-free data it is possible to losslessly store and recover sequence from a Linked de Bruijn graph. With assembly simulations we demonstrate that the LdBG data structure outperforms both the de Bruijn graph and the String Graph Assembler (SGA). Finally we apply the LdBG to Klebsiella pneumoniae short read data to make large (12 kbp) variant calls, which we validate using PacBio sequencing data, and to characterise the genomic context of drug-resistance genes.\\n\\nAvailabilityLinked de Bruijn Graphs and associated algorithms are implemented as part of McCortex, available under the MIT license at https://github.com/mcvean/mccortex.\\n\\nContactturner.isaac@gmail.com.",

    "abstract": "The application of RNA interference (RNAi) to mammalian cells has provided the means to perform phenotypic screens to determine the functions of genes. Although RNAi has revolutionized loss of function genetic experiments, it has been difficult to systematically assess the prevalence and consequences of off-target effects. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) represents an unprecedented resource to study the gene expression consequences of expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Analysis of signatures for over 13,000 shRNAs applied in 9 cell lines revealed that miRNA-like off-target effects of RNAi are far stronger and more pervasive than generally appreciated. We show that mitigating off-target effects is feasible in these datasets via computational methodologies to produce a Consensus Gene Signature (CGS). In addition, we compared RNAi technology to clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based knockout by analysis of 373 sgRNAs in 6 cells lines, and show that the on-target efficacies are comparable, but CRISPR technology is far less susceptible to systematic off-target effects. These results will help guide the proper use and analysis of loss-of-function reagents for the determination of gene function.",

As interactions occur at different scales, we explored the data at 1, 5, 10, and 15 km2. We proposed four hypotheses structuring the mammal community: H1. direct competition between carnivores and herbivores; H2-4: indirect competition produced by each of three types of herbivore diet specialization: H2. ruminants and non-ruminants, H3. grazers and browsers, and H4. a four-way division of small and large grazers and browsers. We used the software CoOccur to implement a robus test for evidence of our hypotheses against null models of community assemblage. At 5, 10, and 15km2 scales, the results supported a competition mechanism in the majority of years for hypotheses H1, H3, and H4, and facilitation in H2. At the finest spatial scale (1km2), we saw evidence for a mixture of competitive, neutral and facilitative process. These results suggest strong, large-scale effects of interspecific interactions on distributions of African megafauna, which may not operate at a more local (1km2) scale, underscoring the importance of scale and mechanism in the guild structure of communities.",

However, the addition of beef flavour or honey flavour to bait did not increase bait removal rates compared to untreated bait.\\n\\nThere was limited evidence of learning (by foxes and other species responsible for removing the bait) at one of the permanent study sites but no evidence of such behaviour at the other site. There was no evidence of consistent seasonal differences in bait removal rates.\\n\\nIt was concluded that the use of attractants may increase bait removal rate in areas where bait removal rate is low; but where bait removal rate is high (in most rural areas of Britain) the addition of attractants or flavours offers little advantage.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic bacterial infection imposes considerable cellular stress on the host and often leads to attenuation of mRNA translation. In this translation-suppressive environment, it is unclear how the host synthesizes various antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to mount innate immune response. Here, we use Drosophila as a model to demonstrate that AMP production during infection relies on a translation bias mechanism mediated by the inhibitor of cap-dependent translation 4E-BP (Drosophila Thor), and the AMP 5UTRs that can undergo cap-independent translation. We found that 4E-BP is induced upon infection with the pathogenic bacteria Ecc15 by the stress-responsive transcription factor ATF4, and its upstream kinase GCN2. Moreover, loss of gcn2, atf4 or 4e-bp compromised immunity against Ecc15. In 4E-BP mutants, the transcriptional induction of AMPs after infection was unaffected, while the protein levels of AMPs were substantially reduced in their hemolymph. Analysis of the 5UTRs of AMPs using cell-based bicistronic reporters and in vitro translation analysis indicated that AMPs are translated in a cap-independent mechanism. Analysis of bicistronic reporters in the presence of 4E-BP indicate that infection enhances cap-independent translational activity associated with AMP 5UTRs, accounting for enhanced AMP translation during infection.\\n\\nHighlights O_LI4E-BP is transcriptionally induced by GCN2/ATF signaling in response to bacterial infection\\nC_LIO_LI4E-BP mutants show unaltered antimicrobial peptide (AMP) transcript levels, but have reduced AMP translation\\nC_LIO_LIAMP 5UTRs are translated cap-independently\\nC_LIO_LITranslation bias by 4E-BP drives cap-independent AMP translation\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Acquisition of foreign DNA by natural transformation is an important mechanism of adaptation and evolution in diverse microbial species. Here, we characterize the mechanism of ComM, a broadly conserved AAA+ protein previously implicated in homologous recombination of transforming DNA (tDNA) in naturally competent Gram-negative bacterial species. In vivo, we found that ComM was required for efficient comigration of linked genetic markers in Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi, which is consistent with a role in branch migration. Also, ComM was particularly important for integration of tDNA with increased sequence heterology, suggesting that its activity promotes the acquisition of novel DNA sequences. In vitro, we showed that purified ComM binds ssDNA, oligomerizes into a hexameric ring, and has bidirectional helicase and branch migration activity. Based on these data, we propose a model for tDNA integration during natural transformation. This study provides mechanistic insight into the enigmatic steps involved in tDNA integration and uncovers the function of a protein required for this conserved mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "1Vision involves complex neuronal dynamics that link the sensory stream to behaviour. To capture the richness and complexity of the visual world and the behaviour it entails, we used an ecologically valid task with a rich set of real-world object images. We investigated how human brain activity, resolved in space with functional MRI and in time with magnetoencephalography, links the sensory stream to behavioural responses. We found that behaviour-related brain activity emerged rapidly in the ventral visual pathway within 200ms of stimulus onset. The link between stimuli, brain activity, and behaviour could not be accounted for by either category membership or visual features (as provided by an artificial deep neural network model). Our results identify behaviourally-relevant brain activity during object vision, and suggest that object representations guiding behaviour are complex and can neither be explained by visual features or semantic categories alone. Our findings support the view that visual representations in the ventral visual stream need to be understood in terms of their relevance to behaviour, and highlight the importance of complex behavioural assessment for human brain mapping.",

    "abstract": "HighlightMandelonitrile, and hence cyanogenic glycosides turnover, is involved in salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis in peach plants under control and stress conditions. A third pathway for SA synthesis in peach is proposed.\\n\\nAbstractDespite the long-established importance of salicylic acid (SA) in plant stress responses and other biological processes, its biosynthetic pathway has not been fully characterized. The proposed SA synthesis originates from chorismate by two distinct pathways: isochorismate and penhylalanine (Phe) ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathways. Cyanogenesis is the process related to the release of hydrogen cyanide from endogenous cyanogenic glycosides (CNglcs), and it has been linked to plant plasticity improvement. To date, however, no relationship has been suggested between both pathways. In this work, by metabolomics and biochemical approaches (including [13C]-labelled compounds), we provide evidences showing that CNglcs turnover is involved, at least in part, in SA biosynthesis in peach plants under control and stress conditions.\\n\\nThe main CNglcs in peach are prunasin and amygdalin, with mandelonitrile (MD), synthesized from Phe, controlling their turnover. In peach plants MD is at the hub of the suggested new SA biosynthetic pathway and CNglcs turnover, regulating both the amygdalin and SA biosynthesis. MD-treated peach plants displayed increased SA levels via benzoic acid (SA precursor). In addition, MD also provides partial protection against Plum pox virus infection in peach seedlings. Thus, we proposed a third pathway, alternative to the PAL pathway, for SA synthesis in peach plants.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsDiurnal changes in solar position and intensity combined with the structural complexity of plant architecture result in highly variable and dynamic light patterns within the plant canopy. This affects productivity through the complex ways that photosynthesis responds to changes in light intensity. Current methods to characterise light dynamics, such as ray-tracing, are able to produce data with excellent spatio-temporal resolution but are computationally intensive and the resultant data are complex and high dimensional. This necessitates development of more economical models for summarising the data and for simulating realistic light patterns over the course of a day.\\n\\nMethodsHigh-resolution reconstructions of field-grown plants are assembled in various configurations to form canopies, and a forward ray-tracing algorithm is applied to the canopies to compute light dynamics at high (1 minute) temporal resolution. From the ray-tracer output, the sunlit or shaded state for each patch on the plants is determined, and these data are used to develop a novel stochastic model for the sunlit-shaded patterns. The model is designed to be straightforward to fit to data using maximum likelihood estimation, and fast to simulate from.\\n\\nKey ResultsFor a wide range of contrasting 3D canopies, the stochastic model is able to summarise, and replicate in simulations, key features of the light dynamics. When light patterns simulated from the stochastic model are used as input to a model of photoinhibition, the predicted reduction in carbon gain is similar to that from calculations based on the (extremely costly) ray-tracer data.\\n\\nConclusionsThe model provides a way to summarise highly complex data in a small number of parameters, and a cost-effective way to simulate realistic light patterns. Simulations from the model will be particularly useful for feeding into larger-scale photosynthesis models for calculating how light dynamics affects the photosynthetic productivity of canopies.",

    "abstract": "MotivationBiological networks unravel the inherent structure of molecular interactions which can lead to discovery of driver genes and meaningful pathways especially in cancer context. Often due to gene mutations, the gene expression undergoes changes and the corresponding gene regulatory network sustains some amount of localized re-wiring. The ability to identify significant changes in the interaction patterns caused by the progression of the disease can lead to the revelation of novel relevant signatures.\\n\\nMethodsThe task of identifying differential sub-networks in paired biological networks (A:control,B:case) can be re-phrased as one of finding dense communities in a single noisy differential topological (DT) graph constructed by taking absolute difference between the topological graphs of A and B. In this paper, we propose a fast two-stage approach, namely Differential Community Detection (DCD), to identify differential sub-networks as differential communities in a de-noised version of the DT graph. In the first stage, we iteratively re-order the nodes of the DT graph to determine approximate block diagonals present in the DT adjacency matrix using neighbourhood information of the nodes and Jaccard similarity. In the second stage, the ordered DT adjacency matrix is traversed along the diagonal to remove all the edges associated with a node, if that node has no immediate edges within a window. We then apply community detection methods on this de-noised DT graph to discover differential sub-networks as communities.\\n\\nResultsOur proposed DCD approach can effectively locate differential sub-networks in several simulated paired random-geometric networks and various paired scale-free graphs with different power-law exponents. The DCD approach easily outperforms community detection methods applied on the original noisy DT graph and recent statistical techniques in simulation studies. We applied DCD method on two real datasets: a) Ovarian cancer dataset to discover differential DNA co-methylation sub-networks in patients and controls; b) Glioma cancer dataset to discover the difference between the regulatory networks of IDH-mutant and IDH-wild-type. We demonstrate the potential benefits of DCD for finding network-inferred bio-markers/pathways associated with a trait of interest.\\n\\nConclusionThe proposed DCD approach overcomes the limitations of previous statistical techniques and the issues associated with identifying differential sub-networks by use of community detection methods on the noisy DT graph. This is reflected in the superior performance of the DCD method with respect to various metrics like Precision, Accuracy, Kappa and Specificity.

We demonstrate the utility of mass spectrometry-based global exposure metabolomics combined with tailored database queries and cognitive computing for comprehensive exposure assessment and the straightforward elucidation of biological effects. The METLIN Exposome database has been redesigned to help identify environmental toxicants, food contaminants and supplements, drugs, and antibiotics as well as their biotransformation products, through its expansion with over 700,000 chemical structures to now include more than 950,000 unique small molecules. More importantly, we demonstrate how the XCMS/METLIN platform now allows for the readout of the biological effect of a toxicant through metabolomic-derived pathway analysis and further, cognitive computing provides a means of assessing the role of a potential toxicant. The presented workflow addresses many of the outstanding methodological challenges current exposome research is facing and will serve to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of environmental exposures and combinatory toxic effects on human health.",

The objectives is To assess the validity of a Mainland Chinese versions of the demoralization scale (MC-DS) for using with Mainland Chinese cancer patients. In-patients sequentially recruited from a specialist tertiary-level cancer hospital in Beijing between January 2016-April 2016 completed Demoralization Scale, (DS) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Revised Life Orientation Test (CLOT-R), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and provided sociodemographic and clinical information. We determined DS factor structure and convergent and divergent validity. 296/424 (70.0%) participants reported mean DS score=30.42(SD=13.00). EFA identified 3-factors explaining 21.4%, 17.8%, and 10.6% respectively of observed variance. Respective Cronbach Alphas were 0.88, 0.84, and 0.64 (0.90 full-scale). Convergent was shown by PHQ-9 scores correlating with Factor 2 (r=0.606), and BHS and C-LOT-R scores correlating (r=0.632,r=0.407 respectively) with Factor 1. Dichotomizing demoralization (high >30, low[less double equals]30) cross-tabulated against PHQ-9 score (mood) scores revealed 47% of patients exceeded demoralization cut-off, 60% of whom were not depressed. Using mean value{+/-}SD indicated demoralization cutoffs at <17.4 (low), 17.4-43.4 (medium) and >43.4 (high). Overall 71% met criteria for medium demoralization, and 15% for high demoralization. Sixty percent of all medium demoralization patients were not depressed, but only 5% of high demoralization patients were not depressed. The conclusion is that the Mainland Chinese Demoralization Scale is useful for detecting mild-to-moderate demoralization in cancer patients but at higher scores has poor specificity against depression.",

Poultry predictor variables recently became much more important than before, supporting the assumption of much wider H7N9 transmission in the chicken reservoir, that could be linked to increases in pathogenicity.

However, the availability, quality, and general funding for early intervention programs is often lacking, leaving newly diagnosed children without adequate and sufficient therapy during the most critical early period of their development. Parent-administered iPad-assisted therapy has the potential to reduce the gap between the amount of therapy recommended for children with ASD and the amount they receive. However it is unclear how ASD severity and age influence a childs ability to engage with and learn from computerized cognitive exercises. In this manuscript, we describe data from a tablet-based therapeutic application administered by parents to 1,514 young children with ASD over the course of four to twelve months. We report that older children and children with milder forms of ASD performed better and progressed faster in cognitive and language exercises. However, most children were able to engage with and learn from exercises independent of their age or ASD severity. This data confirm that tablet-based cognitive and language exercises can be successfully administered by parents to children as young as two years of age over the course of many months independent of ASD severity.",

Though much effort has gone into characterizing and mitigating mismatch tolerance for the most widely adopted OGN, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), potential off-target interactions may still limit applications where on-target specificity is critical. Here we present a new axis to control mismatch sensitivity along the recognition-conferring spacer sequence of SpCas9s guide RNA (gRNA). We introduce mismatch-evading loweredthermostability guides (melt-guides) and exhibit how nucleotide-type substitutions in the spacer can reduce cleavage of sequences mismatched by as few as a single base pair. Cotransfecting melt-guides into human cell culture with an exonuclease involved in DNA repair, we observe indel formation on a standard genomic target at approximately 70% the rate of canonical gRNA and undetectable on off-target data.",

WebMeV (https://mev.tm4.org) is an open-source, web-based tool that gives users access to sophisticated tools for analysis of RNA-Seq and other data in an interface designed to democratize data access. WebMeV combines cloud-based technologies with a simple user interface to allow users to access large public data sets such as that from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or to upload their own. The interface allows users to visualize data and to apply advanced data mining analysis methods to explore the data and draw biologically meaningful conclusions. We provide an overview of WebMeV and demonstrate two simple use cases that illustrate the value of putting data analysis in the hands of those looking to explore the underlying biology of the systems being studied.",

    "abstract": "Changes in spatial chromatin interactions are now emerging as a unifying mechanism or-chestrating regulation of gene expression. Evolution of chromatin conformation capture methods into Hi-C sequencing technology now allows an insight into chromatin interactions on a genome-wide scale. However, Hi-C data contains many DNA sequence- and technology-driven biases. These biases prevent effective comparison of chromatin interactions aimed at identifying genomic regions differentially interacting between, disease-normal states or different cell types. Several methods have been developed for normalizing individual Hi-C datasets. However, they fail to account for biases between two or more Hi-C datasets, hindering comparative analysis of chromatin interactions. We developed a simple and effective method HiCcompare for the joint normalization and differential analysis of multiple Hi-C datasets. The method avoids constraining Hi-C data within a rigid statistical model, allowing a data-driven normalization of biases using locally weighted linear regression (loess). The method identifies region-specific chromatin interaction changes complementary to changes due to large-scale genomic rearrangements, such as copy number variants (CNVs). HiCcompare outperforms methods for normalizing individual Hi-C datasets in detecting a priori known chromatin interaction differences in simulated and real-life settings while detecting biologically relevant changes. HiCcompare is freely available as a Bioconductor R package https://bioconductor.org/packages/HiCcompare/.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAdvances in chromosome conformation capture sequencing technologies (Hi-C) have sparked interest in studying the 3-dimensional (3D) chromatin interaction structure of the human genome. The 3D structure of the genome is now considered as a primary regulator of gene expression. Changes to the 3D chromatin interactions are now emerging as a hallmark of cancer and other complex diseases. With the growing availability of Hi-C data generated under different conditions (e.g. tumor-normal, cell-type-specific), methods are needed to compare them. However, biases in Hi-C data hinder their comparative analysis. To account for biases, several normalization techniques have been developed for removing biases in individual Hi-C datasets, but very few were designed to account for between-datasets biases. We developed a new method and R package HiCcompare for the joint normalization of multiple Hi-C datasets and differential chromatin interaction detection. Our results show the superiority of our joint normalization methods compared to methods for normalizing individual datasets in detecting true chromatin interaction changes. HiCcompare enables further research into discovering the dynamics of 3D genomic changes.",

For example, optical tweezers made from Laguerre-Gaussian or donut beams display an increased axial trap strength and can impart angular momentum to rotate a specimen. However, their application to precision, biophysical measurements remains limited as their are a number of challenges to applying this tool to optical force spectroscopy. One notable complication, not present when trapping with a Gaussian beam, is that the polarization of the trap light can significantly affect the tweezers strength as well as the precise location of the trap. In this article, we provide a practical implementation of a donut beam optical tweezers for applying axial forces. We show how to precisely calibrate the height of the optical trap above the coverslip surface while accounting for focal shifts in the trap position that arise due to radiation pressure, mismatches in the index of refraction, and polarization induced intensity variations.",

In unicellular eukaryotes, loss of the noncanonical tubulins, delta-tubulin and epsilon tubulin, result in loss of the triplet microtubule structure. However, the contribution of triplet microtubules to mammalian centriole formation and stability is unknown. Here, we report the first characterization of delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin null human cells. Centrioles in cells lacking either delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin lack triplet microtubules and fail to undergo centriole maturation. These aberrant centrioles are formed de novo each cell cycle, but are unstable and do not persist to the next cell cycle, leading to a futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration. Disintegration can be suppressed by paclitaxel treatment. Delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin physically interact, indicating that these tubulins act together to maintain triplet microtubules and that these are necessary for inheritance of centrioles from one cell cycle to the next.",

    "abstract": "A central theme in biology is to understand the molecular basis of fitness: which strategies succeed under which conditions; how are they mechanistically implemented; and which constraints shape trade-offs between alternative strategies. We approached these questions with parallel bacterial evolution experiments in chemostats. Chemostats provide a constant environment with a defined resource limitation (glucose), in which the growth rate can be controlled. Using Lactococcus lactis, we found a single mutation in a global regulator of carbon metabolism, CcpA, to confer predictable fitness improvements across multiple growth rates. In silico protein structural analysis complemented with biochemical and phenotypic assays, show that the mutation reprograms the CcpA regulon, specifically targeting transporters. This supports that membrane occupancy, rather than biosynthetic capacity, is the dominant constraint for the observed fitness enhancement. It also demonstrates that cells can modulate a pleiotropic regulator to work around limiting constraints.",

    "abstract": "During economic decisions, neurons in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the values of offered goods. Importantly, their responses adapt to the range of values available in any given context. Prima facie, range adaptation seems to provide an efficient representation. However, uncorrected adaptation in the encoding of offer values would induce arbitrary choice biases. Thus a fundamental and open question is whether range adaptation is behaviorally advantageous. Here we present a theory of optimal coding for economic decisions. In a nutshell, the representation of offer values is optimal if it ensures maximal expected payoff. In this framework, we examine the activity of offer value cells in non-human primates. We show that their firing rates are quasi-linear functions of the offered values, even when optimal tuning functions would be highly non-linear. Most importantly, we demonstrate that for linear tuning functions range adaptation maximizes the expected payoff, even if the effects of adaptation are corrected to avoid choice biases. Thus value coding in OFC is functionally rigid (linear tuning) but parametrically plastic (range adaptation with optimal gain). Importantly, the benefit of range adaptation outweighs the cost of functional rigidity. While generally suboptimal, linear tuning may facilitate transitive choices.",

    "abstract": "The study of molecular host-parasite interactions is essential to understand parasitic infection and adaptation within the host system. As well, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases require clear understanding of the molecular crosstalk between parasites and their hosts. As yet, experimental large-scale identification of host-parasite molecular interactions remains challenging and the use of in silico predictions becomes then necessary. Here, we propose a computational integrative approach to predict host-parasite protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks resulting from the infection of human by 12 different parasites. We used an orthology-based method to transfer high-confidence intra-species interactions obtained from the STRING database to the corresponding inter-species protein pairs in the host-parasite system. To reduce the number of spurious predictions, our approach uses either the parasites predicted secretome and membrane proteins or only the secretome depending on whether they are uni- or multicellular respectively. Besides, the host proteome is filtered for proteins expressed in selected cellular localizations and tissues supporting the parasites growth. We evaluated the inferred interactions by analyzing the enriched biological processes and pathways in the predicted networks and their association to known parasitic invasion and evasion mechanisms. The resulting PPI networks were compared across parasites to identify common mechanisms that may define a global pathogenic hallmark. The predicted PPI networks can be visualized and downloaded at http://orthohpi.jensenlab.org.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is a collection of interactions between proteins from one or more organisms. Host-parasite PPIs are key to understanding the biology of different parasitic diseases, since predicting PPIs enable to know more about the parasite invasion, infection and persist. Our understanding of PPIs between host and parasites is still very limited, as no many systematic experimental studies have so far been performed. Efficacy of treatments for parasitic diseases is limited and in many cases parasites evolve resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs or vaccines for these neglected diseases, and thus interest in the functions and interactions of proteins associated with parasitism processes. Here we developed an in silico method to shed light on the interactome in twelve human parasites by combining an orthology based strategy and integrating, domain-domain interaction data, sub-cellular localization and to give a spatial context, we only took in to account those human tissues that support the parasites tropism. Here we show that is possible to identify relevant interactions across different parasites and their human host and that these interactions are well supported based on the biology of the parasites.",
