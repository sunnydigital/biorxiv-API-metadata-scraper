    "abstract": "A model of genome evolution is proposed. Based on several general assumptions the evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. Both the deterministic classical equation and the stochastic quantum equation are proposed. The classical equation is written in a form of of second-order differential equations on nucleotide frequencies varying in time. It is proved that the evolutionary equation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced logically. Two fundamental constants of time dimension, the quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for characterizing the genome evolution. During speciation the large-scale rapid change of nucleotide frequency makes the evolutionary inertia of the dynamical variables of the genome largely decreasing or losing. That leads to the occurrence of quantum phase of the evolution. The observed smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the classical and quantum phases. In this theory the probability of new-species formation is calculable from the first-principle. To deep the discussions we consider avian genome evolution as an example. More concrete forms on the assumed potential in fundamental equations, namely the diversity and the environmental potential, are introduced. Through the numerical calculations we found that the existing experimental data on avian macroevolution are consistent with our theory. Particularly, the law of the rapid post-Cretaceous radiation of neoavian birds can be understood in the quantum theory. Finally, the present work shows the quantum law may be more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic physics, but also in genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "The importance of gut microbes to metabolic health is becoming more evident and nutrition-based therapies to alter the composition of bacterial communities to manage metabolic disease are an attractive avenue to ameliorate some effects of Western diets. While the composition of gut microbial communities can vary significantly across disease states, it is not well known if these communities have common responses to nutritional interventions. To better understand diet-bacterial community interactions, we collected biological parameters and fecal samples of overweight non-iabetic (OND) and diabetic (OD) individuals before and after daily supplementation of 2.8 g {beta}-lucan on their habitual diet for 30 days. Fecal bacterial communities in an age-atched cohort were measured by sequencing partial 16S rRNA genes and imputed metagenomic content. Unexpectedly, we observed disconnected responses of biological measurements and the bacterial community. Based on average effect size, biological measurements were greater in the OND group while effects on the bacterial community were greatest on the OD cohort, and we suspect these observations are due to the significantly lower alpha diversity in the OD cohort. Our data indicate that responses to cereal-bar supplementation are cohort specific and this should be considered when manipulating the microbiome via diet supplementation.",

    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response.

    "abstract": "Characteristics of male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been well-described, but the genetic basis of male-female copulation is largely unknown. Here we show that the white (w) gene, a classical gene for eye color, is associated with copulation success. 82.5 % of wild-type Canton-S flies copulated within 60 minutes in circular arenas, whereas few white-eyed mutants mated successfully. The w+ allele exchanged to the X chromosome or duplicated to the Y chromosome in the white-eyed genetic background rescued the defect of copulation success. The w+-associated copulation success was independent of eye color phenotype. Addition of the mini-white (mw+) gene to the white-eyed mutant rescued the defect of copulation success in a manner that was mw+ copy number-dependent. Lastly, male-female sexual experience mimicked the effects of w+/mw+ in improving successful copulation. These data suggest that the w+ gene controls copulation success in Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "It has recently become possible to directly estimate the germ-line de novo mutation (dnm) rate by sequencing the whole genome of father-mother-offspring trios, and this has been conducted in human1-5, chimpanzee6, mice7, birds8 and fish9. In these studies dnms are typically defined as variants that are heterozygous in the offspring while being absent in both parents. They are assumed to have occurred in the germ-line of one of the parents and to have been transmitted to the offspring via the sperm cell or oocyte. This definition assumes that detectable mosaicism in the parent in which the mutation occurred is negligible. However, instances of detectable mosaicism or premeiotic clusters are well documented in humans and other organisms, including ruminants10-12. We herein take advantage of cattle pedigrees to show that as much as [~]30% to [~]50% of dnms present in a gamete may occur during the early cleavage cell divisions in males and females, respectively, resulting in frequent detectable mosaicism and a high rate of sharing of multiple dnms between siblings. This should be taken into account to accurately estimate the mutation rate in cattle and other species.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is the largest single cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial community which protects from C. difficile colonization. Multiple antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility; many leading to distinct community structures stemming from variation in bacterial targets of action. These community structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difficile. Therefore we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments. Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated C. difficile highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difficile spore formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C. difficile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C. difficile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C. difficile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm integrating network architecture. This platform identified nutrients C. difficile used preferentially between pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the hypothesis that C. difficile inhabits alternative nutrient niches across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for nitrogen-containing carbon sources, particularly Stickland fermentation substrates and host-derived glycans.\\n\\nImportanceInfection by the bacterium Clostridium difficile causes an inflammatory diarrheal disease which can become life-threatening, and has grown to be the most prevalent nosocomial infection. Susceptibility to C. difficile infection is strongly associated with previous antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the gut microbiota and reduces its ability to prevent colonization. In this study we demonstrated that C. difficile altered pathogenesis between hosts pretreated with antibiotics from separate classes, and exploited different nutrient sources across these environments. Our metabolite score calculation also provides a platform to study nutrient requirements of pathogens during an infection. Our results suggest that C. difficile colonization resistance is mediated by multiple groups of bacteria competing for several subsets of nutrients and could explain why total reintroduction of competitors through fecal microbial transplant currently is the most effective treatment for recurrent CDI. This work could ultimately contribute to the identification of targeted, context-dependent measures that prevent or reduce C. difficile colonization including pre- and probiotic therapies.",

    "abstract": "The birth of genes that encode new protein sequences is a major source of evolutionary innovation. However, we still understand relatively little about how these genes come into being and which functions they are selected for. To address these questions we have obtained a large collection of mammalian-specific gene families that lack homologues in other eukaryotic groups. We have combined gene annotations and de novo transcript assemblies from 30 different mamalian species, obtaining about 6,000 gene families. In general, the proteins in mammalian-specific gene families tend to be short and depleted in aromatic and negatively charged residues. Proteins which arose early in mammalian evolution include milk and skin polypeptides, immune response components, and proteins involved in reproduction. In contrast, the functions of proteins which have a more recent origin remain largely unknown, despite the fact that these proteins also have extensive proteomics support. We identify several previously described cases of genes originated de novo from non-coding genomic regions, supporting the idea that this mechanism frequently underlies the evolution of new protein-coding genes in mammals. Finally, we show that most young mammalian genes are preferentially expressed in testis, suggesting that sexual selection plays an important role in the emergence of new functional genes.",

Reproductive interference is considered a strong ecological force, potentially leading to species exclusion. This supposes that the net effect of reproductive interactions is strongly negative for one of the species involved. Testing this requires a comprehensive analysis of interspecific reproductive interactions, accounting for the order and timing of mating events, and for their effects on either fertility or fecundity. To this aim, we measured reproductive interactions between a focal species, Tetranychus urticae, and an invasive (T.evansi) and a resident (T. ludeni) species, varying the mating sequence and interval, and measuring the effect of such crosses on fecundity and offspring sex ratio (a measure of fertility, as these species are haplodiploid). We found that mating with heterospecifics affected fecundity and sex ratio negatively, but also positively, depending on the species involved, and on the order and timing of mating events. Overall, the net effect of reproductive interactions was weak despite strong effects of particular events. In natural situations, the outcome of reproductive interactions will thus hinge upon the frequency of each event.",

Major theories of consciousness make distinct predictions about the role of PFC, providing an opportunity to arbitrate between these views empirically.

These claims are incompatible with empirical findings, unless one focuses only on studies using methods with limited sensitivity. The literature highlights PFCs essential role in enabling the subjective experience in perception, contra the objective capacity to perform visual tasks; conflating the two can also be a source of confusion.",

Despite this burden, there remains a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms that govern impaired healing of diabetic tendons.\\n\\nMice were placed on either a high fat diet (T2DM) or low fat diet (lean) and underwent flexor tendon transection and repair surgery. Healing was assessed via mechanical testing, histology and changes in gene expression associated with collagen synthesis, matrix remodeling, and macrophage polarization. Obese/diabetic tendons healed with increased scar formation and impaired mechanical properties. Consistent with this, prolonged and excess expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components were observed in obese/T2DM tendons. Macrophages are involved in both inflammatory and matrix deposition processes during healing. Obese/T2DM tendons healed with increased expression of markers of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, and elevated and prolonged expression of M2 macrophages markers that are involved in ECM deposition. Here we demonstrate that tendons from obese/diabetic mice heal with increased scar formation and increased M2 polarization, identifying excess M2 macrophage activity and matrix synthesis as a potential mechanism of the fibrotic healing phenotype observed in T2DM tendons, and as such a potential target to improve tendon healing in T2DM.",

    "abstract": "To study sensory representations, neuroscientists record neural activities while presenting different stimuli to the animal. From these data, we identify neurons whose activities depend systematically on each aspect of the stimulus. These neurons are said to be \\\"tuned\\\" to that stimulus feature. It is typically assumed that these tuned neurons represent the stimulus feature in their firing, whereas any \\\"untuned\\\" neurons do not contribute to its representation. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that in some circumstances, neurons that are untuned to a particular stimulus feature can contribute to its representation. These findings suggest that, by ignoring untuned neurons, our understanding of population coding might be incomplete. At the same time, several key questions remain unanswered: Are the impacts of untuned neurons on population coding due to weak tuning that is nevertheless below the threshold the experimenters set for calling neurons tuned (vs untuned)? Do these effects hold for different population sizes and/or correlation structures? And could neural circuit function ever benefit from having some untuned neurons vs having all neurons be tuned to the stimulus? Using theoretical calculations and analyses of in vivo neural data, I answer those questions by: a) showing how, in the presence of correlated variability, untuned neurons can enhance sensory information coding, for a variety of population sizes and correlation structures; b) demonstrating that this effect does not rely on weak tuning; and c) identifying conditions under which the neural code can be made more informative by replacing some of the tuned neurons with untuned ones. These conditions specify when there is a functional benefit to having untuned neurons.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the visual system, most neurons firing rates are tuned to various aspects of the stimulus (motion, contrast, etc.). For each stimulus feature, however some neurons appear to be untuned: their firing rates do not depend on that stimulus feature. Previous work on information coding in neural populations ignored untuned neurons, assuming that only the neurons tuned to a given stimulus feature contribute to its encoding. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that neurons with no apparent tuning can sometimes contribute to information coding. However, key questions remain unanswered. First, how do the untuned neurons contribute to information coding, and could this effect rely on those neurons having weak tuning that was overlooked? Second, does the function of a neural circuit ever benefit from having some neurons untuned? Or should every neuron be tuned (even weakly) to every stimulus feature? Here, I use mathematical calculations and analyses of data from the mouse visual cortex to answer those questions. First, I show how (and why) correlations between neurons enable the untuned neurons to contribute to information coding. Second, I show that neural populations can often do a better job of encoding a given stimulus feature when some of the neurons are untuned for that stimulus feature. Thus, it may be best for the brain to segregate its tuning, leaving some neurons untuned for each stimulus feature. Along with helping to explain how the brain processes external stimuli, this work has strong implications for attempts to decode brain signals, to control brain-machine interfaces: better performance could be obtained if the activities of all neurons are decoded, as opposed to only those with strong tuning.",

Systemic knockdown of Fxn in adult mice led to multiple phenotypes paralleling those observed in human patients across multiple organ systems. By reversing knockdown after clinical features appear, we were able to determine to what extent observed phenotypes represent reversible cellular dysfunction. Remarkably, upon restoration of near wild-type FXN levels, we observed significant recovery of function, associated pathology and transcriptomic dysregulation even after substantial motor dysfunction and pathology were observed.

In contrast, the few known Maturation Inducing Hormones (MIHs) that act on oocytes to initiate this process have highly variable molecular natures. Using the hydrozoan jellyfish species Clytia and Cladonema, which undergo oocyte maturation in response to dark-light and light-dark transitions respectively, we deduced from gonad transcriptome data amidated tetrapeptide sequences and found that synthetic peptides could induce maturation of isolated oocytes at nanomolar concentrations. Antibody preabsorption experiments conclusively demonstrated that these W/RPRPamide-related neuropeptides account for endogenous MIH activity produced by isolated gonads. We further showed that the MIH peptides are synthesised by neural-type cells in the gonad, are released following dark-light / light-dark transitions, and probably act on the oocyte surface. They are produced by male as well as female jellyfish and can trigger both sperm and egg release, suggesting a role in spawning coordination. We propose an evolutionary link between hydrozoan MIH and the neuropeptide hormones that regulate reproduction upstream of MIH in bilaterian species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe traditional method of visualizing gene annotation data in JBrowse is converting GFF3 files to JSON format, which is time-consuming. The latest version of JBrowse supports rendering sorted GFF3 files indexed by tabix, a novel strategy that is more convenient than the original conversion process. However, current tools available for GFF3 file sorting have some limitations and their sorting results would lead to erroneous rendering in JBrowse.\\n\\nResultsWe developed GFF3sort, a script to sort GFF3 files for tabix indexing. Specifically designed for JBrowse rendering, GFF3sort can properly deal with the order of features that have the same chromosome and start position, either by remembering their original orders or by conducting parent-child topology sorting. Based on our test datasets from seven species, GFF3sort produced accurate sorting results with acceptable efficiency compared with currently available tools.\\n\\nConclusionsGFF3sort is a novel tool to sort GFF3 files for tabix indexing. We anticipate that GFF3sort will be useful to help with genome annotation data processing and visualization.",

    "abstract": "Gene fusions are an important class of cancer-driving events with therapeutic and diagnostic values, yet their underlying genetic mechanisms have not been systematically characterized. Here by combining RNA and whole genome DNA sequencing data from 1188 donors across 27 cancer types we obtained a list of 3297 high-confidence tumour-specific gene fusions, 82% of which had structural variant (SV) support and 2372 of which were novel. Such a large collection of RNA and DNA alterations provides the first opportunity to systematically classify the gene fusions at a mechanistic level. While many could be explained by single SVs, numerous fusions involved series of structural rearrangements and thus are composite fusions. We discovered 75 fusions of a novel class of inter-chromosomal composite fusions, termed bridged fusions, in which a third genomic location bridged two different genes. In addition, we identified 522 fusions involving non-coding genes and 157 ORF-retaining fusions, in which the complete open reading frame of one gene was fused to the UTR region of another. Although only a small proportion (5%) of the discovered fusions were recurrent, we found a set of highly recurrent fusion partner genes, which exhibited strong 5 or 3 bias and were significantly enriched for cancer genes. Our findings broaden the view of the gene fusion landscape and reveal the general properties of genetic alterations underlying gene fusions for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that drive tumorigenesis are a growing focus of cancer genomics studies. To facilitate further discovery, we have created the \\\"Cancer LncRNA Census\\\" (CLC), a manually-curated and strictly-defined compilation of lncRNAs with causative roles in cancer. CLC has two principle applications: first, as a resource for training and benchmarking de novo identification methods; and second, as a dataset for studying the fundamental properties of these genes.\\n\\nCLC Version 1 comprises 122 lncRNAs implicated in 29 distinct cancers. LncRNAs are included based on functional or genetic evidence for causative roles in cancer progression. All belong to the GENCODE reference annotation, to enable integration across projects and datasets. For each entry, the evidence type, biological activity (oncogene or tumour suppressor), source reference and cancer type are recorded. Supporting its usefulness, CLC genes are significantly enriched amongst de novo predicted driver genes from PCAWG. CLC genes are distinguished from other lncRNAs by a series of features consistent with biological function, including gene length, high expression and sequence conservation of both exons and promoters. We identify a trend for CLC genes to be co-localised with known protein-coding cancer genes along the human genome. Finally, by integrating data from transposon-mutagenesis functional screens, we show that mouse orthologues of CLC genes tend also to be cancer genes.\\n\\nThus CLC represents a valuable resource for research into long non-coding RNAs in cancer. Their evolutionary and genomic properties have implications for understanding disease mechanisms and point to conserved functions across ~80 million years of evolution.",

    "abstract": "c-di-GMP is a major player in the decision between biofilm and motile lifestyles. Several bacteria present a large number of c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins, thus a fine-tuning of this nucleotide levels may occur. It is hypothesized that some c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins would provide the global c-di-GMP levels inside the cell whereas others would maintain a localized pool, with the resulting c-di-GMP acting at the vicinity of its production. Although attractive, this hypothesis has yet to be proven in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that the diguanylate cyclase DgcP interacts with the cytosolic region of FimV, a peptidoglycan-binding protein involved in type IV pilus assembly. Moreover, DgcP is located at the cell poles in wild type cells, but scattered in the cytoplasm of cells lacking FimV. Overexpression of DgcP leads to the classical phenotypes of high c-di-GMP levels (increased biofilm and impaired motilities) in the wild-type strain, but not in a AfimV background. Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that DgcP is regulated by FimV and may provide the local c-di-GMP pool that can be sensed by other proteins at the cell pole, bringing to light a specialized function for a specific diguanylate cyclase.",

    "abstract": "Subtelomeric macrosatellite repeats are difficult to sequence using conventional sequencing methods owing to the high similarity among repeat units and high GC content. Sequencing these repetitive regions is challenging, even with recent improvements in sequencing technologies. Among these repeats, a haplotype of the telomeric sequence and shortening of the D4Z4 array on human chromosome 4q35 causes one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy with autosomal-dominant inheritance, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Here, we applied a nanopore-based ultra-long read sequencer to sequence a BAC clone containing 13 D4Z4 repeats and flanking regions. We successfully obtained the whole D4Z4 repeat sequence, including the pathogenic gene DUX4 in the last D4Z4 repeat. The estimated sequence accuracy of the total repeat region was 99.7% based on a comparison with the reference sequence. Errors were typically observed between purine or between pyrimidine bases. Further, we analyzed the D4Z4 sequence from publicly available ultra-long whole human genome sequencing data obtained by nanopore sequencing. This technology may become a new standard for the molecular diagnosis of FSHD in the future and has the potential to widen our understanding of subtelomeric regions.",

Despite the long standing medical need (myopathies, neuropathies, pain, injury, ageing), currently technology (electromyography, dynamometry, shear wave imaging) provides no general, non-invasive method for online estimation of skeletal intramuscular states. Ultrasound provides a technology in which static and dynamic muscle states can be observed non-invasively, yet current computational image understanding approaches are inadequate. We propose a new approach in which deep learning methods are used for understanding the content of ultrasound images of muscle in terms of its measured state. Ultrasound data synchronized with electromyography of the calf muscles, with measures of joint torque/angle were recorded from 19 healthy participants (6 female, ages: 30 {+/-} 7.7). A segmentation algorithm previously developed by our group was applied to extract a region of interest of the medial gastrocnemius. Then a deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict the measured states (joint angle/torque, electromyography) directly from the segmented images. Results revealed for the first time that active and passive muscle states can be measured directly from standard b-mode ultrasound images, accurately predicting for a held out test participant changes in the joint angle, electromyography, and torque with as little error as 0.022{degrees}, 0.0001V, 0.256Nm (root mean square error) respectively.",

Here, we present a four-dimensional expansion of chemical mapping called lock-mutate-map-rescue (LM2R), which integrates multiple layers of mutation with nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping. This technique resolves the core mechanism of the adenine-responsive V. vulnificus add riboswitch including its gene expression platform, a paradigmatic system for which both Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) conformational selection models and non-MWC alternatives have been proposed. To discriminate amongst these models, we locked each functionally important helix through designed mutations and assessed formation or depletion of other helices via high-throughput compensatory rescue experiments. These LM2R measurements give strong support to the pre-existing correlations predicted by MWC models, disfavor alternative models, and reveal new structural heterogeneities that may be general across ligand-free riboswitches.",

These mechanisms have the net effect of generating tractions (force per unit length) on the bilayer that are translated into distinct shapes of the membrane. Here, we demonstrate how the local shape of the membrane can be used to infer the traction acting locally on the membrane. We show that buds and tubes, two common membrane deformations studied in trafficking processes, have different traction distributions along the membrane and that these tractions are specific to the molecular mechanism used to generate these shapes. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of an axial force applied to the membrane as well as that of an effective line tension can be calculated from these tractions. Finally, we consider the sensitivity of these quantities with respect to uncertainties in material properties and follow with a discussion on sources of uncertainty in membrane shape.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPassive acoustic sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for quantifying anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, especially for echolocating bat species. To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats (BatDetect). Our deep learning algorithms (CNN FULL and CNN FAST) were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Romania and Bulgaria by citizen scientists as part of the iBats programme and labelled by users of www.batdetective.org. We compared the performance of our system to other algorithms and commercial systems on expert verified test datasets recorded from different sensors and countries. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on iBats monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we show that both CNNFULL and CNNFAST deep learning algorithms have a higher detection performance (average precision, and recall) of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets, when compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems tested. Precision scores for commercial systems were reasonably good across all test datasets (>0.7), but this was at the expense of recall rates. In particular, our deep learning approaches were better at detecting calls in road-transect data, which contained more noisy recordings. Our comparison of CNNFULL and CNNFAST algorithms was favourable, although CNNFAST had a slightly poorer performance, displaying a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our example monitoring application demonstrated that our open-source, fully automatic, BatDetect CNNFAST pipeline does as well or better compared to a commercial system with manual verification previously used to analyse monitoring data.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that it is possible to both accurately and automatically detect bat search-phase echolocation calls, particularly from noisy audio recordings. Our detection pipeline enables the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale, particularly when combined with automatic species identification. We release our system and datasets to encourage future progress and transparency.\\nC_LI",

Marine calcifying organisms, including stony corals, are expected to be the most affected by the predicted decrease of the surface water pH at the end of the century. The severity of the impacts on coral reefs remains as matter of controversy. Although previous studies have explored the physiological response of stony corals to changes in pH, the response of the holobiont (i.e. the coral itself plus its symbionts) remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we assessed the changes in overall gene expression of the coral Montipora digitata and its microalgal symbionts after a short (three days) and a longer (42 days) exposure to low pH (7.6). The short-term exposure to low pH caused small differences in the expression level of the host, impacting mostly genes associated with stress response in other scleractinians. Resilience to Acidification of a Coral Holobiont Longer exposure to low pH resulted in no significant changes in gene expression of the coral host. Gene expression in the eukaryotic symbionts remained unaltered at both exposure times.

    "abstract": "Perception of chemical stimuli by insects aids in accepting or rejecting food. Gustatory receptors (Grs) regulating external signals in chemosensory organs have been found in many insects. Tribolium castaneum, a major pest of stored products, possesses over 200 Gr genes. An expanded repertoire of Gr genes appears to be required for diet recognition in generalist feeders; however, it remains unclear whether T. castaneum recognizes a suite of chemicals common to many products or whether it is attracted to specific chemicals, and whether its Grs are involved in its feeding behavior. It is difficult to determine the food preference of T. castaneum based on its dietary intake due to a lack of appropriate methodology. This study established a novel dietary intake estimation method using gypsum, designated the TribUTE (Tribolium Urges To Eat) assay. T. castaneum adults were fed gypsum block without added organic compounds. Sugar preference was determined by adding sweeteners and measuring the amount of gypsum in the excreta. Mannitol was the strongest attractant of T. castaneum dietary intake; in addition, TcGr20 was responsible for mannitol and sorbitol responses in Xenopus oocyte expression, but did not respond to any other non-volatile compounds tested. The EC50 values of TcGr20 for mannitol and sorbitol were 72.6 mM and 90.6 mM, respectively, suggesting that TcGr20 is a feasible receptor for the recognition of mannitol in lower concentrations. TcGr20 was expressed in the antennae, where the perception of mannitol would occur. We examined whether TcGr20 was involved in mannitol recognition using RNAi and the TribUTE assay. The amounts of excreta in TcGr20 dsRNA-injected adults decreased significantly despite the presence of mannitol, compared to that of the control adults. Taken together, our results suggest that T. castaneum adults recognized mannitol/sorbitol using TcGr20 receptors, thereby facilitating their dietary intake.\\n\\nAbbreviation",

    "abstract": "Large bone defects cannot heal without intervention and have high complication rates even with the best treatments available. In contrast, bone fractures naturally healing with high success rates by recapitulating the process of bone development through endochondral ossification.1 Endochondral tissue engineering may represent a promising paradigm, but large bone defects are unable to naturally form a callus. We engineered mesenchymal condensations featuring local morphogen presentation (TGF-{beta}1) to mimic the cellular organization and lineage progression of the early limb bud. As mechanical forces are 2,3 critical for proper endochondral ossification during bone morphogenesis2,3 and fracture healing, we hypothesized that mechanical cues would be important for endochondral regeneration.4,5 Here, using fixation plates that modulate ambulatory load transfer through dynamic tuning of axial compliance, we found that in vivo mechanical loading was necessary to restore bone function to large bone defects through endochondral ossification. Endochondral regeneration produced zonal cartilage and primary spongiosa mimetic of the native growth plate. Live human chondrocytes contributed to endochondral regeneration in vivo, while cell devitalization prior to condensation transplantation abrogated bone formation. Mechanical loading induced regeneration comparable to high-dose BMP-2 delivery, but without heterotopic bone formation and with order-of-magnitude greater mechanosensitivity.6-8 In vitro, mechanical loading promoted chondrogenesis, and upregulated pericellular collagen 6 deposition and angiogenic gene expression. Consistently, in vivo mechanical loading regulated cartilage formation and neovascular invasion dependent on load timing. Together, this study represents the first demonstration of the effects of mechanical loading on transplanted cell-mediated bone defect regeneration, and provides a new template for recapitulating developmental programs for tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Diet-induced obesity is associated with increased adipose tissue activated macrophage numbers. Yet, how macrophages integrate fatty acid (FA) signals remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that Fyn deficiency (FynKO) protects against high fat diet-induced adipose tissue macrophage accumulation. Herein, we show that inflammatory markers and reactive oxygen species are not induced in FynKO bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to the saturated FA palmitate, suggesting that Fyn regulates macrophage function in response to FA signals. Saturated palmitate activates Fyn and re-localizes Fyn into the nucleus of RAW264.7, J774 and wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages. Similarly, Fyn activity is increased in cells of AT stromal vascular fraction of high fat-fed control mice, with Fyn protein being located in the nucleus of these cells. We demonstrate that Fyn modulates palmitate-dependent oxidative stress in macrophages. Moreover, Fyn catalytic activity is necessary for its nuclear re-localization and downstream effects, as Fyn pharmacological inhibition abolishes palmitate-induced Fyn nuclear redistribution and palmitate-dependent increase of oxidative stress markers. Importantly, mono-or polyunsaturated FAs do not activate Fyn, and fail to re-localize Fyn to the nucleus. Together these data demonstrate that macrophages integrate nutritional FA signals via a differential activation of Fyn that distinguishes, at least partly, the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fats.",

Here, we have analyzed in details the kinetics of specification and found that ICM cell responsiveness to the up and down regulation of FGF signaling activity are temporally distinct. We also showed that PrE progenitors are generated later than Epi progenitors. We further demonstrated that, during this late phase of specification, a 4 hours period of FGF/ERK inhibition prior E3.75 is sufficient to convert ICM cells into Epi. Finally, we showed that ICM conversion into Epi in response to inhibition during this short time window requires both transcription and proteasome degradation. Collectively, our data give new insights into the timing and mechanisms involved in the process of ICM specification.",

    "abstract": "The inherent stochasticity of molecular reactions prevents us from predicting the exact state of single-cells in a population. However, when a population grows at steady-state, the probability to observe a cell with particular combinations of properties is fixed. Here we validate and exploit existing theory on the statistics of single-cell growth in order to predict the probability of phenotypic characteristics such as cell-cycle times, volumes, accuracy of division and cell-age distributions, using real-time imaging data for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Our results show that single-cell growth-statistics can accurately be predicted from a few basic measurements. These equations relate different phenotypic characteristics, and can therefore be used in consistency tests of experimental single-cell growth data and prediction of single-cell statistics. We also exploit these statistical relations in the development of a fast stochastic-simulation algorithm of single-cell growth and protein expression. This algorithm greatly reduces computational burden, by recovering the statistics of growing cell-populations from the simulation of only one of its lineages. Our approach is validated by comparison of simulations and experimental data. This work illustrates a methodology for the prediction, analysis and tests of consistency of single-cell growth and protein expression data from a few basic statistical principles.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans, a dental caries causing odontopathogen, produces X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase (Sm-XPDAP, encoded by pepX), a serine protease known to have a nutritional role. Considering the potential of proteases as therapeutic targets in pathogens, this study was primarily aimed at investigating the role of Sm-XPDAP in contributing to virulence-related traits. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP IV), an XPDAP analogous enzyme found in mammalian tissues, is a well known therapeutic target in Type II diabetes. Based on the hypothesis that gliptins, commonly used as anti-human-DPP IV drugs, may affect bacterial growth upon inhibition of Sm-XPDAP, we have determined their ex vivo antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity towards S. mutans. All three DPP IV drugs tested reduced biofilm formation as determined by crystal violet staining. To link the observed biofilm inhibition to the human-DPP IV analogue present in S. mutans UA159, a pepX isogenic mutant was generated. In addition to reduced biofilm formation, CLSM studies of the biofilm formed by the pepX isogenic mutant showed these were comparable to those formed in the presence of saxagliptin, suggesting a probable role of this enzyme in biofilm formation by S. mutans UA159. The effects of both pepX deletion and DPP IV drugs on the proteome were studied using LC-MS/MS. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Sm-XPDAP as a novel anti-biofilm target and suggests a template molecule to synthesize lead compounds effective against this enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Carrion beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides, are reared on decomposing vertebrate carrion where larvae are exposed to high-density populations of carcass-derived bacteria. We previously showed that larvae do not become colonized with these bacteria, but instead are colonized with the gut microbiome of their parents. These results suggested that bacteria in the beetle microbiome outcompete the carcass derived species for colonization of the larval gut. Here we test this hypothesis directly and quantify the fitness consequences of colonization of the Nicrophorus larval gut with different bacterial symbionts, including the insect pathogen Serratia marcescens. First, we show that beetles colonized by their endogenous microbiome produce significantly heavier broods than those colonized with carcass-bacteria. Next, we show that bacteria from the endogenous microbiome, including Providencia rettgeri and Morganella morganii, are better colonizers of the beetle gut and can outcompete non-endogenous species, including S. marcescens and Escherichia coli, during in vivo competition. Finally, we find that Providencia and Morganella provide beetles with colonization resistance against Serratia and thereby reduce Serratia-induced larval mortality during co-inoculation. Importantly, this effect is eliminated in larvae first colonized by Serratia, suggesting that while competition within the larval gut is strongly determined by priority effects, these effects are less important for Serratia-induced mortality. Our work supports the idea that bacterial gut symbionts provide direct benefits to Nicrophorus larvae by outcompeting potential bacterial pathogens. They further suggest that one benefit of parental care in Nicrophorus vespilloides is the social transmission of the microbiome from caring parents to their offspring.",

    "abstract": "For many neural network models in which neurons are trained to classify inputs like perceptrons, the number of inputs that can be classified is limited by the connectivity of each neuron, even when the total number of neurons is very large. This poses the problem of how the biological brain can take advantage of its huge number of neurons given that the connectivity is sparse. One solution is to combine multiple perceptrons together, as in committee machines. The number of classifiable random patterns would then grow linearly with the number of perceptrons, even when each perceptron has limited connectivity. However, the problem is moved to the downstream readout neurons, which would need a number of connections that is as large as the number of perceptrons. Here we propose a different approach in which the readout is implemented by connecting multiple perceptrons in a recurrent attractor neural network. We prove analytically that the number of classifiable random patterns can grow unboundedly with the number of perceptrons, even when the connectivity of each perceptron remains finite. Most importantly, both the recurrent connectivity and the connectivity of downstream readouts also remain finite. Our study shows that feed-forward neural classifiers with numerous long range afferent connections can be replaced by recurrent networks with sparse long range connectivity without sacrificing the classification performance. Our strategy could be used to design more general scalable network architectures with limited connectivity, which resemble more closely the brain neural circuits which are dominated by recurrent connectivity.",

While distinct sub-populations of neurons are activated during single finger movements, it remains unknown whether M1 also represents sequences of multiple finger movements. Using novel multivariate fMRI analysis techniques, we show here that even after 5 days of intense practice there was little or no evidence for a true sequence representation in M1. Rather, the activity patterns for sequences in M1 could be explained by linear combination of patterns associated with the constituent individual finger movements, with the strongest weight on the finger making the first response of the sequence. These results suggest that M1 only represents single finger movements, but receives increased input at the start of a sequence. In contrast, the reliable differences between different sequences in premotor and parietal areas could not be explained by a strong weighting of the first finger, supporting the view that these regions exhibit a true representation of sequences.",

Here, we reconcile this apparent contradiction by demonstrating that the generation of dendritic spikes, the emergence of an excitatory ramp in somatic voltage responses and sharp tuning of place-cell responses are all attainable even when iso-feature synapses are randomly dispersed across the dendritic arbor. We found this tuning sharpness to be critically reliant on dendritic sodium and transient potassium channels and on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Importantly, we demonstrate that synaptic potentiation targeted to afferents from one specific place field is sufficient to effectuate place-field selectivity even when intrinsically disparate neurons received randomly dispersed afferents from multiple place-field locations.

    "abstract": "Interactions between sensory pathways such as the visual and auditory systems are known to occur in the brain, but where they first occur is uncertain. Here we show a novel multimodal interaction evident at the eardrum. Ear canal microphone measurements in humans (n=19 ears in 16 subjects) and monkeys (n=5 ears in 3 subjects) performing a saccadic eye movement task to visual targets indicated that the eardrum moves in conjunction with the eye movement. The eardrum motion was oscillatory and began as early as 10 ms before saccade onset in humans or with saccade onset in monkeys. These eardrum movements, which we dub Eye Movement Related Eardrum Oscillations (EMREOs), occurred in the absence of a sound stimulus. The EMREOs amplitude and phase depended on the direction and horizontal amplitude of the saccade. They lasted throughout the saccade and well into subsequent periods of steady fixation. We discuss the possibility that the mechanisms underlying EMREOs create eye movement-related binaural cues that may aid the brain in evaluating the relationship between visual and auditory stimulus locations as the eyes move.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe peripheral hearing system contains several motor mechanisms that allow the brain to modify the auditory transduction process. Movements or tensioning of either the middle-ear muscles or the outer hair cells modify eardrum motion, producing sounds that can be detected by a microphone placed in the ear canal (e.g. as otoacoustic emissions). Here, we report a novel form of eardrum motion produced by the brain via these systems -- oscillations synchronized with and covarying with the direction and amplitude of saccades. These observations suggest that a vision-related process modulates the first stage of hearing. In particular, these eye-movement related eardrum oscillations may help the brain connect sights and sounds despite changes in the spatial relationship between the eyes and the ears.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology applied to industrial biotechnology is transforming the way we produce chemicals. However, despite advances in the scale and scope of metabolic engineering, the bioproduction process still remains costly. In order to expand the chemical repertoire for the production of next generation compounds, a major engineering biology effort is required in the development of novel design tools that target chemical diversity through rapid and predictable protocols. Addressing that goal involves retrosynthesis approaches that explore the chemical biosynthetic space. However, the complexity associated with the large combinatorial retrosynthesis design space has often been recognized as the main challenge hindering the approach. Here, we provide RetroPath2.0, an automated open source workflow for retrosynthesis based on generalized reaction rules that perform the retrosynthesis search from chassis to target through an efficient and well-controlled protocol. Its easiness of use and the versatility of its applications make of this tool a valuable addition into the biological engineer bench desk. We show through several examples the application of the workflow to biotechnological relevant problems, including the identification of alternative biosynthetic routes through enzyme promiscuity; or the development of biosensors. We demonstrate in that way the ability of the workflow to streamline retrosynthesis pathway design and its major role in reshaping the design, build, test and learn pipeline by driving the process toward the objective of optimizing bioproduction.

HFD+LPS trigger pro-inflammatory responses, upregulate NOS2 expression, elicit potent nitric oxide (NO) burst, and reinforce adipose mitochondrial dysfunctions that facilitate adipogenesis for visceral weight gain. By targeting mitochondrial complexes, artemisinin resembles the NO donor nitroglycerin to exert anti-inflammatory effects, downregulate NOS2 expression, maintain stable NO release, and augment adipose mitochondrial functions that necessitate adipolysis for visceral weight loss. Taken together, artemisinin plays adipose weight-reducing roles by rectifying inflammation-driven mitochondrial dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced transiently in response to cell stimuli, and function as second messengers that oxidize target proteins. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are important ROS targets, whose oxidation results in rapid, reversible, catalytic inactivation. Despite increasing evidence for the importance of PTP oxidation in signal transduction, the cell biological details of ROS-catalyzed PTP inactivation have remained largely unclear, due to our inability to visualize PTP oxidation in cells. By combining proximity ligation assay (PLA) with chemical labeling of cysteine residues in the sulfenic acid state, we visualize oxidized Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). We find that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) evokes transient oxidation on or close to RAB5+/EEA1-endosomes. SHP2 oxidation requires NADPH oxidases (NOXs), and oxidized SHP2 co-localizes with PDGF receptor and NOX1/4. Our data demonstrate spatially and temporally limited protein oxidation within cells, and suggest that PDGF-dependent \\\"redoxosomes,\\\" contribute to proper signal transduction.",

We and others have successfully employed Single-Haplotype Iterative Mapping and Sequencing (SHIMS 1.0) to assemble structurally complex regions across the sex chromosomes of several vertebrate species and in targeted improvements to the reference sequences of human autosomes. However, SHIMS 1.0 was expensive and time consuming, requiring the resources that only a genome center could command. Here we introduce SHIMS 2.0, an improved SHIMS protocol to allow even a small laboratory to generate high-quality reference sequence from complex genomic regions. Using a streamlined and parallelized library preparation protocol, and taking advantage of high-throughput, inexpensive, short-read sequencing technologies, a small group can sequence and assemble hundreds of clones in a week. Relative to SHIMS 1.0, SHIMS 2.0 reduces the cost and time required by two orders of magnitude, while preserving high sequencing accuracy.",

In conclusion, the angular motion drives the alignment of microtubules, which in turn allows the cross-linking proteins to connect the microtubules into a stable bundle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmerging adulthood is a peak period of risk for alcohol and illicit drug use. Recent advances in psychiatric genetics suggest that the co-occurrence of substance use and psychopathology arises, in part, from a shared genetic etiology. We sought to extend this research by investigating the influence of genetic risk for schizophrenia on trajectories of four substance use behaviors as they occurred across emerging adulthood.\\n\\nMethodYoung adult participants of non-Hispanic European descent provided DNA samples and completed daily reports of substance use for one month per year across four years (N=30,085 observations of N=342 participants). Polygenic scores for schizophrenia were included in two-level hierarchical linear models designed to test associations between genetic risk for schizophrenia, participant age, and four substance use phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsHere, we interpret results at p<.05 as suggestive and results at p<.005 as significant. Accordingly, our results suggest that polygenic scores for schizophrenia were positively associated with participants overall likelihood to engage in illicit drug use, but not alcohol-related substance use. Moreover, our results indicate that participants with a greater polygenic loading for schizophrenia experienced greater age-related increases in the likelihood of using substances across emerging adulthood.\\n\\nConclusionsThe present study used a novel combination of polygenic prediction and intensive longitudinal methods to characterize the influence of genetic risk for schizophrenia on patterns of age-related change in substance use across emerging adulthood. Results suggest that genetic risk for schizophrenia exerts both broad and developmentally-specific influences on substance use behaviors in a non-clinical population of young adults.",

    "abstract": "BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a human pathogen first isolated in 1971. BKPyV infection is ubiquitous in the human population, with over 80% of adults worldwide being seropositive for BKPyV. BKPyV infection is usually asymptomatic; however, BKPyV reactivation in immunosuppressed transplant patients causes two diseases, polyomavirus-associated nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis. To establish a successful infection in its host cells, BKPyV must travel in retrograde transport vesicles to reach the nuclei. To make this happen, BKPyV requires the cooperation of host cell proteins. To further identify host factors associated with BKPyV entry and intracellular trafficking, we performed a whole-genome siRNA screen on BKPyV infection of primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. The results revealed the importance of the Ras-related protein Rab18 and syntaxin 18 for BKPyV infection. Our subsequent experiments implicated additional factors that interact with this pathway, and suggest a more detailed model of the intracellular trafficking process, indicating that BKPyV reaches the ER lumen through a retrograde transport pathway between the late endosome and the ER.",

Notably, a causal relationship between ZIKV infection and neurodevelopmental abnormalities has been widely reported, yet a specific mechanism underlying impaired neurological development has not been identified. Here, we report on the design of several synthetic competitive inhibitory peptides against key pathogenic ZIKV proteins through the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Often, PPIs between host and viral proteins are crucial for infection and pathogenesis, making them attractive targets for therapeutics. Using two complementary sequence-based PPI prediction tools, we first produced a comprehensive map of predicted human-ZIKV PPIs (involving 209 human protein candidates). We then designed several peptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions thereby acting as anti-ZIKV therapeutics. The data generated in this study constitute a foundational resource to aid in the multi-disciplinary effort to combat ZIKV infection, including the design of additional synthetic proteins.",

    "abstract": "Music is thought to engage its listeners by driving feelings of surprise, tension, and relief through a dynamic mixture of predictable and unpredictable patterns, a property summarized here as \\\"expressiveness\\\". Birdsong shares with music the goal to attract and hold its listeners attention and might make use of similar strategies to achieve this goal. We here tested a songbirds rhythm, as represented by the amplitude envelope (containing information on note timing, duration, and intensity), for expressiveness. We used multifractal analysis which is designed to detect in a signal dynamic fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable states on multiple timescales (e.g. notes, subphrases, songs). Results show that the songs' amplitude envelope is strongly multifractal, indicating rhythm is patterned by fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable patterns. Moreover, comparing original songs with re-synthesized songs that lack all subtle deviations from the \\\"standard\\\" note envelopes, we find that deviations in note intensity and duration significantly contribute to the rhythms multifractality. This suggests that birds render their songs more expressive by subtly modifying note timing patterns, similar to musical operations like accelerando or ritardando. Our findings bear consequences for neuronal models of vocal sequence generation in birds, as they require non-local rules to generate rhythm.",

Here we present the most comprehensive analysis of retrovirus driven lymphomagenesis produced to date, sequencing 700,000 mutations from >500 malignancies collected at time points throughout tumor development. This enabled identification of positively selected events, and the first demonstration of negative selection of mutations that may be deleterious to tumor development indicating novel avenues for therapy. Customized sequencing and bioinformatics methodologies were developed to quantify subclonal mutations in both premalignant and malignant tissue, greatly expanding the statistical power for identifying driver mutations and yielding a high-resolution, genome wide map of the selective forces surrounding cancer gene loci. Screening two BCL2 transgenic models confirms known drivers of human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and implicates novel candidates including modifiers of immunosurveillance such as co-stimulatory molecules and MHC loci. Correlating mutations with genotypic and phenotypic features also gives robust identification of known cancer genes independently of local variance in mutation density.
