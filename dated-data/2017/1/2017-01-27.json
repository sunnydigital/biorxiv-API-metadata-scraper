    "abstract": "MotivationChromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments are commonly used to obtain genome-wide profiles of histone modifications associated with different types of functional genomic elements. However, the quality of histone ChIP-seq data is affected by a myriad of experimental parameters such as the amount of input DNA, antibody specificity, ChIP enrichment, and sequencing depth. Making accurate inferences from chromatin profiling experiments that involve diverse experimental parameters is challenging.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a convolutional denoising algorithm, Coda, that uses convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping from suboptimal to high-quality histone ChIP-seq data. This overcomes various sources of noise and variability, substantially enhancing and recovering signal when applied to low-quality chromatin profiling datasets across individuals, cell types, and species. Our method has the potential to improve data quality at reduced costs. More broadly, this approach - using a high-dimensional discriminative model to encode a generative noise process - is generally applicable to other biological domains where it is easy to generate noisy data but difficult to analytically characterize the noise or underlying data distribution.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/kundajelab/coda\\n\\nContactakundaje@stanford.edu",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The recent growth in pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening (ECS) has raised questions about how such panels might be designed and evaluated systematically. Design principles for ECS panels might improve clinical detection of at-risk couples and facilitate objective discussions of panel choice.\\n\\nMethods: Guided by medical-society statements, we propose a method for the design of ECS panels that aims to maximize the aggregate and per-disease sensitivity and specificity across a range of Mendelian disorders considered serious by a systematic classification scheme. We evaluated this method retrospectively using results from 474,644 de-identified carrier screens. We then constructed several idealized panels to highlight strengths and limitations of different ECS methodologies.\\n\\nResults: Based on modeled fetal risks for \\\"severe\\\" and \\\"profound\\\" diseases, a commercially available ECS panel (Counsyl) is expected to detect 183 affected conceptuses per 100,000 US births. A screens sensitivity is greatly impacted by two factors: (1) the methodology used (e.g., full-exon sequencing finds up to 46 more affected fetuses per 100,000 than targeted genotyping with an optimal 50 variant panel), and (2) the detection rate of the screen for diseases with high prevalence and complex molecular genetics (e.g., fragile X syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and alpha-thalassemia account for 54 affected fetuses per 100,000).\\n\\nConclusion: The described approaches allow principled, quantitative evaluation of which diseases and methodologies are appropriate for pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening.",

    "abstract": "Brain dynamics are thought to unfold on a network determined by the pattern of axonal connections linking pairs of neuronal populations; the so-called connectome. Prior work has indicated that structural brain connectivity constrains pairwise correlations in brain dynamics (also called functional connectivity), but it is not known whether inter-regional axonal connectivity is related to the intrinsic dynamics of individual brain areas. Here we investigate this relationship using a weighted, directed mesoscale mouse connectome from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data measured in 184 brain regions in eighteen anesthetized mice. For each brain region, we measured degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient from weighted and unweighted, and directed and undirected versions of the connectome. We then characterized the univariate rs-fMRI dynamics at each brain region by computing 6 930 time-series properties using the time-series analysis toolbox, hctsa. After correcting for regional volume variations, strong and robust correlations between structural connectivity properties and rs-fMRI dynamics were found only when edge weights were accounted for, and were associated with variations in the autocorrelation properties of the rs-fMRI signal. The strongest relationships were found for weighted in-degree, which was positively correlated to the autocorrelation of fMRI time series at time lag{tau} = 34s (partial Spearman correlation{rho} = 0.58), as well as a range of related measures such as relative high frequency power (f > 0.4 Hz:{rho} = -0.43). Our results indicate that the topology of inter-regional axonal connections of the mouse brain is closely related to intrinsic, spontaneous dynamics such that regions with a greater aggregate strength of incoming projections display longer timescales of activity fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease whose neuropathological signature is a selective loss of medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Despite this selective neuropathology, the mutant protein (huntingtin) is found in virtually every cell so far studied, and, consequently, phenotypes are observed in a wide range of organ systems both inside and outside the central nervous system. We, and others, have suggested that peripheral dysfunction could contribute to the rate of progression of striatal phenotypes of HD. To test this hypothesis, we lowered levels of huntingtin by treating mice with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting the murine Huntingtin gene. To study the relationship between peripheral huntingtin levels and striatal HD phenotypes, we utilized a knock-in model of the human HD mutation (the B6.HttQ111/+ mouse). We treated mice with ASOs from 2-10 months of age, a time period over which significant HD-relevant signs progressively develop in the brains of HttQ111+ mice. Peripheral treatment with ASOs led to persistent reduction of huntingtin protein in peripheral organs, including liver, brown and white adipose tissues. This reduction was not associated with alterations in the severity of HD-relevant signs in the striatum of HttQ111/+ mice at the end of the study, including transcriptional dysregulation, the accumulation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions, and behavioral changes such as subtle hypoactivity and reduced exploratory drive. These results suggest that the amount of peripheral reduction achieved in the current study does not significantly impact the progression of HD-relevant signs in the central nervous system.",

A recent survey of popular genomic literature estimates that one-fifth of all papers with supplementary data containing gene lists in Excel format suffer from this issue.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present an open-source tool, Escape Excel, which prevents these erroneous conversions by generating an escaped text file that can be safely imported into Excel. Escape Excel is available in the Galaxy web environment and can be installed through the Galaxy ToolShed. Escape Excel is also available as a stand-alone, command line Perl script on GitHub (http://www.github.com/pstew/escape_excel). A Galaxy test server implementation is accessible at http://apostl.moffitt.org.\\n\\nConclusionsEscape Excel detects and escapes a wide variety of problematic text strings so that they are not erroneously converted into other representations upon importation into Excel. Examples of problematic strings include date-like strings, time-like strings, leading zeroes in front of numbers, and long numeric and alpha-numeric identifiers that should not be automatically converted into scientific notation. It is hoped that greater awareness of these potential data-corruption issues, together with diligent escaping of text files prior to importation into Excel, will help to reduce the amount of Excel-corrupted data in scientific analyses and publications.",

    "abstract": "Emerging single-molecule sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have revived interest in long read mapping algorithms. Alignment-based seed-and-extend methods demonstrate good accuracy, but face limited scalability, while faster alignment-free methods typically trade decreased precision for efficiency. In this paper, we combine a fast approximate read mapping algorithm based on minimizers with a novel MinHash identity estimation technique to achieve both scalability and precision. In contrast to prior methods, we develop a mathematical framework that defines the types of mapping targets we uncover, establish probabilistic estimates of p-value and sensitivity, and demonstrate tolerance for alignment error rates up to 20%. With this framework, our algorithm automatically adapts to different minimum length and identity requirements and provides both positional and identity estimates for each mapping reported. For mapping human PacBio reads to the hg38 reference, our method is 290x faster than BWA-MEM with a lower memory footprint and recall rate of 96%. We further demonstrate the scalability of our method by mapping noisy PacBio reads (each [&ge;] 5 kbp in length) to the complete NCBI RefSeq database containing 838 Gbp of sequence and > 60, 000 genomes.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variations (CNVs) are large genetic variations detected among the individuals of every multicellular organism examined so far. These variations are believed to play an important role in the evolution and adaptation of species. In plants, little is known about the characteristics of CNVs, particularly regarding the rates at which they are generated and the mechanics of their transmission from a generation to the next. Here, we used SNP-array raw intensity data for 55 two-generations families (3663 individuals) to scan the gene space of the conifer tree Picea glauca (Moench) Voss for CNVs. We were particularly interested in the abundance, inheritance, spontaneous mutation rate spectrum and the evolutionary consequences they may have on the standing genetic variation of white spruce. Our findings show that CNVs affect a small proportion of the gene space and are predominantly copy number losses. CNVs were either inherited or generated through de novo events. De novo CNVs present high rates of spontaneous mutations that vary for different genes and alleles and are correlated with gene expression levels. Most of the inherited CNVs (70%) are transmitted from the parents in violation of Mendelian expectations. These transmission distortions can cause considerable frequency changes between generations and be dependent on whether the heterozygote parents contribute as male or female. Transmission distortions were also influenced by the partner genotype and the parents genetic background. This study provides new insights into the effects of different evolutionary forces on copy number variations based on the analysis of a perennial plant.",

Assessing this relationship is important for determining the clinical utility of early head circumference (HC) measures and for assessing the validity of the early overgrowth hypothesis of autism, which suggests that early accelerated brain development may be a hallmark of the disorder\\n\\nMethodWe performed a retrospective comparison of HC, height, and weight measurements between 66 toddlers who were later diagnosed with autism and 66 matched controls. These toddlers represent an unbiased regional sample from a single health service provider in the southern district of Israel. Using 4-12 measurements between birth and the age of two, we were able to characterize individual HC, height, and weight development with high precision and fit a negative exponential growth model to the data of each toddler with exceptional accuracy\\n\\nResultsThe analyses revealed that HC sizes and growth rates were not significantly larger in toddlers with autism even when stratifying the autism group based on verbal capabilities at the time of diagnosis. In addition, there were no significant correlations between ADOS scores at the time of diagnosis and HC at any time-point during the first two years of life\\n\\nConclusionsThese negative results add to accumulating evidence, which suggest that brain volume is not necessarily larger in toddlers who develop autism.

    "abstract": "O_LIHuman colour vision differs from the vision of other animals. The most obvious differences are the number and type of photoreceptors in the retina. E.g., while humans are insensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light, most non-mammal vertebrates and insects have a colour vision that spans into the UV. The development of colour vision models allowed appraisals of colour vision independent of the human experience. These models are now widespread in ecology and evolution fields. Here I present a guide to colour vision modelling, run a series of simulations, and provide a R package - colourvision - to facilitate the use of colour vision models.\\nC_LIO_LII present the mathematical steps for calculation of the most commonly used colour vision models: Chittka (1992) colour hexagon, Endler & Mielke (2005) model, and Vorobyev & Osorio (1998) linear and log-linear receptor noise limited models (RNL). These models are then tested using identical simulated and real data. These comprise of reflectance spectra generated by a logistic function against an achromatic background, achromatic reflectance against an achromatic background, achromatic reflectance against a chromatic background, and real flower reflectance data against a natural background reflectance.\\nC_LIO_LIWhen the specific requirements of each model are met, between model results are, overall, qualitatively and quantitatively similar. However, under many common scenarios of colour measurements, models may generate spurious values and/or considerably different predictions. Models that log-transform data and use relative photoreceptor outputs are prone to generate unrealistic results when the stimulus photon catch is smaller than the background photon catch. Moreover, models may generate unrealistic results when the background is chromatic (e.g. leaf reflectance) and the stimulus is an achromatic low reflectance spectrum.\\nC_LIO_LIColour vision models are a valuable tool in several ecology and evolution subfields. Nonetheless, knowledge of model assumptions, careful analysis of model outputs, and basic knowledge of calculation behind each model are crucial for appropriate model application, and generation of meaningful and reproducible results. Other aspects of vision not incorporated into these models should be considered when drawing conclusion from model results.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "De novo creation of protein coding genes involves the formation of short ORFs from noncoding regions; some of these ORFs might then become fixed in the populationThese orphan proteins need to, at the bare minimum, not cause serious harm to the organism, meaning that they should for instance not aggregate. Therefore, although the creation of short ORFs could be truly random, the fixation should be subjected to some selective pressure. The selective forces acting on orphan proteins have been elusive, and contradictory results have been reported. In Drosophila young proteins are more disordered than ancient ones, while the opposite trend is present in yeast. To the best of our knowledge no valid explanation for this difference has been proposed.\\n\\nTo solve this riddle we studied structural properties and age of proteins in 187 eukaryotic organisms. We find that, with the exception of length, there are only small differences in the properties between proteins of different ages. However, when we take the GC content into account we noted that it could explain the opposite trends observed for orphans in yeast (low GC) and Drosophila (high GC). GC content is correlated with codons coding for disorder promoting amino acids. This leads us to propose that intrinsic disorder is not a strong determining factor for fixation of orphan proteins. Instead these proteins largely resemble random proteins given a particular GC level. During evolution the properties of a protein change faster than the GC level causing the relationship between disorder and GC to gradually weaken.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe show that the GC content of a genome is of great importance for the properties of an orphan protein. GC content affects the frequency of the codons and this affects the probability for each amino acid to be included in a de novo created protein. The codons encoding for Ala, Pro and Gly contain 80% GC, while codons for Lys, Phe, Asn, Tyr and Ile contain 20% or less. The three high GC amino acids are all disorder promoting, while Phe, Tyr and Ile are order promoting. Therefore, random protein sequences at a high GC will be more disordered than the ones created at a low GC. The structural properties of the youngest proteins match to a large degree the properties of random proteins when the GC content is taken into account. In contrast, structural properties of ancient proteins only show a weak correlation with GC content. This suggests that even after fixation in the population, proteins largely resemble random proteins given a certain GC content. Thereafter, during evolution the correlation between structural properties and GC weakens.",

Spatial analysis confirmed the temporal trends with a decrease and increase in forest surface areas where soil N impoverishment and enrichment have been bioindicated over the time, respectively.\\nC_LIO_LIN bioindicated trends are opposite to changes in N atmospheric deposition compared the 2005-2010 period, while they follow temporal variation in mean N deposition until 1990.\\nSynthesis. Our results showed that forest herb communities have been reshuffled in regards of their soil N requirements over the 20th century highlighting that temporal changes in soil N supply have impacted the understory species composition of forest. We evidenced changes in communities towards less nitrophilous plant assemblage followed by a recent eutrophication since 2005. We propose that the nitrogen forest vegetation status is likely related to N atmospheric deposition trend, but also to both acidification, climate change and forestry management which impacted organic matter decomposition and soil N mineralization through effects on soil microbial and fauna activities. The current eutrophication observed in forest herb communities is worrisome for temperate forest ecosystem and its functioning in regards of biodiversity homogenization which often accompanied such a community reshuffling.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We aim to investigate the application of polygenic risk scoring within a family context. Polygenic risk profiles could aid in unraveling the role that common variation confers on disease risk within a pedigree that would have traditionally been viewed through the prism of monogenic inheritance only. We illustrate our discussion by analyzing polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder in a large pedigree (n~260) in which 30% of family members suffer from major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. We apply polygenic risk scores to study patterns of assortative mating and anticipation, whereby it appears increased polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders is contributed by affected individuals who married into the family, resulting in an increasing genetic risk over generations in the family. This may explain the observation of anticipation in mood disorders, whereby onset is earlier and the severity of a disease increases over the generations of a family. Joint analyses of both rare and common variation may be the most powerful way to understand the familial genetics of mood and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the radiative energy budgets of a heterogeneous photosynthetic coral reef sediment and a compact uniform cyanobacterial biofilm on top of coastal sediment. By combining electrochemical, thermocouple and fiber-optic microsensor measurements of O2, temperature and light, we could calculate the proportion of the absorbed light energy that was either dissipated as heat or conserved by photosynthesis. We show, across a range of different incident light regimes, that such radiative energy budgets are highly dominated by heat dissipation constituting up to 99.5% of the absorbed light energy. Highest photosynthetic energy conservation efficiency was found in the coral sediment under light-limiting conditions and amounted to ~13% of the absorbed light energy. Additionally, the effect of light directionality, i.e., diffuse or collimated light, on energy conversion efficiency was tested on the two surface-associated systems. The effects of light directionality on the radiative energy budgets of these phototrophic communities were not unanimous but, resulted in local spatial differences in heat-transfer, gross photosynthesis and light distribution. The light acclimation index, Ek was >2 times higher in the coral sediment compared to the biofilm and changed the pattern of photosynthetic energy conservation under light-limiting conditions. At moderate to high incident 45 irradiances, the photosynthetic conservation of absorbed energy was highest in collimated light; a tendency that changed in the biofilm under sub-saturating incident irradiances, where higher photosynthetic efficiencies were observed under diffuse light. Our results suggest that the optical properties and the structural organization of phytoelements are important traits affecting the photosynthetic efficiency of biofilms and sediments.",

    "abstract": "Models of mRNA translation usually presume that transcripts are linear; upon reaching the end of a transcript each terminating ribosome returns to the cytoplasmic pool before initiating anew on a different transcript. A consequence of linear models is that faster translation of a given mRNA is unlikely to generate more of the encoded protein, particularly at low ribosome availability. Recent evidence indicates that eukaryotic mRNAs are circularized, potentially allowing terminating ribosomes to preferentially reinitiate on the same transcript. Here we model the effect of ribosome reinitiation on translation and show that, at high levels of reinitiation, protein synthesis rates are dominated by the time required to translate a given transcript. Our model provides a simple mechanistic explanation for many previously enigmatic features of eukaryotic translation, including the negative correlation of both ribosome densities and protein abundance on transcript length, the importance of codon usage in determining protein synthesis rates, and the negative correlation between transcript length and both codon adaptation and 5' mRNA folding energies. In contrast to linear models where translation is largely limited by initiation rates, our model reveals that all three stages of translation - initiation, elongation, and termination/reinitiation - determine protein synthesis rates even at low ribosome availability.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning approaches that have produced breakthrough predictive models in computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation are now being successfully applied to problems in regulatory genomics. However, deep learning architectures used thus far in genomics are often directly ported from computer vision and natural language processing applications with few, if any, domain-specific modifications. In double-stranded DNA, the same pattern may appear identically on one strand and its reverse complement due to complementary base pairing. Here, we show that conventional deep learning models that do not explicitly model this property can produce substantially different predictions on forward and reverse-complement versions of the same DNA sequence. We present four new convolutional neural network layers that leverage the reverse-complement property of genomic DNA sequence by sharing parameters between forward and reverse-complement representations in the model. These layers guarantee that forward and reverse-complement sequences produce identical predictions within numerical precision. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo transcription factor binding data, we show that our proposed architectures lead to improved performance, faster learning and cleaner internal representations compared to conventional architectures trained on the same data.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur implementation is available at\\n\\nContactavanti@stanford.edu, pgreens@stanford.edu, akundaje@stanford.edu",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses replicate with high mutation rates, creating closely related viral populations. The heterogeneous virus populations, referred to as viral quasispecies, rapidly adapt to environmental changes thus adversely affecting efficiency of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Therefore, studying the underlying genetic heterogeneity of viral populations plays a significant role in the development of effective therapeutic treatments. Recent high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided invaluable opportunity for uncovering the structure of quasispecies populations (i.e., reconstruction of viral sequences and discovery of their relative frequencies). However, accurate reconstruction of viral quasispecies remains difficult due to limited read-lengths and presence of sequencing errors. The problem is particularly challenging when the strains in a population are highly similar, i.e., the sequences are characterized by low mutual genetic distances, and further exacerbated if some of those strains are relatively rare; this is the setting where state-of-the-art methods struggle. In this paper, we present a novel viral quasispecies reconstruction algorithm, aBayesQR, that employs a maximum-likelihood framework to infer individual sequences in a mixture from high-throughput sequencing data. The search for the most likely quasispecies is conducted on long contigs that our method constructs from the set of short reads via agglomerative hierarchical clustering; operating on contigs rather than short reads enables identification of close strains in a population and provides computational tractability of the Bayesian method. Results on both simulated and real HIV-1 data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods; aBayesQR particularly stands out when reconstructing a set of closely related viral strains (e.g., quasispecies characterized by low diversity).",

    "abstract": "Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia are commonly accompanied by cognitive deficits. Recent studies have reported negative genetic correlations between schizophrenia and indicators of cognitive ability such as general intelligence and processing speed. Here we compare the effect of the genetic risk of schizophrenia (PRSSCZ) on measures that differ in their relationships with psychosis onset: a measure of current cognitive abilities (the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, BACS) that is greatly reduced in psychosis patients; a measure of premorbid intelligence that is minimally affected by psychosis (the Wide-Range Achievement Test, WRAT); and educational attainment (EY), which covaries with both BACS and WRAT. Using genome-wide SNP data from 314 psychotic and 423 healthy research participants in the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) Consortium, we investigated the association of PRSSCZ with BACS, WRAT and EY. Among apparently healthy individuals, greater genetic risk for schizophrenia (PRSSCZ) was associated with lower BACS scores (r = -0.19, p = 1 x 10-4 at PT = 1 x 10-4) but did not associate with WRAT or EY, suggesting that these areas of cognition vary in their etiologic relationships with schizophrenia. Among individuals with psychosis, PRSSCZ did not associate with variation in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that the same cognitive abilities that are disrupted in psychotic disorders are also associated with schizophrenia genetic risk in the general population. Specific cognitive phenotypes, independent of education or general intelligence, could be more deeply studied for insight into the specific processes affected by the genetic influences on psychosis.\\n\\nSignificancePsychotic disorders such as schizophrenia often involve profound cognitive deficits, the genetic underpinnings of which remain to be elucidated. Poor educational performance early in life is a well-known risk factor for future psychotic illness, potentially reflecting either shared genetic influences or other risk factors that are epidemiologically correlated. Here we show that, in apparently healthy individuals, common genetic risk factors for schizophrenia associate with lower performance in areas of cognition that are impaired in psychotic disorders but do not associate independently with educational attainment or more general measures of intelligence. These results suggest that specific cognitive phenotypes - independent of education or general intelligence - could be more deeply studied for insight into the processes affected by the genetic influences on psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Hi-C has been used to probe the 3D chromatin architecture of multiple organisms and cell types. The resulting collections of pairwise contacts across the genome have connected chromatin architecture to many cellular phenomena, including replication timing and gene regulation. However, high resolution (10 kb or finer) contact maps remain scarce due to the expense and time required for collection. A computational method for predicting pairwise contacts without the need to run a Hi-C experiment would be invaluable in understanding the role that 3D chromatin architecture plays in genome biology. We describe Rambutan, a deep convolutional neural network that predicts Hi-C contacts at 1 kb resolution using nucleotide sequence and DNaseI assay signal as inputs. Specifically, Rambutan identifies locus pairs that engage in high confidence contacts according to Fit-Hi-C, a previously described method for assigning statistical confidence estimates to Hi-C contacts. We first demonstrate Rambutans performance across chromosomes at 1 kb resolution in the GM12878 cell line. Subsequently, we measure Rambutans performance across six cell types. In this setting, the model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7662 and 0.8246 and an area under the precision-recall curve between 0.3737 and 0.9008. We further demonstrate that the predicted contacts exhibit expected trends relative to histone modification ChlP-seq data, replication timing measurements, and annotations of functional elements such as promoters and enhancers. Finally, we predict Hi-C contacts for 53 human cell types and show that the predictions cluster by cellular function. [NOTE: After our original submission we discovered an error in our calling of statistically significant contacts. Briefly, when calculating the prior probability of a contact, we used the number of contacts at a certain genomic distance in a chromosome but divided by the total number of bins in the full genome. While we investigate what impact this had on our results, we ask that readers treat this manuscript skeptically.]",

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism is regulated by enzyme complexes within the mitochondrion, the function of which are sensitive to the prevailing temperature. Such thermal sensitivity, coupled with the observation that population frequencies of mitochondrial haplotypes tend to associate with latitude, altitude or climatic regions across species distributions, led to the hypothesis that thermal selection has played a role in shaping standing variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence. This hypothesis, however, remains controversial, and requires evidence that the distribution of haplotypes observed in nature corresponds with the capacity of these haplotypes to confer differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, haplotypes predominating in tropical climates are predicted to encode increased tolerance to heat stress, but decreased tolerance to cold stress. We present direct evidence for these predictions, using mtDNA haplotypes sampled from the Australian distribution of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the ability of flies to tolerate extreme thermal challenges is affected by sequence variation across mtDNA haplotypes, and that the thermal performance associated with each haplotype corresponds with its latitudinal prevalence. The haplotype that predominates at low (subtropical) latitudes confers greater resilience to heat stress, but lower resilience to cold stress, than haplotypes predominating at higher (temperate) latitudes. We explore molecular mechanisms that might underlie these responses, presenting evidence that the effects are in part regulated by SNPs that do not change the protein sequence. Our findings suggest that standing variation in the mitochondrial genome can be shaped by thermal selection, and could therefore contribute to evolutionary adaptation under climatic stress.",

    "abstract": "The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia suppresses the capacity for arboviral transmission in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and can spread through wild mosquito populations following local introductions. Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spread, that could be due to: i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; ii) leptokurtically distributed dispersal distances; and iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential causes using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We observed a significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312m apart, suggesting long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. Finally, we found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, suggesting loss of Wolbachia in the field. While the long-distance movement and Wolbachia loss currently represent single observations, these findings together with the identified dispersal barriers can contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through the Ae. aegypti population in Cairns. Our landscape genomics approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being considered for biocontrol.",

Although promising, these studies were not controlled for the placebo effect. To address this issue, and to further test the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, we conducted a parallel arm, double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial, in patients with treatment-resistant major depression. Thirty-five patients with treatment-resistant major depression received a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. We measured as primary outcome the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) seven days after the dosing session, and as secondary outcomes the changes in Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and response rates at one day (D1), two days (D2) and seven days (D7) after dosing, and remission rates at D7. This study is registered with http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02914769). We observed robust evidence of rapid antidepressant effects of a single dosing session with ayahuasca when compared to placebo. HAM-D scores at D7 were significantly lower in patients treated with ayahuasca than in those treated with placebo (p=0{middle dot}019; Cohens d=0{middle dot}98). MADRS scores were significantly reduced in the ayahuasca group compared to the placebo group at all endpoints (at D1 and D2, p=0{middle dot}04; at D7, p<0{middle dot}0001). Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 (D1: Cohens d=0{middle dot}84; D2: Cohens d=0{middle dot}84; D7: Cohens d=1{middle dot}49). Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2, and were significantly higher in the ayahuasca group only at D7 (64% vs. 27%; OR = 4{middle dot}95; p = 0{middle dot}04; NNT = 2{middle dot}66). Remission rate was not significantly different between groups. Our study provides new evidence of rapid antidepressant effects of ayahuasca for treatment-resistant major depression.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionFor effective public communication during major disease outbreaks like the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, health information needs of the population must be adequately assessed. Through content analysis of social media data, like tweets, public health information needs can be effectively assessed and in turn provide appropriate health information to effectively address such needs. The aim of the current study was to assess health information needs about Ebola, at distinct epidemic time points, through longitudinal tracking.\\n\\nMethodsNatural language processing was applied to explore public response to Ebola over time from the beginning of the outbreak (July 2014) to six month post outbreak (March 2015). A total 155,647 tweets (unique 68,736, retweet 86,911) mentioning Ebola were analyzed and visualized with infographics.\\n\\nResultsPublic fear, frustration, and health information seeking regarding Ebola-related global priorities were observed across time. Our longitudinal content analysis revealed that due to ongoing health information deficiencies, resulting in fear and frustration, social media was at times an impediment and not a vehicle to support health information needs.\\n\\nDiscussionContent analysis of tweets effectively assessed Ebola information needs. Our study also demonstrates the use of Twitter as a method for capturing real-time data to assess ongoing information needs, fear, and frustration over time.\\n\\nAll authors have seen and approved the manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a dramatic complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with aneurysms, moya moya, intravascular thrombi, cerebral hyperemia and increased vessel tortuosity. We show that aged SCD mice spontaneously develop the characteristics features of cerebral vasculopathy seen in human SCD. Thirteen month old Townes SCD mice and age-matched controls had a cranial windows implanted over the somatosensory cortex. Cortical capillaries were imaged using in vivo two-photon microscopy after the blood plasma was labeled with a fluorescent dye. Results showed that SCD mice compared to controls, had significantly higher red blood cell (RBC) velocity and capillary vessel diameter. SCD mice also had a significantly higher number of occlusive events in the capillary bed, resulting in more stalling of RBC flow. Microvascular topology was also altered, as SCD mice had significantly higher vessel tortuosity and shorter capillary branch lengths. Finally, post-mortem analyses revealed a greater number of cortical microinfarcts, likely caused by vascular occlusion since local tissue hypoxia and blood-brain barrier leakage was prominent. We concluded that aged Townes sickle cell mice spontaneously develop SCD-associated cerebral vasculopathy, and that in vivo two-photon imaging is a powerful approach to investigate the mechanisms of vascular complications in SCD.",

    "abstract": "AimsInhibition of {beta}-lactamase by clavulanate (Clav) sensitizes multi-and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains towards {beta}-lactams such as amoxicillin (Amox). However, the underlying mechanism of how Mtb responds to Amox-Clav combination (Augmentin; AG) is not characterized.\\n\\nResultsWe integrated global expression profiling with the protein-protein interaction landscape and generated a genome-scale network of Mtb in response to AG. In addition to specific targets (e.g., peptidoglycan biosynthesis and {beta}-lactamase), the response to AG was also centered on redox-balance, central carbon metabolism (CCM), and respiration in Mtb. We discovered that AG modulates superoxide levels, NADH/NAD+ balance and mycothiol redox potential (EMSH) of Mtb. Higher intra-mycobacterial EMSH potentiates mycobactericidal efficacy of AG, whereas lower EMSH induces tolerance. Further, Mtb responds to AG via a redox-sensitive transcription factor, WhiB4. Mtb{Delta}whiB4 displayed higher expression of genes involved in {beta}-lactam resistance along with those mediating respiration, CCM and redox balance. Moreimportantly, WhiB4 binds to the promoter regions and represses transcription of genes involved in {beta}-lactamase expression in a redox-dependent manner. Lastly, while Mtb{Delta}whiB4 maintained internal EMSH, exhibited greater {beta}-lactamase activity and displayed AG-tolerance, overexpression of WhiB4 induced oxidative shift in EMSH and repressed {beta}-lactamase activity to aggravate AG-mediated killing of drug-sensitive and -resistant strains of Mtb.\\n\\nInnovation and ConclusionsThis work demonstrate that efficacy of {beta}-lactam\\\\{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combination can be attenuated by elevating mycobacterial antioxidant capabilities and potentiated by impairing redox buffering capacity of Mtb. The functional linkage between {beta}-lactams, redox balance, and WhiB4 can be exploited to potentiate AG action against drug-resistant Mtb.",

The measured values scatter over an order of magnitude but the corresponding Arrhenius activation energies converge in the current literature. Osmotic flux through an AQP was simulated as water current forced through the channel by kilobar hydraulic pressure or theoretically approximated as single-file diffusion. In this paper, we report large scale simulations of osmotic current under sub M gradient through three water channels (the water-specific AQP4 and AQP5 along with aquaglyceroporin GlpF) using the mature particle mesh Ewald technique (PME) for which the established force fields have been optimized with known accuracy. These simulations were implemented with hybrid periodic boundary conditions devised to avoid the artifactitious mixing across the membrane in a regular PME simulation. The computed single-channel permeabilities at 5{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C are in agreement with recently refined experiments on GlpF. The Arrhenius activation energies extracted from our simulations for all the three AQPs agree with the in vitro measurements. The single-file diffusion approximations from our large-scale simulations are consistent with the current literature on smaller systems. From these unambiguous agreements among the in vitro and in silico studies, we observe the quantitative accuracy of the all-atom force fields of the current literature for water-channel biology. We also observe that AQP4, that is particularly rich in the central nervous system, is more efficient in water conduction and more temperature-sensitive than other water-specific channel proteins.",

    "abstract": "Research on network mechanisms and coding properties of grid cells assume that the firing rate of a grid cell in each of its fields is the same. Furthermore, proposed network models predict spatial regularities in the firing of inhibitory interneurons that are inconsistent with experimental data. In this paper, by analyzing the response of grid cells recorded from rats during free navigation, we first show that there are strong variations in the mean firing rate of the fields of individual grid cells and thus show that the data is inconsistent with the theoretical models that predict similar peak magnitudes. We then build a two population excitatory-inhibitory network model in which sparse spatially selective input to the excitatory cells, presumed to arise from e.g. salient external stimuli, hippocampus or a combination of both, leads to the variability in the firing field amplitudes of grid cells. We show that, when combined with appropriate connectivity between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the variability in the firing field amplitudes of grid cells results in inhibitory neurons that do not exhibit regular spatial firing, consistent with experimental data. Finally, we show that even if the spatial positions of the fields are maintained, variations in the firing rates of the fields of grid cells are enough to cause remapping of hippocampal cells.",
