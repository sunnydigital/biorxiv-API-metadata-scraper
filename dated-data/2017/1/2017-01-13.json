    "abstract": "The perceptual representation of individual faces is often explained with reference to a norm-based face space. In such spaces, individuals are encoded as vectors where identity is primarily conveyed by direction and distinctiveness by eccentricity. Here we measured human fMRI responses and psychophysical similarity judgments of individual face exemplars, which were generated as realistic 3D animations using a computer-graphics model. We developed and evaluated multiple neurobiologically plausible computational models, each of which predicts a representational distance matrix and a regional-mean activation profile for 24 face stimuli. In the fusiform face area, a face-space coding model with sigmoidal ramp tuning provided a better account of the data than one based on exemplar tuning. However, an image-processing model with weighted banks of Gabor filters performed similarly. Accounting for the data required the inclusion of a measurement-level population averaging mechanism that approximates how fMRI voxels locally average distinct neuronal tunings. Our study demonstrates the importance of comparing multiple models and of modeling the measurement process in computational neuroimaging.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHumans recognize conspecifics by their faces. Understanding how faces are recognized is an open computational problem with relevance to theories of perception, social cognition, and the engineering of computer vision systems. Here we measured brain activity with functional MRI while human participants viewed individual faces. We developed multiple computational models inspired by known response preferences of single neurons in the primate visual cortex. We then compared these neuronal models to patterns of brain activity corresponding to individual faces. The data were consistent with a model where neurons respond to directions in a high-dimensional space of faces. It also proved essential to model how functional MRI voxels locally average the responses of tens of thousands of neurons. The study highlights the challenges in adjudicating between alternative computational theories of visual information processing.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are routinely visualized to present and interpret the evolutionary relationships of species. Virtually all empirical evolutionary data studies contain a visualization of the inferred tree with branch support values. Ambiguous semantics in tree file formats can lead to erroneous tree visualizations and therefore to incorrect interpretations of phylogenetic analyses.\\n\\nHere, we discuss problems that can and do arise when displaying branch values on trees after re-rooting. Branch values are typically stored as node labels in the widely-used Newick tree format. However, such values are attributes of branches. Storing them as node labels can therefore yield errors when re-rooting trees. This depends on the mostly implicit semantics that tools deploy to interpret node labels.\\n\\nWe reviewed 10 tree viewers and 10 bioinformatics toolkits that can display and re-root trees. We found that 14 out of 20 of these tools do not permit users to select the semantics of node labels. Thus, unaware users might obtain incorrect results when rooting trees inferred by common phylogenetic inference programs. We illustrate such incorrect mappings for several test cases and real examples taken from the literature. This review has already led to improvements and workarounds in 8 of the tested tools. We suggest tools should provide an option that explicitly forces users to define the semantics of node labels.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, scientists have created artificial microscopic and nanoscopic self-propelling particles, often referred to as nano- or micro-swimmers, capable of mimicking biological locomotion and taxis. This active diffusion enables the engineering of complex operations that so far have not been possible at the micro- and nanoscale. One of the most promising task is the ability to engineer nanocarriers that can autonomously navigate within tissues and organs, accessing nearly every site of the human body guided by endogenous chemical gradients. Here we report a fully synthetic, organic, nanoscopic system that exhibits attractive chemotaxis driven by enzymatic conversion of glucose. We achieve this by encapsulating glucose oxidase -- alone or in combination with catalase -- into nanoscopic and biocompatible asymmetric polymer vesicles (known as polymersomes). We show that these vesicles self-propel in response to an external gradient of glucose by inducing a slip velocity on their surface, which makes them move in an extremely sensitive way towards higher concentration regions. We finally demonstrate that the chemotactic behaviour of these nanoswimmers enables a four-fold increase in penetration to the brain compared to non-chemotactic systems.",

    "abstract": "The Anopheles gambiae complex contains a number of highly anthropophilic mosquito species that have acquired exceptional ability to thrive in complex human habitats. Thus, examining the evolutionary history of this Afrotropical mosquito may yield vital information on the selective processes that occurred during the adaptation to human-dominated environments. We performed reduced representation sequencing on 941 mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex collected across four ecogeographic zones in Cameroon. We find evidence for genetic and geographic subdivision within An. coluzzii and An. gambiae sensu stricto - the two most significant malaria vectors in the region. Importantly, in both species, rural and urban populations are genetically differentiated. Genome scans reveal pervasive signatures of selection centered on genes involved in xenobiotic resistance. Notably, a selective sweep containing detoxification enzymes is prominent in urban mosquitoes that exploit polluted breeding sites. Overall, our study suggests that recent anthropogenic environmental modifications and widespread use of insecticides are driving population differentiation and local adaptation in vectors with potentially significant consequences for malaria epidemiology.",

We find that alteration of Pol II catalytic rate, either fast or slow, leads to decreased Pol II occupancy and apparent reduction in elongation rate in vivo. However, we also find that determination of elongation rate in vivo by chromatin IP can be confounded by the kinetics and conditions of transcriptional shutoff in the assay. We identify promoter and template-specific effects on severity of gene expression defects for both fast and slow Pol II mutants. We show that mRNA half-lives for a reporter gene are increased in both fast and slow Pol II mutant strains and the magnitude of half-life changes correlate both with mutants growth and reporter expression defects. Finally, we tested a model that altered Pol II activity sensitizes cells to nucleotide depletion. In contrast to model predictions, mutated Pol II retains normal sensitivity to altered nucleotide levels. Our experiments establish a framework for understanding the diversity of transcription defects derived from altered Pol II activity mutants, essential for their use as probes of transcription mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "There is widespread interest in the relationship between the neurobiological systems supporting human cognition and emerging computational systems capable of emulating these capacities. Human speech comprehension, poorly understood as a neurobiological process, is an important case in point. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems with near-human levels of performance are now available, which provide a computationally explicit solution for the recognition of words in continuous speech. This research aims to bridge the gap between speech recognition processes in humans and machines, using novel multivariate techniques to compare incremental 'machine states', generated as the ASR analysis progresses over time, to the incremental 'brain states', measured using combined electro-and magneto-encephalography (EMEG), generated as the same inputs are heard by human listeners. This direct comparison of dynamic human and machine internal states, as they respond to the same incrementally delivered sensory input, revealed a significant correspondence between neural response patterns in human superior temporal cortex and the structural properties of ASR-derived phonetic models. Spatially coherent patches in human temporal cortex responded selectively to individual phonetic features defined on the basis of machine-extracted regularities in the speech to lexicon mapping process. These results demonstrate the feasibility of relating human and ASR solutions to the problem of speech recognition, and suggest the potential for further studies relating complex neural computations in human speech comprehension to the rapidly evolving ASR systems that address the same problem domain.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe ability to understand spoken language is a defining human capacity. But despite decades of research, there is still no well-specified account of how sound entering the ear is neurally interpreted as a sequence of meaningful words. At the same time, modern computer-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are capable of nearhuman levels of performance, especially where word-identification is concerned. In this research we aim to bridge the gap between human and machine solutions to speech recognition. We use a novel combination of neuroimaging and statistical methods to relate human and machine internal states that are dynamically generated as spoken words are heard by human listeners and analysed by ASR systems. We find that the stable regularities discovered by the ASR process, linking speech input to phonetic labels, can be significantly related to the regularities extracted in the human brain. Both systems may have in common a representation of these regularities in terms of articulatory phonetic features, consistent with an analysis process which recovers the articulatory gestures that generated the speech. These results suggest a possible partnership between human-and machine-based research which may deliver both a better understanding of how the human brain provides such a robust solution to speech understanding, and generate insights that enhance the performance of future ASR systems.",

    "abstract": "This study is an attempt to expand a previous survey by Fisler and Lecointre (FL) for systematizing ideas on the use of the tree metaphor in classification, as expressed by various historically important figures in their writings. FL used a cladistic approach to analyze their data, as employed in biological classification. We supplement this analysis here using several methods of multivariate data exploration, producing a UPGMA dendrogram, a minimum spanning tree, a neighbor joining additive tree, a plexus graph, a phylogenetic network, and two multidimensional scaling ordinations of the same data used by FL. We confirm the validity of many of FLs smaller clusters of writings, and revealed a new 3-group categorization undetected by the previous study. These three groups largely correspond to Classifiers, who did not consider evolution for historical reasons or on purpose, Non-analytical evolutionists, who recognized evolution but with a more or less naive attitude towards the temporal change of life, and Modelers, with more explicit views on evolutionary processes, often applying objective mathematical tools for exploring the past and present of organismal diversity. Some scientists were difficult to assign to any group unambiguously, including J.W. von Goethe, who takes a unique position in the history of biology, and, to a lesser extent, E. Mayr and G.G. Simpson, the leaders of the gradist school of systematics. We argue that cladistic methods are insufficient by themselves, notably in situations where there are no obvious ancestor-descendant relationships underlying the development of the objects being analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Multiple and unpredictable numbers of actions are often required to achieve a goal. In order to organize behavior and allocate effort so that optimal behavioral policies can be selected, it is necessary to continually monitor ongoing actions. Real-time processing of information related to actions and outcomes is typically assigned to the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, but also depends on midbrain regions, especially the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We were interested in how individual VTA neurons, as well as networks within the VTA, encode salient events when an unpredictable number of serial actions are required to obtain a reward. We recorded from ensembles of putative dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the VTA as animals performed multiple cued trials in a recording session where, in each trial, serial actions were randomly rewarded. While averaging population activity did not reveal a response pattern, we observed that different neurons selectively tuned to low, medium, or high numbered actions in a trial. This preferential tuning of putative dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons to different subsets of actions in a trial allowed information about binned action number to be decoded from the ensemble activity. At the network level, tuning curve similarity was positively associated with action-evoked noise correlations, suggesting that action number selectivity reflects functional connectivity within these networks. Analysis of phasic responses to cue and reward revealed that the requirement to execute multiple and uncertain numbers of actions weakens both cue-evoked responses and cue-reward response correlation. The functional connectivity and ensemble coding scheme that we observe here may allow VTA neurons to cooperatively provide a real-time account of ongoing behavior. These computations may be critical to cognitive and motivational functions that have long been associated with VTA dopamine neurons.",

    "abstract": "In animals, skewed sex ratios can affect individual fitness either via sexual interactions (e.g. intersexual conflict or intrasexual mate competition) or non-sexual interactions (e.g. sex-specific resource competition). Because most analyses of sex ratio focus on sexual interactions, the relative importance of these mechanisms remains unclear. We addressed this problem using the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, where male-biased sex ratios increase female fitness relative to unbiased or female-biased groups. Although flour beetles show both sexual and non-sexual (resource) competition, we found that sexual interactions did not explain female fitness. Instead, female fecundity was dramatically reduced even after a brief exposure to flour conditioned by other females. Earlier studies suggested that quinones (secreted toxins) might mediate density-dependent population growth in flour beetles. We identified ethyl- and methyl-benzoquinone (EBQ and MBQ) as the primary components of adult stink glands that regulate female fecundity. In female-biased groups (i.e. at high female density), females upregulated quinones and suppressed each others reproduction. In male-biased groups, low female density lead to low quinone levels, allowing higher fecundity. Thus, quinones serve both as indicators and mediators of female competition, resulting in the observed fitness decline in female-biased groups. Our results underscore the importance of non-sexual interference competition that may often underlie the fitness consequences of skewed sex ratios.",

Our results suggest that the perception of risk is an overarching process across non-social and social decision-making, whereas nonlinear weighting of others acceptance probabilities is unique to social interactions in which others valuation processes needs to be inferred. Despite the complexity of social decision-making, human participants make near-optimal decisions by dynamically adjusting their decision parameters to the changing social value orientation of their opponents through influence by multidimensional inferences they make about those opponents (e.g. how prosocial they think their opponent is relative to themselves).",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale genomic, chemical and pharmacological data provides new opportunities for drug discovery and repositioning. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous data not only serves as a promising tool for identifying new drug-target interactions (DTIs), which is an important step in drug development, but also provides a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug action. In this work, we integrate diverse drug-related information, including drugs, proteins, diseases and side-effects, together with their interactions, associations or similarities, to construct a heterogeneous network with 12,015 nodes and 1,895,445 edges. We then develop a new computational pipeline, called DTINet, to predict novel drug-target interactions from the constructed heterogeneous network. Specifically, DTINet focuses on learning a low-dimensional vector representation of features for each node, which accurately explains the topological properties of individual nodes in the heterogeneous network, and then predicts the likelihood of a new DTI based on these representations via a vector space projection scheme. DTINet achieves substantial performance improvement over other state-of-the-art methods for DTI prediction. Moreover, we have experimentally validated the novel interactions between three drugs and the cyclooxygenase (COX) protein family predicted by DTINet, and demonstrated the new potential applications of these identified COX inhibitors in preventing inflammatory diseases. These results indicate that DTINet can provide a practically useful tool for integrating heterogeneous information to predict new drug-target interactions and repurpose existing drugs.

The proportion of anagenetic endemics and of all endemics steadily increased over time. Extinction rates of endemic species peaked later than for non-endemic species. Species richness and the number of anagenetic endemics decreased with isolation as did rates of colonization, anagenesis, and extinction. The proportion of all endemics and of cladogenetic endemics, the number of cladogenetic endemics, of radiating lineages, and of species per radiating lineage, and the cladogenesis rate all increased with isolation.\\n\\nMain conclusionsThe results confirm most GDM predictions related to island ontogeny and isolation, but predict an increasing proportion of endemics throughout the experiment: a difference attributable to diverging assumptions on late island ontogeny. New insights regarding the extinction trends of endemics further demonstrate how simulation models focusing on low ecological levels provide tools to test biogeographical-scale predictions and to develop more detailed predictions for further empirical tests.",

    "abstract": "Changes in inhibitory connections are essential for experience-dependent circuit adaptations. Defects in inhibitory synapses are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, but the molecular processes underlying inhibitory synapse formation are not well understood. Here we use high resolution two-photon microscopy in organotypic hippocampal slices to examine the signaling pathways induced by the postsynaptic signaling molecule Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) during inhibitory synapse formation. By monitoring changes in individual GFP-labeled presynaptic boutons we found that the primary action of Sema4D is to induce stabilization of presynaptic boutons within tens of minutes. Stabilizing boutons rapidly recruited synaptic vesicles, which was followed by accumulation of postsynaptic gephyrin. Newly formed inhibitory synapses were complete and functional after 24 hours, as determined by electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We further showed that Sema4D signaling is regulated by network activity and can induce a local increase in bouton density, suggesting a possible role in circuit adaptation. We further examined the intracellular signaling cascade triggered by Sema4D and found that bouton stabilization occurred through rapid remodeling of actin, and this could be mimicked by the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B or by reducing ROCK activity. The intracellular signaling cascade required activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, which is a well-known autism risk factor. Our immunohistochemistry data suggests that MET may be localized to presynaptic inhibitory axons. Together, our data yield important insights in the molecular pathway underlying activity-dependent Sema4D-induced synapse formation and reveal a novel role for MET in inhibitory synapses.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGABAergic synapses provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain. We make important steps in unraveling the molecular processes that take place when formation of inhibitory synapses is triggered by a specific signaling molecule, Sema4D. We find that this process depends on network activity and involves specific remodeling of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. We also reveal a previously unknown role for MET in inhibitory synapses. As defects in GABAergic synapses have been implied in many brain disorders, and mutations in MET are strong risk factors for autism, our findings urge for a further investigation of the role of MET at inhibitory synapses.",

    "abstract": "Archaeogenomic research has proven to be a valuable tool to trace migrations of historic and prehistoric individuals and groups, whereas relationships within a group or burial site have not been investigated to a large extent. Knowing the genetic kinship of historic and prehistoric individuals would give important insights into social structures of ancient and historic cultures. Most archaeogenetic research concerning kinship has been restricted to uniparental markers, while studies using genome-wide information were mainly focused on comparisons between populations. Applications which infer the degree of relationship based on modern-day DNA information typically require diploid genotype data. Low concentration of endogenous DNA, fragmentation and other post-mortem damage to ancient DNA (aDNA) makes the application of such tools unfeasible for most archaeological samples. To infer family relationships for degraded samples, we developed the software READ (Relationship Estimation from Ancient DNA). We show that our heuristic approach can successfully infer up to second degree relationships with as little as 0.1x shotgun coverage per genome for pairs of individuals. We uncover previously unknown relationships among prehistoric individuals by applying READ to published aDNA data from several human remains excavated from different cultural contexts. In particular, we find a group of five closely related males from the same Corded Ware culture site in modern-day Germany, suggesting patrilocality, which highlights the possibility to uncover social structures of ancient populations by applying READ to genome-wide aDNA data.",

    "abstract": "The merging of genomes in inter-specific hybrids can result in novel phenotypes, including increased growth rate and biomass yield, a phenomenon known as heterosis. We describe a budding yeast hybrid that grows faster than its parents under different environments. Phenotypically, the hybrid progresses more rapidly through cell cycle checkpoints, relieves the repression of respiration in fast growing conditions, does not slow down its growth when presented with ethanol stress, and shows increasing signs of DNA damage. A systematic genetic screen identified hundreds of alleles affecting hybrid growth whose identity vastly differed between the hybrid and its parent and between growth conditions. This large-scale rewiring of allele effects suggests that despite showing clear heterosis, the hybrid is perturbed in multiple regulatory processes. We discuss the possibility that incompatibilities contribute to hybrid vigor by perturbing safeguard mechanisms that limit growth in the parental background.",

    "abstract": "p53 as an effector of nucleolar stress is well defined, but p53 independent mechanisms are largely unknown. Like p53, the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress. Many stresses that stimulate NF-{kappa}B also disrupt nucleoli. However, the link between nucleolar function and activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway is as yet unknown. Here we demonstrate that siRNA silencing of PolI complex components stimulates NF-{kappa}B signalling. Unlike p53 nucleolar stress response, this effect does not appear to be linked to inhibition of rDNA transcription. We show that specific stress stimuli of NF-{kappa}B induce degradation of a critical component of the PolI complex, TIF-IA. This degradation precedes activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway and is associated with an atypical nucleolar architecture. It is mimicked by CDK4 inhibition and is dependent upon upstream binding factor (UBF) and p14ARF. We show that blocking stress effects on TIF-IA blocks their ability to activate the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Finally, using ex vivo culture, we show a strong correlation between degradation of TIF-IA and activation of NF-{kappa}B in freshly resected, human colorectal tumours exposed to the chemopreventative agent, aspirin. Together, our study provides compelling evidence for a new, NF-{kappa}B nucleolar stress response pathway that has in vivo relevance and therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Animals can show very different behaviors even in isogenic populations, but the underlying mechanisms to generate this variability remain elusive. We found that laboratory and isogenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae showed consistent individual behaviors when swimming freely in identical wells or in reaction to stimuli. We also found that this behavioral inter-individual variability was reduced when we impaired the histone deacetylation pathway. Individuals with high levels of histone H4 acetylation, and specifically H4K12, behaved similar to the average of the population, but those with low levels deviated from it. More precisely, we found a set of genomic regions whose histone H4 acetylation is reduced with the distance between the individual and the average population behavior. We found evidence that this modulation depends on a complex of Yin-yang 1 (YY1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) that binds to and deacetylates these regions. These changes were not only maintained at the transcriptional level but also amplified, as most target regions were located near genes encoding transcription factors. We suggest that stochasticity in the histone deacetylation pathway participates the generation of genetic-independent behavioral inter-individual variability.",

    "abstract": "In temperate countries, influenza and other viral respiratory diseases often have distinct seasonal peaks occurring during colder, wintertime months. However, little is known about the dynamics of influenza and viral respiratory disease dynamics in the tropics, despite high morbidity and a clear epidemiological link between tropical and temperate countries. In temperate countries, the dynamics of influenza and other respiratory diseases are often analyzed using syndromic surveillance data describing influenza-like illness (ILI) as ILI is highly correlated with virological surveillance for influenza. To obtain a detailed picture of respiratory disease incidence patterns in a large tropical city, we established an mHealth study in community outpatient clinics in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (11N latitude). From August 2009 through December 2015, clinics reported daily case numbers of ILI using standard mobile-phone SMS messaging. A subset of these clinics performed molecular diagnostics for influenza A and B viruses. Unlike the annual patterns seen in temperate countries, ILI activity in Ho Chi Minh City exhibited strong non-annual periodicity and was not correlated with PCR-confirmed influenza. The dominant periodicity in the data was approximately 200 days. This was confirmed by a time series decomposition, a step-wise regression analysis on annual and non-annual covariates, and a forecasting exercise showing that forecasting was 30% to 40% more accurate when a 200-day non-annual cycle was included in the forecast. This suggests, for the first-time, that a non-annual cycle may be an essential driver of ILI dynamics in the tropics. This raises new questions about the seasonality and drivers of respiratory disease transmission in tropical countries.",

Several species are important model organisms for scientific research to study embryogenesis, development, immune function, and endocrine signaling. The globally-distributed Ranidae (true frogs) are the largest frog family, and have substantial evolutionary distance from the model laboratory Xenopus frog species. Consequently, the extensive Xenopus genomic resources are of limited utility for Ranids and related frog species. More widely applicable amphibian genomic data is urgently needed as more than two-thirds of known species are currently threatened or are undergoing population declines.\\n\\nHerein, we report on the first genome sequence of a Ranid species, an adult male North American bullfrog (Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana). We assembled high-depth Illumina reads (66-fold coverage), into a 5.8 Gbp (NG50 = 57.7 kbp) draft genome using ABySS v1.9.0. The assembly was scaffolded with LINKS and RAILS using pseudo-long-reads from targeted denovo assembler Kollector and Illumina Synthetic Long-Reads, as well as reads from long fragment (MPET) libraries. We predicted over 22,000 protein-coding genes using the MAKER2 pipeline and identified the genomic loci of 6,227 candidate long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) from a composite reference bullfrog transcriptome. Mitochondrial sequence analysis supported Lithobates as a subgenus of Rana. RNA-Seq experiments identified ~6,000 thyroid hormone- responsive transcripts in the back skin of premetamorphic tadpoles; the majority of which regulate DNA/RNA processing. Moreover, 1/6th of differentially-expressed transcripts were putative lncRNAs. Our draft bullfrog genome will serve as a useful resource for the amphibian research community.",

    "abstract": "High density linkage maps are an important tool to gain insight into the genetic architecture of traits of evolutionary and economic interest, and provide a resource to characterise variation in recombination landscapes. Here, we used information from the cattle genome and the 50K Cervine Illumina BeadChip to inform and refine a high density linkage map in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We constructed a predicted linkage map of 38,038 SNPs and a skeleton map of 10,835 SNPs across 34 linkage groups. We identified several chromosomal rearrangements in the deer lineage relative to sheep and cattle, including six chromosome fissions, one fusion and two large inversions. Otherwise, our findings showed strong concordance with map orders in the cattle genome. The sex-averaged linkage map length was 2739.7cM and the genome-wide autosomal recombination rate was 1.04cM per Mb. The female autosomal map length was 1.21 longer than that of males (2767.4cM vs 2280.8cM, respectively). Sex differences in map length were driven by high female recombination rates in peri-centromeric regions, a pattern that is unusual relative to other mammal species. This effect was more pronounced in fission chromosomes that would have had to produce new centromeres. We propose two hypotheses to explain this effect: (1) that this mechanism may have evolved to counteract centromeric drive associated with meiotic asymmetry in oocyte production; and/or (2) that sequence and structural characteristics suppressing recombination in close proximity to the centromere may not have yet evolved at neo-centromeres. Our study provides insight into how recombination landscapes vary and evolve in mammals, and will provide a valuable resource for studies of evolution, genetic improvement and population management in red deer and related species.\\n\\nArticle SummaryWe present a high density linkage map (>38,000 markers) in a wild population of Red deer (Cervus elaphus). Our investigation of the recombination landscape showed a marked difference in recombination rates between the sexes in proximity to the centromere, with females showing an unusually elevated rate relative to other mammal species. This effect is most pronounced in chromosomes that would have produced a new centromere in the deer lineage.

    "abstract": "BackgroundOur previous studies demonstrated that growth and migration of medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children, are stimulated by 17{beta}-estradiol. The growth stimulating effects of estrogens are mediated through ER{beta} and insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling to inhibit caspase 3 activity and reduce tumor cell apoptosis. The objective of this study was to determine whether estrogens decreased sensitivity of MB cells to cytotoxic actions of chemotherapeutic drugs.\\n\\nMethodsUsing in vitro cell viability and clonogenic survival assays, concentration response analysis was used to determine whether the cytoprotective effects of estradiol protected human D283 Med MB cells from the cytotoxic actions of the MB chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin, vincristine, or lomustine. Additional experiments were done to determine whether the ER antagonist fulvestrant or the selective ER modulator tamoxifen blocked the cytoprotective actions of estradiol. ER-selective agonists and antagonists were used to define receptor specificity, and the impacts of the soy-derived phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, and s-equol on chemosensitivity were evaluated.\\n\\nResultsIn D283 Med cells the presence of 10 nM estradiol increased the IC50 for cisplatin-induced inhibition of viability 2-fold from ~5 M to >10 M. In clonogenic survival assays estradiol decreased the chemosensitivity of D283 Med exposed to cisplatin, lomustine and vincristine. The ER{beta} selective agonist DPN and low physiological concentrations of the soy-derived phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, and s-equol also decreased sensitivity of D283 Med cells to cisplatin. The protective effects of estradiol were blocked by the antiestrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) and the ER{beta} selective antagonist PPHTP. Whereas estradiol also decreased chemosensitivity of PFSK1 cells, estradiol increased sensitivity of Daoy cell to cisplatin, suggesting that ER{beta} mediated effects may vary in different subtypes of MB.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that E2 and environmental estrogens decrease sensitivity of MB to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, and that ER{beta} selective and non-selective inhibition of estrogen receptor activity blocks these cytoprotective actions. These findings support the therapeutic potential of antiestrogen adjuvant therapies for MB, and findings that soy phytoestrogens also decrease sensitivity of MB cells to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics suggest that decreased exposure to environmental estrogens may benefit MB patient responses to chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial conglomerates such as biofilms and microcolonies are ubiquitous in nature and play an important role in industry and medicine. In contrast to well-mixed, diluted cultures routinely used in microbial research, bacteria in a microcolonv interact mechanically with one another and with the substrate to which they are attached. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the role of such mechanical interactions on growth and biological evolution of microbial populations. Here we use a computer model of a microbial colony of rod-shaped cells to investigate how physical interactions between cells determine their motion in the colony, this affects biological evolution. We show that the probability that a faster-growing mutant \\\"surfs\\\" at the colonys frontier and creates a macroscopic sector depends on physical properties of cells (shape, elasticity, friction). Although all these factors contribute to the surfing probability in seemingly different ways, they all ultimately exhibit their effects by altering the roughness of the expanding frontier of the colony and the orientation of cells. Our predictions are confirmed by experiments in which we measure the surfing probability for colonies of different front roughness. Our results show that physical interactions between bacterial cells play an important role in biological evolution of new traits, and suggest that these interaction may be relevant to processes such as de novo evolution of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Subjective experience suggests that we are able to direct our auditory attention independent of our visual gaze, e.g when shadowing a nearby conversation at a cocktail party. But what are the consequences at the behavioural and neural level? While numerous studies have investigated both auditory attention and visual gaze independently, little is known about their interaction during selective listening. In the present EEG study, we manipulated visual gaze independently of auditory attention while participants detected targets presented from one of three loudspeakers. We observed increased response times when gaze was directed away from the locus of auditory attention. Further, we found an increase in occipital alpha-band power contralateral to the direction of gaze, indicative of a suppression of distracting input. Finally, this condition also led to stronger central theta-band power, which correlated with the observed effect in response times, indicative of differences in top-down processing. Our data suggest that a misalignment between gaze and auditory attention both reduce behavioural performance and modulate underlying neural processes. The involvement of central theta-band and occipital alpha-band effects are in line with compensatory neural mechanisms such as increased cognitive control and the suppression of task irrelevant inputs.",

    "abstract": "A successful strategy for prediction of crop yield that accounts for the effects of genotype and environment will open up many opportunities for enhancing the productivity of agricultural systems. Crop growth models (CGMs) have a history of application for crop management decision support. Recently whole genome prediction (WGP) methodologies have been developed and applied in breeding to enable prediction of crop traits for new genotypes and thus increase the size of plant breeding programs without the need to expand expensive field testing. The presence of Genotype-by-Environment-by-Management (GxExM) interactions for yield presents a significant challenge for the development of prediction technologies for both product development by breeding and product placement within agricultural production systems. The integration of a CGM into the algorithm for whole genome prediction WGP, referred to as CGM-WGP, has opened up the potential for prediction of GxExM interactions for breeding and product placement applications. Here a combination of simulation and empirical studies are used to explain how the CGM-WGP methodology works and to demonstrate successful reduction to practice for applications to maize breeding and product placement recommendation in the US corn belt.",

    "abstract": "AimsUnderstanding how biodiversity emerges and varies in space and time is central to ecology and biogeography. Multiple processes affect biodiversity at different scales and organizational levels, hence progress in understanding biodiversity dynamics requires the integration of these underlying processes. Here we present BioGEEM (BioGeographical Eco-Evolutionary Model), a spatially-explicit, process-based model that integrates all processes hypothesized to be relevant for biodiversity dynamics and that can be used to evaluate their relative roles.\\n\\nLocationHypothetical oceanic islands\\n\\nMethodsThe model is stochastic, grid-based, and integrates ecological (metabolic constraints, demography, dispersal, and competition), evolutionary (mutation and speciation), and environmental (geo-climatic dynamics) processes. Plants on oceanic islands served as model system. We used the full model to test hypotheses about emergent patterns at different spatio-temporal scales and organizational levels (populations, species, communities, and assemblages), switching off processes to assess the importance 1) of competition for realistic population and range dynamics; 2) metabolic constraints for endemism and community composition; 3) environmental dynamics and 4) speciation for biogeographical patterns.\\n\\nResultsThe full model generated multiple patterns matching empirical and theoretical expectations. For example, populations were largest on young, species-poor islands. Species, particularly endemics, were better able to fill their potential range on small, species-poor islands. Richness gradients peaked at mid-elevations. The proportion of endemics was highest on old, large, and isolated environments within the islands. Species and trait richness showed unimodal temporal trends. Switching off selected processes affected these patterns, and we found most of our hypotheses supported.\\n\\nMain conclusionsIntegrating ecological, evolutionary, and environmental processes is essential to simultaneously generate realistic spatio-temporal dynamics at population, species, community, and assemblage level. Finally, large-scale biodiversity dynamics emerged directly from biological processes which make this mechanistic model a valuable  virtual long-term field station to study the linkages between biogeography and ecology.",

    "abstract": "The adult mammalian kidney has a complex, highly-branched collecting duct epithelium that arises as a ureteric bud sidebranch from an epithelial tube known as the nephric duct. Subsequent branching of the ureteric bud to form the collecting duct tree is regulated by subcellular interactions between the epithelium and a population of mesenchymal cells that surround the tips of outgrowing branches. The mesenchymal cells produce glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), that binds with RET receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells to stimulate several subcellular pathways in the epithelium. Such interactions are known to be a prerequisite for normal branching development, although competing theories exist for their role in morphogenesis. Here we introduce the first agent-based model of ex vivo kidney uretic branching. Through comparison with experimental data, we show that growth factor-regulated growth mechanisms can explain early epithelial cell branching, but only if epithelial cell division depends in a switch-like way on the local growth factor concentration; cell division occurring only if the driving growth factor level exceeds a threshold. We also show how a recently-developed method, \\\"Approximate Approximate Bayesian Computation\\\", can be used to infer key model parameters, and reveal the dependency between the parameters controlling a growth factor-dependent growth switch. These results are consistent with a requirement for signals controlling proliferation and chemotaxis, both of which are previously identified roles for GDNF.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA number of important congenital disorders arise due to incomplete development of the mammalian kidney. Elucidating the cause of these conditions requires an understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to kidney morphogenesis. Whilst experimental work has suggested several candidate mechanisms, their importance is still not well understood. Here we develop a computational model of kidney morphogenesis at the individual cell level to compare these different hypotheses. Guided by existing experimental evidence we propose that a generic growth factor, that we term \\\"GDNF\\\", produced from the mesenchyme surrounding the epithelium, can drive a number of cellular responses. Simulations of our agent-based model reveal that diffusion of GDNF, coupled with GDNF-stimulated epithelial cell division, can generate the branching patterns seen in ex vivo kidney explant experiments. We also find that branching depends on the sensitivity of cell proliferation to changes in GDNF levels. In particular our model only generates realistic branching when there is significant variation in GDNF levels along the boundary of the epithelium, and most cells divide only if the local concentration of GDNF exceeds a threshold value. We conclude that feedback between mesenchymal cells that produce GDNF, and epithelial cells that consume it, is vital for normal kidney organogenesis.",
