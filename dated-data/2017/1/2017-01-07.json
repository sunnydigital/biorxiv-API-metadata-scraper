    "abstract": "Gompertz empirical law of mortality is often used in practical research to parametrize survival fraction as a function of age with the help of just two quantities: the Initial Mortality Rate (IMR) and the Gompertz exponent, inversely proportional to the Mortality Rate Doubling Time (MRDT). The IMR is often found to be inversely related to the Gompertz exponent, which is the dependence commonly referred to as Strehler-Mildvan (SM) correlation. In this paper, we address fundamental uncertainties of the Gompertz parameters inference from experimental Kaplan-Meier plots and show, that a least squares fit often leads to an ill-defined non-linear optimization problem, which is extremely sensitive to sampling errors and the smallest systematic demographic variations. Therefore, an analysis of consequent repeats of the same experiments in the same biological conditions yields the whole degenerate manifold of possible Gompertz parameters. We find that whenever the average lifespan of species greatly exceeds MRDT, small random variations in the survival records produce large deviations in the identified Gompertz parameters along the line, corresponding to the set of all possible IMR and MRDT values, roughly compatible with the properly determined value of average lifespan in experiment. The best fit parameters in this case turn out to be related by a form of SM correlation. Therefore, we have to conclude that the combined property, such as the average lifespan in the group, rather than IMR and MRDT values separately, may often only be reliably determined via experiments, even in a perfectly homogeneous animal cohort due to its finite size and/or low age-sampling frequency, typical for modern high-throughput settings. We support our findings with careful analysis of experimental survival records obtained in cohorts of C. elegans of different sizes, in control groups and under the influence of experimental therapies or environmental conditions. We argue that since, SM correlation may show up as a consequence of the fitting degeneracy, its appearance is not limited to homogeneous cohorts. In fact, the problem persists even beyond the simple Gompertz mortality law. We show that the same degeneracy occurs exactly in the same way, if a more advanced Gompertz-Makeham aging model is employed to improve the modeling. We explain how SM type of relation between the demographic parameters may still be observed even in extremely large cohorts with immense statistical power, such as in human census datasets, provided that systematic historical changes are weak in nature and lead to a gradual change in the mean lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic differentiation and programmed cell death are common developmental processes in microbes, driving diverse altruistic behaviors that promote cooperation. Utilizing cell death in developmental programs requires control over the rate of differentiation to balance cell proliferation against the utility of sacrifice. However, the regulatory networks that control these behaviors are often complex and have yet to be successfully harnessed as biotechnology. Here, we engineered a synthetic developmental gene network that couples stochastic differentiation with programmed cell death to implement a two-member division of labor. Progenitor cellobiose consumer cells were engineered to grow on cellobiose and differentiate at a controlled rate into self-destructive altruists that release an otherwise sequestered cellulase enzyme payload through autolysis to form a developmental Escherichia coli consortium that utilizes cellulose for growth. We used an experimentally parameterized model of task switching, payload delivery and cellulose conversion to nutrients to set key parameters to achieve overall population growth supported by cellulase release, liberating 14-23% of the available carbon. An inevitable consequence of engineering altruistic developmental behaviors is the emergence of cheaters that undermine cooperation. We observed cheater phenotypes for consumers and altruists, identified mutational hotspots and constructed a predictive model of circuit longeivity based on mutation rate estimates for each mode of evolutionary escape. This work introduces the altruistic developmental program as a new tool for synthetic biology, demonstrates the utility of population dynamics models to engineer complex phenotypes and provides a testbed for probing the evolutionary biology of self-destructive altruism.",

    "abstract": "Combining fluorescence microscopy with electron cryo-tomography allows, in principle, spatial localization of tagged macromolecular assemblies and structural features within the cellular environment. To allow precise localization and scale integration between the two disparate imaging modalities, accurate alignment procedures are needed. Here, we describe a marker-free method for aligning images from light or cryo-light fluorescence microscopy and from electron cryo-microscopy that takes advantage of sample support features, namely the holes in the carbon film. We find that the accuracy of this method, as judged by prediction errors of the hole center coordinates, is better than 100 nm.",

    "abstract": "1The motion energy model is the standard account of motion detection in animals from beetles to humans. Despite this common basis, we show here that a difference in the early stages of visual processing between mammals and insects leads this model to make radically different behavioural predictions. In insects, early filtering is spatially lowpass, which makes the surprising prediction that motion detection can be impaired by \\\"invisible\\\" noise, i.e. noise at a spatial frequency that elicits no response when presented on its own as a signal. We confirm this prediction using the optomotor response of praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola. This does not occur in mammals, where spatially bandpass early filtering means that linear systems techniques, such as deriving channel sensitivity from masking functions, remain approximately valid. Counter-intuitive effects such as masking by invisible noise may occur in neural circuits wherever a nonlinearity is followed by a difference operation.",
