    "abstract": "AbstractPedicle screw loosening has been implicated in recurrent back pain after lumbar spinal fusion, but the degree of loosening has not been systematically quantified in patients. Instrumentation removal is an option for patients with successful arthrodesis, but remains controversial. Here, we quantified pedicle screw loosening by measuring screw insertion and/or removal torque at high statistical power ({beta} = 0.98) in N = 108 patients who experienced pain recurrence despite successful fusion after posterior instrumented lumbar fusion with anterior lumbar interbody fusion (L2-S1). Between implantation and removal, pedicle screw torque was reduced by 58%, indicating significant loosening over time. Loosening was greater in screws with evoked EMG threshold under 11 mA, indicative of screw misplacement. A theoretical stress analysis revealed increased local stresses at the screw interface in pedicles with decreased difference in pedicle thickness and screw diameter. Loosening was greatest in vertebrae at the extremities of the fused segments, but was significantly lower in segments with one level of fusion than in those with two or more.\\n\\nClinical significanceThese data indicate that pedicle screws can loosen significantly in patients with recurrent back pain and warrant further research into methods to reduce the incidence of screw loosening and to understand the risks and potential benefits of instrumentation removal.",

    "abstract": "We review here recent progress to link the nuclear organization to its function, based on elementary physical processes such as diffusion, polymer dynamics of DNA, chromatin and the search mechanism for a small target by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) break. These physical models and their analysis make it possible to compute critical rates involved in cell reorganization timing, which depends on many parameters. In the framework of polymer models, various empirical observations are interpreted as anomalous diffusion of chromatin at various time scales. The reviewed theoretical approaches offer a framework for extracting features, biophysical parameters, predictions, and so on, based on a large variety of experimental data, such as chromosomal capture data, single particle trajectories, and more. Combining theoretical approaches with live cell microscopy data should unveil some of the still unexplained behavior of the nucleus in carrying out some of its key function involved in survival, DNA repair or gene activation.",

    "abstract": "Modern digital pathology departments have grown to produce whole-slide image data at petabyte scale, an unprecedented treasure chest for medical machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, most digital slides are not annotated at the image level, hindering large-scale application of supervised learning. Manual labeling is prohibitive, requiring pathologists with decades of training and outstanding clinical service responsibilities. This problem is further aggravated by the United States Food and Drug Administrations ruling that primary diagnosis must come from a glass slide rather than a digital image. We present the first end-to-end framework to overcome this problem, gathering annotations in a nonintrusive manner during a pathologists routine clinical work: (i) microscope-specific 3D-printed commodity camera mounts are used to video record the glass-slide-based clinical diagnosis process; (ii) after routine scanning of the whole slide, the video frames are registered to the digital slide; (iii) motion and observation time are estimated to generate a spatial and temporal saliency map of the whole slide. Demonstrating the utility of these annotations, we train a convolutional neural network that detects diagnosis-relevant salient regions, then report accuracy of 85.15% in bladder and 91.40% in prostate, with 75.00% accuracy when training on prostate but predicting in bladder, despite different pathologists examining the different tissues. When training on one patient but testing on another, AUROC in bladder is 0.7929 0.1109 and in prostate is 0.9568{+/-}0.0374. Our tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/aschaumberg/deepscope.",

    "abstract": "Bradyzoite differentiation is marked by major changes in gene expression resulting in a parasite that expresses a new repertoire of surface antigens hidden inside a modified parasitophorous vacuole called the tissue cyst. The factors that control this important life cycle transition are not well understood. Here we describe an important Toxoplasma transcriptional repressor mechanism controlling bradyzoite differentiation that operates exclusively in the tachyzoite stage. The ApiAP2 factor, AP2IV-4, is a nuclear factor dynamically expressed in late S phase through mitosis/cytokinesis of the tachyzoite cell cycle. Remarkably, deletion of the AP2IV-4 locus resulted in the increased expression of bradyzoite mRNAs in replicating tachyzoites, and in two different genetic lineages we confirmed the misexpression of tissue cyst wall components (e.g. BPK1, MCP4, CST1) and the bradyzoite surface antigen SRS9 in the tachyzoite stage. In the murine animal model, the loss of AP2IV-4 had profound biological consequences. Type II prugniaud strain parasites lacking AP2IV-4 were unable to form tissue cysts in brain tissue and the absence of this factor also recruited a potent immune response characterized by increases inflammatory monocytes, IFN-{gamma} and higher numbers of both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells. Altogether, these results indicate that suppression of bradyzoite antigens by AP2IV-4 during acute infection is required for Toxoplasma to establish a chronic infection in the immune-competent host.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Toxoplasma biology that underlies the establishment of a chronic infection is developmental conversion of the acute tachyzoite stage into the latent bradyzoite-tissue cyst stage. Despite the important clinical consequences of this developmental pathway, the molecular basis of the switch mechanisms that control formation of the tissue cyst is still poorly understood. A fundamental feature of tissue cyst formation is the expression of bradyzoite-specific genes. Here we show the transcription factor AP2IV-4 directly silences bradyzoite mRNA and protein expression in the acute tachyzoite stage demonstrating that developmental control of tissue cyst formation is as much about when not to express bradyzoite genes as it is about when to activate them. Loosing the suppression of bradyzoite gene expression in the acute tachyzoite stage caused by deleting AP2IV-4 blocked the establishment of chronic disease in healthy animals through the pre-arming of the immune system suggesting a possible strategy for preventing chronic Toxoplasma infections.",

Communication at chemical synapses occurs via neurotransmitter release whereas electrical synapses utilize gap junctions for direct ionic and metabolic coupling. Electrical synapses are often viewed as symmetrical structures, with the same components making both sides of the gap junction. By contrast, we show that a broad set of electrical synapses in zebrafish, Danio rerio, require two gap-junction-forming Connexins for formation and function. We find that one Connexin functions presynaptically while the other functions postsynaptically in forming the channels. We also show that these synapses are required for the speed and coordination of escape responses. Our data identify a genetic basis for molecular asymmetry at vertebrate electrical synapses and show they are required for appropriate behavioral performance.",

    "abstract": "Damage by parasites is a perpetual challenge for hosts, often leading to the evolution of elaborate mechanisms of avoidance, immunity, or tolerance. Host resistance can evolve via changes in immune protein coding and/or expression. Heritable population differences in gene expression following infection can reveal mechanisms of immune evolution. We compared gene expression in infected and uninfected threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from two natural populations that differ in their resistance to a native cestode parasite, Schistocephalus solidus. Genes in both the innate and adaptive immune system were differentially expressed as a function of host population, infection status, and their interaction. These genes were enriched for loci controlling immune functions that we independently verified differ between host populations, or in response to infection. For instance, populations differ strongly in reactive oxygen (ROS) production, and we observed corresponding differences in expression of ROS-affecting loci. Differentially expressed genes also were involved in fibroblast activation, B-cell activation, and leukocyte trafficking. Coexpression network analysis identified two distinct immune processes contributing to stickleback resistance; several modules of genes are correlated with parasite survival while a different set of modules are correlated with suppression of cestode growth. Comparison of networks between populations showed resistant fish have a dynamic expression profile while susceptible fish are static. In summary, recent evolutionary divergence between two vertebrate populations has generated population-specific gene expression responses to parasite infection, which reveal a few immune modules likely to separately affect cestode establishment, and growth.",

    "abstract": "Achieving a mechanistic explanation of brain function requires understanding causal relationships among regions. A relatively new technique to assess effective connectivity in fMRI data is Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). As DCM is more frequently used, it becomes increasingly important to further validate the technique and understand its limitations. With DCM, Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) is used to select the most likely causal model. We conducted simulations to test the degree to which BMS is robust to two types of challenges when applied to DCMs, those inherent to data (Category 1) and those inherent to model space (Category 2). Category 1 challenges tested properties of the data (low signal-to-noise, different response magnitudes and shapes across regions) that could either blur the distinction between models or potentially bias model selection. These challenges are impossible or difficult to measure and control in real data, so investigating their effect upon BMS through simulation is critical. Category 2 challenges tested properties of model space that create subsets of confusable models. Our results suggest that given data that conform to the prior assumptions of DCM, BMS is robust to challenges from Category 1. However, in the face of Category 2 challenges (when a more homogenous model space was tested) the false positive rate rose above an acceptable level. We show that such errors are neither trivial nor easily avoided with existing approaches. However, we argue that it is possible to detect Category 2 challenges, and avoid inappropriate interpretations by conducting simulations prior to applying DCM.\\n\\nAcronyms",

    "abstract": "1An animal embryo begins its life as a ball of epithelial cells. In the course of development, invariably, this cellular ball will undergo a process of gastrulation to form a multilayered structure with the different germ layers designated to form organs with different shapes and functions. In the fruit fly Drosophia melanogaster, gastrulation begins with the constriction of mesodermal cells that make up a rectangular domain in the ventral part of the embryo. A remarkable aspect of this morphogenetic event is its anisotropy - the mesoderm constricts much more along one axis than along the other. In this paper we propose an explanation of this observed anisotropy. Specifically, we show that tissue contraction must be anisotropic, provided that the tissue is elastic and that the contractile domain is elongated (e.g. rectangular as opposed to square). This conclusion is generic in the sense that it does not depend on the specific values of model parameters. Since our recent study demonstrated that embryonic tissue is elastic on a developmentally relevant time-scale, it appears likely that the anisotropy of mesoderm contraction is an elastic effect. Our model makes a number of specific predictions that appear in close agreement with the available data.",

    "abstract": "Confidence is the  feeling of knowing that accompanies decision making and guides processes such as learning, error detection, and inter-personal communication. Bayesian theory proposes that confidence is a function of the probability that a decision is correct given the evidence. Empirical research has shown, however, that humans tend to report confidence in very different ways. This idiosyncratic behaviour suggests that different individuals may perform different computations to estimate confidence from uncertain evidence. We tested this hypothesis by collecting confidence reports from healthy adults making decisions under either visual or numerical uncertainty. We found that for most individuals, confidence did indeed reflect the perceived probability of being correct. However, in approximately half of them, confidence also reflected a different probabilistic quantity: the observed Fisher information. We isolated the influence of each of these two quantities on confidence, and found that this decomposition is stable across weeks, and consistent across tasks involving uncertainty in both perceptual and cognitive domains. Our findings provide, for the first time, a mechanistic interpretation of individual differences in the human sense of confidence.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, recombination, synapsis, chromosome segregation and gene expression are coordinately regulated to ensure successful execution of this specialised cell division. In many model organisms, checkpoint controls can delay meiotic progression to allow defects or errors in these processes to be repaired or corrected. Mouse spermatocytes possess quality control checkpoints that eliminate cells with persistent irreparable defects in chromosome synapsis or recombination, and here we show that a spermatocyte checkpoint regulates progression through pachytene to accommodate delays in meiotic recombination. We have previously show that the appearance of early recombination foci is delayed in Tex19.1-/- spermatocytes during leptotene/zygotene, but some Tex19.1-/- spermatocytes still successfully synapse their chromosomes. Therefore, we have used autosomally synapsed Tex19.1-/- mouse spermatocytes to assess the consequences of delayed recombination on progression through pachytene. We show that these pachytene spermatocytes are enriched for early recombination foci. This skew is not accompanied by cell death and likely reflects delays in the generation and/or maturation of recombination foci. Moreover, patterns of axis elongation, chromatin modifications, and histone H1t expression are also all skewed towards earlier substages of pachytene suggesting these events are co-ordinately regulated. Importantly, the delay in histone H1t expression in response to loss of Tex19.1 does not occur in a Spo11 mutant background, suggesting that histone H1t expression is being delayed by a recombination-dependent checkpoint. These data indicate that a recombination-dependent checkpoint operates in mouse spermatocytes that can alter progression through pachytene to accommodate spermatocytes with some types of recombination defect.",

Depletion of the Drosophila orthologue causes spindle pole unfocusing during mitosis in multiple cell types. However, it remains unknown whether human ASPM has a similar function. Here, using CRISPR-based gene knockout (KO) and RNA interference combined with auxin-inducible degron, we show that ASPM functions in spindle pole organisation during mitotic metaphase redundantly with another microcephaly protein CDK5RAP2 (also called CEP215) in human tissue culture cells. Deletion of the ASPM gene alone did not affect spindle morphology or mitotic progression. However, when the pericentriolar material protein CDK5RAP2 was depleted in ASPM KO cells, spindle poles were unfocused during prometaphase and anaphase onset was significantly delayed. The phenotypic analysis of CDK5RAP2-depleted cells suggested that the pole-focusing function of CDK5RAP2 is independent of its known function to localise the kinesin-14 motor HSET or activate the{gamma} -tubulin complex. Finally, a hypomorphic mutation identified in ASPM microcephaly patients similarly caused spindle pole unfocusing in the absence of CDK5RAP2, suggesting a possible link between spindle pole disorganisation and microcephaly.",

    "abstract": "Cellular aging plays an important role in many diseases, such as cancers, metabolic syndromes and neurodegenerative disorders. There has been steady progress in identifying aging-related factors such as reactive oxygen species and genomic instability, yet an emerging challenge is to reconcile the contributions of these factors with the fact that genetically identical cells can age at significantly different rates. Such complexity requires single-cell analyses designed to unravel the interplay of aging dynamics and cell-to-cell variability. Here we use novel microfluidic technologies to track the replicative aging of single yeast cells and reveal that the temporal patterns of heterochromatin silencing loss regulate cellular lifespan. We found that cells show sporadic waves of silencing loss in the heterochromatic ribosomal DNA (rDNA) during the early phases of aging, followed by sustained loss of silencing preceding cell death. Isogenic cells have different lengths of the early intermittent silencing phase that largely determine their final lifespans. Combining computational modeling and experimental approaches, we found that the intermittent silencing dynamics is important for longevity and is dependent on the conserved Sir2 deacetylase, whereas either sustained silencing or sustained loss of silencing shortens lifespan. These findings reveal, for the first time, that the temporal patterns of a key molecular process can directly influence cellular aging and thus could provide guidance for the design of temporally controlled strategies to extend lifespan.\\n\\nSignificanceAging is an inevitable consequence of living, and with it comes increased morbidity and mortality. Novel approaches to mitigating age-related chronic diseases demand a better understanding of the biology of aging. Studies in model organisms have identified many conserved molecular factors that influence aging. The emerging challenge is to understand how these factors interact and change dynamically to drive aging. Using multidisciplinary technologies, we have revealed a sirtuin-dependent intermittent pattern of chromatin silencing during yeast aging that is crucial for longevity. Our findings highlight the important role of silencing dynamics in aging, which deserves careful consideration when designing schemes to delay or reverse aging by modulating sirtuins and silencing.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is one of the most common types of RNA editing, a posttranscriptional modification made by special enzymes. We present a proteomic study on this phenomenon for Drosophila melanogaster. Three proteome data sets were used in the study: two taken from public repository and the third one obtained here. A customized protein sequence database was generated using results of genome-wide adenosine-to-inosine RNA studies and applied for identifying the edited proteins. The total number of 68 edited peptides belonging to 59 proteins was identified in all data sets. Eight of them being shared between the whole insect, head and brain proteomes. Seven edited sites belonging to synaptic vesicle and membrane trafficking proteins were selected for validation by orthogonal analysis by Multiple Reaction Monitoring. Five editing events in cpx, Syx1A, Cadps, CG4587 and EndoA were validated in fruit fly brain tissue at the proteome level using isotopically labeled standards. Ratios of unedited-to-edited proteoforms varied from 35:1 (Syx1A) to 1:2 (EndoA). Lys-137 to Glu editing of endophilin A may have functional consequences for its interaction to membrane. The work demonstrates the feasibility to identify the RNA editing event at the proteome level using shotgun proteomics and customized edited protein database.",

    "abstract": "Finding new genetic causes of monogenic diabetes can help to understand development and function of the human pancreas. We aimed to find novel protein-truncating variants causing Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), a subtype of monogenic diabetes. We used a combination of next-generation sequencing of MODY cases with unknown aetiology along with comparisons to the ExAC database to identify new MODY genes. In the discovery cohort of 36 European patients, we identified two probands with novel RFX6 heterozygous nonsense variants. RFX6 protein truncating variants were enriched in the MODY discovery cohort compared to the European control population within ExAC (odds ratio, OR=131, P=lxl0-4). We found similar results in non-Finnish European (n=348, OR=43, P=5xl0-5) and Finnish (n=80, OR=22, P=1xl0-6) replication cohorts. The overall meta-analysis OR was 34 (P=lxl0-16). RFX6 heterozygotes had reduced penetrance of diabetes compared to common HNF1A and HNF4A-MODY mutations (27%, 70% and 55% at 25 years of age, respectively). The hyperglycaemia resulted from beta-cell dysfunction and was associated with lower fasting and stimulated gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) levels. Our study demonstrates that heterozygous RFX6 protein truncating variants are associated with MODY with reduced penetrance.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis in cells has been thoroughly investigated and characterized over the past 60 years. However, some fundamental issues remain unresolved, including the reasons for genetic code redundancy and codon bias. In this study, we changed the kinetics of the E. coli transcription and translation processes by mutating the promoter and ribosome binding domains and by using genetic code expansion. The results expose a counterintuitive phenomenon, whereby an increase in the initiation rates of transcription and translation lead to a decrease in protein expression. This effect can be rescued by introducing slow translating codons into the beginning of the gene, by shortening gene length or by reducing initiation rates. Based on the results, we developed a biophysical model, which suggests that the density of co-transcriptional translation plays a role in bacterial protein synthesis. These findings indicate how cells use codon bias to tune translation speed and protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Nerve tissue contains a high density of chemical synapses, about 1 per {micro}m3 in the mammalian cerebral cortex. Thus, even for small blocks of nerve tissue, dense connectomic mapping requires the identification of millions to billions of synapses, of which about 80-90% are excitatory synapses. While the focus of connectomic data analysis has been on neurite reconstruction, synapse detection becomes limiting when datasets grow in size and dense mapping is required. Here, we report SynEM, a method for automated detection of excitatory synapses from conventionally en-bloc stained 3D electron microscopy image stacks. The approach is based on a segmentation of the image data and focuses on classifying borders between neuronal processes as synaptic or non-synaptic. SynEM yields 98% precision and recall in binary excitatory cortical connectomes with no user interaction. It scales to large volumes of cortical neuropil, plausibly even whole-brain datasets. SynEM removes the burden of manual synapse annotation for large densely mapped connectomes.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis relies on the SPO11 endonuclease to generate the recombinogenic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) required for homologous chromosome synapsis and segregation. The number of meiotic DSBs needs to be sufficient to allow chromosomes to search for and find their homologs, but not excessive to the point of causing genome instability. Here we report that meiotic DSB frequency in mouse spermatocytes is regulated by the mammal-specific gene Tex19.1. We show that the chromosome asynapsis previously reported in Tex19.1-/- spermatocytes is preceded by reduced numbers of recombination foci in leptotene and zygotene. Tex19.1 is required for the generation of normal levels of Spo11-dependent DNA damage during leptotene, but not for upstream events such as MEI4 foci formation or accumulation of H3K4me3 at recombination hotspots. Furthermore, we show that mice carrying mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2, a TEX19.1-interacting partner, phenocopy the Tex19.1-/- recombination defects. These data show that Tex19.1 and Ubr2 are required for mouse spermatocytes to generate sufficient meiotic DSBs to ensure that homology search is consistently successful, and reveal a hitherto unknown genetic pathway regulating meiotic DSB frequency in mammals.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis is a specialised type of cell division that occurs during sperm and egg development to reduce chromosome number prior to fertilisation. Recombination is a key step in meiosis as it facilitates the pairing of homologous chromosomes prior to their reductional division, and generates new combinations of genetic alleles for transmission in the next generation. Regulating the amount of recombination is key for successful meiosis: too much will likely cause mutations, chromosomal re-arrangements and genetic instability, whereas too little causes defects in homologous chromosome pairing prior to the meiotic divisions. This study identifies a genetic pathway requiredto generate robust meiotic recombination in mouse spermatocytes. We show that male mice with mutations in Tex19.1 or Ubr2, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with TEX19.1, have defects in generating normal levels of meiotic recombination. We show that the defects in these mutants impact on the recombination process at the stage when programmed DNA double strand breaks are being made. This defect likely contributes to the chromosome synapsis and meiotic progression phenotypes previously described in these mutant mice. This study has implications for our understanding of how this fundamental aspect of genetics and inheritance is controlled.",
