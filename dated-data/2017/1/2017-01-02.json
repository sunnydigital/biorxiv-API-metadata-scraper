    "abstract": "One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across all animal groups and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome usage and composition, taking into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, essentially all animals have comparable amounts of introns and intergenic sequence, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more dependent on genome size than previously thought.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryWithin our anthropocentric genomic framework, many analyses tends to try to define humans, mammals, or vertebrates relative to the so-called \\\"lower\\\" animals. This implicitly posits that vertebrates are complex organisms with large genomes and invertebrates are simple organisms with small genomes. This has the problem that genome size is therefore presumed to correlate with complexity and ignores any unknown complexity of vast numbers of invertebrate groups, many with large genomes. Animals vary widely in genome size, by almost three orders of magnitude, but when sequencing new animal genomes preference is given to those with smaller genomes for reasons of cost. In trying to understand how genomes are used in general, there is an added layer of complication from quality of the assembly and annotation. We have examined genome usage across a wide range of animals and have described ways to account for errors of low-quality annotations. We also show that the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates are not so different, and that when large-genome invertebrates are added, genome size alone appears to be defining the fraction of the genome that is genes.",

Here we show that most of the reactions in the core of central carbon metabolism are part of compact autocatalytic cycles. Such metabolic designs must meet specific conditions to support stable fluxes, hence avoiding depletion of intermediate metabolites. As such, they are subjected to constraints that may seem counter-intuitive: the enzymes of branch reactions out of the cycle must be overexpressed and the affinity of these enzymes to their substrates must be relatively weak. We use recent quantitative proteomics and fluxomics measurements to show that the above conditions hold for functioning cycles in central carbon metabolism of E.coli. This work demonstrates that the topology of a metabolic network can shape kinetic parameters of enzymes and lead to seemingly wasteful enzyme usage.",

    "abstract": "The ability to replace genes coding for cellular proteins with DNA that codes for fluorescent protein-tagged versions opens the way to counting the number of molecules of each protein component of macromolecular assemblies in vivo by measuring fluorescence microscopically. Converting fluorescence to absolute numbers of molecules requires a fluorescent standard whose molecular composition is known precisely. In this report the construction, properties, and mode of using a set of fluorescence calibration standards are described. The standards are based on an icosahedral virus engineered to contain exactly 240 copies of one of seven different fluorescent proteins. Two applications of the fluorescent standards to counting molecules in the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii are described. Methods for improving the preciseness of the measurements and minimizing potential inaccuracies are emphasized.\\n\\nLay AbstractA broad goal of modern biology is to understand how the machines within living cells work. It is nowadays routine to identify the individual protein components of a machine, but not yet straightforward to tell how many copies of each component are needed to build a functional assembly. In many types of cells it is now possible to substitute for the native proteins within cells altered versions that are fluorescent. If one knew how much fluorescence is generated by a single molecule of the altered protein, then one could use a light microscope to count the number of copies of the protein in a cellular machine by simply measuring the total fluorescence coming from that part of the cell. This paper describes the construction and methods for using a set of fluorescent virus particles that can be used to determine how much fluorescence is contributed by one molecule of fluorescent protein. The virus particles were chosen for this role because the particular icosahedral symmetry of their structure guarantees that each particle contains exactly 240 copies of one fluorescent protein.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration requires the precise integration of cues that initiate proliferation, direct differentiation, and ultimately re-pattern tissues to the proper size and scale. Yet how these processes are integrated with wounding cues remains relatively unknown. The freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, is an ideal model to study the stereotyped proliferative and transcriptional responses to injury due to its high capacity for regeneration. Here, we characterize the effector of the Hippo signalling cascade, yorkie, during planarian regeneration and its role in restricting early injury responses. In yki(RNAi) regenerating animals, wound responses are hyper-activated; the bimodal proliferation kinetics are heighted and prolonged, while the transcriptional injury responses are similarly augmented with dysregulated temporal patterns. We also uncovered novel wound-induced genes by RNAseq that are primarily associated with tissue patterning. Indeed, a high proportion of non-wound- and wound-induced patterning molecules are mis-expressed in yki(RNAi), which we demonstrate is in part due to an expanded muscle cell population. These altered injury responses have consequential effects on regenerative outcomes, specifically sensing the size of a given injury and appropriately scaling organ and tissue sizes. Taken together, our results suggest that yki functions as a key node to integrate the injury responses of proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning to coordinate regeneration.",

In the face of rapidly increasing volumes of data, heuristic methods that trade software speed for accuracy may be employed. We are have studied these trade-offs using the results of a large number of independent software benchmarks, and evaluated whether external factors are indicative of accurate software.\n\nMethodWe have extracted accuracy and speed ranks from independent benchmarks of different bioinformatic software tools, and evaluated whether the speed, author reputation, journal impact, recency and developer efforts are indicative of accuracy.\n\nResultsWe found that software speed, author reputation, journal impact, number of citations and age are all unreliable predictors of software accuracy. This is unfortunate because citations, author and journal reputation are frequently cited reasons for selecting software tools. However, GitHub-derived records and high version numbers show that the accurate bioinformatic software tools are generally the product of many improvements over time, often from multiple developers.\n\nDiscussionWe also find that the field of bioinformatics has a large excess of slow and inaccurate software tools, and this is consistent across many sub-disciplines. Meanwhile, there are few tools that are middle-of-road in terms of accuracy and speed trade-offs. We hypothesise that a form of publication-bias influences the publication and development of bioinformatic software. In other words, software that is intermediate in terms of both speed and accuracy may be difficult to publish - possibly due to author, editor and reviewer practices. This leaves an unfortunate hole in the literature as the ideal tools may fall into this gap. For example, high accuracy tools are not always useful if years of CPU time are required, while high speed is not useful if the results are also inaccurate.",

    "abstract": "Social ties are crucial for humans. Disruption of ties through social exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however, such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others (i.e., mentalizing). Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides novel insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges, and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics.",

The mechanism by which roots perceive the spatial distribution of water to position lateral branches is unknown. Here we reveal that a root's developmental competence for hydropatterning is limited to the root tip, where tissue growth occurs. Mathematical modeling suggests that water uptake during growth creates spatial biases in tissue water potential, and we show that these gradients predict the position of future lateral branches. By altering growth dynamics with exogenous chemical and environmental treatments, we demonstrate that growth is necessary to allow roots to distinguish environments with relatively high or low water availability and pattern branching accordingly. Furthermore, we show that these cues regulate a number of other physiologically important pathways. Our work supports a sense-by-growth mechanism governing lateral root hydropatterning, in which water availability cues are rendered interpretable through growth-sustained water movement.",

    "abstract": "Comparative studies of genomic differentiation among independent lineages can provide insights into aspects of the speciation process, such as the relative importance of selection and drift in shaping genomic landscapes, the role of genomic regions of high differentiation, and the prevalence of convergent molecular evolution. We investigated patterns of genetic diversity and divergence in stonechats (genus Saxicola), a widely distributed avian species complex with phenotypic variation in plumage, morphology, and migratory behavior, to ask whether similar genomic regions are important in the evolution of independent, but closely related, taxa. We used whole-genome pooled sequencing of 262 individuals from 5 taxa and found that patterns of genetic diversity and divergence are highly similar among different stonechat taxa. We then asked if these patterns remain correlated at deeper evolutionary scales and found that homologous genomic regions have become differentiated in stonechats and the closely related Ficedula flycatchers. Such correlation across a range of evolutionary divergence and among phylogenetically independent comparisons suggests that similar processes may be driving the differentiation of these independently evolving lineages, which in turn may be the result of intrinsic properties of particular genomic regions (e.g., areas of low recombination). Consequently, studies employing genome scans to search for areas important in reproductive isolation should account for corresponding regions of differentiation, as these regions may not necessarily represent speciation islands or facilitate local adaptation.",

Cancer detection and treatment may be possible based on the detection and control of microtubule mechanical oscillations in cells throughexternal fields (e.g. electromagnetic or ultrasound). However, little is known about the dynamic (high-frequency) mechanical properties of microtubules. Here we propose to control the vibrations of a doubly clamped microtubule by tip electrodes and to detect its motion via the optomechanical coupling between the vibrational modes of the microtubule and an optical cavity. In the presence of a red-detuned strong pump laser, this coupling leads to optomechanical induced transparency of an optical probe field, which can be detected with state-of-the art technology. The center frequency and linewidth of the transparency peak give the resonance frequency and damping rate of the microtubule respectively, while the height of the peak reveals information about the microtubule-cavity field coupling. Our method should yield new knowledge about the physical properties of microtubules, which will enhance our capability to design physical cancer treatment protocols as alternatives to chemotherapeutic drugs.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is in constant flux, as distinct areas engage in transient communication to support basic behaviors as well as complex cognition. The collection of interactions between cortical and subcortical areas forms a functional brain network whose topology evolves with time. Despite the nontrivial dynamics that are germaine to this networked system, experimental evidence demonstrates that functional interactions organize into putative brain systems that facilitate different facets of cognitive computation. We hypothesize that such dynamic functional networks are organized around a set of rules that constrain their spatial architecture - which brain regions may functionally interact - and their temporal architecture - how these interactions fluctuate over time. To objectively uncover these organizing principles, we apply an unsupervised machine learning approach called nonnegative matrix factorization to time-evolving, resting state functional networks in 20 healthy subjects. This machine-learning approach automatically clusters temporally co-varying functional interactions into subgraphs that represent putative topological modes of dynamic functional architecture. We find that subgraphs are stratified based on both the underlying modular organization and the topographical distance of their strongest interactions: while many subgraphs are largely contained within modules, others span between modules and are expressed differently over time. The relationship between dynamic subgraphs and modular architecture is further highlighted by the ability of time-varying subgraph expression to explain inter-individual differences in module reorganization. Collectively, these results point to the critical role subgraphs play in constraining the topography and topology of functional brain networks. More broadly, this machine learning approach opens a new door for understanding the architecture of dynamic functional networks during both task and rest states, and for probing alterations of that architecture in disease.",

    "abstract": "Tumors consist of a hierarchical population of cells that differ in their phenotype and genotype. This hierarchical organization of cells means that a few clones (i.e., cells and several generations of offspring) are abundant while most are rare, which is called clonal dominance. Such dominance also occurred in published in vitro iterated growth and passage experiments with tumor cells in which genetic barcodes were used for lineage tracing. A potential source for such heterogeneity is that dominant clones derive from cancer stem cells with an unlimited self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, ongoing evolution within the growing population may also induce clonal dominance. To understand how clonal dominance developed in the iterated growth and passage experiments, we built a computational model that accurately simulates these experiments. The model simulations reproduced the clonal dominance that developed in in vitro iterated growth and passage experiments when the division rates vary between cells, due to a combination of initial variation and of ongoing mutational processes. In contrast, the experimental results can neither be reproduced with a model that considers random growth and passage, nor with a model based on cancer stem cells. Altogether, our model suggests that in vitro clonal dominance develops due to selection of fast-dividing clones.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification holds enormous potential for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain by employing task-based fMRI data sets. There is a wide range of challenges in the MVP techniques, i.e. decreasing noise and sparsity, defining effective regions of interest (ROIs), visualizing results, and the cost of brain studies. In overcoming these challenges, this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation, which can automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then utilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional activities. Therefore, this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists to ask this question: what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected regions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually selected ROIs. Moreover, our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain image for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fMRI time series. Further, a new Gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of voxels in the level of ROIs. The proposed method enables us to combine different fMRI data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies. Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and nonsense photos) confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.",

Here, data from 71 comparative proteomics studies were analyzed using elemental ratios and chemical components as measures of oxidation and hydration state. Experimental lowering of oxygen availability (hypoxia) and water activity (hyperosmotic stress) are reflected in decreased oxidation and hydration states of proteomes, but up-expressed proteins in colorectal and pancreatic cancer most often have higher average oxidation or hydration state. Calculations of chemical affinity were used to quantify the thermodynamic potentials for transformation of proteomes as a function of fugacity of O2 and activity of H2O, which serve as scales of oxidation and hydration potential. Potential diagrams for the overall reactions between down- and up-expressed proteins in various datasets have predicted equipotential lines that cluster near unit activity of H2O, suggesting that protein expression is sensitive to local variations in water activity. A redox balance calculation indicates that an increase in the lipid to protein ratio in cancer cells by 20% over hypoxic cells would generate an electron sink of sufficient size for oxidation of the cancer proteomes. These findings demonstrate consistent, condition-dependent chemical differences between proteomes, identify primary microenvironmental constraints on proteomic transformations, and help to quantify the redox balance among cellular macromolecules.

    "abstract": "Neural network function can be shaped by varying the strength of synaptic connections. One way to achieve this is to vary connection structure. To investigate how structural variation among synaptic connections might affect neural computation, we examined primary afferent connections in the Drosophila olfactory system. We used large-scale serial section electron microscopy to reconstruct all the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons that target a left-right pair of glomeruli, as well as all the projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to these ORNs. We found three variations in ORN[-&gt;]PN connectivity. First, we found a systematic co-variation in synapse number and PN dendrite size, suggesting total synaptic conductance is tuned to postsynaptic excitability. Second, we discovered that PNs receive more synapses from ipsilateral than contralateral ORNs, providing a structural basis for odor lateralization behavior. Finally, we found evidence of imprecision in ORN[-&gt;]PN connections and show how this can diminish network performance.",

    "abstract": "Genetic correlations between traits can bias adaptation away from optimal phenotypes and constrain the rate of evolution. If genetic correlations between traits limit adaptation to contrasting environments, rapid adaptive divergence across a heterogeneous landscape may be difficult. However, if genetic variance can evolve and align with the direction of natural selection, then abundant allelic variation can promote rapid divergence during adaptive radiation. Here, we explored adaptive divergence among ecotypes of an Australian native wildflower by quantifying divergence in multivariate phenotypes of populations that occupy four contrasting environments. We investigated differences in multivariate genetic variance underlying morphological traits and examined the alignment between divergence in phenotype and divergence in genetic variance. We found that divergence in mean multivariate phenotype has occurred along two major axes represented by different combinations of plant architecture and leaf traits. Ecotypes also showed divergence in the level of genetic variance in individual traits, and the multivariate distribution of genetic variance among traits. Divergence in multivariate phenotypic mean aligned with divergence in genetic variance, with most of the divergence in phenotype among ecotypes associated with a change in trait combinations that had substantial levels of genetic variance in each ecotype. Overall, our results suggest that divergent natural selection acting on high levels of standing genetic variation might fuel ecotypic differentiation during the early stages of adaptive radiation.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor,\\n\\nLegume/cereal intercropping systems have been regarded as the practical application of basic ecological principles such as diversity, competition and facilitation. In a recent PNAS paper, Li et al. (1) describe the novel finding that maize exudates promote faba bean nodulation and nitrogen fixation by upregulating genes involved in (iso)flavonoids synthesis (chalcone-flavanone isomerase) within faba bean, resulting in production of more genistein, a legume-to-rhizobia signal during establishment of the faba bean N2-fixing symbiosis. Although we salute the authors methodological efforts, there is another mechanism that could be responsible for the effect of corn root exudates on faba been nitrogen fixation observed in this article (1). The authors may misunderstand their data and the signalling role of maize exudates, thus got a defective model for the root interactions between faba bean and maize.",

    "abstract": "gro is a cell programming language developed in Klavins Lab for simulating colony growth and cell-cell communication. It is used as a synthetic biology prototyping tool for simulating multicellular biocircuits. In this work, we present several extensions made to gro that improve the performance of the simulator, make it easier to use and provide new functionalities. The new version of gro is between one and two orders of magnitude faster than the original version. It is able to grow microbial colonies with up to 105 cells in less than 20 minutes. A new library, CellEngine, accelerates the resolution of spatial physical interactions between growing and dividing cells by implementing a new shoving algorithm. A genetic library, CellPro, based on Probabilistic Timed Automata, simulates gene expression dynamics using simplified and easy to compute digital proteins. We also propose a more convenient language specification layer, ProSpec, based on the idea that proteins drive cell behavior. CellNutrient, another library, implements Monod-based growth and nutrient uptake functionalities. The intercellular signaling management was improved and extended in a library called CellSignals. Finally, bacterial conjugation, another local cell-cell communication process, was added to the simulator. To show the versatility and potential outreach of this version of gro, we provide studies and novel examples ranging from synthetic biology to evolutionary microbiology. We believe that the upgrades implemented for gro have made it into a powerful and fast prototyping tool capable of simulating a large variety of systems and synthetic biology designs.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation in utero may result in life-long neurological disabilities. Microglia play a pivotal role, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. No early postnatal treatment strategies exist to enhance neuroprotective potential of microglia. We hypothesized that agonism on 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) in fetal microglia will augment their neuroprotective transcriptome profile, while the antagonistic stimulation of 7nAChR will achieve the opposite. Using an in vivo - in vitro model of developmental programming of neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we validated this hypothesis in primary fetal sheep microglia cultures re-exposed to LPS in presence of a selective 7nAChR agonist or antagonist. Our RNAseq and protein level findings show that a pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype acquired in vitro by LPS stimulation is reversed with 7nAChR agonistic stimulation. Conversely, antagonistic 7nAChR stimulation potentiates the pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype. Surprisingly, under conditions of LPS double-hit an interference of a postulated 7nAChR - ferroportin signaling pathway may impede this mechanism. These results suggest a therapeutic potential of 7nAChR agonists in early re-programming of microglia in neonates exposed to in utero inflammation via an endogenous cerebral cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Future studies will assess the role of interactions between inflammation-triggered microglial iron sequestering and 7nAChR signaling in neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "RNA profiling is an excellent phenotype of cellular responses and tissue states, but can be costly to generate at the massive scale required for studies of regulatory circuits, genetic states or perturbation screens. Here, we draw on a series of advances over the last decade in the field of mathematics to establish a rigorous link between biological structure, data compressibility, and efficient data acquisition. We propose that very few random composite measurements - in which gene abundances are combined in a random linear combination - are needed to approximate the high-dimensional similarity between any pair of gene abundance profiles. We then show how finding latent, sparse representations of gene expression data would enable us to \\\"decompress\\\" a small number of random composite measurements and recover high-dimensional gene expression levels that were not measured (unobserved). We present a new algorithm for finding sparse, modular structure, which improves the ability to interpret samples in terms of small numbers of active modules, and show that the modular structure we find is sufficient to recover gene expression profiles from composite measurements (with ~100-fold fewer composite measurements than genes). Moreover, the knowledge that sparse, modular structures exist allows us to recover expression profiles from composite measurements, even without access to any training data. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept experiment for making composite measurements in the laboratory, involving the measurement of linear combinations of RNA abundances. Altogether, our results suggest new compressive modalities in experimental biology that can form a foundation for massive scaling in high-throughput measurements, while also offering new insights into the interpretation of high-dimensional data.",
