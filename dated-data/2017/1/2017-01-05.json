    "abstract": "Identification of drug targets and mechanism of action (MoA) for new and uncharacterlzed drugs is important for optimization of drug efficacy. Current MoA prediction approaches largely rely on prior information including side effects, therapeutic indication and/or chemo-informatics. Such information is not transferable or applicable for newly identified, previously uncharacterlzed small molecules. Therefore, a shift in the paradigm of MoA predictions is necessary towards development of unbiased approaches that can elucidate drug relationships and efficiently classify new compounds with basic input data. We propose a new integrative computational pharmacogenomlc approach, referred to as Drug Network Fusion (DNF), to infer scalable drug taxonomies that relies only on basic drug characteristics towards elucidating drug-drug relationships. DNF is the first framework to integrate drug structural information, high-throughput drug perturbation and drug sensitivity profiles, enabling drug classification of new experimental compounds with minimal prior information. We demonstrate that the DNF taxonomy succeeds in identifying pertinent and novel drug-drug relationships, making it suitable for investigating experimental drugs with potential new targets or MoA. We highlight how the scalability of DNF facilitates identification of key drug relationships across different drug categories, and poses as a flexible tool for potential clinical applications in precision medicine. Our results support DNF as a valuable resource to the cancer research community by providing new hypotheses on the compound MoA and potential insights for drug repurposlng.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe importance of transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modifications in the control of gene expression is widely accepted. However, causal relationships between changes in TF binding, histone modifications, and gene expression during the response to extracellular stimuli are not well understood. Here, we analyzed the ordering of these events on a genome-wide scale in dendritic cells (DCs) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.\\n\\nResultsUsing a ChIP-seq time series dataset, we found that the LPS-induced accumulation of different histone modifications follow clearly distinct patterns. Increases in H3K4me3 appear to coincide with transcriptional activation. In contrast, H3K9K14ac accumulates early after stimulation, and H3K36me3 at later time points. Integrative analysis with TF binding data revealed potential links between TF activation and dynamics in histone modifications. Especially, LPS-induced increases in H3K9K14ac and H3K4me3 were associated with binding by STAT1/2, and were severely impaired in Stat1-/- cells.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile the timing of short-term changes of some histone modifications coincides with changes in transcriptional activity, this is not the case for others. In the latter case, dynamics in modifications more likely reflect strict regulation by stimulus-induced TFs, and their interactions with chromatin modifiers.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is thought to mediate mnemonic and homeostatic functions. However, the mechanism by which this brain state can implement both the \\\"selective\\\" plasticity needed to consolidate novel memory traces as well as the \\\"general\\\" plasticity necessary to maintain a well-functioning neuronal system is unclear. Recent findings show that both of these functions differentially affect neurons based on their intrinsic firing rate, a ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity. Furthermore, they are both implemented by the NREM slow oscillation, which also distinguishes neurons based on firing rate during sequential activity at the DOWN->UP transition. These findings suggest a mechanism by which spiking activity during the slow oscillation acts to maintain network statistics that promote a skewed distribution of neuronal firing rates, and \\\"perturbation\\\" of that activity by hippocampal replay acts to integrate new memory traces into the existing cortical network.",

    "abstract": "Multinucleated cells are important in many organisms but the mechanisms governing the movements of nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm are not understood. In the hyphae of the plant pathogenic fungus Ashbya gossypii, nuclei move back and forth, occasionally bypassing each other, and, preventing the formation of nuclear clusters, this is essential for genetic stability. These movements depend on cytoplasmic microtubules emanating from the nuclei, that are pulled by dynein motors anchored at the cortex. Using 3D stochastic simulations with parameters constrained by the literature, we predict the cortical anchors density from the characteristics of nuclear movements. Altogether, the model accounts for the complex nuclear movements seen in vivo, using a minimal set of experimentally determined ingredients. Interestingly, these ingredients power the oscillations of the anaphase spindle in budding yeast, but in A. gossypii this system is not restricted to a specific nuclear cycle stage, possibly as a result of adaptation to hyphal growth and multinuclearity.",

    "abstract": "The connections between neurons determine the computations performed by both artificial and biological neural networks. Recently, we have proposed SYNseq, a method for converting the connectivity of a biological network into a form that can exploit the tremendous efficiencies of high-throughput DNA sequencing. In SYNseq, each neuron is tagged with a random sequence of DNA--a \\\"barcode\\\"--and synapses are represented as barcode pairs. SYNseq addresses the analysis problem, reducing a network into a suspension of barcode pairs. Here we formulate a novel and complementary synthesis problem: How can the suspension of barcode pairs be used to \\\"clone\\\" or copy the network back into an uninitialized tabula rasa network? Although this synthesis problem might be expected to be computationally intractable, we find that, surprisingly, this problem can be solved efficiently, using only neuron-local information. We present the \\\"one barcode one cell\\\" (OBOC) algorithm, which forces all barcodes of a given sequence to coalesce into the same neuron, and show that it converges in a number of steps that is a power law of the network size. Rapid and reliable network cloning with single synapse precision is thus theoretically possible.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies of multidimensional phenotypes can potentially link genetic variation, gene expression, and physiological data to create multi-scale models of complex traits. Multi-parent populations provide a resource for developing methods to understand these relationships. In this study, we simultaneously modeled body composition, serum biomarkers, and liver transcript abundances from 474 Diversity Outbred mice. This population contained both sexes and two dietary cohorts. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we summarized transcript data into functional modules which we then used as summary phenotypes representing enriched biological processes. These module phenotypes were jointly analyzed with body composition and serum biomarkers in a combined analysis of pleiotropy and epistasis (CAPE), which inferred networks of epistatic interactions between quantitative trait loci that affect one or more traits. This network frequently mapped interactions between alleles of different ancestries, providing evidence of both genetic synergy and redundancy between haplotypes. Furthermore, a number of loci interacted with sex and diet to yield sex-specific genetic effects. We were also able to identify alleles that potentially protect individuals from the effects of a high-fat diet. Although the epistatic interactions explained small amounts of trait variance, the combination of directional interactions, allelic specificity, and high genomic resolution provided context to generate hypotheses for the roles of specific genes in complex traits. Our approach moves beyond the cataloging of single loci to infer genetic networks that map genetic etiology by simultaneously modeling all phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The expression of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) remains a major bottleneck in the characterization of this important protein class. IMP expression levels are currently unpredictable, which renders the pursuit of IMPs for structural and biophysical characterization challenging and inefficient. Experimental evidence demonstrates that changes within the nucleotide or amino-acid sequence for a given IMP can dramatically affect expression; yet these observations have not resulted in generalizable approaches to improved expression. Here, we develop a data-driven statistical predictor named IMProve, that, using only sequence information, increases the likelihood of selecting an IMP that expresses in E. coli. The IMProve model, trained on experimental data, combines a set of sequence-derived features resulting in an IMProve score, where higher values have a higher probability of success. The model is rigorously validated against a variety of independent datasets that contain a wide range of experimental outcomes from various IMP expression trials. The results demonstrate that use of the model can more than double the number of successfully expressed targets at any experimental scale. IMProve can immediately be used to identify favorable targets for characterization.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) bearing Met-tRNA[Formula] in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP scans the mRNA leader for an AUG codon in favorable \\\"Kozak\\\" context. AUG recognition provokes rearrangement from an open PIC conformation with TC bound in a state not fully engaged with the P site (\\\"POUT\\\") to a closed, arrested conformation with TC tightly bound in the \\\"PIN\\\" state. Yeast ribosomal protein Rps3/uS3 resides in the mRNA entry channel of the 40S subunit and contacts mRNA via conserved residues whose functional importance was unknown. We show that substitutions of these residues reduce bulk translation initiation and diminish initiation at near-cognate UUG start codons in yeast mutants in which UUG selection is abnormally high (Sui-), conferring the Ssu- phenotype. Two such Ssu- substitutions--R116D and R117D--also increase discrimination against an AUG codon in suboptimal Kozak context. Consistently, the Arg116 and Arg117 substitutions destabilize TC binding to 48S PICs reconstituted in vitro with mRNA harboring a UUG start codon, indicating destabilization of the closed PIN state with a UUG:anticodon mismatch. Using model mRNAs lacking contacts with either the mRNA entry or exit channels of the 40S subunit, we demonstrate that Arg116/Arg117 are crucial for stabilizing PIC:mRNA contacts at the entry channel, complementing the function of eIF3 at both entry and exit channels. The corresponding residues in bacterial uS3 promote the helicase activity of the elongating ribosome, suggesting that uS3 contacts with mRNA enhance multiple phases of translation across different domains of life.",

    "abstract": "Inter-individual variation in metabolic health and adiposity is driven by many factors. Diet composition and genetic background and the interactions between these two factors affect adiposity and related traits such as circulating cholesterol levels. In this study, we fed 850 Diversity Outbred mice, half females and half males, with either a standard chow diet or a high fat, high sucrose diet beginning at weaning and aged them to 26 weeks. We measured clinical chemistry and body composition at early and late time points during the study, and liver transcription at euthanasia. Males weighed more than females and mice on a high fat diet generally weighed more than those on chow. Many traits showed sex- or diet-specific changes as well as more complex sex by diet interactions. We mapped both the physiological and molecular traits and found that the genetic architecture of the physiological traits is complex, with many single locus associations potentially being driven by more than one polymorphism. For liver transcription, we find that local polymorphisms affect constitutive and sex-specific transcription, but that the response to diet is not affected by local polymorphisms. We identified two loci for circulating cholesterol levels. We performed mediation analysis by mapping the physiological traits, given liver transcript abundance and propose several genes that may be modifiers of the physiological traits. By including both physiological and molecular traits in our analyses, we have created deeper phenotypic profiles to identify additional significant contributors to complex metabolic outcomes such as polygenic obesity. We make the phenotype, liver transcript and genotype data publicly available as a resource for the research community.",

    "abstract": "Diverse cell types employ mechanisms to maintain size homeostasis and minimize aberrant fluctuations in cell size. It is well known that exponential cellular growth can drive unbounded intercellular variations in cell size, if the timing of cell division is size independent. Hence coupling of division timing to size is an essential feature of size control. We formulate a stochastic model, where exponential cellular growth is coupled with random cell division events, and the rate at which division events occur increases as a power function of cell size. Interestingly, in spite of nonlinearities in the stochastic dynamical model, statistical moments of the newborn cell size can be determined in closed form, providing fundamental limits to suppression of size fluctuations. In particular, formulas reveal that the magnitude of fluctuations in the newborn size is determined by the inverse of the size exponent in the division rate, and this relationship is independent of other model parameters, such as the growth rate. We further expand these results to consider randomness in the partitioning of mother cell size among daughters at the time of division. The sensitivity of newborn size fluctuations to partitioning noise is found to monotonically decrease, and approach a non-zero value, with increasing size exponent in the division rate. Finally, we discuss how our analytical results provide limits on noise control in commonly used models for cell size regulation.",

    "abstract": "Effective management of fisheries depends on the selectivity of different fishing methods, control of fishing effort, and the life history and mating system of the target species. For sex-changing species, it is unclear how the truncation of age structure or selection of specific size or age classes (by fishing for specific markets) affects population dynamics. We specifically address the consequences of plate-sized selectivity, whereby sub-mature,  plate-sized fish are preferred in the live reef food fish trade. We use an age-structured model to investigate the decline and recovery of populations fished with three different selectivity scenarios (asymptotic, dome-shaped, and plate-sized) applied to two sexual systems (female-first hermaphroditism and gonochorism). We parameterized our model with life-history data from Brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) and Napoleon fish (Cheilinus undulatus).  Plate-sized selectivity had the greatest negative effect on population trajectories, assuming accumulated fishing effort across ages was equal, while the relative effect of fishing on biomass was greatest with low natural mortality. Fishing such sex-changing species before maturation decreased egg production (and the spawning potential ratio) in two ways: average individual size decreased, and, assuming plasticity, females became males at a smaller size. Somatic growth rate affected biomass if selectivity was based on size-at-age because in slow growers, a smaller proportion of total biomass was vulnerable to fishing. We recommend fisheries avoid taking individuals near their maturation age, regardless of mating system, unless catch is tightly controlled. We also discuss the implications of fishing post-settlement individuals on population dynamics and offer practical management recommendations.",

Assembly requires the constituent tubulin dimers to bind the nucleotide GTP, and its subsequent hydrolysis to GDP induces disassembly. The underlying structural mechanisms, however, are not well understood. Here, we determine the strength of contacts in the microtubule lattice by combining high precision measurements of the bending stiffness of analogues of GTP and GDP microtubules with a recent theoretical model. While previous structural studies have focussed on how the curvature of the tubulin dimer is affected by nucleotide binding, we present evidence of a dramatic regulation of the lateral interactions between the parallel protofilaments that dimers form in the microtubule. We conclude that the shear coupling between neighboring protofilaments is at least two orders of magnitude stronger in the GTP state than in the GDP state, and discuss the implications for the microtubule assembly.",

    "abstract": "The functional divergence of duplicate genes (ohnologues) retained from whole genome duplication (WGD) is thought to promote evolutionary diversification. However, species radiation and phenotypic diversification is often highly temporally-detached from WGD. Salmonid fish, whose ancestor experienced WGD by autotetraploidization ~95 Ma (i.e.  Ss4R), fit such a  time-lag model of post-WGD radiation, which occurred alongside a major delay in the rediploidization process. Here we propose a model called  Lineage-specific Ohnologue Resolution (LORe) to address the phylogenetic and functional consequences of delayed rediploidization. Under LORe, speciation precedes rediploidization, allowing independent ohnologue divergence in sister lineages sharing an ancestral WGD event. Using cross-species sequence capture, phylogenomics and genome-wide analyses of ohnologue expression divergence, we demonstrate the major impact of LORe on salmonid evolution. One quarter of each salmonid genome, harbouring at least 4,500 ohnologues, has evolved under LORe, with rediploidization and functional divergence occurring on multiple independent occasions > 50 Myr post-WGD. We demonstrate the existence and regulatory divergence of many LORe ohnologues with functions in lineage-specific physiological adaptations that promoted salmonid species radiation. We show that LORe ohnologues are enriched for different functions than  older ohnologues that began diverging in the salmonid ancestor. LORe has unappreciated significance as a nested component of post-WGD divergence that impacts the functional properties of genes, whilst providing ohnologues available solely for lineage-specific adaptation. Under LORe, which is predicted following many WGD events, the functional outcomes of WGD need not appear  explosively, but can arise gradually over tens of Myr, promoting lineage-specific diversification regimes under prevailing ecological pressures.",

    "abstract": "Spike density and processing quality are important traits during the evolution of wheat, which is controlled by multiple gene loci. The associated gene loci have been heavily studied with slow progress. A common wheat mutant with extremely compact spikes and good processing quality was isolated. The gene (Qc1) responsible for the mutant phenotype was mapped and cloned, and the cellular mechanism for the mutant phenotype was investigated. Qc1 originated from a point mutation that interferes with the miR172-directed cleavage of the Q gene, leading to its overexpression. Qc1 reduces the longitudinal cell size of rachises, resulting in an increased spike density. Qc1 increases the number of vascular bundles, which suggests a higher efficiency in the transportation of assimilates in the spikes of the mutant than in the WT. This could account for the improved processing quality. The effects of Qc1 on spike density and wheat processing quality were confirmed by the identification of nine common wheat mutants having four different Qc alleles. These results deepen our understanding of the key role of Q gene, one of the most important domestication gene for wheat, and provide new insights for the potential application of Qc allele in wheat breeding.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRapid advances in scientific research have led to an increase in public awareness of genetic testing and pharmacogenetics. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies, such as 23andMe, allow consumers to access their genetic information directly through an online service without the involvement of healthcare professionals. Here, we evaluate the clinical relevance of such pharmacogenetic tests reported by 23andMe.\\n\\nMethodsThe research papers listed under each 23andMe report were evaluated, extracting information on effect size, sample size and ethnicity. A wider literature search was performed to provide a fuller assessment of the pharmacogenetic test and variants were matched to FDA recommendations. Additional evidence from CPIC guidelines, PharmGKB, and Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group was reviewed to determine current clinical practice. The value of the tests across ethnic groups was determined, including information on linkage disequilibrium between the tested SNP and causal pharmacogenetic variant, where relevant.\\n\\nResults23andMe offers 12 pharmacogenetic tests, some of which are in standard clinical practice, and others which are less widely applied. The clinical validity and clinical utility varies extensively between tests. The variants tested are likely to have different degrees of sensitivity due to different risk allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns across populations. The clinical relevance depends on the ethnicity of the individual and variability of pharmacogenetic markers. Further research is required to determine causal variants and provide more complete assessment of drug response and side effects.\\n\\nConclusion23andMe reports provide some useful pharmacogenetics information, mirroring clinical tests that are in standard use. Other tests are unspecific, providing limited guidance and may not be useful for patients without professional interpretation. Nevertheless, DTC companies like 23andMe act as a powerful intermediate step to integrate pharmacogenetic testing into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "A key function of the brain is to provide a stable representation of an objects location in the world. In hearing, sound azimuth and elevation are encoded by neurons throughout the auditory system and auditory cortex is necessary for sound localization. However the coordinate frame in which neurons represent sound space remains undefined: classical spatial receptive fields in head-fixed subjects can be explained either by sensitivity to sound source location relative to the head (egocentric) or relative to the world (allocentric encoding). This coordinate frame ambiguity can be resolved by studying freely moving subjects and here we recorded spatial receptive fields in auditory cortex freely moving ferrets. We found two distinct populations of neurons: While the majority ([~]80%) of spatially tuned neurons represented sound source location relative to the head, we provide novel evidence for a group of neurons in which space was represented in an allocentric world-centered coordinate frame. We also use our ability to measure spatial tuning in moving subjects to explore the influence of sound source distance and speed of head movements on auditory cortical activity and spatial tuning. Modulation depth of spatial tuning increased with distance for egocentric but not allocentric units, whereas for both populations modulation was stronger at faster movement speeds. Our findings argue that auditory cortex is involved in the representation of both sound source location relative to ourselves and sound location in the world independent of our own position.",

While scRNA-seq provides a comprehensive measurement of stochasticity in transcription, the limitations of the technology have prevented its application to dissect variability in RNA processing events such as splicing. Here we present BRIE (Bayesian Regression for Isoform Estimation), a Bayesian hierarchical model which resolves these problems by learning an informative prior distribution from sequence features. We show that BRIE yields reproducible estimates of exon inclusion ratios in single cells and provides an effective tool for differential isoform quantification between scRNA-seq data sets.

However, documenting Hmox1 expression patterns has thus far only been feasible in simple model organisms with limited relevance to humans. We now report a new Hmox1 reporter line that makes it possible to access this information in mice, the premiere model system for studying human disease and toxicology. Using a state-of-the-art strategy, we express multiple complementary reporter molecules from the murine Hmox1 locus, including firefly luciferase to allow long-term, non-invasive imaging of Hmox1 expression, and {beta}-galactosidase for high-resolution mapping of expression patterns post-mortem. We validate the model by confirming the absence of haplo-insufficiency effects, the fidelity of reporter expression, and its responsiveness to oxidative and inflammatory stimuli. In addition to providing blueprints for Hmox1 expression in mice that provide novel biological insights for follow-up, this work paves the way for the broad application of this model to regulatory toxicology studies and, also, pre-clinical investigations into human degenerative diseases.",

Despite this common basis, we show here that a difference in the early stages of visual processing between mammals and insects leads this model to make radically different behavioural predictions. In insects, early filtering is spatially lowpass, which makes the surprising prediction that motion detection can be impaired by \\\"invisible\\\" noise, i.e. noise at a spatial frequency that elicits no response when presented on its own as a signal. We confirm this prediction using the optomotor response of praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola. This does not occur in mammals, where spatially bandpass early filtering means that linear systems techniques, such as deriving channel sensitivity from masking functions, remain approximately valid. Counter-intuitive effects such as masking by invisible noise may occur in neural circuits wherever a nonlinearity is followed by a difference operation.",

Previously, we showed that upon chronic undernutrition, strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, a dominant commensal partner of Drosophila, promote host juvenile growth and maturation partly via enhanced expression of intestinal peptidases. By screening a transposon insertion library of Lactobacillus plantarum in gnotobiotic Drosophila larvae, we identify a bacterial cell wall modifying machinery encoded by the pbpX2-dltXABCD operon that is critical to enhance host digestive capabilities and promote growth and maturation. Deletion of this operon leads to bacterial cell wall alteration with a complete loss of teichoic acids D-alanylation. We thus conclude that teichoic acids modifications participate in commensal-host interactions and specifically, D-alanine esterification of teichoic acids contributes to optimal L. plantarum mediated intestinal peptidase expression and Drosophila juvenile growth upon chronic undernutrition.\\n\\nHighlights- LpNC8 mutant library screening identifies genes affecting Drosophila growth promotion.\\n- pbpX2-dlt operon is required for D-alanylation of teichoic acids and Drosophila growth.\\n- Deleting the pbpX2-dlt operon alters host intestinal peptidase expression.\\n- Peptidoglycan and pbpX2-dlt dependent signals are required for LpNC8 mediated growth promotion.\\n\\n\\neTOC blurbAnimals establish interactions with their microbial communities that shape many aspects of their physiology including juvenile growth.

In this Letter, we study a reaction-diffusion (RD) model of population growth and dispersion in one dimension, which incorporates the Allee effect in both the growth and mortality rates. In the absence of diffusion, the bifurcation diagram displays regions of both finite population density and zero population density, i.e., extinction. The early signatures of the transition to extinction at a bifurcation point are computed in the presence of additive noise. For the full RD model, the existence of travelling wave solutions of the population density is demonstrated. The parameter regimes in which the travelling wave advances (range expansion) and retreats are identified. In the weak Allee regime, the transition from the pushed to the pulled wave is shown as a function of the mortality rate constant. The results obtained are in agreement with the recent experimental observations on budding yeast populations.",

We introduce a new model for the core regulation network in mammalian cells, and conduct a formal analysis of the different network configurations that emerge in the evolutionary path to complexity. Solving the high dimensional equations associated with this model is typically challenging, and we develop a novel algorithm to overcome this problem. A key technical tool used is the representation of the distinct pathways in the core regulation networks as \\\"modules\\\", such that the behavior of the composite of two or more modules can be inferred from the characteristics of each of the individual modules. Apart from simplifying the complexity of the algorithm, this modular representation also allows us to qualitatively compare the distinct types of switching behaviors each network can exhibit. This then allows us to demonstrate how our model for the core regulation network in mammalian cells matches experimentally observed phenomena, and contrast this with the plausible behaviors admitted by the network configurations in putative primordial organisms. We show that the complexity of the p53 core regulation network in vertebrates permits a range of behaviors that can bring about distinct cell fate decisions not possible in the putative primordial organisms.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe p53 protein has been protecting organisms from tumors for a billion years. We study the link between the evolution of the p53 network structure and its corresponding tumor suppression strategies. We compare the dynamical behaviors in putative primordial organisms with simple networks with the vertebrate network that contains multiple feedback loops. We show that the vertebrate network, but not the ancestral network, can both repair moderate damage and induce apoptosis if too much damage accumulates, balancing the risk of cancer with the cost of too much cell death. Moreover, the complexity of the vertebrate network allows for adaptation, for example to increase p53 network sensitivity, which is consistent with recent research on large mammals.",

    "abstract": "Pain sensitivity is strongly modulated by time of day and by prior sleep behavior. These two factors, governed by the circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive, respectively, likewise dictate the timing and duration of sleep. The fields of sleep and circadian research have identified much of the physiology underlying the circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive with mathematical modeling playing an important role in understanding how these two processes interact to affect sleep behavior. We hypothesize that the daily rhythm of pain sensitivity and its sleep-dependent modulation reflect an interaction of the circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive. To investigate this hypothesis, we adapt the formalism of a classic mathematical model for the regulation of sleep behavior by the circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive, called the Two Process model, to simulate the interaction of these two processes on pain sensitivity. To construct the model, we utilize data from experimental reports on the daily rhythmicity of pain sensitivity in humans to define a \\\"daily pain sensitivity\\\" function. We decompose this function into two processes: a sleep-dependent process S(t) that follows the homeostatic sleep drive and a circadian process C(t) that is dictated by the circadian rhythm. By simulating different sleep schedules with the original Two Process model, we compute changes in the sleep-dependent process S(t) that modulates pain sensitivity. By combining S(t) with the circadian process C(t), our model predicts resultant changes in the daily pain sensitivity rhythm. We illustrate model predictions for changes in pain sensitivity due to sleep deprivation, sleep restriction and shift work schedules. We believe that this model may be a useful tool for pain management by providing predictions of the variations in pain sensitivity due to changing sleep schedules.",

We examined twenty low-compulsive and twenty high-compulsive participants, recruited from a large population-based sample, and matched for other psychiatric and cognitive dimensions. Hierarchical computational modelling of the participants metacognitive abilities on a visual global motion detection paradigm revealed that high-compulsive participants had a reduced metacognitive ability.

Information from different sensory modalities reaching the thalamus is segregated into specialized nuclei, whose neurons then send inputs to cognate cortical areas through topographically defined axonal connections.\\n\\nDeveloping thalamocortical axons (TCAs) normally approach the cortex by extending through the subpallium; here, axonal navigation is aided by distributed guidance cues and discrete cell populations, such as the corridor neurons and the internal capsule (IC) guidepost cells. In mice lacking Semaphorin-6A, axons from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) bypass the IC and extend aberrantly in the ventral subpallium. The functions normally mediated by Semaphorin-6A in this system remain unknown, but might depend on interactions with Plexin-A2 and Plexin-A4, which have been implicated in other neurodevelopmental processes.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed immunohistochemical and neuroanatomical analyses of thalamocortical wiring and subpallial development in Sema6a and Plxna2;Plxna4 null mutant mice and analyzed the expression of these genes in relevant structures.\\n\\nResultsIn Plxna2;Plxna4 double mutants we discovered TCA pathfinding defects that mirrored those observed in Sema6a mutants, suggesting that Semaphorin-6A-Plexin-A2/Plexin-A4 signaling might mediate dLGN axon guidance at subpallial level.\\n\\nIn order to understand where and when Semaphorin-6A, Plexin-A2 and Plexin-A4 may be required for proper subpallial TCA guidance, we then characterized their spatiotemporal expression dynamics during early TCA development. We observed that the thalamic neurons whose axons are misrouted in these mutants normally express Semaphorin-6A but not Plexin-A2 or Plexin-A4. By contrast, all three proteins are expressed in corridor cells and other structures in the developing basal ganglia.\\n\\nThis could be consistent with the Plexins acting as guidance signals through Sema6A as a receptor on dLGN axons, and/or with an indirect effect on TCA guidance due to functions in morphogenesis of subpallial intermediate targets. In support of the latter possibility, we observed that in both Plxna2;Plxna4 and Sema6a mutants some IC guidepost cells abnormally localize in correspondence of the ventral path misrouted TCAs elongate into.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings implicate Semaphorin-6A-Plexin-A2/Plexin-A4 interactions in dLGN axon guidance and in the spatiotemporal organization of guidepost cell populations in the mammalian subpallium.",

    "abstract": "The studies of nonlinear models in epidemiology have generated a deep interest in gaining insight into the mechanisms that underlie AIDS-related cancers, providing us with a better understanding of cancer immunity and viral oncogenesis. In this article, we analyse an HIV-1 model incorporating the relations between three dynamical variables: cancer cells, healthy CD4+ T lymphocytes and infected CD4+ T lymphocytes. Recent theoretical investigations indicate that these cells interactions lead to different dynamical outcomes, for instance to periodic or chaotic behavior. Firstly, we analytically prove the boundedness of the trajectories in the systems attractor. The complexity of the coupling between the dynamical variables is quantified using observability indices. Our calculations reveal that the highest observable variable is the population of cancer cells, thus indicating that these cells could be monitored in future experiments in order to obtain time series for attractors reconstruction. We identify different dynamical behaviors of the system varying two biologically meaningful parameters: r1, representing the uncontrolled proliferation rate of cancer cells, and k1, denoting the immune systems killing rate of cancer cells. The maximum Lyapunov exponent is computed to identify the chaotic regimes. Considering very recent developments in the literature related to the homotopy analysis method (HAM), we construct the explicit series solution of the cancer model and focus our analysis on the dynamical variable with the highest observability index. An optimal homotopy analysis approach is used to improve the computational efficiency of HAM by means of appropriate values for the convergence control parameter, which greatly accelerate the convergence of the series solution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA editing by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) proteins is a form of transcriptional regulation that is widespread among humans and other primates. Based on high-throughput scans used to identify putative RNA editing sites, ADAR appears to catalyze a substantial number of adenosine to inosine transitions within repetitive regions of the primate transcriptome, thereby dramatically enhancing genetic variation beyond what is encoded in the genome.\\n\\nResultsHere, we demonstrate the editing potential of the pig transcriptome by utilizing DNA and RNA sequence data from the same pig. We identified a total of 8550 mismatches between DNA and RNA sequences across three tissues, with 75% of these exhibiting an A-to-G (DNA to RNA) discrepancy, indicative of a canonical ADAR-catalyzed RNA editing event. When we consider only mismatches within repetitive regions of the genome, the A-to-G percentage increases to 94%, with the majority of these located within the swine specific SINE retrotransposon PRE-1. We also observe evidence of A-to-G editing within coding regions that were previously verified in primates.\\n\\nConclusionsThus, our high-throughput evidence suggests that pervasive RNA editing by ADAR can exist outside of the primate lineage to dramatically enhance genetic variation in pigs.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSummary graphics for RNA-sequencing and microarray gene expression analyses may contain upwards of tens of thousands of points. Details about certain genes or samples of interest are easily obscured in such dense summary displays. Incorporating interactivity into summary plots would enable additional information to be displayed on demand and facilitate intuitive data exploration.\\n\\nResultsThe open-source Glimma package creates interactive graphics for exploring gene expression analysis with a few simple R commands. It extends popular plots found in the limma package, such as multi-dimensional scaling plots and mean-difference plots, to allow individual data points to be queried and additional annotation information to be displayed upon hovering or selecting particular points. It also offers links between plots so that more information can be revealed on demand. Glimma is widely applicable, supporting data analyses from a number of well established Bioconductor workflows (limma, edgeR and DESeq2) and uses D3/JavaScript to produce HTML pages with interactive displays that enable more effective data exploration by end-users. Results from Glimma can be easily shared between bioinformaticians and biologists, enhancing reporting capabilities while maintaining reproducibility.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe Glimma R package is available from http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/Glimma.html.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLow and deficient levels of vitamin A are common in low and middle income countries where tuberculosis burden is high. We assessed the impact of baseline levels of vitamins A and carotenoids on TB disease risk.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe conducted a case-control study nested within a longitudinal cohort of household contacts of pulmonary TB cases in Lima, Peru. We screened all contacts for TB disease at 2, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. We defined cases as HIV-negative household contacts with blood samples who developed TB disease at least 15 days after enrollment of the index patient. For each case, we randomly selected 4 controls from among contacts who did not develop TB disease, matching on gender and year of age. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for incident TB disease by vitamin A and carotenoids levels, controlling for other nutritional and socioeconomic factors.\\n\\nAmong 6751 HIV-negative household contacts with baseline blood samples, 192 developed secondary TB disease during follow-up. We analyzed 180 cases with viable samples and 709 matched controls. After controlling for possible confounders, we found that baseline vitamin A deficiency was associated with a 10-fold increase in risk of TB disease among household contacts (aOR 10.42; 95% CI 4.01-27.05; p < 0.001). This association was dose-dependent with stepwise increases in TB disease risk with each decreasing quartile of vitamin A level. Carotenoid levels were also inversely associated with TB risk among adolescents.\\n\\nOur study is limited by the one year duration of follow up and by the relatively few blood samples available from household contacts under ten years of age.\\n\\nConclusionsVitamin A deficiency strongly predicted risk of incident TB disease among household contacts of TB patients. Vitamin A supplementation among individuals at high risk of TB may provide an effective means of preventing TB disease.",
