    "abstract": "Evolve and resequence experiments have provided us a tool to understand bacterial adaptation to antibiotics by the gain of genomic mutations. In our previous work, we used short term evolution to isolate mutants resistant to the ribosome targeting antibiotic kanamycin. We had reported gain of resistance to kanamycin via multiple different point mutations in the translation elongation factor G (EF-G). Furthermore, we had shown that the resistance of EF-G mutants could be increased by second site mutations in the genes rpoD / cpxA / topA / cyaA. Mutations in three of these genes had been discovered in earlier screens for aminoglycoside resistance. In this work we expand on our understanding of these second site mutations. Using genetic tools we asked how mutations in the cell envelope stress sensor kinase (CpxAF218Y) and adenylate cyclase (CyaAN600Y) could alter their activities to result in resistance. We found that the mutation in cpxA most likely results in an active Cpx stress response. Further evolution of an EF-G mutant in a higher concentration of kanamycin than what was used in our previous experiments identified the cpxA locus as a primary target for a significant increase in resistance. The mutation in cyaA results in a loss of catalytic activity and probably results in resistance via altered CRP function. Despite a reduction in cAMP levels, the CyaAN600Y mutant has a transcriptome indicative of increased CRP activity, pointing to an unknown non-catalytic role for CyaA in gene expression. From the transcriptomes of double and single mutants we describe the epistasis between the mutation in EF-G and these second site mutations. We show that the large scale transcriptomic changes in the topoisomerase I (FusAA608E-TopAS180L) mutant likely result from increased negative supercoiling in the cell. Finally, genes with known roles in aminoglycoside resistance were present among the mis-regulated genes in the mutants.",

    "abstract": "Mate recognition in animals evolves during niche adaptation and involves habitat and social olfactory signals. Drosophila melanogaster is attracted to fermenting fruit for feeding and egg-laying. We show that, in addition, female flies release a pheromone (Z)4-undecenal (Z4-11Al), that elicits flight attraction in both sexes. The biosynthetic precursor of Z4-11Al is the cuticular hydrocarbon (Z,Z)-7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD), which is known to afford reproductive isolation between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. A pair of alternatively spliced receptors, Or69aB and Or69aA, is tuned to Z4-11Al and to food olfactory cues, respectively. These receptors are co-expressed in the same olfactory sensory neurons, and feed into a neural circuit mediating species-specific, long-range communication: the close relative D. simulans does not respond. That Or69aA and Or69aB have adopted dual olfactory traits highlights the interplay of habitat and social signals in mate finding. These olfactory receptor genes afford a collaboration between natural and sexual selection, which has the potential to drive phylogenetic divergence.",

    "abstract": "Advances in 3rd generation sequencing have opened new possibilities for  benchtop whole genome sequencing. The MinION is a portable device that uses nanopore technology and can sequence long DNA molecules. MinION long reads are well suited for sequencing and de novo assembly of complex genomes with large repetitive elements. Long reads also facilitate the identification of complex genomic rearrangements such as those observed in tumor genomes. To assess the feasibility of the de novo assembly of large complex genomes using both MinION and Illumina platforms, we sequenced the genome of a Caenorhabditis elegans strain that contains a complex acetaldehyde-induced rearrangement and a biolistic bombardment-mediated insertion of a GFP containing plasmid. Using [~]5.8 gigabases of MinION sequence data, we were able to assemble a C. elegans genome containing 145 contigs (N50 contig length = 1.22 Mb) that covered >99% of the 100,286,401 bp reference genome. In contrast, using [~]8.04 gigabases of Illumina sequence data, we were able to assemble a C. elegans genome in 38,645 contigs (N50 contig length = [~]26 kb) containing 117 Mb. From the MinION genome assembly we identified the complex structures of both the acetaldehyde-induced mutation and the biolistic-mediated insertion. To date, this is the largest genome to be assembled exclusively from MinION data and is the first demonstration that the long reads of MinION sequencing can be used for whole genome assembly of large (100 Mb) genomes and the elucidation of complex genomic rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "Humans perform saccadic eye movements two to three times per second. When doing so, the nervous system strongly suppresses sensory feedback for extended periods of time in comparison with the movement time. Why does the brain discard so much visual information? Here we suggest that perceptual suppression may arise from efficient sensorimotor computations, assuming that perception and control are fundamentally linked. More precisely, we show that a Bayesian estimator should reduce the weight of sensory information around the time of saccades, as a result of signal dependent noise and of sensorimotor delays. Such reduction parallels the behavioral suppression occurring prior to and during saccades, and the reduction in neural responses to visual stimuli observed across the visual hierarchy. We suggest that saccadic suppression originates from efficient sensorimotor processing, indicating that the brain shares neural resources for perception and control.",

    "abstract": "Legumes (family Fabaceae) are globally important crops due to their nitrogen fixing ability. Papilionoideae, the best-studied subfamily, have undergone a Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) around 59 million years ago. Recent study found varying WGD ages in subfamilies Mimosoideae and Caesalpinioideae and proposed multiple occurrences of WGD across the family based on gene duplication patterns. Despite that, the genome evolution of legume ancestor into modern legumes after the WGD is not well-understood. We aimed to study genome evolution at the subfamily level using gene-based linkage maps for Acacia auriculiformis and A. mangium (Mimosoideae) and we discovered evidence for a WGD event in Acacia. In additional to synonymous substitution rate (Ks) analysis, we used ancestral karyotype prediction to further corroborate this WGD and elucidate underlying mechanisms of karyotype evolution in Fabaceae. Using publicly available transcriptome resources from 25 species across the family Fabaceae and 2 species from order Fabales, we found that the variations in WGD ages highly correlate (R=0.8606, p-value<0.00001) with the divergence age of Vitis vinifera as an outgroup. If the variation of Ks is corrected, the age of WGDs of the family Fabaceae should be the same and therefore, parsimony would favour a single WGD near the base of Fabaceae over multiple independent WGDs across Fabaceae. In addition, we demonstrated that genome comparison of Papilionoideae with other subfamily provide important insights in understanding genome evolution in legumes.",
