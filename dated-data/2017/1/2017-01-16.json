    "abstract": "O_LICharacterizing species history and identifying loci underlying local adaptation is crucial in functional ecology, evolutionary biology, conservation and agronomy. The ongoing and constant improvement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has facilitated the production of an ever-increasing number of genetic markers across genomes of non-model species.\\nC_LIO_LIThe study of variation in these markers across natural populations has deepened the understanding of how population history and selection act on genomes. Population genomics now provides tools to better integrate selection into a historical framework, and take into account selection when reconstructing demographic history. However, this improvement has come with a burst of analytical tools that can confuse users.\\nC_LIO_LISuch confusion can limit the amount of information effectively retrieved from complex genomic datasets. In addition, the lack of a unified analytical pipeline impairs the diffusion of the most recent analytical tools into fields like conservation biology.\\nC_LIO_LITo address this need, we describe possible analytical protocols and link these with more than 70 methods dealing with genome-scale datasets. We summarise the strategies they use to infer demographic history and selection, and discuss some of their limitations. A website listing these methods is available at www.methodspopgen.com.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Across a large variety of Mendelian disorders, 50 to 75% of undiagnosed patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis by whole exome sequencing indicative of underlying regulatory variants. In contrast, whole genome sequencing allows the discovery of all genetic variants, but their significant number, coupled with a poor understanding of the non-coding genome, makes their prioritization challenging. Here, we demonstrate the power of directly sequencing transcriptomes by providing a genetic diagnosis for 11% (5 of 47) of unsolved mitochondrial disease patients and strong candidates for other patients. We found a median of 1 aberrantly expressed gene, 5 aberrant splicing events, and 6 mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and established disease-causing roles for each kind. Private exons often arose from sites that are weakly spliced in other individuals, providing an important clue for future variant prioritization. One such intronic exon-creating variant was found in three unrelated families in the complex I assembly factor TIMMDC1, which we consequently established as a novel disease-associated gene. In conclusion, our study expands the diagnostic tools for detecting non-exonic variants of Mendelian disorders and provides examples of intronic loss-of-function variants with pathological relevance.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is an almost inevitable consequence of cancer therapy and ultimately proves fatal for the majority of patients. In many cases this is the consequence of specific gene mutations that have the potential to be targeted to re-sensitize the tumor. The ability to uniformly saturate the genome with point mutations without chromosome or nucleotide sequence context bias would open the door to identify all putative drug resistance mutations in cancer models. Here we describe such a method for elucidating drug resistance mechanisms using genome-wide chemical mutagenesis allied to next-generation sequencing. We show that chemically mutagenizing the genome of cancer cells dramatically increases the number of drug-resistant clones and allows the detection of both known and novel drug resistance mutations. We have developed an efficient computational process that allows for the rapid identification of involved pathways and druggable targets. Such a priori knowledge would greatly empower serial monitoring strategies for drug resistance in the clinic as well as the development of trials for drug resistant patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOxytocin may influence various human behaviors and the connectivity across subcortical and cortical networks. Previous oxytocin studies are male-biased and often constrained by task-based inferences. Here we investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting state connectivity between subcortical and cortical networks women.\\n\\nMethodsWe collected resting state fMRI data on 26 typically-developing women following intranasal oxytocin administration using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on OXTR.\\n\\nResultsIn women, OXTR was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in reward, emotion, social-communication, language, and pain processing. This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals with higher autistic traits.\\n\\nDiscussionOxytocin strengthens corticostriatal connectivity in women, particularly with cortical networks that are involved in social-communicative, motivational, and affective processes. This effect may be important for future work on neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g., autism, chronic pain), particularly through highlighting how oxytocin may operate differently for subsets of individuals.\\n\\nSignificance statementThis is the first study to examine how oxytocin affects corticostriatal connectivity in humans, and specifically in women. This is important given oxytocin could impact neural circuitry differently in males and females. Here, we show that oxytocin increases connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry involved in a number of social-communicative, motivational, and affective processes that are implicated in certain neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., autism). This effect is bolstered by independent evidence that oxytocin receptor gene expression is high in striatal regions and modest in cortical areas. These results may have potential implications for personalized treatment, as oxytocin-related effects on connectivity may vary substantially between individuals.",

    "abstract": "1Recent investigations on the aerodynamics of natural fliers have illuminated the significance of the Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) for lift generation in a variety of flight conditions. A well documented example of an LEV is that generated by aircraft with highly swept, delta shaped wings. While the wing aerodynamics of a manoeuvring aircraft, a bird gliding and a bird in flapping flight vary significantly, it is believed that this existing knowledge will serve to add understanding to the complex aerodynamics of natural fliers. In this investigation, the wing of a common swift Apus apus is simplified to a model with swept wings and a sharp leading-edge, making it readily comparable to a model delta shaped wing of the same leading-edge geometry. Particle image velocimetry provides an understanding of the effect of the tapering swift wing on LEV development and stability, compared with the delta wing model. For the first time a dual LEV is recorded on a swift shaped wing, where it is found across all tested conditions. It is shown that the span-wise location of LEV breakdown is governed by the local chord rather than Reynolds number or angle of attack. These findings suggest that the common swift is able to generate a dual LEV while gliding, potentially delaying vortex breakdown by exploiting other features non explored here, such as wing twist and flexibility. It is further suggested that the vortex system could be used to damp loading fluctuations, reducing energy expenditure, rather than for lift augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies are now shifting focus from analysis of common to uncommon and rare variants with an anticipation to explain additional heritability of complex traits. As power for association testing for individual rare variants may often be low, various aggregate level association tests have been proposed to detect genetic loci that may contain clusters of susceptibility variants. Typically, power calculations for such tests require specification of large number of parameters, including effect sizes and allele frequencies of individual variants, making them difficult to use in practice. In this report, we approximate power to varying degree of accuracy using a smaller number of key parameters, including the total genetic variance explained by multiple variants within a locus. We perform extensive simulation studies to assess the accuracy of the proposed approximations in realistic settings. Using the simplified power calculation methods, we then develop an analytic framework to obtain bounds on genetic architecture of an underlying trait given results from a genome-wide study and observe important implications for the completely lack of or limited number of findings in many currently reported studies. Finally, we provide insights into the required quality of annotation/functional information for identification of likely causal variants to make meaningful improvement in power of subsequent association tests. A shiny application, Power Analysis for GEnetic AssociatioN Tests (PAGEANT), in R implementing the methods is made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Autism-associated genetic mutations may produce altered learning abilities by perturbing the balance between stability and plasticity of synaptic connections in the brain. Here we report an increase in the stabilization of dendritic spines formed during repetitive motor learning in the mouse model of MECP2-duplication syndrome, a high-penetrance form of syndromic autism. This increased stabilization is mediated entirely by spines that form cooperatively in clusters. The number of clusters formed and stabilized predicts the mutants enhanced motor learning and memory phenotype, reminiscent of savant-like behaviors occasionally associated with autism.\\n\\nThe ERK signaling pathway, which promotes cooperative plasticity between spines, was found to be hyperactive in MECP2-duplication motor cortex specifically after training. Inhibition of ERK signaling normalizes clustered spine stabilization and rescues motor learning behavior in mutants. We conclude that learning-associated dendritic spine clustering stabilized by hyperactive ERK signaling drives abnormal motor learning and memory consolidation in this model of syndromic autism.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory techniques for high-throughput sequencing have enhanced our ability to generate DNA sequence data from millions of natural history specimens collected prior to the molecular era, but remain poorly tested at shallower evolutionary time scales. Hybridization capture using restriction site associated DNA probes (hyRAD) is a recently developed method for population genomics with museum specimens (Suchan et al. 2016). The hyRAD method employs fragments produced in a restriction site associated double digestion as the basis for probes that capture orthologous loci in samples of interest. While promising in that it does not require a reference genome, hyRAD has yet to be applied across study systems in independent laboratories. Here we provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of hyRAD on both fresh avian tissue and dried tissue from museum specimens up to 140 years old and investigate how variable quantities of input DNA affects sequencing, assembly, and population genetic inference. We present a modified bench protocol and bioinformatics pipeline, including three steps for detection and removal of microbial and mitochondrial DNA contaminants. We confirm that hyRAD is an effective tool for sampling thousands of orthologous SNPs from historic museum specimens to describe phylogeographic patterns. We find that modern DNA performs significantly better than historical DNA better during sequencing, but that assembly performance is largely equivalent. We also find that the quantity of input DNA predicts %GC content of assembled contiguous sequences, suggesting PCR bias. We caution against sampling schemes that include taxonomic or geographic autocorrelation across modern and historic samples.",

In addition to learning from the current trial, the new model supposes that animals store and replay previous trials, learning from the replayed trials using the same learning rule. This simple idea provides a unified explanation for diverse phenomena that have proved challenging to earlier associative models, including spontaneous recovery, latent inhibition, retrospective revaluation, and trial spacing effects. For example, spontaneous recovery is explained by supposing that the animal replays its previous trials during the interval between extinction and test. These include earlier acquisition trials as well as recent extinction trials, and thus there is a gradual re-acquisition of the conditioned response. We present simulation results for the simplest version of this replay idea, where the trial memory is assumed empty at the beginning of an experiment, all experienced trials are stored and none removed, and sampling from the memory is performed at random. Even this minimal replay model is able to explain the challenging phenomena, illustrating the explanatory power of an associative model enhanced by learning from remembered as well as real experiences.",

    "abstract": "Colubridae is the largest and most diverse family of snakes, with visual systems that reflect this diversity, encompassing a variety of retinal photoreceptor organizations. The transmutation theory proposed by Walls postulates that photoreceptors could evolutionarily transition between cell types in squamates, but few studies have tested this theory. Recently, evidence for transmutation and rod-like machinery in an all cone retina has been identified in a diurnal garter snake (Thamnophis), and it appears that the rhodopsin gene at least may be widespread among colubrid snakes. However, functional evidence supporting transmutation beyond the existence of the rhodopsin gene remains rare. We examined the all cone retina of another diurnal colubrid, Pituophis melanoleucus, distantly related to Thamnophis. We found that P. melanoleucus expresses two cone opsins (SWS1, LWS) and rhodopsin (RH1) within the eye. Immunohistochemistry localized rhodopsin to the outer segment of photoreceptors in the all-cone retina of the snake and all opsin genes produced functional visual pigments when expressed in vitro. Consistent with other studies, we found that P. melanoleucus rhodopsin is extremely blue-shifted. Surprisingly, P. melanoleucus rhodopsin reacted with hydroxylamine, a typical cone opsin characteristic. These results support the idea that the rhodopsin-containing photoreceptors of P. melanoleucus are the products of evolutionary transmutation from rod ancestors, and suggests that this phenomenon may be widespread in colubrid snakes. We hypothesize that transmutation may be an adaptation for diurnal, brighter-light vision, which could result in increased spectral sensitivity and chromatic discrimination with the potential for colour vision.\\n\\nSummary StatementThe all cone retina of the colubrid snake, Pituophis melanoleucus contains a blue-shifted rhodopsin with cone opsin-like properties, which may have been adaptive in diurnal snakes.",

The data provided supports to the possibility that the RAG transposon has been active through the deuterostome evolution and is still active in several lineages. The RAG transposon corresponds to several families present in deuterostomes. RAG1-RAG2 V(D)J recombinase evolved from one of them, partially due to the new ability of the transposon to interact with the cellular reparation machinery. Considering the fact that the RAG transposon survived millions of years in many different lineages, in multiple copies, and that DDE transposases evolved their association with proteins involved in repair mechanisms, we propose that the apparition of V(D)J recombination machinery could be a predictable genetic event.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100020). Predicting and managing contemporary adaption requires a proper understanding of the determinants of genetic variation. Spatial heterogeneity of the environment may stably maintain polymorphism when habitat contribution to the next generation can be considered independent of the degree of adaptation of local populations within habitats (i.e., under soft selection). In contrast, when habitats contribute proportionally to the mean fitness of the populations they host (hard selection), polymorphism is not expected to be maintained by selection. Although mathematically established decades ago, this prediction had never been properly explored. Here we provide an experimental test in which polymorphic populations of Escherichia coli growing in heterogeneous habitats were exposed to hard and soft selection regimes. As predicted by theory, polymorphism was longer preserved under soft selection. Complementary tests established that soft selection slowed down fixation processes and could even protect polymorphism on the long term by providing a systematic advantage to rare genotypes.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, with the advent of inexpensive microarray and RNA-seq technologies, there have been many expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies for identifying genetic variants called eQTLs that regulate gene expression. Discovering eQTLs has been increasingly important as they may elucidate the functional consequence of non-coding variants identified from genome-wide association studies. Recently, several eQTL studies such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium have made a great effort to obtain gene expression from multiple tissues. One advantage of these multi-tissue eQTL datasets is that they may allow one to identify more eQTLs by combining information across multiple tissues. Although a few methods have been proposed for multi-tissue eQTL studies, they are often computationally intensive and may not achieve optimal power because they do not consider a biological insight that a genetic variant regulates gene expression similarly in related tissues. In this paper, we propose an efficient meta-analysis approach for identifying eQTLs from large multi-tissue eQTL datasets. We name our method RECOV because it uses a random effects (RE) meta-analysis with an explicit covariance (COV) term to model the correlation of effect that eQTLs have across tissues. Our approach is faster than the previous approaches and properly controls the false-positive rate. We apply our approach to the real multi-tissue eQTL dataset from GTEx that contains 44 tissues, and show that our approach detects more eQTLs and eGenes than previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous EEG-fMRI has been vastly used to investigate functional networks of brain combining high spatial resolution (millimeter) of fMRI with high temporal resolution (millisecond) of EEG. However, to extract the most relevant information from the acquired data, it is necessary to develop analysis methods with less ad hoc assumptions. To this end, brain rhythms are often used which are the specific frequency-bands of EEG signal and assumed to represent diverse sub-second cognitive processes at different parts of the cortex. Furthermore, single-trial analysis of EEG is believed to show more realistic picture of ongoing and event-related activities of brain. Here, we present a nonparametric multiple change-point detection and estimation method for the single-trial analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment recorded during auditory and visual oddball tasks. In a simple attention task like oddball, the frontal cortex of brain is responsible to distinguish and respond appropriately to target versus standard events. By using EEG signal at the frontal cortex, we show that the -band activity changes according to \\\"inhibition timing\\\" hypothesis and the {beta}-band activity is in line with \\\"maintaining the status quo\\\" hypothesis. Furthermore, using these activities to build regressors in the GLM analysis of fMRI, we localize active brain regions with high spatial and temporal resolutions and elaborate further on the coordination of attentional networks across brain.",

    "abstract": "The dinoflagellate-coral partnership influences the coral holobionts tolerance to thermal stress and bleaching. However, the comparative roles of host genetic versus environmental factors in determining the composition of this symbiosis are largely unknown. Here we quantify the heritability of the initial Symbiodinium communities for two broadcast-spawning corals with different symbiont transmission modes: Acropora tenuis has environmental acquisition, whereas Montipora digitata has maternal transmission. Using high throughput sequencing of the ITS-2 region to characterize communities in parents, juveniles and eggs, we describe previously undocumented Symbiodinium diversity and dynamics in both corals. After one month of uptake in the field, Symbiodinium communities associated with A. tenuis juveniles were dominated by A3, C1, D1, A-type CCMP828, and D1a in proportional abundances conserved between experiments in two years. M. digitata eggs were predominantly characterized by C15, D1, and A3. In contrast to current paradigms, host genetic influences accounted for a surprising 29% of phenotypic variation in Symbiodinium communities in the horizontally-transmitting A. tenuis, but only 62% in the vertically-transmitting M. digitata. Our results reveal hitherto unknown flexibility in the acquisition of Symbiodinium communities and substantial heritability in both species, providing material for selection to produce partnerships that are locally adapted to changing environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract (250 words)Whole-body regeneration, the formation of an entire adult from only a small fragment of its own tissue, is extremely rare among chordates. Exceptionally, in the colonial ascidian Botrylloides leachii, a fully functional adult is formed from their common vascular system, upon ablation of all adults from the colony, in just 10 days thanks to their high blastogenetic potential. While previous studies have identified key genetic markers and morphological changes, no study has yet focused on the haematological aspects of regeneration despite the major involvement of the remaining vascular system and the contained haemocytes in this process. To dissect this process, we analysed colony blood flow patterns using time-lapse microscopy to obtain a quantitative description of the velocity, reversal pattern, and average distance travelled by haemocytes. We also observed that flows present during regeneration are powered by temporally and spatially synchronized contractions of the terminal ampullae. In addition, we revised previous studies on B. leachii haematology as well as asexual development using histological sectioning, and compared the role of haemocytes during whole-body regeneration. We found that regeneration starts with a rapid healing response characterized by blood clotting and infiltration of immunocytes, followed by increased activity of haemoblasts, recruitment of macrophage-like cells for clearing the tissues of debris, and their subsequent disappearance from the circulation concomitant with the maturation of a single regenerated adult. Overall, we provide a uniquely detailed account of the haematological properties of regenerating B. leachii colonies, providing novel lines of inquiry towards the decipherment of regeneration in chordates.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular reactivity mapping (CVR), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and carbon dioxide as a stimulus, provides useful information on how cerebral blood vessels react under stress. This information has proven to be useful in the study of vascular disorders, dementia and healthy ageing. However, clinical adoption of this form of CVR mapping has been hindered by relatively long scan durations of 7 to 12 minutes. By replacing the conventional block presentation of carbon dioxide enriched air with a sinusoidally modulated stimulus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether more clinically acceptable scan durations are possible. Firstly, the conventional block protocol was compared with a sinusoidal protocol of the same duration of 7 minutes. Estimates of the magnitude of the CVR signal (CVR magnitude) and the relative timing of the CVR response (CVR phase) were found to be in good agreement between the stimulus protocols. Secondly, data from the sinusoidal protocol was reanalysed using decreasing amounts of data in the range 1 to 6 minutes. The CVR magnitude was found to tolerate this reduction in scan duration better than CVR phase. However, these analyses indicate that scan durations in the range of 3 to 5 minutes produce robust data.",
