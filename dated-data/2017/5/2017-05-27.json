    "abstract": "Motion Induced Blindness (MIB) is a well-established visual phenomenon whereby highly salient targets disappear when viewed against a moving background mask. No research has yet explored whether contracting and expanding optic flow can also trigger target disappearance. We explored MIB using mask speeds corresponding to driving at 35, 50, 65 and 80 km/h in simulated forward (expansion) and backward (contraction) motion as well as 2-D radial movement, random, and static mask motion types. Participants (n = 18) viewed MIB targets against masks with different movement types, speed, and target locations. To understand the relationship between saccades, pupil response and perceptual disappearance, we ran two additional eye-tracking experiments (n = 19). Target disappearance increased significantly with faster mask speeds and upper visual field target presentation. Simulated optic flow and 2-D radial movement caused comparable disappearance, and all moving masks caused significantly more disappearance than a static mask. Saccades could not entirely account for differences between conditions, suggesting that self-motion optic flow does cause MIB in an artificial setting. Pupil analyses implied that MIB disappearance induced by optic flow is not subjectively salient, potentially explaining why MIB is not noticed during driving. Potential implications of MIB for driving safety and Head-Up-Display (HUD) technologies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella is an intracellular pathogen that infects a wide range of hosts and can survive in macrophages. An essential mechanism uses by the macrophages to eradicate Salmonella is production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we used proteogenomics to determine the candidate genes and proteins that have a role in resistance of S. Typhimurium to H2O2. For Tn-seq, a highly saturated Tn5 insertion library was grown in vitro under either 2.5 (H2O2L) or 3.5 mM H2O2 (H2O2H). We identified two sets of overlapping genes that are required for resistance of S. Typhimurium to H2O2L and H2O2H, and the results were validated via phenotypic evaluation of 50 selected mutants. The enriched pathways for resistance to H2O2 included DNA repair, aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (aroBK), Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, iron homeostasis and a putative iron transporter system (ybbKLM), flagellar genes (fliBC), H2O2 scavenging enzymes, and DNA adenine methylase. Proteomics revealed that the majority of essential proteins, including ribosomal proteins, were downregulated upon exposure to H2O2. A subset of proteins identified by Tn-seq were analyzed by targeted proteomics, and 70% of them were upregulated upon exposure to H2O2. The identified candidate genes will deepen our understanding about mechanisms of S. Typhimurium survival in macrophages, and can be exploited to develop new antimicrobial drugs.",

We demonstrate that existing techniques for estimating compositional bias fail with sparse metagenomic 16S count data and propose an empirical Bayes normalization approach to overcome this problem. In addition, we clarify the assumptions underlying frequently used scaling normalization methods in light of compositional bias, including scaling methods that were not designed directly to address it.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in eukaryotes have demonstrated the translation of alternative open reading frames (altORFs) in addition to annotated protein coding sequences (CDSs). We show that a large number of small proteins could in fact be coded by altORFs. The putative alternative proteins translated from altORFs have orthologs in many species and evolutionary patterns indicate that altORFs are particularly constrained in CDSs that evolve slowly. Thousands of predicted alternative proteins are detected in proteomic datasets by reanalysis with a database containing predicted alternative proteins. Protein domains and co-conservation analyses suggest potential functional cooperation or shared function between small and large proteins encoded in the same genes. This is illustrated with specific examples, including altMID51, a 70 amino acid mitochondrial fission-promoting protein encoded in MiD51/Mief1/SMCR7L, a gene encoding an annotated protein promoting mitochondrial fission. Our results suggest that many coding genes code for more than one protein that are often functionally related.",

    "abstract": "Cell sorting, whereby a heterogeneous cell mixture organizes into distinct tissues, is a fundamental patterning process in development. So far, most studies of cell sorting have relied either on 2-dimensional cellular aggregates, in vitro situations that do not have a direct counterpart in vivo, or were focused on the properties of single cells. Here, we report the first multiscale experimental study on 3-dimensional regenerating Hydra aggregates, capable of reforming a full animal. By quantifying the kinematics of single cell and whole aggregate behaviors, we show that no differences in cell motility exist among cell types and that sorting dynamics follow a power law. Moreover, we measure the physical properties of separated tissues and determine their viscosities and surface tensions. Based on our experimental results and numerical simulations, we conclude that tissue interfacial tensions are sufficient to explain Hydra cell sorting. Doing so, we illustrate DArcy Thompsons central idea that biological organization can be understood through physical principles, an idea which is currently re-shaping the field of developmental biology.\\n\\nSummary statementHydra regenerates after dissociation into single cells. We show how physical mechanisms can explain the first step of regeneration, whereby ectodermal and endodermal cells sort out to form distinct tissue layers.",

Despite the requirement for stromal cell contact in this process, the nature of these contacts has been poorly defined. We have previously identified a requirement for NK cell signaling receptors associated with terminal maturation in NK cell migration. However, the relationship between NK cell migration and differentiation is still unclear. Here, we perform continuous long-term imaging and tracking of NK cell progenitors undergoing in vitro differentiation. We demonstrate that NK cell precursors can be tracked over long time periods on the order of weeks by utilizing phase-contrast microscopy, and show that these cells acquire increasing motility as they mature. Additionally, we observe that NK cells display a more heterogeneous range of migratory behaviors at later stages of development, with the acquisition of complex modes of migration that are associated with terminal maturation. Together these data demonstrate previously unknown migratory behaviors of innate lymphocytes undergoing lineage differentiation revealed by long-term imaging and analysis workflows.",

The affected neural circuits and cell types remain unclear and may vary at different developmental stages. By analyzing multiple sets of human single cell transcriptome profiles, we found that ASD candidates showed enriched gene expression in neurons, especially in inhibitory neurons. ASD candidates were also more likely to be the hubs of the co-expressed module that is highly expressed in inhibitory neurons, a feature not detected for excitatory neurons. In addition, we found that upregulated genes in multiple ASD cortex samples were also enriched with genes highly expressed in inhibitory neurons, suggesting a potential increase of inhibitory neurons and an imbalance in the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, the downstream targets of several ASD candidates, such as CHD8, EHMT1 and SATB2, also displayed enriched expression in inhibitory neurons. Taken together, our analysis of single cell transcriptomic data suggest that inhibitory neurons may be the major neuron subtype affected by the disruption of ASD gene networks, providing single cell functional evidence to support the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The TOR pathway regulates morphogenesis and responses to host cells in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Eukaryotic TOR complex 1 (TORC1) induces growth and proliferation in response to nitrogen and carbon source availability. Our unbiased genetic approach seeking new components of TORC1 signaling in C. albicans revealed that the phosphate transporter Pho84 is required for normal TORC1 activity. We found that mutants in PHO84 are hypersensitive to rapamycin and, in response to phosphate feeding, generate less phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (P-S6) than wild type. The small GTPase Gtr1, a component of the TORC1-activating EGO complex, links Pho84 to TORC1. Mutants in Gtr1, but not in another TORC1-activating GTPase, Rhb1, are defective in the P-S6 response to phosphate. Overexpression of Gtr1 and of a constitutively active Gtr1Q67L mutant suppress TORC1-related defects. In S. cerevisiae pho84 mutants, constitutively active Gtr1 suppresses a TORC1 signaling defect but does not rescue rapamycin hypersensitivity. Hence connections from phosphate homeostasis to TORC1 may differ between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. The converse direction of signaling, from TORC1 to the phosphate homeostasis (PHO) regulon, previously observed in S. cerevisiae, was genetically demonstrated in C. albicans using conditional TOR1 alleles. A small molecule inhibitor of Pho84, an FDA-approved drug, inhibits TORC1 signaling and potentiates the activity of the antifungals amphotericin B and micafungin. Anabolic TORC1-dependent processes require significant amounts of phosphate. Our study demonstrates that phosphate availability is monitored and also controlled by TORC1, and that TORC1 can be indirectly targeted by inhibiting Pho84.\\n\\nSignificanceThe human fungal pathogen Candida albicans uses the TOR signaling pathway to contend with varying host environments and thereby regulate cell growth. Seeking novel components of the C. albicans TOR pathway we identified a cell-surface phosphate importer, Pho84, and its molecular link to TOR complex 1 (TORC1). Since phosphorus is a critical element for anabolic processes like DNA replication, ribosome biogenesis, translation and membrane biosynthesis, TORC1 monitors its availability in regulating these processes. By depleting the central kinase in the TORC1 pathway, we showed that TORC1 signaling modulates regulation of phosphate acquisition. An FDA-approved small-molecule inhibitor of Pho84 inhibits TORC1 signaling and potentiates the activity of the gold-standard antifungal amphotericin B and the echinocandin micafungin.",

This mechanistic, multi-pathway model that features receptor heterodimerization, was trained on seven cancer cell lines and can predict signaling across two independent cell lines by adjusting only the receptor expression levels for each cell line. Interestingly, for patient samples the predicted tumor growth response correlates with high growth factor expression in the tumor microenvironment, which argues for a co-evolution of both factors in vivo.\\n\\nSummaryPrediction of ligand-induced growth of cancer cell lines, which correlates with ligand-blocking antibody efficacy, could be significantly improved by learning from features of a mechanistic signaling model, and was applied to reveal a correlation between growth factor expression and predicted response in patient samples.",

We generated a transgenic system and found that in ESCs, the pluripotency master regulator, OCT4, counteracts pro-differentiation induced by MITF by physical interference with MITF transcriptional activity. We further found that ESCs must be released from OCT4-maintained pluripotency prior to ectopically induced differentiation. Moreover, OCT4 induction in various differentiated cells repressed their lineage identity in vivo. Alongside, chromatin architecture combined with ChIP-seq analysis suggested that OCT4 competes with various lineage master regulators for binding promoters and enhancers.

    "abstract": "Human genomes contain structural variations (SVs) that are associated with various phenotypic variations and diseases. SV detection by sequencing is incomplete due to limited read length. Nanochannel-based optical mapping (OM) allows direct observation of SVs up to hundreds of kilo-bases in size on individual DNA molecules, making it a promising alternative technology for identifying large SVs. SV detection from optical maps is non-trivial due to complex types of error present in OM data, and no existing methods can simultaneously handle all these complex errors and the wide spectrum of SV types. Here we present a novel method, OMSV, for accurate and comprehensive identification of SVs from optical maps. OMSV detects both homozygous and heterozygous SVs, SVs of various types and sizes, and SVs with and without creating/destroying restriction sites. In an extensive series of tests based on real and simulated data, OMSV achieved both high sensitivity and specificity, with clear performance gains over the latest existing method. Applying OMSV to a human cell line, we identified hundreds of SVs >2kbp, with 65% of them missed by sequencing-based callers. Independent experimental validations confirmed the high accuracy of these SVs. We also demonstrate how OMSV can incorporate sequencing data to determine precise SV break points and novel sequences in the SVs not contained in the reference. We provide OMSV as open-source software to facilitate systematic studies of large SVs.",

To address this problem, we propose to construct finite-state machines (FSMs) instead. A modified version of the Evidence-Driven State Merging (EDSM) heuristic is used to reduce the number of states as FSMs grow too quickly as a function of the number of sequences to reveal any useful structure. We tested our approach on sequence data for the transcription factor HNF4 and found out that the constructed FSMs provide small representations and an intuitive visualization. Furthermore, the FSM was better than PWMs at discriminating the positive and negative sequences in our data set.",

The movement control functions of globus pallidus (GP), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and zona incerta (ZI) were analyzed in monkeys reaching for seen targets. Temporal profiles of the hand movements of monkeys and the synchronized flow of electrochemical energy through these basal ganglia were analyzed in terms of a theory of goal-directed movement. Theoretical and empirical analysis indicated: (i) the neural information for controlling movement is the relative-rate-of-change of flow of electrochemical energy in neurons rather than the flow itself; (ii) GP is involved in creating prospective electrochemical flow to guide movement; (iii) STN is involved in registering the perceptual electrochemical flow monitoring the movement; (iv) ZI is involved in integrating the prospective and perceptual electrochemical flows to power the muscles and thence the movement.

Here, we show for the first time that CS induces steatogenesis, atherogenesis, and dementia-like pathogenesis in mice. Gut microbiome analysis revealed the sulfatase-secreting bacteria Rikenella and the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio are enriched. Surprisingly, berberine use boosts CS-induced multi-loci inflammatory manifestations by further increasing the abundance of Rikenella and Desulfovibrio, whereas cephalosporin reinforces the colon mucus barrier via flourishing Akkermansia muciniphila and upregulating mucin expression. Mechanistically, berberine aggravates mucus lining injury by prompting mucin degradation, endotoxin leakage, neutralizing antibody induction, pro-inflammatory cytokine burst, lactic acid accumulation and energy currency depletion in multiple organs and tissues. Taken together, CS evokes the early-phase pathogenesis toward steatohepatitis, atherosclerosis, and dementia upon augmenting gut opportunistic infection, and a sustained antibiotic monotherapy does not deprive the risk of CS-driven systemic inflammatory disorders.",

Within these domains, intergenic transcriptional enhancers evade heterochromatic silencing and converge into interchromosomal hubs that assemble over the transcriptionally active OR. The significance of this nuclear organization in OR choice remains elusive. Here, we show that transcription factors Lhx2 and Ebf specify OR enhancers by binding in a functionally cooperative fashion to stereotypically spaced motifs that defy heterochromatin. Specific displacement of Lhx2 and Ebf from OR enhancers resulted in pervasive, long-range, and trans downregulation of OR transcription, whereas pre-assembly of a multi-enhancer hub increased the frequency of OR choice in cis. Our data provide genetic support for the requirement and sufficiency of interchromosomal interactions in singular OR choice and generate general regulatory principles for stochastic, mutually exclusive gene expression programs.",

The cambium, the stem cell niche mediating wood formation, fundamentally depends on auxin signaling but its exact role and spatial organization is obscure. Here, we show that, while auxin signaling levels increase in differentiating cambium descendants, a moderate level of signaling in cambial stem cells is essential for cambium activity. We identify the auxin-dependent transcription factor ARF5/MONOPTEROS to cell-autonomously restrict the number of stem cells by attenuating the activity of the stem cell promoting WOX4 gene. In contrast, ARF3 and ARF4 function as cambium activators in a redundant fashion from outside of WOX4-expressing cells. Our results reveal an influence of auxin signaling on distinct cambium features by specific signaling components and allow the conceptual integration of plant stem cell systems with distinct anatomies.",

Research on cellular variability has mostly relied on observing expression either in response to natural stimuli or to constant gene regulators. However, the ability to probe cells individually can lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying process. Here, we propose an experimental platform for optogenetic feedback control of individual cells. It consists of a digital micromirror device that, coupled to a microscope, can target light-responsive cells with individualized illumination profiles, thereby exploiting the good spatial resolution of optogenetic induction. Together with an automated software pipeline for segmentation, quantification and tracking of single cells, the platform enables independent and real-time control of numerous cells. We demonstrate our platform by regulating transcription in over a hundred yeast cells simultaneously, while achieving tunability of mRNA abundance. Using a novel technique to measure extrinsic variation, we further show that single cell feedback regulation of this highly stochastic process achieves a 10-fold reduction of extrinsic variation in nascent mRNA over population control, with superior control loop properties. Our platform establishes a new, flexible method for studying transcriptional dynamics in single cells.",

We introduce cell-accurate three-dimensional Ca2+-mapping of all cells in the entire heart during the looping stage in live embryonic zebrafish, using high-speed light sheet microscopy and tailored image processing and analysis.

Thus, there is a large unmet need to predict which individuals will develop nephropathy and to understand the molecular mechanisms which govern this susceptibility. We compared the glomerular transcriptome from mice with distinct susceptibilities to DN, and identified differential regulation of genes that modulate inflammation. From these genes, we identified endothelial cell specific molecule-1 (Esm-1), as a glomerular-enriched determinant of resistance to DN. Glomerular Esm-1 mRNA and protein were lower in DN-susceptible, DBA/2, compared to DN-resistant, C57BL/6, mice. We demonstrated higher Esm-1 secretion from primary glomerular cultures of diabetic mice, and high glucose was sufficient to increase Esm-1 mRNA and protein secretion in both strains of mice. However, induction was significantly attenuated in DN-susceptible mice. Urine Esm-1 was also significantly higher only in DN-resistant mice. Moreover, using intravital microscopy and a biomimetic microfluidic assay, we showed that Esm-1 inhibited rolling and transmigration in a dose-dependent manner. For the first time we have uncovered glomerular-derived Esm-1 as a potential non-invasive biomarker of DN. Esm-1 inversely correlates with disease susceptibility and inhibits leukocyte infiltration, a critical factor in protecting the kidney from DN.",

    "abstract": "While it has long been recognised that anticipatory states amplify early EEG responses to visual targets in humans, it remains unclear how such modulations relate to the actual content of the neural representation, and help prioritise targets among temporally competing distractor stimuli. Using multivariate orientation decoding of high temporal resolution EEG recordings, we first demonstrate that anticipation also increases the amount of stimulus-identity information contained in these early brain responses. By characterising the influence of temporally adjacent distractors on target identity decoding, we additionally reveal that anticipation does not just attenuate distractor interference on target representations but, instead, delay it. Enhanced target decoding and distractor resistance are further predicted by the attenuation of posterior 8-14 Hz alpha oscillations. These findings offer several novel insights into how anticipatory states shape neural representations in service of resolving sensory competition in time, and they highlight the potential of non-invasive multivariate electrophysiology to track cognitive influences on perception in tasks with rapidly changing displays.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAnticipatory states help resolve visual competition in time\\nC_LIO_LIAnticipation enhances early target coding and delays distractor interference\\nC_LIO_LIAttenuated alpha oscillations also enhance target coding and distractor resistance\\nC_LIO_LIEEG decoding is a powerful tool for tracking percepts in rapidly changing displays\\nC_LI\\n\\nSignificance statementWhile the neural mechanisms by which anticipatory states help prioritise inputs that compete in space have received ample scientific investigation, the mechanisms by which the human brain accomplishes such prioritisation for inputs that compete in time remain less well understood. We used high temporal resolution EEG decoding to individuate (and track in time) neural information linked to visual target and distractors stimuli that were presented in close temporal proximity. This revealed that anticipatory states help resolve temporally competing percepts by a combination of enhanced target (but not distractor) coding as well as delayed interference on this target coding caused by temporally adjacent distractors - thus allocating a \\\"protective temporal window\\\" for high-fidelity target processing.",

Participants used a planar three degree-of-freedom exoskeleton robot to move a cursor to a target following a mechanical perturbation that flexed the elbow. In our first experiment, the cursor was mapped to the veridical position of the robot handle, but participants grasped the handle with two different hand orientations (thumb pointing upward or thumb point downward). We found that large rapid feedback responses were evoked in wrist extensor muscles when wrist extension helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb upward), and in wrist flexor muscles when wrist flexion helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb downward). In our second experiment, participants grasped the robot handle with their thumb pointing upward, but the cursors movement was either veridical, or was mirrored such that flexing the wrist moved the cursor as if the participant extended their wrist, and vice versa. After extensive practice, we found that rapid feedback responses were appropriately tuned to the wrist muscles that supported moving the cursor to the target when the cursor was mapped to the mirrored movement of the wrist, but were not tuned to the appropriate wrist muscles when the cursor was remapped to the wrists veridical movement.",

To facilitate identification of therapeutic targets we developed a novel murine model of diabetic tendinopathy. Mice fed a High Fat Diet (HFD) developed diet induced obesity and T2DM. Obesity/ T2DM resulted in progressive impairments in tendon gliding function and mechanical properties, relative to mice fed a Low Fat Diet (LFD), as well as a decrease in collagen fibril diameter by transmission electron microscopy. We then determined if restoration of normal metabolic function, by switching mice from HFD to LFD, is sufficient to halt the pathological changes in tendon due to obesity/T2DM. However, switching from a HFD to LFD resulted in greater impairments in tendon gliding function than mice maintained on a HFD. Mechanistically, IR{beta} signaling is decreased in obese/T2DM murine tendons, suggesting altered IR{beta} signaling as a driver of diabetic tendinopathy. However, knock-down of IR{beta} expression in S100a4-lineage cells (IRcKOS100a4) was not sufficient to induce diabetic tendinopathy as no impairments in tendon gliding function or mechanical properties were observed in IRcKOS100a4 relative to WT.

Our computational analysis led to the identification of 63 TE-miRNAs, which were either locating nearby of any TE (TE-related), or overlapping with a TE (TE-derived). Furthermore, 13 out of 63 TE-miRNAs were designated as drought-responsive. Expression pattern of the identified drought-responsive TE-miRNAs are observed as tissue-specific manner, and their specific target transcripts are mostly related to transcription factors and growth-associated genes. Our findings suggest that miRNAs in relation with transposable elements might be key molecular players in the regulation of drought response.",

    "abstract": "Clustering of mutations has been found both in somatic mutations from cancer genomes and in germline de novo mutations (DNMs). We identified 1,755 clustered DNMs (cDNMs) within whole-genome sequencing data from 1,291 parent-offspring trios and investigated the underlying mutational mechanisms. We found that the number of clusters on the maternalallele was positively correlated with maternal age and that these consist of more individual mutations with larger intra-mutational distances compared to paternal clusters. More than 50% of maternal clusters were located on chromosomes 8, 9 and 16, in regions with an overall increased maternal mutation rate. Maternal clusters in these regions showed a distinct mutation signature characterized by C>G mutations. Finally, we found that maternal clusters associate with processes involving double-stranded-breaks (DSBs) such as meiotic gene conversions and de novo deletions events. These findings suggest accumulation of DSB-induced mutations throughout oocyte aging as an underlying mechanism leading to maternal mutation clusters.",
