    "abstract": "Scalable, integrative methods to understand mechanisms that link genetic variants with phenotypes are needed. Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations were tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Glycolysis is central to energy metabolism in most organisms, and is highly regulated to enable optimal growth. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, feedback mechanisms that control flux through glycolysis span transcriptional control to metabolite levels in the cell. Using a cellobiose consumption pathway, we decoupled glucose sensing from carbon utilization, revealing new modular layers of control that induce ATP consumption to drive rapid carbon fermentation. Alterations of the beta subunit of phosphofructokinase (PFK2), H+-plasma membrane ATPase (PMA1), and glucose sensors (SNF3, RGT2) revealed the importance of coupling extracellular glucose sensing to manage ATP levels in the cell. Controlling the upper bound of cellular ATP levels may be a general mechanism used to regulate energy levels in cells, via a regulatory network that can be uncoupled from ATP concentrations under perceived starvation conditions.\\n\\nImportanceLiving cells are fine-tuned through evolution to thrive in their native environments. Genome alterations to create organisms for specific biotechnological applications may result in unexpected and undesired phenotypes. We used a minimal synthetic biological system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a platform to reveal novel connections between carbon sensing, starvation conditions and energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The PML (promyelocytic leukemia) protein is a member of the TRIM family, a large group of proteins that show high diversity in functions but possess a common tripartite motif giving the family its name. We and others recently reported that both murine PML (mPML) and human PML (hPML) strongly restrict the early stages of infection by HIV-1 and other lentiviruses when expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This restriction activity was found to contribute to the type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 in MEFs. Additionally, PML caused transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 promoter in MEFs. By contrast, the modulation of the early stages of HIV-1 infection of human cells by PML has been investigated by RNAi with unclear results. In order to conclusively determine whether PML restricts HIV-1 or not in human cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out its gene in epithelial, lymphoid and monocytic human cell lines. Infection challenges showed that PML knockout had no effect on the permissiveness of these cells to HIV-1 infection. IFN-I treatments inhibited HIV-1 equally whether PML was expressed or not. Over-expression of individual hPML isoforms, or of mPML, in a human T cell line did not restrict HIV-1. The presence of PML was not required for the restriction of nonhuman retroviruses by TRIM5 was inhibited by arsenic trioxide through a PML-independent mechanism. We conclude that PML is not a restriction factor for HIV-1 in human cell lines representing diverse lineages.\\n\\nImportancePML is involved in innate immune mechanisms against both DNA and RNA viruses. Although the mechanism by which PML inhibits highly divergent viruses is unclear, it was recently found that it can increase the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, whether human PML inhibits HIV-1 has been debated. Here we provide unambiguous, knockout-based evidence that PML does not restrict the early post-entry stages of HIV-1 infection in a variety of human cell types and does not participate in the inhibition of HIV-1 by IFN-I. Although this study does not exclude the possibility of other mechanisms by which PML may interfere with HIV-1, we nonetheless demonstrate that PML does not generally act as an HIV-1 restriction factor in human cells and that its presence is not required for IFN-I to stimulate the expression of anti-HIV-1 genes. These results contribute to uncovering the landscape of HIV-1 inhibition by ISGs in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we described a method for multiplex genome editing by natural transformation (MuGENT). Mutant constructs for MuGENT require large arms of homology (>2000 bp) surrounding each genome edit, which necessitates laborious in vitro DNA splicing. In Vibrio cholerae, we uncover that this requirement is due to cytoplasmic ssDNA exonucleases, which inhibit natural transformation. In ssDNA exonuclease mutants, one arm of homology can be reduced to as little as 40 bp while still promoting integration of genome edits at rates of ~50% without selection in cis. Consequently, editing constructs are generated in a single PCR reaction where one homology arm is oligonucleotide encoded. To further enhance editing efficiencies, we also developed a strain for transient inactivation of the mismatch repair system. As a proof-of-concept, we used these advances to rapidly mutate 10 high-affinity binding sites for the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA and generated a duodecuple mutant of 12 diguanylate cyclases in V. cholerae. Whole genome sequencing revealed little to no off-target mutations in these strains. Finally, we show that ssDNA exonucleases inhibit natural transformation in Acinetobacter baylyi. Thus, rational removal of ssDNA exonucleases may be broadly applicable for enhancing the efficacy and ease of MuGENT in diverse naturally transformable species.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal activates a neuronal ensemble in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) that is responsible for high levels of uncontrolled alcohol drinking. However, the neuronal phenotypes and circuits controlled by these neurons are unknown. We investigated the cellular identity of this CeA neuronal ensemble and found that most neurons expressed corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Using Crh-Cre transgenic rats combined with in vivo optogenetics, we tested the role of CeA CRF neurons and their projections in excessive alcohol self-administration during withdrawal. Rats were injected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP or AAV-DIO-eYFP and implanted with optical fibers over the CeA. Animals were then exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor to induce alcohol dependence. Inactivation of CeA CRF neurons decreased alcohol drinking in dependent rats to non-dependent levels and completely suppressed activation of the CeA neuronal ensemble (Fos+ neurons) during withdrawal. No effects were observed on water or saccharin self-administration. In a second experiment, CeA CRF neurons were infected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP and optical fibers were implanted into downstream projection regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral hypothalamus (LH), parasubthalamic nucleus (pSTN), substantia innominata (SI), and parabrachial nuclei (PBN). Optogenetic inactivation of CRF terminals in the BNST reduced alcohol drinking and withdrawal signs, whereas inactivation of all other projections had no effect. These results demonstrate that CeA CRF neurons and their projections to the BNST drive excessive alcohol drinking and withdrawal in dependent rats.",

    "abstract": "Tomato leaf mould disease is caused by the biotrophic fungus Cladosporium fulvum. During infection, C. fulvum produces extracellular small secreted protein (SSP) effectors that function to promote colonization of the leaf apoplast. Resistance to the disease is governed by Cf immune receptor genes that encode receptor-like proteins (RLPs). These RLPs recognize specific SSP effectors to initiate a hypersensitive response (HR) that renders the pathogen avirulent. C. fulvum strains capable of overcoming one or more of all cloned Cf genes have now emerged. To combat these strains, new Cf genes are required. An effectoromics approach was employed to identify wild tomato accessions carrying new Cf genes. Proteomics and transcriptome sequencing were first used to identify 70 apoplastic in planta-induced C. fulvum SSPs. Based on sequence homology, 61 of these SSPs were novel or lacked known functional domains. Seven, however, had predicted structural homology to antimicrobial proteins, suggesting a possible role in mediating antagonistic microbe-microbe interactions in planta. Wild tomato accessions were then screened for HR-associated recognition of 41 SSPs using the Potato virus X-based transient expression system. Nine SSPs were recognized by one or more accessions, suggesting that these plants carry new Cf genes available for incorporation into cultivated tomato.",

    "abstract": "Farming was first introduced to southeastern Europe in the mid-7th millennium BCE - brought by migrants from Anatolia who settled in the region before spreading throughout Europe. To clarify the dynamics of the interaction between the first farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherers where they first met, we analyze genome-wide ancient DNA data from 223 individuals who lived in southeastern Europe and surrounding regions between 12,000 and 500 BCE. We document previously uncharacterized genetic structure, showing a West-East cline of ancestry in hunter-gatherers, and show that some Aegean farmers had ancestry from a different lineage than the northwestern Anatolian lineage that formed the overwhelming ancestry of other European farmers. We show that the first farmers of northern and western Europe passed through southeastern Europe with limited admixture with local hunter-gatherers, but that some groups mixed extensively, with relatively sex-balanced admixture compared to the male-biased hunter-gatherer admixture that prevailed later in the North and West. Southeastern Europe continued to be a nexus between East and West after farming arrived, with intermittent genetic contact from the Steppe up to 2,000 years before the migration that replaced much of northern Europes population.",

    "abstract": "At synapses throughout the mammalian brain, AMPA receptors form complexes with auxiliary proteins, including TARPs. However, how TARPs modulate AMPA receptor gating remains poorly understood. We built structural models of TARP-AMPA receptor complexes for TARPs {gamma}2 and {gamma}8, combining recent structural studies and de novo structure predictions. These models, combined with peptide binding assays, provide evidence for multiple interactions between GluA2 and variable extracellular loops of TARPs. Substitutions and deletions of these loops had surprisingly rich effects on the kinetics of glutamate-activated currents, without any effect on assembly. Critically, by altering the two interacting loops of {gamma}2 and {gamma}8, we could entirely remove all allosteric modulation of GluA2, without affecting formation of AMPA receptor-TARP complexes. Likewise, substitutions in the linker domains of GluA2 completely removed any effect of Y2 on receptor kinetics, indicating a dominant role for this previously overlooked site proximal to the AMPA receptor channel gate.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of a host-pathogen interaction is determined by the conditions of the host, the pathogen, and the environment. Although numerous proteomic studies of in vitro-grown microbial pathogens have been performed, in vivo proteomic approaches are still rare. In addition, increasing evidence supports that in vitro studies inadequately reflect in vivo conditions. Choosing the proper host is essential to detect the expression of proteins from the pathogen in vivo. Numerous studies have demonstrated the suitability of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model to in vivo studies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. In most zebrafish-pathogen studies, infection is achieved by microinjection of bacteria into the larvae. However, few reports using static immersion of bacterial pathogens have been published. In this study we infected 3 days post-fertilization (DPF) zebrafish larvae with P. aeruginosa PAO1 by immersion and injection and tracked the in vivo immune response by the zebrafish. Additionally, by using non-isotopic (Q-exactive) metaproteomics we simultaneously evaluated the proteomic response of the pathogen (P. aeruginosa PAO1) and the host (zebrafish). We found some zebrafish metabolic pathways, such as hypoxia response via HIF activation pathway, exclusively enriched in the larvae exposed by static immersion. In contrast, we found that inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways was exclusively enriched in the larvae exposed by injection, while the integrin signaling pathway and angiogenesis were solely enriched in the larvae exposed by immersion. We also found important virulence factors from P. aeruginosa that were enriched only after exposure by injection, such as the Type-III secretion system and flagella-associated proteins. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa proteins involved in processes like biofilm formation, cellular responses to antibiotic and starvation were enriched exclusively after an exposure by immersion.\\n\\nWe demonstrated the suitability of zebrafish embryos as a model for in vivo host-pathogen based proteomic studies in P. aeruginosa. Our global proteomic profiling identifies novel molecular signatures that give systematic insight into zebrafish-Pseudomonas interaction.",

    "abstract": "Sweetpotato is among the most important root-crops worldwide, particularly in developing countries, and its production is affected severely by a variety of virus diseases. During the last decade a number of new viruses have been discovered in sweetpotatoes from different continents through next generation sequencing studies, among them belonging to the genus Badnavirus and collectively assigned to the species Sweet potato pakkakuy virus (SPPV). We determined the complete genome sequence of two SPPV isolates and show the ubiquitous presence of similar viruses in germplasm and field material from around the globe. We show SPPV is not integrated into the sweetpotato genome, occurs only at extremely low titers but is nevertheless efficiently transmitted through seeds and cuttings. They are unaffected by virus elimination therapy and lack any discernible symptoms in sweetpotatoes or indicator host plants. Nevertheless, they show considerable variation in their nucleotide sequences and correspond to several genetic lineages. Studies of their interaction with the two most important sweetpotato viruses showed only limited synergistic increase in the titres of one of two SPPV isolates. We contend that these viruses may pose little threat to sweetpotato production and more likely represent a new type of persistent virus in a possibly commensal or mutualistic relationship with sweetpotato.\\n\\nImportanceNext generation sequencing approaches have in the last few years led to the discovery of many virus like sequences in different crop plants including sweetpotatoes. The significance of such discoveries can sometimes be elusive when they have not been associated with specific symptoms due to mixed infections or have been found in apparently healthy plants. Badnavirus sequences found in sweetpotatoes provide a typical case. Considering they have now been reported globally, it was important to determine how common these viruses are and what their possible impact may be on sweetpotato production. The significance of our research lies in resolving the case of badnaviruses, providing evidence they represent a new type of vertically transmitted persistent and apparently harmless episomal viruses living in a state of commensalism with their host.",
