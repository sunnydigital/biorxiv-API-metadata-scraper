    "abstract": "The birth of genes that encode new protein sequences is a major source of evolutionary innovation. However, we still understand relatively little about how these genes come into being and which functions they are selected for. To address these questions we have obtained a large collection of mammalian-specific gene families that lack homologues in other eukaryotic groups. We have combined gene annotations and de novo transcript assemblies from 30 different mamalian species, obtaining about 6,000 gene families. In general, the proteins in mammalian-specific gene families tend to be short and depleted in aromatic and negatively charged residues. Proteins which arose early in mammalian evolution include milk and skin polypeptides, immune response components, and proteins involved in reproduction. In contrast, the functions of proteins which have a more recent origin remain largely unknown, despite the fact that these proteins also have extensive proteomics support. We identify several previously described cases of genes originated de novo from non-coding genomic regions, supporting the idea that this mechanism frequently underlies the evolution of new protein-coding genes in mammals. Finally, we show that most young mammalian genes are preferentially expressed in testis, suggesting that sexual selection plays an important role in the emergence of new functional genes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular signatures of Yersinia pestis were recently identified in prehistoric Eurasian individuals, thus suggesting Y. pestis caused some form of disease in humans prior to the first historically documented pandemic. Here, we present six new Y. pestis genomes spanning from the European Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age (LNBA) dating from 4,800 to 3,700 BP. We show that all currently investigated LNBA strains form a single genetic clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny that appears to be extinct. Interpreting our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence, which suggests an increase in human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the spread of Y. pestis during the LNBA: Y. pestis may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia during an expansion of steppe people, persisted within Europe until the mid Bronze Age, and moved back towards Central Eurasia in parallel with subsequent human population movements.",

    "abstract": "Molecular heterogeneity in tumours leads to variability in drug response both between patients and across lesions within a patient. These sources of variability could be explored through analysis of routinely collected clinical trial imaging data. We applied a mathematical model of tumour growth to analyse both within and between patient variability in tumour size dynamics to clinical data from three drugs, Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and Trametinib, used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The analysis revealed: 1) existence of homogeneity in drug response and resistance development within a patient; 2) tumour shrinkage rate does not relate to rate of resistance development; 3) Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib, two BRAF inhibitors, have different variability in tumour shrinkage rates. Overall these results show how analysis of the dynamics of individual lesions can shed light on the within and between patient differences in tumour shrinkage and resistance rates, which could be used to gain a macroscopic understanding of tumour heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Here we report the findings from the first two years of an arbovirus surveillance study conducted in Machala, Ecuador, a dengue endemic region (2014-2015). Patients with suspected dengue virus (DENV) infections (index cases, n=324) were referred from five Ministry of Health clinical sites. A subset of DENV positive index cases (n = 44) were selected, and individuals from the index household and four neighboring homes within 200-meters were recruited (n = 400). Individuals who entered the study, other than index cases, are referred to as associates. In 2014, 70.9% of index cases and 35.6% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. In 2015, 28.3% of index cases and 12.8% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. For every DENV infection captured by passive surveillance, we detected an additional three acute or recent DENV infections in associates. Of associates with acute DENV infections, 68% reported dengue-like symptoms, with the highest prevalence of symptomatic acute infections in children under 10 years of age. The first chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections were detected on epidemiological week 12 in 2015. 43.1% of index cases and 3.5% of associates had acute CHIKV infections. No Zika virus infections were detected. Phylogenetic analyses of isolates of DENV from 2014 revealed genetic relatedness and shared ancestry of DENV1, DENV2 and DENV4 genomes from Ecuador with those from Venezuela and Colombia, indicating presence of viral flow between Ecuador and surrounding countries. Enhanced surveillance studies, such as this, provide high-resolution data on symptomatic and inapparent infections across the population.",

    "abstract": "A recurrent question within oncology drug development is predicting phase III outcome for a new treatment using early clinical data. One approach to tackle this problem has been to derive metrics from mathematical models that describe tumour size dynamics termed re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth. They have shown to be strong predictors of overall survival in numerous studies but there is debate about how these metrics are derived and if they are more predictive than empirical end-points. This work explores the issues raised in using model-derived metric as predictors for survival analyses. Re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth were calculated for three large clinical studies by forward and reverse alignment. The latter involves re-aligning patients to their time of progression. Hence it accounts for the time taken to estimate re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth but also assesses if these predictors correlate to survival from the time of progression. We found that neither re-growth rate nor time to tumour re-growth correlated to survival using reverse alignment. This suggests that the dynamics of tumours up until disease progression has no relationship to survival post progression. For prediction of a phase III trial we found the metrics performed no better than empirical end-points. These results highlight that care must be taken when relating dynamics of tumour imaging to survival and that bench-marking new approaches to existing ones is essential.",

    "abstract": "Drones are rapidly becoming a key part of the toolkit for a range of scientific disciplines, as well as a range of management and commercial applications. This presents a number of challenges in context of how drone use might impact nearby wildlife. Interactions between birds and drones naturally come to mind, since they share the airspace. This paper details initial findings on the interactions between drones and birds for a range of waterbird, passerine and raptor species, across of a range of scientific applications and natural environments. The primary aims of this paper are to provide guidance for those planning or undertaking drone monitoring exercises, as well as provide direction for future research into safe and effective monitoring with drones. Our study sites we all located within Australia and spanned a range of arid, semi-arid, dunefield, floodplain, wetland, woodland, forest, coastal heath and urban environments. We particularly focus on behavioral changes towards drones during breeding season, interactions with raptors, and effects on nesting birds in large colonies - three areas yet to be explored in published literature. In over 70 hours of flight, there were no incidents with birds. Although some aggressive behavior was encountered from solitary breeding birds. Several large breeding bird colonies were surveyed, and included in our observations is monitoring and counting of nests in a colony of over 200,000 Straw-necked Ibis, the largest drone-based bird monitoring exercise to date. In addition to providing observations of interactions with specific bird species, we recommend procedures for flight planning, safe flying and avoidance. This paper also provides a basis for a number of critical and emerging areas of research into bird-drone interactions, most notably, territorial breeding birds, safety around large raptors, and the effect of drones on the behaviour of birds in large breeding colonies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.If protein sequences are recoded with a binary alphabet derived from a division of the 20 amino acids into two subsets, a protein can be identified from its subsequences by searching through a recoded sequence database. A binary-coded primary sequence can be obtained for an unbroken protein molecule from current blockades in a nanopore. Only two (instead of 20) blockade levels need to be recognized to identify a residues subset; a hard or soft detector can do this with two current thresholds. Computations were done on the complete proteome of Helicobacter pylori (http://www.uniprot.org; database id UP000000210, 1553 sequences) using a binary alphabet based on published data for residue volumes in the range [~]0.06 nm3 to [~]0.225 nm3. Assuming normally distributed volumes, more than 93% of binary subsequences of length 20 from the primary sequences of H. pylori are correct with a confidence level of 90-95%; they can uniquely identify over 98% of the proteins. Recently published work shows that a 0.7 nm diameter nanopore can measure residue volume with a resolution of [~]0.07 nm3; this makes the procedure described here both feasible and practical. This is a non-destructive single-molecule method without the vagaries of proteolysis.",

While studied extensively at the transcriptome level, much less is known about protein dynamics. Here, we measured mRNA and protein levels of 7459 genes during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This comprehensive data set revealed pervasive discordance between mRNA and protein. The high temporal resolution of the data made it possible to determine protein turnover rates genome-wide by fitting a kinetic model. This model further enabled us to systematically identify dynamic post-transcriptional regulation. Moreover, we linked different modes of regulation to the function of specific gene sets. Finally, we showed that the kinetic model can be applied to singlecell transcriptomics data to predict protein levels in differentiated cell types. In conclusion, our comprehensive data set, easily accessible through a web application, is a valuable resource for the discovery of post-transcriptional regulation in ESC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measure to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table, which decomposes the total and global variance into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each variance component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variance and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.",

In this study, we examine all commonly occurring missense mutations in HTT to identify potential human modifiers of HTT PTMs relevant to HD biology. We reveal a SNP that modifies post-translational myristoylation of HTT, resulting in downstream alterations to toxic HTT proteolysis in human cells. This is the first SNP shown to functionally modify a PTM in HD and the first validated genetic modifier of post-translational myristoylation.

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian clock is a critical regulator of metabolism and cell division. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that systemic disruption of the circadian clock can promote cancer, whether the clock is disrupted in primary human tumors is unknown. Here we used transcriptome data from mice to define a signature of the mammalian circadian clock based on the co-expression of 12 genes that form the core clock or are directly controlled by the clock. Our approach can be applied to samples that are not labeled with time of day and were not acquired over the entire circadian (24-h) cycle. We validated the clock signature in transcriptome data from healthy human tissues, then developed a metric we call the delta clock correlation distance ({Delta}CCD) to describe the extent to which the signature is perturbed in samples from one condition relative to another. We calculated the {Delta}CCD comparing human tumor and non-tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and eight independent datasets, discovering widespread dysregulation of clock gene co-expression in tumor samples. Subsequent analysis of data from clock gene knockouts in mice suggested that clock dysregulation in human cancer is not caused solely by loss of activity of clock genes. Furthermore, by analyzing a large set of genes previously inferred to be rhythmic in healthy human lung, we found that dysregulation of the clock in human lung cancer is accompanied by dysregulation of broader patterns of circadian co-expression. Our findings suggest that clock dysregulation is a common means by which human cancers achieve unrestrained growth and division, and that restoring clock function could be a viable therapeutic strategy in multiple cancer types. In addition, our approach opens the door to using publicly available transcriptome data to quantify clock disruption in a multitude of human phenotypes.

    "abstract": "The quantitative characterization of bacterial growth has attracted substantial research attention since Monods pioneering study. Theoretical and experimental work have uncovered several laws for describing the exponential growth phase, in which the number of cells grows exponentially. However, microorganism growth also exhibits lag, stationary, and death phases under starvation conditions, in which cell growth is highly suppressed, for which quantitative laws or theories are markedly underdeveloped. In fact, the models commonly adopted for the exponential phase that consist of autocatalytic chemical components, including ribosomes, can only show exponential growth or decay in a population, and thus phases that halt growth are not realized. Here, we propose a simple, coarse-grained cell model that includes an extra class of macromolecular components in addition to the autocatalytic active components that facilitate cellular growth. These extra components form a complex with the active components to inhibit the catalytic process. Depending on the nutrient condition, the model exhibits the typical transitions among the lag, exponential, stationary, and death phases. Furthermore, the lag time needed for growth recovery after starvation follows the square root of the starvation time and is inversely related to the maximal growth rate. This is in agreement with experimental observations, in which the length of time of cell starvation is memorized in the slow accumulation of molecules. Moreover, the lag time distributed among cells is skewed with a long time tail. If the starvation time is longer, an exponential tail appears, which is also consistent with experimental data. Our theory further predicts a strong dependence of lag time on the speed of substrate depletion, which can be tested experimentally. The present model and theoretical analysis provide universal growth laws beyond the exponential phase, offering insight into how cells halt growth without entering the death phase.",

Genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species would promote investigation of genetic mechanisms that underpin plastic responses to environmental stress, such as climate warming. Moreover, such resources would aid comparative studies of complex traits at the molecular level, such as the transition from oviparous to viviparous reproduction, which happened at least four times within Sceloporus.\\n\\nFindingsA de novo transcriptome assembly for Sceloporus undulatus, Sund_v1.0, was generated using over 179 million Illumina reads obtained from three tissues (whole brain, skeletal muscle, and embryo) as well as previously reported liver sequences. The Sund_v1.0 assembly had an average contig length of 782 nucleotides and an E90N50 statistic of 2,550 nucleotides. Comparing S. undulatus transcripts with the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) for tetrapod species yielded 97.2% gene representation. A total of 13,422 protein-coding orthologs were identified in comparison to the genome of the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, which is the closest related species with genomic data available.\\n\\nConclusionsThe multi-tissue transcriptome of S. undulatus is the first for a member of the family Phrynosomatidae, offering an important resource to advance studies of adaptation in this species and genomic research in reptiles.",

    "abstract": "Non-equilibrium demography impacts coalescent genealogies leaving detectable, well-studied signatures of variation. However, similar genomic footprints are also expected under models of large reproductive skew, posing a serious problem when trying to make inference. Furthermore, current approaches consider only one of the two processes at a time, neglecting any genomic signal that could arise from their simultaneous effects, preventing the possibility of jointly inferring parameters relating to both offspring distribution and population history. Here, we develop an extended Moran model with exponential population growth, and demonstrate that the underlying ancestral process converges to a time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent. However, by applying a non-linear change of time scale - analogous to the Kingman coalescent - we find that the ancestral process can be rescaled to its time-homogeneous analogue, allowing the process to be simulated quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the expected site-frequency spectrum under the time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent and develop an approximate-likelihood framework for the joint estimation of the coalescent and growth parameters. By means of extensive simulation, we demonstrate that both can be estimated accurately given linkage equilibrium, while linkage disequilibrium systematically biases growth rate estimates. In addition, not accounting for demography can lead to serious biases in the inferred coalescent model, with broad implications for genomic studies ranging from ecology to conservation biology. Finally, we use our method to analyze sequence data from Japanese sardine populations and find evidence of high variation in individual reproductive success, but few signs of a recent demographic expansion.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in massively parallel single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is paving the way for high-resolution single cell profiling of biological samples. In most scRNA-seq studies, only a small fraction of the transcripts present in each cell are sequenced. The efficiency, that is, the proportion of transcripts in the cell that are sequenced, can be especially low in highly parallelized experiments where the number of reads allocated for each cell is small. This leads to unreliable quantification of lowly and moderately expressed genes, resulting in extremely sparse data and hindering downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce SAVER (Single-cell Analysis Via Expression Recovery), an expression recovery method for scRNA-seq that borrows information across genes and cells to impute the zeros as well as to improve the expression estimates for all genes. We show, by comparison to RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and by data down-sampling experiments, that SAVER reliably recovers cell-specific gene expression concentrations, cross-cell gene expression distributions, and gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell correlations. This improves the power and accuracy of any downstream analysis involving genes with low to moderate expression.",

Identifying the amyloid-prone regions within protein sequences is important both for understanding the mechanisms of amyloid-associated diseases and for understanding functional amyloids. Based on the crystal structures of seven cross-{beta} amyloidogenic peptides with different topologies and one recently solved cross- fiber structure, we have developed a computational approach for identifying amyloidogenic segments in protein sequences using the Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model. The AWSEM-Amylometer performs favorably in comparison with other predictors in predicting aggregation-prone sequences in multiple datasets. The method also predicts the specific topologies (the relative arrangement of {beta}-strands in the core) of the amyloid fibrils well. An important advantage of the AWSEM-Amylometer over other existing methods is its direct connection with an efficient, optimized protein folding simulation model, AWSEM. This connection allows one to combine efficient and accurate search of protein sequences for amyloidogenic segments with the detailed study of the thermodynamic and kinetic roles that these segments play in folding and aggregation in the context of the entire protein sequence. We present new simulation results that highlight the free energy landscapes of peptides that can take on multiple fibril topologies. We also demonstrate how the Amylometer methodology can be straightforwardly extended to the study of functional amyloids that have the recently discovered cross- fibril architecture.",

HTS-DNA-SIP has enormous potential to reveal patterns of carbon and nitrogen exchange within microbial food webs. A current limitation is that, due to the expense of these experiments, it has been impossible to evaluate the accuracy of DNA-SIP methods. We have developed a model that simulates DNA-SIP data, and we use the model to systematically evaluate and validate the accuracy of DNA-SIP analyses. This model can determine the analytical accuracy of DNA-SIP experiments in a range of contexts. Furthermore, the ability to predict experimental outcomes, as a function of experimental design and community characteristics, should be of great use in the design and interpretation DNA-SIP experiments.\\n\\nSummaryDNA Stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) is a powerful method that identifies in situ isotope assimilation by microbial taxa. Combining DNA-SIP with multiplexed high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS-DNA-SIP) creates the potential to map in situ assimilation dynamics for thousands of microbial taxonomic units. However, the accuracy of methods for analyzing DNA-SIP data has never been evaluated. We have developed a toolset (SIPSim) for simulating HTS-DNA-SIP datasets and evaluating the accuracy of methods for analyzing HTS-DNA-SIP data. We evaluated two different approaches to analyzing HTS-DNA-SIP data: \\\"high resolution stable isotope probing\\\" (HR-SIP) and \\\"quantitative stable isotope probing\\\" (q-SIP). HR-SIP was highly specific and moderately sensitive, with very few false positives but potential for false negatives. In contrast, q-SIP had fewer false negatives but many false positives. We also found HR-SIP more robust than q-SIP with respect to experimental variance. Furthermore, we found that the detection sensitivity of HTS-DNA-SIP can be increased without compromising specificity by evaluating evidence of isotope incorporation over multiple windows of buoyant density (MW-HR-SIP). SIPSim provides a platform for determining the accuracy of HTS-DNA-SIP methods across a range of experimental parameters, which will be useful in the design, analysis, and validation of DNA-SIP experiments.",

    "abstract": "Moving animal groups such as schools of fish or flocks of birds often undergo sudden collective changes of their travelling direction as a consequence of stochastic fluctuations in heading of the individuals. However, the mechanisms by which these behavioural fluctuations arise at the individual level and propagate within a group are still unclear. In the present study, we combine an experimental and theoretical approach to investigate spontaneous collective U-turns in groups of rummy-nose tetra (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) swimming in a ring-shaped tank. U-turns imply that fish switch their heading between the clockwise and anticlockwise direction. We reconstruct trajectories of individuals moving alone and in groups of different sizes. We show that the group decreases its swimming speed before a collective U-turn. This is in agreement with previous theoretical predictions showing that speed decrease facilitates an amplification of fluctuations in heading in the group, which can trigger U-turns. These collective U-turns are mostly initiated by individuals at the front of the group. Once an individual has initiated a U-turn, the new direction propagates through the group from front to back without amplification or dampening, resembling the dynamics of falling dominoes. The mean time between collective U-turns sharply increases as the size of the group increases. We develop an Ising spin model integrating anisotropic and asymmetrical interactions between fish and their tendency to follow the majority of their neighbours nonlinearly (social conformity). The model quantitatively reproduces key features of the dynamics and the frequency of collective U-turns observed in experiments.",

We then propose that the AES extrudes from the sides and tips of distinct families of small ducts, apparently by buckling of the thinning luminal epithelium into the surrounding mesenchyme, stabilized firstly by rings of elastin and later by rings of collagen and elastin fibers, that surround the mouth of each distal unit of the AES. We propose this mechanism as a parsimonious solution to achieving the optimum form, packing density and functional efficiency of the AES, while allowing sufficient space between for the plumbing of conducting airways, pulsatile capillary blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves and other key matrix and cellular components within the interstitial mesenchyme.\\n\\nAbstractHerein we show, using several novel imaging and computational approaches, how the air exchange units (AEUs) of the lung develop from the tips and sides of distinct families of tortuous ducts, that themselves ramify as distinct families distal to the bronchoalveolar duct junctions (BADJs), prenatally in humans but postnatally in mice. The mature AEUs thus consist of indented spheroids tightly packed between quite regularly spaced distal ducts. Since the diameter of the BADJs and the distal ducts increases rather than decreasing during the formation of AEUs, we further deduce that the AEUs must form by circular epithelial precursor buckling at their mouths with reulsting extrusion of their lumen into the surrounding mesenchyme, stabilized firstly by interlocking rings of elastin and later by rings of elastin and collagen fibers surrounding the mouth of each of the prospective AEUs. Furthermore, we show that the surface of each of the AEUs is highly rugose, being indented by the capillary network that lies close beneath the AES membranes. We propose that, the kissing theorem proposed of Newton tha expresses the number of times billiard balls may touch within their frame is a parsimonious solution to achieving optimum packing of the distal AES unit spaces, while allowing sufficient space between them to allow for conducting airways, closely applied pulsatile capillary blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves and other key components of the interstitial mesenchyme.",

    "abstract": "Accurate typing of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), a histocompatibility test, is important because HLA genes play various roles in immune responses, and have also been shown to be associated with many diseases such as cancer. The current gold standard for HLA typing uses DNA sequencing technology combined with sequence enrichment techniques using specially designed primers or probes, causing it to be slow and labor-intensive. Although there exist enrichment-free computational methods that use various types of sequencing data, hyper-polymorphism found in HLA region of the human genome makes it challenging to type HLA genes with high accuracy from whole genome sequencing data. Furthermore, these methods are database-matching approaches where their output is inherently limited by the completeness of already known types, forcing them to find the best matching known alleles from a database, thereby causing them to be unsuitable for discovery of rare or novel alleles. In order to ensure both high accuracy as well as the ability to type novel alleles, we have developed a graph-guided assembly technique for classical HLA genes, which is capable of assembling phased, full-length haplotype sequences of typing exons given high-coverage (>30-fold) whole genome sequencing data. Our method delivers highly accurate HLA typing, comparable to the current state-of-the-art database-matching methods. We also demonstrate that our method can type novel alleles by experimenting on various data including simulated, Illumina Platinum Genomes, and 1000 Genomes data.",

We compare such criteria within the framework of the PC algorithm, a popular network inference algorithm for directed acyclic dependency graphs. We also propose and evaluate a method to apply unconditional independence criteria to assess conditional independence and a method to simulate data with desired properties from experimental data. Our main finding is that a recently proposed criterion based on distance covariance performs well compared to other independence criteria in terms of error rates, speed of computation, and need of fine-tuning parameters when applied to experimental biological datasets.",

This algorithm attempts to bridge the gap between fast \\\"mapping\\\" algorithms and more traditional alignment procedures.\\n\\nResultsWe adopt a hybrid approach that is able to increase mapping accuracy while still retaining much of the efficiency of fast mapping algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a new approach that explores the candidate search space with high sensitivity as well as a collection of carefully-engineered heuristics to efficiently filter these candidates. Additionally, unlike the strategies adopted in most aligners which first align the ends of paired-end reads independently, we introduce a notion of co-mapping. This procedure exploits relevant information between the \\\"hits\\\" from the left and right ends of paired-end reads before full alignments or mappings for each are generated, which improves the efficiency of filtering likely-spurious alignments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of selective alignment in improving the accuracy of efficient transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq reads. Specifically, we show that selective-alignment is able to resolve certain complex mapping scenarios that can confound existing fast mapping procedures, while simultaneously eliminating spurious alignments that fast mapping approaches can produce.\\n\\nAvailabilitySelective-alignment is implemented in C++11 as a part of Salmon, and is available as open source software, under GPL v3, at: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/selective-alignment\\n\\nContactrob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu",

    "abstract": "In embryos, multipotent progenitors divide to produce distinct progeny and express their full potential. In vertebrates, multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors produce second-heart-field-derived cardiomyocytes, and branchiomeric skeletal head muscles. However, the mechanisms underlying these early fate choices remain largely elusive. The tunicate Ciona emerged as an attractive model to study early cardiopharyngeal development at high resolution: through two asymmetric and oriented divisions, defined cardiopharyngeal progenitors produce distinct first and second heart precursors, and pharyngeal muscle (aka atrial siphon muscle, ASM) precursors. Here, we demonstrate that differential FGF-MAPK signaling distinguishes between heart and ASM precursors. We characterize a feed-forward circuit that promotes the successive activations of essential ASM determinants, Hand-related, Tbx1/10 and Ebf. Finally, we show that coupling FGF-MAPK restriction and cardiopharyngeal network deployment with cell divisions defines the timing of gene expression and permits the emergence of diverse cell types from multipotent progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Genetic coding is generally thought to have required ribozymes whose functions were taken over by polypeptide aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). Two discoveries about aaRS and their tRNA substrates now furnish a unifying rationale for the opposite conclusion: that the key processes of the Central Dogma of molecular biology emerged simultaneously and naturally from simple origins in a peptide*RNA partnership, eliminating the epistemological need for a prior RNA world. First, the two aaRS classes likely arose from opposite strands of the same ancestral gene, implying a simple genetic alphabet. Inversion symmetries in aaRS structural biology arising from genetic complementarity would have stabilized the initial and subsequent differentiation of coding specificities and hence rapidly promoted diversity in the proteome. Second, amino acid physical chemistry maps onto tRNA identity elements, establishing reflexivity in protein aaRS. Bootstrapping of increasingly detailed coding is thus intrinsic to polypeptide aaRS, but impossible in an RNA world. These notions underline the following concepts that contradict gradual replacement of ribozymal aaRS by polypeptide aaRS: (i) any set of aaRS must be interdependent; (ii) reflexivity intrinsic to polypeptide aaRS production dynamics promotes bootstrapping; (iii) takeover of RNA-catalyzed aminoacylation by enzymes will necessarily degrade specificity; (iv) the Central Dogmas emergence is most probable when replication and translation error rates remain comparable. These characteristics are necessary and sufficient for the essentially de novo emergence of a coupled gene-replicase-translatase system of genetic coding that would have continuously preserved the functional meaning of genetically encoded protein genes whose phylogenetic relationships match those observed today.",

    "abstract": "The ability of organisms to adaptively respond to environmental changes (evolvability) is usually considered to be an important advantage in interspecific competition. It has been suggested, however, that evolvability could be a double-edged sword that could present a serious handicap in fluctuating environments. The authors of this counterintuitive idea have published only verbal models to support their claims.\\n\\nHere we present the results of individual-based stochastic modelling of competition between two asexual species differing only by their evolvability. They show that, in changeable environments, less evolvable species could outperform their more evolvable competitors in a broad area of a parameter space, regardless of whether the conditions fluctuated periodically or aperiodically. Highly evolvable species prospered better nearly all the time; however, they sustained a higher probability of extinction during rare events of the rapid transient change of conditions.\\n\\nOur results offer an explanation of why sexually reproducing species, with their reduced capacity to respond adaptively to local or temporal environmental changes, prevail in most eukaryotic taxa in nearly all biotopes on the surface of Earth. These species may suffer several important disadvantages in direct competitive battles with asexual species; however, they might win in changeable environments in the more important sorting-according-to-stability war.",

Quantitative characteristics of long RNA-seq have been extensively described, but small RNA-seq involves fundamentally different methods for library preparation, with distinct protocols and technical variations that have not been fully and systematically studied. We report here the results of a study using common references (synthetic RNA pools of defined composition, as well as plasma-derived RNA) to evaluate the accuracy, reproducibility and bias of small RNA-seq library preparation for five distinct protocols and across nine different laboratories. We observed protocol-specific and sequence-specific bias, which was ameliorated using adapters for ligation with randomized end-nucleotides, and computational correction factors. Despite this technical bias, relative quantification using small RNA-seq was remarkably accurate and reproducible, even across multiple laboratories using different methods. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of reproducible cross-laboratory small RNA-seq studies, even those involving analysis of data generated using different protocols.",

    "abstract": "Although the majority of patients with Lyme disease can be cured with the standard 2-4 week antibiotic treatment, about 10-20% of patients continue to suffer from post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is debated, one possibility is due to persisters not killed by the current Lyme antibiotics. It has been reported that essential oils have antimicrobial activities and some have been used by patients with persisting Lyme disease symptoms. However, the activity of essential oils against the causative agent Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) has not been carefully studied. Here, we evaluated the activity of 34 essential oils against B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture as a model for persisters. We found that many essential oils had varying degrees of activity against B. burgdorferi, with top 5 essential oils (oregano, cinnamon bark, clove bud, citronella, and wintergreen) at a low concentration of 0.25% showing more activity than the persister drug daptomycin. Interestingly, some highly active essential oils were found to have excellent anti-biofilm ability as shown by their ability to dissolve the aggregated biofilm-like structures. The top 3 hits, oregano, cinnamon bark and clove bud, completely eradicated all viable cells without regrowth in subculture. Carvacrol was found to be the most active ingredient of oregano oil showing excellent activity against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells, while p-cymene and -terpinene had no apparent activity. Future studies are needed to characterize and optimize the active essential oils in drug combinations in vitro and in vivo for improved treatment of persistent Lyme disease.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThere is a huge need for effective treatment of patients with Lyme disease who suffer from PTLDS. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that B. burgdorferi develops persisters that are not killed by the current Lyme antibiotics as a possible contributor to this condition. Although essential oils are used by patients with Lyme disease with variable improvement in symptoms, their anti-borrelia activity has not been carefully studied. Here we found that not all essential oils have adequate anti-borrelia activity and identified some highly potent essential oils (oregano, cinnamon bark, clove bud) that have even higher anti-persister and anti-biofilm activity than the persister drug daptomycin. Carvacrol was found to be the most active ingredient of oregano oil and have the potential to serve as a promising oral persister drug. Our findings may have implications for developing improved treatment of persisting Lyme disease.",

    "abstract": "Hookworm infection is a major tropical parasitic disease affecting almost 500 million people worldwide. These soil-transmitted helminths can survive for many years in the intestine of the host, where they feed on blood, causing iron deficiency anaemia and other complications. To avoid the hosts immune response the parasite releases excretory/secretory products (ESPs), a complex mixture of glycans, lipids and proteins that represent the major host-parasite interface. Using a combination of separation techniques such as SDS-PAGE and OFFGEL electrophoresis, in combination with state-of-the-art mass spectrometry we have reanalysed the dog hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, ESPs (AcES). We identified 315 proteins present in the AcES, compared with just 105 identified in previous studies. The most highly represented family of proteins is the SCP/TAPs (90 of the 315 proteins), and the most abundant constituents of AcES are homologues of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMP) family. We identified putative vaccine candidates and proteins that could have immunomodulatory effects for treating inflammatory diseases. This study provides novel information about the proteins involved in host-hookworm interactions, and constitutes a comprehensive dataset for the development of vaccines and the discovery of new immunoregulatory biologics.",

Although bacteria influence everything from nutrition and metabolism to cell biology and development in eukaryotes, bacterial regulation of eukaryotic mating was unexpected. Here we show that a single V. fischeri protein, the previously uncharacterized EroS, fully recapitulates the aphrodisiac activity of live V. fischeri. EroS is a chondroitin lyase; although its substrate, chondroitin sulfate, was previously thought to be an animal synapomorphy, we demonstrate that S. rosetta produces chondroitin sulfate and thus extend the ancestry of this important glycosaminoglycan to the premetazoan era. Finally, we show that V. fischeri, purified EroS, and other bacterial chondroitin lyases induce S. rosetta mating at environmentally-relevant concentrations suggesting that bacterially-produced aphrodisiacs likely regulate choanoflagellate mating in nature.",

Current models of the spatial and temporal structure of fcMRI based connectivity contain strong a priori assumptions. We report that low temporal frequency fMRI signal synchrony within the local (3 mm radius) neighborhood of a location on the cortical surface strongly predicts the scale of its global functional connectivity. This relationship is tested vertex-wise across the cortex using Spearmans rank order correlation on an individual subject basis. Furthermore, this relationship is shown to be dynamically preserved across repeated within session scans. These results provide a model free data driven method to visualize and quantitatively analyze patterns of connectivity at the imaging voxel resolution across the entire cortex on an individual subject basis.

Finding the right balance between the two is important for controlling overall cortical excitation and network dynamics. However, it is unclear how the correct number of cortical interneurons (CIs) is established in the mammalian forebrain. CIs are generated in excess from basal forebrain progenitors and their final numbers are adjusted via an intrinsically determined program of apoptosis that takes place during an early postnatal window. Here, we provide evidence that the extent of CI apoptosis during this critical period is plastic, cell type specific and can be reduced in a cell autonomous manner by acute increases in neuronal activity. We propose that the physiological state of the emerging neural network controls the activity levels of local CIs to modulate their numbers in a homeostatic manner.",

    "abstract": "The motor system prepares for movements well in advance of their execution. In the gaze control system, premotor neurons that produce a burst of activity for the movement are also active leading up to the saccade. The dynamics of preparatory neural activity have been well described by stochastic accumulator models, and variability in the accumulation dynamics has been shown to be correlated with reaction times of the eventual saccade, but it is unclear whether this activity is purely preparatory in nature or has features indicative of a hidden movement command. We explicitly tested whether preparatory neural activity in premotor neurons of the primate superior colliculus has \\\"motor potential\\\". We removed inhibition on the saccadic system using reflex blinks, which turn off downstream gating, and found that saccades can be initiated before underlying activity reaches levels seen under normal conditions. Accumulating low-frequency activity was predictive of eye movement dynamics tens of milliseconds in advance of the actual saccade, indicating the presence of a latent movement command. We also show that reaching threshold is not a necessary condition for movement initiation, contrary to the postulates of accumulation-to-threshold models. The results bring into question extant models of saccade generation and support the possibility of a concurrent representation for movement preparation and generation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHow the brain plans for upcoming actions before deciding to initiate them is a central question in neuroscience. Popular theories suggest that movement planning and execution occur in serial stages, separated by a decision boundary in neural activity space (e.g., \\\"threshold\\\"), which needs to be crossed before the movement is executed. By removing inhibitory gating on the motor system, we show here that the activity required to initiate a saccade can be flexibly modulated. We also show that evolving activity during movement planning is a hidden motor command. The results have important implications for our understanding of how movements are generated, in addition to providing useful information for decoding movement intention based on planning-related activity.\\n\\nImpact StatementNon-invasive disinhibition of the oculomotor system shows that ongoing preparatory activity in the superior colliculus has movement-generating potential and need not rise to threshold in order to produce a saccade.",

Ongoing neuronal activity is susceptible to the modulation of synaptic activity and membrane potentials. This susceptibility leverages transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for neuroplastic interventions. Through neuromodulation of phasic, neural activity, tACS presents a powerful tool for investigations of the neural correlates of cognition alongside other forms of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) and noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). The rapid pace of development in this area requires clarification of best practices.

    "abstract": "The balance between selfing and outcrossing is a life history trait of major concern with deep evolutionary consequences in mixed mating species. Yet, our current understanding of the proximate and ultimate determinants of species mating system is still unsatisfactory and largely theoretical. Indeed, evolutionary biologists are still puzzled by the often dramatic variation of mating strategies within single species. Of particular concern is the extent to which environmental conditions shape patterns of variation and covariation of mating system components within species. Here, we address this concern in the common morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea) by taking advantage of an extensive dataset of floral traits, genetic estimates of selfing and inbreeding, and relevant environmental factors compiled for 22 populations of this species distributed along a disparate set of environments along Southeast and Midwest USA. Combining a powerful array of parametric and model-free statistical approaches, we robustly identify a set of natural and anthropogenic environmental factors underlying population-level variation in selfing, inbreeding, and flower morphology. Remarkably, individual mating system components are found to be associated with different environmental factors and only loosely associated with each other, and thus potentially under multiple different selective pressures. These results not only corroborate theoretical expectations of the significant role the environment plays in the local determination of mating systems, but also provide compelling evidence of complex underlying interactions between multiple evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "While predominant as a disease entity, knowledge voids exist regarding the pathogenesis of canine diabetes. To test the hypothesis that diabetic dogs have similar metabolomic perturbations to humans with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we analyzed serum metabolomic profiles of breed- and body weight-matched, diabetic (n=6) and healthy (n=6) dogs by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling. We report distinct clustering of diabetic and control groups based on heat map analysis of known and unknown metabolites. Random forest classification identified 5/6 dogs per group correctly with overall out of bag error rate=16.7%. Diabetic dogs demonstrated significant upregulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis intermediates (e.g., glucose/fructose, C6H12O6, keto-hexose, deoxy-hexose, (P<0.01)), with significant downregulation of tryptophan metabolism metabolites (e.g., picolinic acid, indoxyl sulfate, anthranilate, (P<0.01)). Multiple amino acids (AA), AA metabolites, and bile acids were also significantly lower in diabetic versus healthy dogs (P<0.05) with the exception of the branched chain AA valine, which was elevated in diabetic animals (P<0.05). Metabolomic profiles in diabetic versus healthy dogs shared similarities with those reported in human T1D (e.g., alterations in glycolysis/gluconeogensis metabolites, bile acids, and elevated branched chain AA). Further studies are warranted to evaluate the utility of canine diabetes to provide novel mechanistic insights to the human disorder.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Understanding patterns of species occurrence and the processes underlying these patterns is fundamental to the study of ecology. One of the more commonly used approaches to investigate species occurrence patterns is occupancy modeling, which can account for imperfect detection of a species during surveys. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Bayesian modeling in ecology, which includes fitting Bayesian occupancy models. The Bayesian framework is appealing to ecologists for many reasons, including the ability to incorporate prior information through the specification of prior distributions on parameters. While ecologists often intend to choose priors so that they are \\\"uninformative\\\"; or \\\";vague\\\";, such priors can easily be unintentionally highly informative. Here we report on how the specification of a \\\"vague\\\" normally distributed (i.e., Gaussian) prior on coefficients in Bayesian occupancy models can unintentionally influence parameter estimation. Using both simulation and empirical examples, we illustrate how this issue likely compromises inference about species-habitat relationships. While the occurrence of this issue likely depends on the data set, researchers fitting Bayesian occupancy models should conduct sensitivity analyses to ensure intended inference, or use priors other than those most commonly used in the literature. We provide further suggestions for addressing this issue in occupancy studies, and an online tool for exploring this issue under different contexts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStreptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that is a major cause of infant mortality. Identifying the pneumococcal serotype is an important step in monitoring the impact of vaccines used to protect against disease. Genomic microarrays provide an effective method for molecular serotyping. Previously we developed an empirical Bayesian model for the classification of serotypes from a molecular serotyping array. With only few samples available, a model driven approach was the only option. In the meanwhile, several thousand samples have been made available to us, providing an opportunity to investigate serotype classification by machine learning methods, which could complement the Bayesian model.\\n\\nResultsWe compare the performance of the original Bayesian model with two machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting Machines and Random Forests. We present our results as an example of a generic strategy whereby a preliminary probabilistic model is complemented or replaced by a machine learning classifier once enough data are available. Despite the availability of thousands of serotyping arrays, a problem encountered when applying machine learning methods is the lack of training data containing mixtures of serotypes; due to the large number of possible combinations. Most of the available training data comprises samples with only a single serotype. To overcome the lack of training data we implemented an iterative analysis, creating artificial training data of serotype mixtures by combining raw data from single serotype arrays.\\n\\nConclusionsWith the enhanced training set the machine learning algorithms out perform the original Bayesian model. However, for serotypes currently lacking sufficient training data the best performing implementation was a combination of the results of the Bayesian Model and the Gradient Boosting Machine. As well as being an effective method for classifying biological data, machine learning can also be used as an efficient method for revealing subtle biological insights, which we illustrate with an example.",

    "abstract": "Integrative clustering is used to identify groups of samples by jointly analysing multiple datasets describing the same set of biological samples, such as gene expression, copy number, methylation etc. Most existing algorithms for integrative clustering assume that there is a shared consistent set of clusters across all datasets, and most of the data samples follow this structure. However in practice, the structure across heterogeneous datasets can be more varied, with clusters being joined in some datasets and separated in others.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present a probabilistic clustering method to identify groups across datasets that do not share the same cluster structure. The proposed algorithm, Clusternomics, identifies groups of samples that share their global behaviour across heterogeneous datasets. The algorithm models clusters on the level of individual datasets, while also extracting global structure that arises from the local cluster assignments. Clusters on both the local and the global level are modelled using a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture model to identify structure on both levels.\\n\\nWe evaluated the model both on simulated and on real-world datasets. The simulated data exemplifies datasets with varying degrees of common structure. In such a setting Clusternomics outperforms existing algorithms for integrative and consensus clustering. In a real-world application, we used the algorithm for cancer subtyping, identifying subtypes of cancer from heterogeneous datasets. We applied the algorithm to TCGA breast cancer dataset, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and proteomics. The algorithm extracted clinically meaningful clusters with significantly different survival probabilities. We also evaluated the algorithm on lung and kidney cancer TCGA datasets with high dimensionality, again showing clinically significant results and scalability of the algorithm.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIntegrative clustering is the task of identifying groups of samples by combining information from several datasets. An example of this task is cancer subtyping, where we cluster tumour samples based on several datasets, such as gene expression, proteomics and others. Most existing algorithms assume that all such datasets share a similar cluster structure, with samples outside these clusters treated as noise. The structure can, however, be much more heterogeneous: some meaningful clusters may appear only in some datasets.\\n\\nIn the paper, we introduce the Clusternomics algorithm that identifies groups of samples across heterogeneous datasets. It models both cluster structure of individual datasets, and the global structure that appears as a combination of local structures. The algorithm uses probabilistic modelling to identify the groups and share information across the local and global levels. We evaluated the algorithm on both simulated and real world datasets, where the algorithm found clinically significant clusters with different survival outcomes.",

Establishing a predictive model we identified two combined origins of host cell vulnerability: the pathogen-induced cellular vulnerability emerging from Salmonella uptake and persisting at later stage of the infection, and the host cell-inherent vulnerability. We linked the host cell inherent vulnerability with its morphological attributes such as the local cell crowding, and with host cell cholesterol content.

Here, we show evidence of one mechanism by which the brain can rapidly develop new motor output, seemingly without altering the functional connectivity between or within cortical areas. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of neurons in the premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices, and computed models relating these neural populations throughout adaptation to reaching movement perturbations. We found a signature of learning in the \\\"null subspace\\\" of PMd with respect to M1. Earlier experiments have shown that null subspace activity allows the motor cortex to alter preparatory activity without directly influencing M1. In our experiments, the null subspace planning activity evolved with the adaptation, yet the \\\"potent\\\" mapping that captures information sent to M1 was preserved. Our results illustrate a population-level mechanism within the motor cortices to adjust the output from one brain area to its downstream structures that could be exploited throughout the brain for rapid, online behavioral adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The stabilizing role of sensory feedback in relation to realistic 3-dimensional movement dynamics remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to quantify how primary afferent activity contributes to shaping muscle activity patterns during reaching movements. To achieve this objective, we designed a virtual reality task that guided healthy human subjects through a set of planar reaching movements with controlled kinematic and dynamic conditions that minimized inter-subject variability. Next, we integrated human upper-limb models of musculoskeletal dynamics and proprioception to analyze motion and major muscle activation patterns during these tasks. We recorded electromyographic and motion-capture data and used the integrated model to simulate joint kinematics, joint torques due to muscle contractions, muscle length changes, and simulated primary afferent feedback. The parameters of the primary afferent model were altered systematically to evaluate the effect of fusimotor drive. The experimental and simulated data were analyzed with hierarchical clustering. We found that the muscle activity patterns contained flexible task-dependent groups that consisted of co-activating agonistic and antagonistic muscles that changed with the dynamics of the task. The activity of muscles spanning only the shoulder generally grouped into a proximal cluster, while the muscles spanning the wrist grouped into a distal cluster. The bifunctional muscle spanning the shoulder and elbow were flexibly grouped with either proximal or distal cluster based on the dynamical requirements of the task. The composition and activation of these groups reflected the relative contribution of active and passive forces to each motion. In contrast, the simulated primary afferent feedback was most related to joint kinematics rather than dynamics, even though the primary afferent models had nonlinear dynamical components and variable fusimotor drive. Simulated physiological changes to the fusimotor drive were not sufficient to reproduce the dynamical features in muscle activity pattern. Altogether, these results suggest that sensory feedback signals are in a different domain from that of muscle activation signals. This indicates that to solve the neuromechanical problem, the central nervous system controls limb dynamics through task-dependent co-activation of muscles and non-linear modulation of monosynaptic primary afferent feedback.\n\nNew & NoteworthyHere we answered the fundamental question in sensorimotor transformation of how primary afferent signals can contribute to the compensation for limb dynamics evident in muscle activity. We combined computational and experimental approaches to create a new experimental paradigm that challenges the nervous system with passive limb dynamics that either assists or resists the desired movement. We found that the active dynamical features present in muscle activity are unlikely to arise from direct feedback from primary afferents.",

In combination with integrated mutagenesis, ensemble-solution kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations approaches, this study reveals an allosteric communication pathway that connects the distal end of the motor domain with the active site. Genetic disruption of this pathways reduces nucleotide binding and release kinetics up to 85-fold and abolishes nonmuscle myosin-2 specific kinetic signatures.

    "abstract": "The genus Stenotrophomonas (Gammaproteobacteria) has a broad environmental distribution. S. maltophilia is its best known species because it is a globally emerging, multidrug-resistant (MDR), opportunistic pathogen. Members of this species are known to display high genetic, ecological and phenotypic diversity, forming the so-called S. maltophilia complex (Smc). Heterogeneous resistance and virulence phenotypes have been reported for environmental Smc isolates of diverse ecological origin. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity could be in part due to the potential lumping of several cryptic species in the Smc. Here we used state-of-the-art phylogenetic and population genetics methods to test this hypothesis based on the multilocus dataset available for the genus at pubmlst.org. It was extended with sequences from complete and draft genome sequences to assemble a comprehensive set of reference sequences. This framework was used to analyze 108 environmental isolates obtained in this study from the sediment and water column of four rivers and streams in Central Mexico, affected by contrasting levels of anthropogenic pollution. The aim of the study was to identify species in this collection, defined as genetically cohesive sequence clusters, and to determine the extent of their genetic, ecological and phenotypic differentiation. The multispecies coalescent, coupled with Bayes factor analysis was used to delimit species borders, together with population genetic structure analyses, recombination and gene flow estimates between sequence clusters.\\n\\nThese analyses consistently revealed that the Smc contains at least 5 significantly differentiated lineages: S. maltophilia and Smc1 to Smc4. Only S. maltophilia was found to be intrinsically MDR, all its members expressing metallo-{beta}-lactamases (MBLs). The other Smc lineages were not MDR and did not express MBLs. We also obtained isolates related to S. acidaminiphila, S. humi and S. terrae. They were significantly more susceptible to antibiotics than S. maltophilia. We demonstrate that the sympatric lineages recovered display significantly differentiated habitat preferences, antibiotic resistance profiles and beta-lactamase expression phenotypes, as shown by diverse multivariate analyses and robust univariate statistical tests. We discuss our data in light of current models of bacterial speciation, which fit these data well, stressing the implications of species delimitation in ecological, evolutionary and clinical research.",

    "abstract": "There were several high concentrations of flavonoid components in tea leaves that present health benefits. A novel purple-leaf tea variety,  Mooma1, was obtained from the natural hybrid population of Longjing 43 variety. The buds and young leaves of  Mooma1 were displayed in bright red. HPLC and LC-MS analysis showed that anthocyanins and O-Glycosylated flavonols were remarkably accumulated in the leaves of  Mooma1, while the total amount of catechins in purple-leaf leaves was slightly decreased compared with the control. A R2R3-MYB transcription factor (CsMYB6A) and a novel UGT gene (CsUGT72AM1), that were highly expressed in purple leaf were isolated and identified by transcriptome sequencing. The over-expression of transgenic tobacco confirmed that CsMYB6A can activate the expression of flavonoid-related structural genes, especially CHS and 3GT, controlling the accumulation of anthocyanins in the leaf of transgenic tobacco. Enzymatic assays in vitro confirmed that CsUGT72AM1 has catalytic activity as a flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase, and displayed broad substrate specificity. The results were useful for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the flavonoid metabolic fluxes in the tea plant.",

    "abstract": "An autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutation R272Q in human ICK (intestinal cell kinase) gene causes profound multiplex developmental defects in human ECO (endocrine-cerebro-osteodysplasia) syndrome. ECO patients exhibit a wide variety of skeletal abnormalities, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ICK regulates skeletal development remain largely unknown. The goal of this study is to understand the structural and mechanistic basis underlying skeletal anomalies caused by ICK dysfunction. Ick R272Q knock in transgenic mouse model not only recapitulated major ECO skeletal defects such as short limbs and polydactyly but also revealed a deformed spine with deficient intervertebral disc. Loss of ICK functions markedly reduces mineralization in the spinal column, ribs, and long bones. Ick mutants show a significant decrease in the number of proliferating chondrocytes and type X collagen-expressing hypertrophic chondrocytes in the spinal column and the growth plate of long bones. Our results demonstrate that ICK plays an important role in bone and intervertebral disc development by promoting chondrocyte proliferation and maturation, and thus provide novel mechanistic insights into the skeletal phenotypes of human ECO syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Recent work done exclusively in tissue culture cells revealed that the nuclear envelope (NE) undergoes ruptures leading to transient mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic components. The duration of transient NE ruptures depends on lamins, however the underlying mechanisms and the relevance to in vivo events is not known. Here, we use C. elegans embryos to show that dynein forces that position nuclei increase the severity of lamin-induced NE ruptures in vivo. In the absence of dynein forces, lamin prevents nuclear-cytoplasmic mixing caused by NE ruptures. By monitoring the dynamics of NE rupture events, we demonstrate that lamin is required for a distinct step in NE recovery that restricts nucleocytoplasmic mixing prior to the full restoration of NE rupture sites. We show that laser-induced puncture of the NE recapitulates phenotypes associated with NE recovery in wild type cells. Surprisingly, we find that embryonic lethality does not correlate with the incidence of NE rupture events suggesting that embryos survive transient losses of NE compartmentalization during early embryogenesis. In addition to presenting the first mechanistic analysis of transient NE ruptures in vivo, this work demonstrates that lamin controls the duration of NE ruptures by opposing dynein forces on ruptured nuclei to allow reestablishment of the NE permeability barrier and subsequent restoration of NE rupture sites.",

Reconstructed genomes provide evidence for anoxygenic photosynthesis involving fixation of carbon using reduced sulphur and iron as an electron donor in the anoxic zone of the sampled lake systems. In addition to anoxygenic photosynthesis, our molecular data reveals novel chemolithoautotrophic organisms and supports the existence of methanotrophs in bottom anoxic waters. Reconstructed genomes matched methanotrophs related to Methylobacter tundripaludum, phototrophic Chloroflexi and Chlorobia, as well as lithoautotrophic genomes affiliated to the Betaproteobacteria class and Planctomycetes phylum. Based on our in-depth characterization, complex metabolic interactomes emerge unique to each lakes redox tower and with sulfur, iron and carbon cycling tightly intertwined through chemolithotrophy and anoxygenic photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The omnigenic model of complex diseases stipulates that the majority of the heritability will be explained by the effects of common variation on genes in the periphery of core disease pathways. Rare variant associations, expected to explain far less of the heritability, may be enriched in core disease genes and thus will be instrumental in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis and their potential therapeutic targets. Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing (WES), high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify three candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the >80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In a follow-up cohort of 10,995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P=0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P=0.0005 and P=0.0033). Both genes are functional candidates and significantly constrained against missense mutations in gene-level analyses, along with C1QTNF4. We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-{kappa}B activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRare variants, present in <1% in population, are expected to explain little of the heritability of complex diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), yet are likely to identify core genes crucial to disease mechanisms. Their rarity, however, limits the power to show their statistical association with disease. Through sequencing the exomes of SLE patients and their parents, we identified non-inherited de novo mutations in 14 genes and hypothesised that these are prime candidates for harbouring additional disease-associated rare variants. We demonstrate that two of these genes also carry a significant excess of rare variants in an independent, large cohort of SLE patients. Our findings will influence future study designs in the search for the  missing heritability of complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although most animal behaviors are associated with some form of heritable genetic variation we do not yet understand how genes sculpt behavior across evolution, either directly or indirectly. To address this, I here compile a dataset comprised of over 1,000 genomic loci representing a spectrum of behavioral variation across animal taxa. Comparative analyses reveal that courtship and feeding behaviors are associated with genomic regions of significantly greater effect than other traits, on average three fold greater than other behaviors. Investigations of whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic data for 87 behavioral traits from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel indicate that courtship and feeding behaviors have significantly greater genetic contributions and that, in general, behavioral traits overlap little in individual base pairs but increasingly interact at the levels of genes and traits. These results provide evidence that different types of behavior are associated with variable genetic bases and suggest that, across animal evolution, the genetic landscape of behavior is more rugged, yet predictable, than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present an effective model All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The model describes reinforcing feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We decomposed the effective model into three modules; a signal initiation module that sensed and transformed an ATRA signal into program activation signals; a signal integration module that controlled the expression of upstream transcription factors; and a phenotype module which encoded the expression of functional differentiation markers from the ATRA-inducible transcription factors. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. Additionally, the model captured intermediate and phenotypic gene expression data. Knockout analysis suggested Gfi-1 and PPAR$[gamma] were critical to the ATRA-induced differentiation program. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggested that reinforcing feedback is central to hyperactive signaling in a diversity of cell fate programs.",

    "abstract": "The scientific endeavor pivots on the accurate reporting of experimental and theoretical findings, and consequently scientific publication is immensely important. As the number of active scientists continues to increase, there is concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive where careless and fraudulent research can thrive. This is compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel or positive findings rather than negative results or investigations that merely confirm a null hypothesis, despite their intrinsic value, potentially compounding a reproducibility crisis in several fields. This is a serious problem for both science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little mathematical modeling on the factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. In this work, we present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists with funding allocated based on published outputs. The results of this analysis suggest that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is strongly influenced by the false positive rate and the pressures from journals for positive results, and that decreasing available funding has negative consequences for the resulting trustworthiness. We also examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science, including increasing fraud detection and awarding diligence, discussing the implications of these findings.",

Patients were classified as retrospective (epilepsy diagnosis > 6 months) or prospective (epilepsy diagnosis < 6 months). WES was performed on an Ion ProtonTM and variant reporting was restricted to the sequences of 565 known epilepsy genes. Diagnostic yield and time to diagnosis were calculated. An analysis of cost and impact on treatment was also performed.\\n\\nResultsA likely/definite diagnosis was made in 17/50 patients (34%) with immediate treatment implications in 8/17 (47%). A possible diagnosis was identified in 9 additional patients (18%) for whom supporting evidence is pending. Time from epilepsy onset to genetic diagnosis was faster when WES was performed early in the diagnostic process (mean: 143 days prospective versus 2,172 days retrospective). Costs of prior negative tests averaged $8,344 in the retrospective group, suggesting savings of up to $5,110 per patient.\\n\\nInterpretationThese results support the clinical utility and potential cost-effectiveness of using targeted WES early in the diagnostic workup of patients with unexplained early-onset epilepsy. The costs and clinical benefits are likely to continue to improve. Advances in precision medicine and further studies regarding impact on long-term clinical outcome will be important.",

We found sensitization of Lys63 in eight new conditions. In total, our experiments have uncovered a sensitizing condition for every position in Ub except Ser57 and Gln62.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRed hair is associated with pain sensitivity, and more so in women than in men. Hair redness may thus interact with a female-specific factor. We tested this hypothesis on a large sample of Czech and Slovak respondents. They were asked about the natural redness and darkness of their hair, their natural eye color, their physical and mental health (24 categories), and other personal attributes (height, weight, number of children, lifelong number of sexual partners, frequency of smoking).\\n\\nResultsWe found that red-haired women did worse than other women in ten health categories and better in only three. In particular, they were more prone to colorectal, cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. Cancer risk increased steadily with increasing hair redness except for the reddest shade. Red-haired men showed a balanced pattern of health effects, doing better than other men in three categories and worse in three. Number of children was the only category where both male and female redheads did better than other respondents. We also confirmed earlier findings that red hair is naturally more frequent in women than in men.\\n\\nConclusionRed-haired women had higher fecundity and sexual attractiveness, but this selective advantage seems offset by worse health outcomes and therefore lower viability. The resulting equilibrium between these two counterbalancing forces might explain why red hair has remained less common than other hair and eye colors. Of the  new hair and eye colors, red hair diverges the most from the ancestral state of black hair and brown eyes. It is the most sexually dimorphic variant, not only in population frequency but also in health outcomes. This sexual dimorphism seems to have resulted from a selection pressure that acted primarily on early European women and which led to a general and apparently rapid diversification of hair and eye colors.",

    "abstract": "Genetic alterations initiate tumors and enable the evolution of drug resistance. The pro-cancer view of mutations is however incomplete, and several studies show that mutational load can reduce tumor fitness. Given its negative effect, genetic load should make tumors more sensitive to anticancer drugs. Here, we test this hypothesis across all major types of cancer from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, that provides genetic and expression data of 496 cell lines together with their response to 24 common anticancer drugs. We found that the efficacy of 9 out of 24 drugs showed significant association with genetic load in a pan-cancer analysis. The associations for some tissue-drug combinations were remarkably strong with genetic load explaining up to 83% of the variance in the drug response. Overall, the role of genetic load depended on both the drug and the tissue type with 10 tissues being particularly vulnerable to genetic load. We also identified changes in gene expression associated with increased genetic load, which included cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA damage and apoptosis. Our results show that genetic load is an important component of tumor fitness and can predict drug sensitivity. Beyond being a biomarker, genetic load might be a new, unexplored vulnerability of cancer.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DATA ACCESSIBILITY BIOSKETCH REFERENCES Environmental temperature influences organisms in many ways; temperature increases or decreases rates of physiological processes (Brown et al., 2012), determines timing of reproduction (Olive, 1995), and even directly affects mortality (Pauly, 1980). Because of the far-reaching influence of temperature, projected increases in global temperatures due to climate change are expected to substantially alter diverse species characteristics. Increased temperatures have already been implicated in shifts in species geographic distributions (e.g., Buckley et al., 2010), and in the phenology of species life history and development (e.g., Wolkovich ...",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100042).\\n\\nReconstructing ancestral characters on a phylogeny is an arduous task because the observed states at the tips of the tree correspond to a single realization of the underlying evolutionary process. Recently, it was proposed that ancestral traits can be indirectly estimated with the help of molecular data, based on the fact that life history traits influence substitution rates. Here we challenge these new approaches in the Cetartiodactyla, a clade of large mammals which, according to paleontology, derive from small ancestors. Analysing transcriptome data in 41 species, of which 22 were newly sequenced, we provide a dated phylogeny of the Cetartiodactyla and report a significant effect of body mass on the overall substitution rate, the synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitution rate and the dynamics of GC-content. Our molecular comparative analysis points toward relatively small Cetartiodactyla ancestors, in agreement with the fossil record, even though our data set almost exclusively consists of large species. This analysis demonstrates the potential of phylogenomic methods for ancestral trait reconstruction and gives credit to recent suggestions that the ancestor to placental mammals was a relatively large and long-lived animal.",

    "abstract": "Our bodies and the environment constrain our movements. For example, when our arm is fully outstretched, we cannot extend it further. More generally, the distribution of possible movements is conditioned on the state of our bodies in the environment, which is constantly changing. However, little is known about how the brain represents such distributions, and uses them in movement planning. Here, we recorded from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) while monkeys reached to randomly placed targets. The hands position within the workspace created probability distributions of possible upcoming targets, which affected movement trajectories and latencies. PMd, but not M1, neurons had increased activity when the monkeys hand position made it likely the upcoming movement would be in the neurons preferred directions. Across the population, PMd activity represented probability distributions of individual upcoming reaches, which depended on rapidly changing information about the bodys state in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with damage to the cerebellum perform poorly in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This deficit has been attributed to impairment in sensory-prediction-error-based updating of an internal forward model, a form of implicit learning. These individuals can, however, successfully counter a perturbation when instructed with an explicit aiming strategy. This successful use of an instructed aiming strategy presents a paradox: In adaptation tasks, why dont individuals with cerebellar damage come up with an aiming solution on their own to compensate for their implicit learning deficit? To explore this question, we employed a variant of a visuomotor rotation task in which, prior to executing a movement on each trial, the participants verbally reported their intended aiming location. Compared to healthy controls, participants with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) displayed impairments in both implicit learning and aiming. This was observed when the visuomotor rotation was introduced abruptly (Exp. 1) or gradually (Exp. 2). This dual deficit does not appear to be related to the increased movement variance associated with ataxia: Healthy undergraduates showed little change in implicit learning or aiming when their movement feedback was artificially manipulated to produce similar levels of variability (Exp. 3). Taken together the results indicate that a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction is not only impaired sensory-prediction-error-based learning, but also a difficulty in developing and/or maintaining an aiming solution in response to a visuomotor perturbation. We suggest that this dual deficit can be explained by the cerebellum forming part of a network that learns and maintains action-outcome associations across trials.\\n\\nNew and noteworthyIndividuals with cerebellar pathology are impaired in sensorimotor adaptation. This deficit has been attributed to an impairment in error-based learning, specifically, from a deficit in using sensory prediction errors to update an internal model. Here, we show that these individuals also have difficulty in discovering an aiming solution to overcome their adaptation deficit, suggesting a new role for the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation tasks.",

    "abstract": "The photopigment melanopsin supports reflexive visual functions in people, such as pupil constriction and circadian photoentrainment. What contribution melanopsin makes to conscious visual perception is less studied. We devised a stimulus that targeted melanopsin separately from the cones using pulsed (3 s) spectral modulations around a photopic background. Pupil-lometry confirmed that the melanopsin stimulus drives a retinal mechanism distinct from luminance. In each of four subjects, a functional MRI response in area V1 was found. This response scaled with melanopic contrast and was not easily explained by imprecision in the silencing of the cones. Twenty additional subjects then observed melanopsin pulses and provided a structured rating of the perceptual experience. Melanopsin stimulation was described as an unpleasant, blurry, minimal brightening that quickly faded. We conclude that isolated stimulation of melanopsin is likely associated with a response within the cortical visual pathway and with an evoked conscious percept.",

    "abstract": "Human perceptual grouping of sequential auditory cues has traditionally been modeled using a mechanistic approach. The problem however is essentially one of source inference - a problem that has recently been tackled using statistical Bayesian models in visual and auditory-visual modalities. Usually the models are restricted to performing inference over just one or two possible sources, but human perceptual systems have to deal with much more complex scenarios. To characterize human perception we have developed a Bayesian inference model that allows an unlimited number of signal sources to be considered: it is general enough to allow any discrete sequential cues, from any modality. The model uses a non-parametric prior, hence increased complexity of the signal does not necessitate more parameters. The model not only determines the most likely number of sources, but also specifies the source that each signal is associated with. The model gives an excellent fit to data from an auditory stream segregation experiment in which the pitch and presentation rate of pure tones determined the perceived number of sources.",

    "abstract": "The coral reefs around Praia do Tofo and Praia da Barra, southern Mozambique, are known for their aggregations of marine megafauna but few studies have examined their reef fish biodiversity. This study assesses for the first time the ichthyofaunal diversity of the seas around Praia do Tofo and Praia da Barra. Methods involved underwater observations during recreational dives between February and September 2016, and the use of photographic records from 2015. A total of 353 species, representing 79 families, were recorded from 16 patch reefs in the region. The area shows comparable species diversity to others in the southwestern Indian Ocean, suggesting these reefs are in good condition. But high primary productivity driven by coastal upwelling may make fish diversity and trophic structure unreliable measures of the health of these reefs. Future studies investigating the sustainability of this ecosystem would benefit from utilising a wide range of reef health measures.",
