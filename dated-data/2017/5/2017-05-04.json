    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions can be stabilized against invasion by non-cooperative individuals by putting such \\\"cheaters\\\" at a selective disadvantage. Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality -- yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance, but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts ability to sanction non-cooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice-versa. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. These results predict that mutualists can maintain variation in recognition of partner signals or in the ability to sanction non-cooperators without destabilizing mutualism, and reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism should consider communication between partners as well as the exchange of benefits.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer treatment is predicting the clinical response to anti-cancer drugs for each individual patient. For complex diseases such as cancer, characterized by high inter-patient variance, the implementation of precision medicine approaches is dependent upon understanding the pathological processes at the molecular level. While the \\\"omics\\\" era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to utilize it in targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the \\\"omics\\\" data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNNs), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses in cancer treatment. We present the application of Association Rule Mining combined with DLNNs for the analysis of high-throughput molecular profiles of 1001 cancer cell lines, in order to extract cancer-specific signatures in the form of easily interpretable rules and use these rules as input to predict pharmacological responses to a large number of anti-cancer drugs. The proposed algorithm outperformed Random Forests (RF) and Bayesian Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning (BMMKL) classification which currently represent the state-of-the-art in drug-response prediction. Moreover, the in silico pipeline presented, introduces a novel strategy for identifying potential therapeutic targets, as well as possible drug combinations with high therapeutic potential. For the first time, we demonstrate that DLNNs trained on a large pharmacogenomics data-set can effectively predict the therapeutic response of specific drugs in different cancer types. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the application of DLNNs to predict therapeutic responsiveness, a milestone in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of many animal and plant diseases relies on the behavior of arthropod vectors. In particular, the choice to feed on either infected or uninfected hosts can dramatically affect the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. I develop an epidemiological model to explore the impact of host choice behavior on the dynamics of these diseases and to examine selection acting on vector behavior, but also on pathogen manipulation of this behavior. This model identifies multiple evolutionary conflicts over the control of this behavior and generates testable predictions under different scenarios. In general, the vector should evolve the ability to avoid infected hosts. However, if the vector behavior is under the control of the pathogen, uninfected vectors should prefer infected hosts while infected vectors should seek uninfected hosts. But some mechanistic constraints on pathogen manipulation ability may alter these predictions. These theoretical results are discussed in the light of observed behavioral patterns obtained on a diverse range of vector-borne diseases. These patterns confirm that several pathogens have evolved conditional behavioral manipulation strategies of their vector species. Other pathogens, however, seem unable to evolve such complex conditional strategies. Contrasting the behavior of infected and uninfected vectors may thus help reveal mechanistic constraints acting on the evolution of the manipulation of vector behavior.",

    "abstract": "Proteome balance is safeguarded by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that evolved to maintain native function of the diverse ensemble of protein species, ensuring cellular and organismal health. Proteostasis imbalances and collapse are implicated in a spectrum of human diseases, from neurodegeneration to cancer. The characteristics of PN disease alterations however have not been assessed in a systematic way. Zooming in on the chaperome as a central PN component we turned to a curated functional ontology of the human chaperome that we connect in a high-confidence physical protein-protein interaction network. Challenged by the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations in the heterogeneous spectrum of human cancers, we assessed gene expression across more than 10,000 patient biopsies covering 22 solid cancers. We derived a novel customized Meta-PCA dimension reduction approach yielding M-scores as quantitative indicators of disease expression changes to condense the complexity of cancer transcriptomics datasets into quantitative functional network topographies. We confirm upregulation of the HSP90 family and also highlight HSP60s, Prefoldins, HSP100s, ER- and mitochondria-specific chaperones as pan-cancer enriched. Our analysis also reveals a surprisingly consistent strong downregulation of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and we stratify two cancer groups based on the preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones. Strikingly, our analysis highlight similarities between stem cell and cancer proteostasis, and diametrically opposed chaperome deregulation between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We developed a web-based Proteostasis Profiler tool (Pro2) enabling intuitive analysis and visual exploration of proteostasis disease alterations using gene expression data. Our study showcases a comprehensive profiling of chaperome shifts in human cancers and sets the stage for a systematic global analysis of PN alterations across the human diseasome towards novel hypotheses for therapeutic network re-adjustment in proteostasis disorders.",

    "abstract": "Most people tend to bisect horizontal lines slightly to the left of their true center (pseudoneglect), and start visual search from left-sided items. This physiological leftward spatial bias may depend on hemispheric asymmetries in the organization of attentional networks, but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here we modeled relevant aspects of the ventral and dorsal attentional networks (VAN and DAN) of the human brain. First, we demonstrated pseudoneglect in visual search in 101 right-handed psychology students. Participants consistently tended to start the task from a left-sided item, thus showing pseudoneglect. Second, we trained populations of simulated neurorobots to perform a similar task, by using a genetic algorithm. The neurorobots behavior was controlled by artificial neural networks, which simulated the human VAN and DAN in the two brain hemispheres. Neurorobots differed in the connectional constraints that were applied to the anatomy and function of the attention networks. Results indicated that (1) neurorobots provided with a biologically plausible hemispheric asymmetry of the VAN-DAN connections, as well as with inter-hemispheric inhibition, displayed the best match with human data; however, (2) anatomical asymmetry per se was not sufficient to generate pseudoneglect; in addition, the VAN must have an excitatory influence on the ipsilateral DAN; (3) neurorobots provided with bilateral competence in the VAN but without inter-hemispheric inhibition failed to display pseudoneglect. These findings provide a proof of concept of the causal link between connectional asymmetries and pseudoneglect, and specify important biological constraints that result in physiological asymmetries of human behavior.\\n\\nSignificance statementMost of us start our exploration of the environment from the left side. Here we demonstrated this tendency in undergraduate students, and trained artificial agents (neurorobots) to perform a similar visual search task. The neurorobots behavior was controlled by artificial neural networks, inspired by the human fronto-parietal attentional system. In seven distinct populations of neurorobots, different constraints were applied on the network connections within and between the brain hemispheres. Only one of the artificial populations behaved in a similar way to the human participants. The connectional constraints applied to this population included known characteristics of the human fronto-parietal networks, but had also additional properties not previously described. Thus, our findings specify biological constraints that induce physiological asymmetries of human behavior.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell genomics is a powerful tool for determining the genetic structure of complex communities of unicellular organisms. Patients infected with the malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, often carry multiple, genetically distinct parasites. Little is known about the diversity and relatedness of these lineages. We have developed an improved single-cell genomics protocol to reconstruct individual haplotypes from infections, a necessary step in uncovering parasite ecology within the host. This approach captures singly-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) prior to whole genome amplification (WGA) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Here, we demonstrate that parasites in late cell cycle stages, which contain increased DNA content, are far superior templates for generating high quality genomic data. Targeting of these cells routinely generates near-complete capture of the 23Mb P. falciparum genome (mean breadth of coverage 90.7%) at high efficiency. We used this approach to analyze the genomes of 48 individual cells from a polyclonal malaria infection sampled in Chikhwawa, Malawi. This comprehensive dataset enabled high-resolution estimation of the clonality and the relatedness of parasite haplotypes within the infection, long-standing problems in malaria biology.",

    "abstract": "Plant responses to the environment are shaped by external stimuli and internal signaling pathways. In both the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and crop species, circadian clock factors have been identified as critical for growth, flowering and circadian rhythms. Outside of A. thaliana, however, little is known about the molecular function of clock genes. Therefore, we sought to compare the function of Brachypodium distachyon and Seteria viridis orthologs of EARLY FLOWERING3, a key clock gene in A. thaliana. To identify both cycling genes and putative ELF3 functional orthologs in S. viridis, a circadian RNA-seq dataset and online query tool (Diel Explorer) was generated as a community resource to explore expression profiles of Setaria genes under constant conditions after photo- or thermo-entrainment. The function of ELF3 orthologs from A. thaliana, B. distachyon, and S. viridis were tested for complementation of an elf3 mutation in A. thaliana. Despite comparably low sequence identity versus AtELF3 (less than 37%), both monocot orthologs were capable of rescuing hypocotyl elongation, flowering time and arrhythmic clock phenotypes. Molecular analysis using affinity purification and mass spectrometry to compare physical interactions also found that BdELF3 and SvELF3 could be integrated into similar complexes and networks as AtELF3, including forming a composite evening complex. Thus, we find that, despite 180 million years of separation, BdELF3 and SvELF3 can functionally complement loss of ELF3 at the molecular and physiological level.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryOrthologs of a key circadian clock component ELF3 from grasses functionally complement the Arabidopsis counterpart at the molecular and physiological level, in spite of high sequence divergence.",

    "abstract": "Human sociality depends upon the benefits of mutual aid and extensive communication. However, diverse norms and preferences complicate mutual aid, and ambiguity in meaning hinders communication. Here we demonstrate that these two problems can work together to enhance cooperation through the strategic use of deliberately ambiguous signals: covert signaling. Covert signaling is the transmission of information that is accurately received by its intended audience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow coordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or hostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the empirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling, such as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics. We introduce a novel mathematical model to assess when a covert signaling strategy will evolve, as well as how receiver attitudes coevolve with covert signals. Covert signaling plausibly serves an important function in facilitating within-group cooperative assortment by allowing individuals to pair up with similar group members when possible and to get along with dissimilar ones when necessary. This mechanism has broad implications for theories of signaling and cooperation, humor, social identity, political psychology, and the evolution of human cultural complexity.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of additive versus non-additive interactions in the regulation of complex traits remains controversial. This may be in part because large-scale epistasis has traditionally been difficult to detect in complex, multi-cellular organisms. We hypothesized that it would be easier to detect interactions using mouse chromosome substitution strains that simultaneously incorporate allelic variation in many genes on a controlled genetic background. Analyzing metabolic traits and gene expression levels in the offspring of a series of crosses between mouse chromosome substitution strains demonstrated that inter-chromosomal epistasis was a dominant feature of these complex traits. Epistasis typically accounted for a larger proportion of the heritable effects than those due solely to additive effects. These epistatic interactions typically resulted in trait values returning to the levels of the parental CSS host strain. Due to the large epistatic effects, analyses that did not account for interactions consistently underestimated the true effect sizes due to allelic variation or failed to detect the loci controlling trait variation. These studies demonstrate that epistatic interactions are a common feature of complex traits and thus identifying these interactions is key to understanding their genetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "De Bruijn graphs are a common assembly data structure for large sequencing datasets. But with the advances in sequencing technologies, assembling high coverage datasets has become a computational challenge. Read normalization, which removes redundancy in large datasets, is widely applied to reduce resource requirements. Current normalization algorithms, though efficient, provide no guarantee to preserve important k-mers that form connections between regions in the graph. Here, normalization is phrased as a set multi-cover problem on reads and a heuristic algorithm, ORNA, is proposed. ORNA normalizes to the minimum number of reads required to retain all k-mers and their relative kmer abundances from the original dataset. Hence, all connections and coverage information from the original graph are preserved. ORNA was tested on various RNA-seq datasets with different coverage values. It was compared to the current normalization algorithms and was found to be performing better. It is shown that combining read error correction and normalization allows more accurate and resource efficient RNA assemblies compared to the original dataset. Further, an application was proposed in which multiple datasets were combined and normalized to predict novel transcripts that would have been missed otherwise. Finally, ORNA is a general purpose normalization algorithm that is fast and significantly reduces datasets with little loss of assembly quality.\\n\\nORNA can be found under https://github.com/SchulzLab/ORNA",

Despite this remarkable difference with other cortical areas, the influence of motor output and its amplitude on TEPs is largely unknown. Here we studied TEPs resulting from M1 stimulation and assessed whether their waveform and spectral features depend on the MEP amplitude. To this aim, we performed two separate experiments. In experiment 1, single-pulse TMS was applied at the same supra-threshold intensity on primary motor, prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices and the corresponding TEPs were compared by means of local mean field power and time-frequency spectral analysis. In experiment 2 we stimulated M1 at resting motor threshold in order to elicit MEPs characterized by a wide range of amplitudes. TEPs computed from high-MEP and low-MEP trials were then compared using the same methods applied in experiment 1. In line with previous studies, TMS of M1 produced larger TEPs compared to other cortical stimulations. Notably, we found that only TEPs produced by M1 stimulation were accompanied by a late ([~]300 ms after TMS) event-related desynchronization (ERD), whose magnitude was strongly dependent on the amplitude of MEPs. Overall, these results suggest that M1 produces peculiar responses to TMS possibly reflecting specific anatomo-functional properties, such as the re-entry of proprioceptive feedback associated with target muscle activation.",

    "abstract": "The detection and transmission of the temporal quality of intracellular and extracellular signals is an essential cellular mechanism. It remains largely unexplored how cells interpret the duration information of a stimulus. In this paper, through an integrated quantitative and computational approach we demonstrate that crosstalk among multiple TGF-{beta} activated pathways forms a relay from SMAD to GLI1 that initializes and maintains SNAILl expression, respectively. This transaction is smoothed and accelerated by another temporal switch from elevated cytosolic GSK3 enzymatic activity to reduced nuclear GSK3 enzymatic activity. The intertwined network places SNAIL1 as a key integrator of information from TGF-{beta} signaling subsequently distributed through upstream divergent pathways; essentially cells generate a transient or sustained expression of SNAIL1 depending on TGF-{beta} duration. Other signaling pathways may use similar network structure to encode duration information.",

In immunology, scRNA-seq allowed the characterisation of transcript sequence diversity of functionally relevant sub-populations of T cells, and notably the identification of the full length T cell receptor (TCR{beta}), which defines the specificity against cognate antigens. Several factors, such as RNA library capture, cell quality, and sequencing output have been suggested to affect the quality of scRNA-seq data, but these factors have not been systematically examined.\\n\\nWe studied the effect of read length and sequencing depth on the quality of gene expression profiles, cell type identification, and TCR{beta} reconstruction, utilising 1,305 publically available scRNA-seq datasets, and simulation-based analyses. Gene expression was characterised by an increased number of unique genes identified with short read lengths (<50 bp), but these featured higher technical variability compared to profiles from longer reads. TCR{beta} were detected in 1,027 cells (79%), with a success rate between 81% and 100% for datasets with at least 250,000 (PE) reads of length >50 bp.\\n\\nSufficient read length and sequencing depth can control technical noise to enable accurate identification of TCR{beta} and gene expression profiles from scRNA-seq data of T cells.",

In Experiment 2 the dogs were presented with human faces expressing happiness, anger, fear, or sadness. Using the resulting cluster from Experiment 1 we trained a linear support vector machine classifier to discriminate between pairs of emotions and found that it could only discriminate between happiness and the other emotions. Finally, evaluation of the whole-brain fMRI time courses through a similar classifier allowed us to predict the emotion being observed by the dogs.

Here, we show that Aubergine (Aub), another PIWI protein, is intrinsically required in GSCs for their self-renewal and differentiation. Aub loading with piRNAs is essential for these functions. The major role of Aub is in self-renewal and depends on mRNA regulation. We identify the Cbl proto-oncogene, a regulator of mammalian hematopoietic stem cells, as a novel GSC differentiation factor.

    "abstract": "Resistance to insecticides through enhanced metabolism is a worldwide problem. The Cyp6g1 gene of the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a paradigm for the study of metabolic resistance. Constitutive overexpression of this gene confers resistance to several chemical classes of insecticides, including the neonicotinoids exemplified by the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI). The metabolism of IMI in this species has been previously shown to yield oxidative and nitro-reduced metabolites. While levels of the oxidative metabolites are correlated with CYP6G1 expression, nitro-reduced metabolites are not, raising the question of how these metabolites are produced. Some IMI metabolites are known to be toxic, making their fate within the insect a second question of interest. These questions have been addressed by coupling the genetic tools of gene overexpression and CRISPR gene knock-out with the sensitive mass spectrometric technique, the Twin-Ion Method (TIM). Analysing axenic larvae indicated that microbes living within D. melanogaster are largely responsible for the production of the nitro-reduced metabolites. Knock-out of Cyp6g1 revealed functional redundancy, with some metabolites produced by CYP6G1 still detected. IMI metabolism was shown to produce toxic products that are not further metabolized but readily excreted, even when produced in the Central Nervous System (CNS), highlighting the significance of transport and excretion in metabolic resistance.",

Though PfFPPS/GGPPS is also inhibited by a class of bisphosphonate drugs, MMV019313 has significant advantages for antimalarial drug development. MMV019313 has superior physicochemical properties compared to charged bisphosphonates that have poor bioavailability and strong bone affinity. We also show that it is highly selective for PfFPPS/GGPPS and showed no activity against human FPPS or GGPPS. Inhibition of PfFPPS/GGPPS by MMV019313, but not bisphosphonates, was disrupted in an S228T variant, demonstrating that MMV019313 and bisphosphonates have distinct modes-of-inhibition against PfFPPS/GGPPS. Altogether MMV019313 is the first specific, non-bisphosphonate inhibitor of PfFPPS/GGPPS. Our findings uncover a new small molecule binding site in this important antimalarial drug target and provide a promising starting point for development of Plasmodium-specific FPPS/GGPPS inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "High resolution and high throughput, genotype to phenotype studies in plants are underway to accelerate breeding of climate ready crops. Complex developmental phenotypes are observed by imaging a variety of accessions in different environment conditions, however extracting the genetically heritable traits is challenging. In the recent years, deep learning techniques and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long-Short Term Memories (LSTMs), have shown great success in visual data recognition, classification, and sequence learning tasks. In this paper, we proposed a CNN-LSTM framework for plant classification of various genotypes. Here, we exploit the power of deep CNNs for joint feature and classifier learning, within an automatic phenotyping scheme for genotype classification. Further, plant growth variation over time is also important in phenotyping their dynamic behavior. This was fed into the deep learning framework using LSTMs to model these temporal cues for different plant accessions. We generated a replicated dataset of four accessions of Arabidopsis and carried out automated phenotyping experiments. The results provide evidence of the benefits of our approach over using traditional hand-crafted image analysis features and other genotype classification frameworks. We also demonstrate that temporal information further improves the performance of the phenotype classification system.",

    "abstract": "Cancer evolution and progression are shaped by cellular interactions and Darwinian selection. Evolutionary game theory incorporates both of these principles, and has been proposed as a framework to understand tumor cell population dynamics. A cornerstone of evolutionary dynamics is the replicator equation, which describes changes in the relative abundance of different cell types, and is able to predict evolutionary equilibria. Typically, the replicator equation focuses on differences in relative fitness. We here show that this framework might not be sufficient under all circumstances, as it neglects important aspects of population growth. Standard replicator dynamics might miss critical differences in the time it takes to reach an equilibrium, as this time also depends on cellular turnover in growing but bounded populations. As the system reaches a stable manifold, the time to reach equilibrium depends on cellular death and birth rates. These rates shape the timescales, in particular in co-evolutionary dynamics of growth factor producers and free-riders. Replicator dynamics might be an appropriate framework only when birth and death rates are of similar magnitude. Otherwise, population growth effects cannot be neglected when predicting the time to reach an equilibrium, and cell type specific rates have to be accounted for explicitly.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of the suite of morphological and behavioral adaptations underlying the ecological success of army ants has been the subject of considerable debate. This \\\"army ant syn-drome\\\" has been argued to have arisen once or multiple times within the ant subfamily Dorylinae. To address this question I generated data from 2,166 loci and a comprehensive taxon sampling for a phylogenetic investigation. Most analyses show strong support for convergent evolution of the army ant syndrome in the Old and New World but certain relationships are sensitive to analytics. I examine the signal present in this data set and find that conflict is diminished when only loci less likely to violate common phylogenetic model assumptions are considered. I also provide a temporal and spatial context for doryline evolution with timecalibrated, biogeographic, and diversification rate shift analyses. This study underscores the need for cautious analysis of phylogenomic data and calls for more efficient algorithms employing better-fitting models of molecular evolution.\\n\\nSignificanceRecent interpretation of army ant evolution holds that army ant behavior and morphology originated only once within the subfamily Dorylinae. An inspection of phylogenetic signal in a large new data set shows that support for this hypothesis may be driven by bias present in the data. Convergent evolution of the army ant syndrome is consistently supported when sequences violating assumptions of a commonly used model of sequence evolution are excluded from the analysis. This hypothesis also fits with a simple scenario of doryline biogeography. These results highlight the importance of careful evaluation of signal and conflict within phylogenomic data sets, even when taxon sampling is comprehensive.",

Analysis of these datasets supports the definition of the patterns of infection and colonization/contamination. Although 16S rDNA sequencing was more sensitive, whole genome shotgun sequencing allowed for a more comprehensive and unbiased representation of the microbial flora, including eukarya and viral pathogens, and of bacterial virulence factors. Urine samples positive by whole genome shotgun sequencing contained a plethora of bacterial (median 41 genera/sample), eukarya (median 2 species/sample) and viral sequences (median 3 viruses/sample). Genomic analyses revealed cases of infection with potential pathogens (e.g., Alloscardovia sp, Actinotignum sp, Ureaplasma sp) that are often missed during routine urine culture due to species specific growth requirements.

    "abstract": "The goal of computational neuroscience is to find mechanistic explanations of how the nervous system processes information to give rise to cognitive function and behaviour. At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied, which map sensory stimuli to neural responses and/or neural to behavioural responses. These models range from simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term \\\"neural network\\\" suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNNs neglect many details of biological neural networks. These simplifications contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling them to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs excel at predicting neural responses to novel sensory stimuli with accuracies well beyond any other currently available model type. DNNs can have millions of parameters, which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for successful task performance. Contrary to the intuition that this renders them into impenetrable black boxes, the computational properties of the network units are the result of four directly manipulable elements: input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. With full access to the activity and connectivity of all units, advanced visualization techniques, and analytic tools to map network representations to neural data, DNNs represent a powerful framework for building task-performing models and will drive substantial insights in computational neuroscience.",

This primary ratchet can arise without appeal to specialized cognitive adaptations and is plausibly more widespread in animal societies. We use a simple model to highlight how simple forms of contingent social learning can create the primary ratchet effect, dramatically increasing the prevalence of adaptive, hard to invent behavior. We investigate some ways that demography may interact with the primary ratchet to generate patterns of cultural variation.

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing importance of non-targeted metabolomics to answer various life science questions, extracting biochemically relevant information from metabolomics spectral data is still an incompletely solved problem. Most computational tools to identify tandem mass spectra focus on a limited set of molecules of interest. However, such tools are typically constrained by the availability of reference spectra or molecular databases, limiting their applicability to identify unknown metabolites. In contrast, recent advances in the field illustrate the possibility to expose the underlying biochemistry without relying on metabolite identification, in particular via substructure prediction. We describe an automated method for substructure recommendation motivated by association rule mining. Our framework captures potential relationships between spectral features and substructures learned from public spectral libraries. These associations are used to recommend substructures for any unknown mass spectrum. Our method does not require any predefined metabolite candidates, and therefore it can be used for the partial identification of unknown unknowns. The method is called MESSAR (MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender) and is implemented in a free online web service available at messar.biodatamining.be.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMass spectrometry is one of most used techniques to detect and identify metabolites. However, learning metabolite structures directly from mass spectrometry data has always been a challenging task. Thousands of mass spectra from various biological systems still remain unanalyzed simply because no current bioinformatic tools are able to generate structural hypotheses. By manually studying mass spectra of standard compounds, chemists discovered that metabolites that share common substructures can also share spectral features. As data scientists, we believe that such relationships can be unraveled from massive structure and spectra data by machine learning. In this study, we adapted \\\"association rule mining\\\", traditionally used in market basket analysis, to structural and spectral data, allowing us to investigate all spectral features - metabolite substructures relationships. We further collected all statistically sound relationships into a database and used them to assign substructral hypotheses to unexplored spectra. We named our approach MESSAR, MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender, available to the metabolomics and mass spectrometry community as a free and open web service.",

    "abstract": "Plant mating systems have profound effects on levels and structuring of genetic variation, and can affect the impact of natural selection. While theory predicts that intermediate outcrossing rates may allow plants to prevent accumulation of deleterious alleles, few studies have empirically tested this prediction using genomic data. Here, we study the effect of mating system on purifying selection by conducting population genomic analyses on whole-genome resequencing data from 38 European individuals of the arctic-alpine crucifer Arabis alpina. We find that outcrossing and mixed-mating populations maintain genetic diversity at similar levels, whereas highly self-fertilizing Scandinavian A. alpina show a strong reduction in genetic diversity, most likely as a result of a postglacial colonization bottleneck. We further find evidence for accumulation of genetic load in highly self-fertilizing populations, whereas the genome-wide impact of purifying selection does not differ greatly between mixed-mating and outcrossing populations. Our results demonstrate that intermediate levels of outcrossing may allow efficient selection against harmful alleles whereas demographic effects can be important for relaxed purifying selection in highly selfing populations. Thus, both mating system and demography shape the impact of purifying selection on genomic variation in A. alpina. These results are important for an improved understanding of the evolutionary consequences of mating system variation and the maintenance of mixed-mating strategies.\\n\\nSignificanceIntermediate outcrossing rates are theoretically predicted to maintain effective selection against harmful alleles, but few studies have empirically tested this prediction using genomic data. We used whole-genome resequencing data from alpine rock-cress to study how genetic variation and purifying selection vary with mating system. We find that populations with intermediate outcrossing rates have similar levels of genetic diversity as outcrossing populations, and that purifying selection against harmful alleles is efficient in mixed-mating populations. In contrast, self-fertilizing populations from Scandinavia have strongly reduced genetic diversity, and accumulate harmful mutations, likely as a result of demographic effects of postglacial colonization. Our results suggest that mixed-mating populations can avoid the negative evolutionary consequences of high self-fertilization rates.",

    "abstract": "Individuals often interact more closely with some members of the population (e.g. offspring, siblings or group members) than they do with other individuals. This structuring of interactions can lead to multilevel natural selection, where traits expressed at the group-level influence fitness alongside individual-level traits. Such multilevel selection can alter evolutionary trajectories, yet is rarely quantified in the wild, especially for species that do not interact in clearly demarcated groups. We quantified multilevel natural selection on two traits, postnatal growth rate and birth date, in a population of North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). The strongest level of selection was typically within-acoustic social neighbourhoods (within 130m of the nest), where growing faster and being born earlier than nearby litters was key, while selection on growth rate was also apparent both within-litters and within-study areas. Higher population densities increased the strength of selection for earlier breeding, but did not influence selection on growth rates. Females experienced especially strong selection on growth rate at the within-litter level, possibly linked to the biased bequeathal of the maternal territory to daughters. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering multilevel and sex-specific selection in wild species, including those that are territorial and sexually monomorphic.\\n\\nData archival: the data set is archived on Dryad (info XXX), with a five-year embargo from the date of publication.",

As the number of published shRNA and CRISPR perturbation screens in cancer cell lines expands, there is an opportunity for integrative analysis that goes further than pairwise synthetic lethality and discovers genetic vulnerabilities of related sets of cell lines. We re-analyze over 100 high-quality, genome-scale shRNA screens in human cancer cell lines and derive a quantitative fitness score for each gene that accurately reflects genotype-specific gene essentiality. We identify pairs of genes with correlated essentiality profiles and merge them into a cancer coessentiality network, where shared patterns of genetic vulnerability in cell lines give rise to clusters of functionally related genes in the network. Network clustering discriminates among all three defined subtypes of breast cancer cell lines (basal, luminal, and Her2-amplified), and further identifies novel subsets of Her2+ and ovarian cancer cells. We demonstrate the utility of the network as a platform for both hypothesis-driven and data-driven discovery of context-specific essential genes and their associated biomarkers.",

Curative therapies and vaccines are lacking. Currently, Cryptosporidium oocysts for research must be freshly produced in animals and cannot be long-term stored. Here, we show that COLO-680N cells infected with two different Cryptosporidium parvum strains (Moredun, Iowa) produce sufficient infectious oocysts to infect subsequent cultures. Oocyst identity was confirmed by specific staining (Crypt-a-glo, Vicia Villosa lectin, Sporo-glo), PCR-based amplification of Cryptosporidium-specific genes, lipidomics fingerprinting, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Antibody-stained oocysts produced unstained oocysts confirming production of novel oocysts. Infected cultures could be cryoconserved and continued to produce infectious oocysts after resuscitation. Transmission electron microscopy identified all key Cryptosporidium life cycle stages. Infected cultures produced thick-walled (primarily involved in Cryptosporidium transmission between organisms) and thin-walled oocysts (important for Cryptosporidium propagation within a host/tissue) as indicated by DAPI staining (only thin-walled oocysts are permeable to DAPI staining, thus allowing visualisation of sporozoites) and AFM. In conclusion, we present a novel, easy-to-handle cell culture system that enables the propagation, cryopreservation and detailed investigation of Cryptosporidium at a laboratory scale. Its availability will accelerate research on Cryptosporidium and the development of anti-Cryptosporidium drugs.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of Return (IOR) refers to a slowing of response times (RTs) for visual stimuli repeated at the same spatial location, as compared to stimuli occurring at novel locations. The functional mechanisms and the neural bases of this phenomenon remain debated. Here we present FORTIOR, a model of the cortical control of visual IOR in the human brain. The model is based on known facts about the anatomical and functional organization of fronto-parietal attention networks, and accounts for a broad range of behavioral findings in healthy participants and brain-damaged patients. FORTIOR does that by combining four principles of asymmetry: O_LIAsymmetry in the networks topography, whereby the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) nodes are lateralized to the right hemisphere, causing higher activation levels in the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal eye field (FEF) nodes.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetry in inter-hemispheric connectivity, in which inter-hemispheric connections from left hemisphere IPS to right hemisphere IPS and from left hemisphere FEF to right hemisphere FEF are weaker than in the opposite direction.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetry of visual inputs, stipulating that the FEF receives direct visual input coming from the ipsilateral visual cortex, while the right TPJ and vlPFC and IPS nodes receive input from both the contralateral and the ipsilateral visual fields.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetry in the response modality, with a higher response threshold for the manual response system than that required to trigger a saccadic response.

    "abstract": "A prominent feature of brain activity with relevance to cognitive processes is Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) between slow and fast oscillatory signals. A newly developed neural mass model of cross-frequency coupling [1] predicts, counter-intuitively, that PAC shows sustained increases after repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). This is because rTMS leads to simultaneous neuronal firing in distinct regions, thereby enhancing the connectivity that, according to the model, is needed for PAC to be increased. We tested this prediction in healthy human volunteers. Two seconds of 10Hz rTMS were applied to the intraparietal sulcus, temporal-parietal junction, and lateral occipital complex. PAC in the subsequent electro-encephalogram was analyzed for two band pairs, theta-gamma and alpha-gamma, and compared to a sham condition. For all stimulation loci, PAC was higher in both band pairs after rTMS than in the sham condition. These results were found to be conform the model prediction. The perspective for using rTMS to modulate cross-band coupling is discussed.",

    "abstract": "To study sensory representations, neuroscientists record neural activities while presenting different stimuli to the animal. From these data, we identify neurons whose activities depend systematically on each aspect of the stimulus. These neurons are said to be \\\"tuned\\\" to that stimulus feature. It is typically assumed that these tuned neurons represent the stimulus feature in their firing, whereas any \\\"untuned\\\" neurons do not contribute to its representation. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that in some circumstances, neurons that are untuned to a particular stimulus feature can contribute to its representation. These findings suggest that, by ignoring untuned neurons, our understanding of population coding might be incomplete. At the same time, several key questions remain unanswered: Are the impacts of untuned neurons on population coding due to weak tuning that is nevertheless below the threshold the experimenters set for calling neurons tuned (vs untuned)? Do these effects hold for different population sizes and/or correlation structures? And could neural circuit function ever benefit from having some untuned neurons vs having all neurons be tuned to the stimulus? Using theoretical calculations and analyses of in vivo neural data, I answer those questions by: a) showing how, in the presence of correlated variability, untuned neurons can enhance sensory information coding, for a variety of population sizes and correlation structures; b) demonstrating that this effect does not rely on weak tuning; and c) identifying conditions under which the neural code can be made more informative by replacing some of the tuned neurons with untuned ones. These conditions specify when there is a functional benefit to having untuned neurons.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the visual system, most neurons firing rates are tuned to various aspects of the stimulus (motion, contrast, etc.). For each stimulus feature, however some neurons appear to be untuned: their firing rates do not depend on that stimulus feature. Previous work on information coding in neural populations ignored untuned neurons, assuming that only the neurons tuned to a given stimulus feature contribute to its encoding. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that neurons with no apparent tuning can sometimes contribute to information coding. However, key questions remain unanswered. First, how do the untuned neurons contribute to information coding, and could this effect rely on those neurons having weak tuning that was overlooked? Second, does the function of a neural circuit ever benefit from having some neurons untuned? Or should every neuron be tuned (even weakly) to every stimulus feature? Here, I use mathematical calculations and analyses of data from the mouse visual cortex to answer those questions. First, I show how (and why) correlations between neurons enable the untuned neurons to contribute to information coding. Second, I show that neural populations can often do a better job of encoding a given stimulus feature when some of the neurons are untuned for that stimulus feature. Thus, it may be best for the brain to segregate its tuning, leaving some neurons untuned for each stimulus feature. Along with helping to explain how the brain processes external stimuli, this work has strong implications for attempts to decode brain signals, to control brain-machine interfaces: better performance could be obtained if the activities of all neurons are decoded, as opposed to only those with strong tuning.",

The process of mechanosensation is complex, and involves elements such as the cytoskeleton and active contraction from myosin motors. Ultimately, mechanosensation is connected to changes in gene expression in the cell, or mechanotransduction. While the involvement of the cytoskeleton in mechanosensation is known, processes upstream to cytoskeletal changes is unclear. In this paper, using a microfluidic device that mechanically compresses live cells, we demonstrate that calcium currents and membrane tension-sensitive ion channels directly signals to the Rho GTPase and myosin contraction. In response to membrane tension changes, cell actively regulates cortical myosin contraction to balance external forces. The process is captured by a mechanochemical model where membrane tension, myosin contraction and the osmotic pressure difference between the cytoplasm and extracellular environment are connected by mechanical force-balance. Finally, to complete the picture of mechanotransduction, we find that the tension-sensitive transcription factor YAP translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to mechanical compression.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial insect colonies are defined by extreme variation in reproductive activity among castes, but the ancestral conditions from which this variation arose are unknown. Investigating the factors that contribute to variation in reproductive physiology among solitary insects that are closely related to social species can help to fill this gap. We experimentally tested the role of nutrition, juvenile hormone, and social cues on reproductive maturation in solitary alkali bees (Halictidae: Nomia melanderi). We find that alkali bee females emerge from overwintering with small Dufour's glands and small ovaries, containing oocytes in the early stages of development. Oocyte maturation occurs rapidly, and is staggered between the two ovaries. Lab-reared females reached reproductive maturity without access to mates or nesting opportunities, and many had resorbed oocytes. Initial activation of these reproductive structures does not depend on pollen consumption, though dietary protein or lipids may be necessary for long-term reproductive activity. JH is likely to be a limiting factor in alkali bee reproductive activation, as females treated with JH were more likely to develop mature oocytes and Dufour's glands. Unlike for related social bees, the effects of JH were not suppressed by the presence of older, reproductive females. These results provide important insight into the factors that influence reproductive activity in an important native pollinator, and those that may have been particularly important in the evolution of reproductive castes.",
