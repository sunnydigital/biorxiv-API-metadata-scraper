    "abstract": "Genome-wide proximity placement analysis of diverse families of human-specific genomic regulatory loci (HSGRL) identified topologically-associating domains (TADs) that are significantly enriched for HSGRL and termed rapidly-evolving in humans TADs (revTADs; Genome Biol Evol. 2016 8; 2774-88). Here, human-specific genomic features of pluripotency regulatory networks in hESC have been analyzed. The primary focus was on identification of human-specific elements of the interphase chromatin architecture of TADs responsible for transcriptional regulatory control of the NANOG, POU5F1, and POU3F2 genes. Comparative analyses of the four adjacent TADs spanning ~3.3 Mb NANOG locus-associated genomic region were carried-out to highlight primate-specific genomic features. Lastly, the putative mechanisms of the genome-wide regulatory effects of human-specific NANOG-binding sites (HSNBS) on expression of genes implicated in the fetal and adult brain development have been examined. Acquisition of primate-specific regulatory loci appears to rewire TADs exerting transcriptional control on pluripotency regulators, revealing a genomic placement pattern consistent with the enhanced regulatory impact of NANOG in primates. Proximity placement analysis of HSNBS identified a large expression signature in the human fetal neocortex temporal lobe comprising 4,957 genes, which appear to retain acquired in the embryo expression changes for many years of human brain development and maintain highly concordant expression profiles in the neocortex and prefrontal cortex regions of adult human brain. Collectively, reported herein observations indicate that genomic elements of pluripotency regulatory circuitry associated with HSNBS, specifically proteins of the classical NurD chromatin remodeling complex, contribute to transcriptional regulation of a large set of genes implicated in development and function of human brain.\\n\\nList of abbreviations5hmC, 5-Hydromethylcytosine\\n\\nCTCF, CCCTC-binding factor\\n\\nDHS, DNase hypersensitivity sites\\n\\nFHSRR, fixed human-specific regulatory regions\\n\\nGRNs, genomic regulatory networks\\n\\nHAR, human accelerated regions\\n\\nhCONDEL, human-specific conserved deletions\\n\\nhESC, human embryonic stem cells\\n\\nHSGRL, human-specific genomic regulatory loci\\n\\nHSNBS, human-specific NANOG-binding sites\\n\\nHSTFBS, human-specific transcription factor-binding sites\\n\\nLAD, lamina-associated domain\\n\\nLINE, long interspersed nuclear element\\n\\nlncRNA, long non-coding RNA\\n\\nLTR, long terminal repeat\\n\\nMADE, methylation-associated DNA editing\\n\\nmC, methylcytosine\\n\\nmESC, mouse embryonic stem cells\\n\\nNANOG, Nanog homeobox\\n\\nnt, nucleotide\\n\\nPOU5F1, POU class 5 homeobox 1\\n\\nPSDS, partial strand displacement state\\n\\nTAD, topologically associating domains\\n\\nTE, transposable elements\\n\\nTF, transcription factor\\n\\nTSC, triple-stranded complex\\n\\nTSS, transcription start sites\\n\\nSE, super-enhancers\\n\\nSED, super-enhancer domains\\n\\nsncRNA, small non coding RNA",

    "abstract": "Features selection is a key step in many single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) analyses. Feature selection is intended to preserve biologically relevant information while removing genes only subject to technical noise. As it is frequently performed prior to dimensionality reduction, clustering and pseudotime analyses, feature selection can have a major impact on the results. Several different approaches have been proposed for unsupervised feature selection from unprocessed single-cell expression matrices, most based upon identifying highly variable genes in the dataset. We present two methods which take advantage of the prevalence of zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data to identify features. We show that dropout-based feature selection outperforms variance-based feature selection for multiple applications of single-cell RNASeq.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHigh throughput sequencing methods produce massive amounts of data. The most common first step in interpretation of these data is to map the data to genomic intervals and then overlap with genome annotations. A major interest in computational genomics is spatial genome-wide correlation among genomic features (e.g. between transcription and histone modification). The key hypothesis here is that features that are similarly distributed along a genome may be functionally related.\\n\\nResultsHere, we propose a method that rapidly estimates genomewide correlation of genomic annotations; these annotations can be derived from high throughput experiments, databases, or other means. The method goes far beyond the simple overlap and proximity tests that are commonly used, by enabling correlation of continuous data, so that the loss of data that occurs upon reduction to intervals is unnecessary. To include analysis of nonoverlapping but spatially related features, we use kernel correlation. Implementation of this method allows for correlation analysis of two or three profiles across the human genome in a few minutes on a personal computer. Another novel and extraordinarily powerful feature of our approach is the local correlation track output that enables overlap with other correlations (correlation of correlations). We applied our method to the datasets from the Human Epigenome Atlas and FANTOM CAGE. We observed the changes of the correlation between epigenomic features across developmental trajectories of several tissue types, and found unexpected strong spatial correlation of CAGE clusters with splicing donor sites and with poly(A) sites.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe StereoGene C++ source code, program documentation, Galaxy integration scrips and examples are available at the project homepage at http://stereogene.bioinf.fbb.msu.ru/\\n\\nContactfavorov@sensi.org\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online.",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies have revealed evidence of both parts-based and holistic representations of objects and faces in the primate visual system. However, it is still a mystery how such seemingly contradictory types of processing can coexist within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theory called mixture of sparse coding models, inspired by the formation of category-specific subregions in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. We developed a hierarchical network that constructed a mixture of two sparse coding submodels on top of a simple Gabor analysis. The submodels were each trained with face or non-face object images, which resulted in separate representations of facial parts and object parts. Importantly, evoked neural activities were modeled by Bayesian inference, which had a top-down explaining-away effect that enabled recognition of an individual part to depend strongly on the category of the whole input. We show that this explaining-away effect was indeed crucial for the units in the face submodel to exhibit significant selectivity to face images over object images in a similar way to actual face-selective neurons in the macaque IT cortex. Furthermore, the model explained, qualitatively and quantitatively, several tuning properties to facial features found in the middle patch of face processing in IT as documented by Freiwald, Tsao, and Livingstone (2009). These included, in particular, tuning to only a small number of facial features that were often related to geometrically large parts like face outline and hair, preference and anti-preference of extreme facial features (e.g., very large/small inter-eye distance), and reduction of the gain of feature tuning for partial face stimuli compared to whole face stimuli. Thus, we hypothesize that the coding principle of facial features in the middle patch of face processing in the macaque IT cortex may be closely related to mixture of sparse coding models.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic datasets contain billions of protein sequences that could greatly enhance large-scale functional annotation and structure prediction. Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of million of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 hours on a single server to 50% sequence identity, > 1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases. (Open-source software and Metaclust database: https://mmseqs.org/).",

    "abstract": "In light of increasing terrestrial carbon (C) transport across aquatic boundaries, the mechanisms governing organic carbon (OC) oxidation along terrestrial-aquatic interfaces are crucial to future climate predictions. Here, we investigate the biochemistry, metabolic pathways, and thermodynamics corresponding to OC oxidation in the Columbia River corridor using ultra-high resolution C characterization. We leverage natural vegetative differences to encompass variation in terrestrial C inputs. Our results suggest that decreases in terrestrial C deposition associated with diminished riparian vegetation induce oxidation of physically -bound OC. We also find that contrasting metabolic pathways oxidize OC in the presence and absence of vegetation and--in direct conflict with the  priming concept--that inputs of water-soluble and thermodynamically favorable terrestrial OC protects bound-OC from oxidation. In both environments, the most thermodynamically favorable compounds appear to be preferentially oxidized regardless of which OC pool microbiomes metabolize. In turn, we suggest that the extent of riparian vegetation causes sediment microbiomes to locally adapt to oxidize a particular pool of OC, but that common thermodynamic principles govern the oxidation of each pool (i.e., water-soluble or physically-bound). Finally, we propose a mechanistic conceptualization of OC oxidation along terrestrial-aquatic interfaces that can be used to model heterogeneous patterns of OC loss under changing land cover distributions.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LIRiparian vegetation protects bound-OC stocks\\nC_LIO_LIBiochemical processes associated with OC oxidation vary with vegetation conditions\\nC_LIO_LICommon thermodynamic principles underlie OC oxidation regardless of vegetation conditions\\nC_LI",

We have developed the first recombinant expression system in E. coli to produce a construct of human FGFR2 containing its transmembrane and extracellular receptor domains. We demonstrate that the expressed construct is functional in binding heparin and dimerizing. Size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that the purified FGFR2 does not form a complex with FGF1 or adopts an inactive dimer conformation. Progress towards the successful recombinant production of intact FGFRs will facilitate further biochemical experiments and structure determination that will provide insight into how extracellular FGF binding activates intracellular kinase activity.",

    "abstract": "Microbial N2 fixation (diazotrophy) represents an important nitrogen source to oligotrophic peatland ecosystems, which are important sinks for atmospheric CO2 and susceptible to changing climate. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the active microbial group and type of nitrogenase mediating diazotrophy in a ombrotrophic Sphagnum-dominated peat bog (the S1 peat bog, Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA); and (ii) to determine the effect of environmental parameters (light, O2, CO2, CH4) on potential rates of diazotrophy measured by acetylene (C2H2) reduction and 15N2 incorporation. Molecular analysis of metabolically active microbial communities suggested that diazotrophy in surface peat was primarily mediated by Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae). Despite higher dissolved vanadium (V; 11 nM) than molybdenum (Mo; 3 nM) in surface peat, a combination of metagenomic, amplicon sequencing and activity measurements indicated that Mo-containing nitrogenases dominate over the V-containing form. Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water content. Incorporation of15N2 was suppressed 90% by O2 and 55% by C2H2, and was unaffected by CH4 and CO2 amendments. These results suggest that peatland diazotrophy is mediated by a combination of C2H2 - sensitive and C2H2 - insensitive microbes that are more active at low O2 and show similar activity at high and low CH4.\\n\\nImportancePrevious studies indicate that diazotrophy provides an important nitrogen source and is linked to methanotrophy in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. However, the environmental controls and enzymatic pathways of peatland diazotrophy, as well as the metabolically active microbial populations that catalyze this process remain in question. Our findings indicate that oxygen levels and photosynthetic activity override low nutrient availability in limiting diazotrophy, and that members of the Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales) catalyze this process at the bog surface using the molybdenum - based form of the nitrogenase enzyme.",

Here, we have studied the differences in ERPs between the left (C3) and right (C4) central leads and relation of this asymmetry to ADHD diagnosed using DSM.\\n\\nMethods20 typically developing (TD) boys and 19 boys diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM-IV-TR, aged 10-13 years, were examined by the Attentional Network Test (ANT), with simultaneous recording of the respective ERPs.

According to the current perception, both periplasmic and {beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins ({beta}-barrel OMPs) are translocated via the SecYEG translocon in bacterial cells, although direct living cell evidences remain lacking. Here, mainly via in vivo protein photo-crosslinking analysis, we revealed that the never reported membrane-integrated SecAN protein apparently functions as the translocon for {beta}-barrel OMPs. Additionally, SecAN contains a GXXXG motif known for mediating protein interactions in biomembranes, and processing of {beta}-barrel OMP precursors was severely affected in cells producing an assembly-defective SecAN variant resulted from the GXXXG motif mutations. Furthermore, SecAN was demonstrated to directly interact with the Bam complex, thus likely be a part of the supercomplex that we revealed earlier to be responsible for {beta}-barrel OMP biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide molecular gene expression studies generally compare expression values for each gene across multiple conditions followed by cluster and gene set enrichment analysis to determine whether differentially expressed genes are enriched in specific biochemical pathways, cellular components, biological processes, and/or molecular functions, etc. This approach to analyzing differences in gene expression enables discovery of gene function, but is not useful to determine whether pre-defined groups of genes share or diverge in their expression patterns in response to treatments nor to assess the correctness of pre-defined gene set groupings. Here we present a simple method that changes the dimension of comparison by treating genes as variable traits to directly assess significance of differences in expression levels among pre-defined gene groups. Because expression distributions are typically skewed (thus unfit for direct assessment using Gaussian statistical methods) our method involves transforming expression data to approximate a normal distribution followed by dividing the genes into groups, then applying Gaussian parametric methods to assess significance of observed differences. This method enables the assessment of differences in gene expression distributions within and across samples, enabling hypothesis-based comparison among groups of genes. We demonstrate this method by assessing the significance of specific gene groups differential response to heat stress conditions in maize.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Genes capable of conferring resistance to clinically used antibiotics have been found in many different natural environments. However, a concise overview of the resistance genes found in common human bacterial pathogens is lacking, which complicates risk ranking of environmental reservoirs. Here, we present an analysis of potential antibiotic resistance genes in the 17 most common bacterial pathogens isolated from humans. We analyzed more than 20,000 bacterial genomes and defined a clinical resistome as the set of resistance genes found across these genomes. Using this database, we uncovered the co-occurrence frequencies of the resistance gene clusters within each species enabling identification of co-dissemination and co-selection patterns. The resistance genes identified in this study represent the subset of the environmental resistome that is clinically relevant and the dataset and approach provides a baseline for further investigations into the abundance of clinically relevant resistance genes across different environments. To facilitate an easy overview the data is presented at the species level at www.resistome.biosustain.dtu.dk.",

    "abstract": "Measuring synaptic connectivity in large neuronal populations remains a major goal of modern neuroscience. While this connectivity is traditionally revealed by anatomical methods such as electron microscopy, an efficient alternative is to computationally infer functional connectivity from recordings of neural activity. However, these statistical techniques still require further refinement before they can be reliably applied to real data. Here, we report significant improvements to a deep learning method for functional connectomics, as assayed on synthetic ChaLearn Connectomics data. The method, which integrates recent advances in convolutional neural network architecture and model-free partial correlation coefficients, outperforms published methods on competition data and can achieve over 90% precision at 1% recall on validation datasets. This suggests that future application of the model to in vivo whole-brain imaging data in larval zebrafish could reliably recover on the order of 106 synaptic connections with a 10% false discovery rate. The model also generalizes to networks with different underlying connection probabilities and should scale well when parallelized across multiple GPUs. The method offers real potential as a statistical complement to existing experiments and circuit hypotheses in neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "An important application of genomic selection in plant breeding is the prediction of untested single crosses (SCs). Most investigations on the prediction efficiency were based on tested SCs, using cross-validation. The main objective was to assess the prediction efficiency by correlating the predicted and true genotypic values of untested SCs (accuracy) and measuring the efficacy of identification of the best 300 untested SCs (coincidence), using simulated data. We assumed 10,000 SNPs, 400 QTLs, two groups of 70 selected DH lines, and 4,900 SCs. The heritabilities for the assessed SCs were 30, 60 and 100%. The scenarios included three sampling processes of DH lines, two sampling processes of SCs for testing, two SNP densities, DH lines from distinct and same populations, DH lines from populations with lower LD, two genetic models, three statistical models, and three statistical approaches. We derived a model for genomic prediction based on SNP average effects of substitution and dominance deviations. The prediction accuracy is not affected by the linkage phase. The prediction of untested SCs is very efficient. The accuracies and coincidences ranged from approximately 0.8 and 0.5, respectively, under low heritability, to 0.9 and 0.7, assuming high heritability. Additionally, we highlighted the relevance of the overall LD and evidenced that efficient prediction of untested SCs can be achieved for crops that show no heterotic pattern, for reduced training set size (10%), for SNP density of 1 cM, and for distinct sampling processes of DH lines, based on random choice of the SCs for testing.",

    "abstract": "The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in megabase-scale areas of highly interacting chromatin known as topologically associating domains (TADs), typically identified by computational analyses of Hi-C sequencing data. TADs are demarcated by boundaries that are largely conserved across cell types and even across species, although, increasing evidence suggests that the seemingly invariant TAD boundaries may exhibit plasticity and their insulating strength can vary. However, a genome-wide characterization of TAD boundary strength in mammals is still lacking. A systematic classification and characterization of TAD boundaries may generate new insights into their function. In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize TAD boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher TAD boundary insulation scores are associated with elevated CTCF levels and that they may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancer elements are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries, i.e. boundaries of higher insulation score. Furthermore, we perform a pan-cancer analysis to demonstrate that strong TAD boundaries and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated in cancer patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons and Parkinsons Diseases (HD and PD) are neurodegenerative disorders that share some pathological features but are disparate in others. For example, while both diseases are marked by aberrant protein aggregation in the brain, the specific proteins that aggregate and types of neurons affected differ. A better understanding of the molecular similarities and differences between these two diseases may lead to a more complete mechanistic picture of both the individual diseases and the neurodegenerative process in general. We sought to characterize the common transcriptional signature of HD and PD as well as genes uniquely implicated in each of these diseases using mRNA-Seq data from post mortem human brains in comparison to neuropathologically normal controls. The enriched biological pathways implicated by HD differentially expressed genes show remarkable consistency with those for PD differentially expressed genes and implicate the common biological processes of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, transcriptional dysregulation, and neuron-associated functions. Comparison of the differentially expressed (DE) genes highlights a set of consistently altered genes that span both diseases. In particular, processes involving nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are the most prominent among the genes common to HD and PD. When the combined HD and PD data are compared to controls, relatively few additional biological processes emerge as significantly enriched suggesting that most pathways are independently seen within each disorder. Despite showing comparable numbers of DE genes, DE genes unique to HD are enriched in far more coherent biological processes than the DE genes unique to PD, suggesting that PD may represent a more heterogeneous disorder.",

    "abstract": "Behavior which deviates from our normative expectations often appears irrational. A classic example concerns the question of how choice should be distributed among multiple alternatives. The so-called matching law predicts that the fraction of choices made to any option should match the fraction of total rewards earned from the option. This choice strategy can maximize reward in a stationary reward schedule. Empirically, however, behavior often deviates from this ideal. While such deviations have often been interpreted as reflecting  noisy, suboptimal, decision-making, here we instead suggest that they reflect a strategy which is adaptive in nonstationary and uncertain environments. We analyze the results of a dynamic foraging task. Animals exhibited significant deviations from matching, and animals turned out to be able to collect more rewards when deviation was larger. We show that this behavior can be understood if one considers that animals had incomplete information about the environments dynamics. In particular, using computational models, we show that in such nonstationary environments, learning on both fast and slow timescales is beneficial. Learning on fast timescales means that an animal can react to sudden changes in the environment, though this inevitably introduces large fluctuations (variance) in value estimates. Concurrently, learning on slow timescales reduces the amplitude of these fluctuations at the price of introducing a bias that causes systematic deviations. We confirm this prediction in data - monkeys indeed solved the bias-variance tradeoff by combining learning on both fast and slow timescales. Our work suggests that multi-timescale learning could be a biologically plausible mechanism for optimizing decisions under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Label-free quantification using data-independent acquisition (DIA) is a robust method for deep and accurate proteome quantification1,2. However, when lacking a pre-existing spectral library, as is often the case with studies of novel post-translational modifications (PTMs), samples are typically analyzed several times: one or more data dependent acquisitions (DDA) are used to generate a spectral library followed by DIA for quantification. This type of multi-injection analysis results in significant cost with regard to sample consumption and instrument time for each new PTM study, and may not be possible when sample amount is limiting and/or studies require a large number of biological replicates. Recently developed software (e.g. DIA-Umpire) has enabled combined peptide identification and quantification from a data-independent acquisition without any pre-existing spectral library3,4. Still, these tools are designed for protein level quantification. Here we demonstrate a software tool and workflow that extends DIA-Umpire to allow automated identification and quantification of PTM peptides from DIA.

    "abstract": "KAMO and Blend provide particularly effective tools to manage automatically the merging of large numbers of datasets from serial crystallography. The requirement for manual intervention in the process can be reduced by extending Blend to support additional clustering options such as use of more accurate cell distance metrics and use of reflection-intensity correlation coefficients to infer \"distances\" among sets of reflec- tions. This increases the sensitivity to differences in unit cell parameters and allows for clustering to assemble nearly complete datasets on the basis of intensity or ampli- tude differences. If datasets are already sufficiently complete to permit it, one applies KAMO once and clusters the data using intensities only. If starting from incomplete datasets, one applies KAMO twice, first using cell parameters. In this step we use either the simple cell vector distance of the original Blend, or we use the more sensi- tive NCDist. This step tends to find clusters of sufficient size so that, when merged, each cluster is sufficiently complete to allow reflection intensities or amplitudes to be compared. One then uses KAMO again using the correlation between the reflections having a common hkl to merge clusters in a way sensitive to structural differences that may not have perturbed the cell parameters sufficiently to make meaningful clusters.\n\nMany groups have developed effective clustering algorithms that use a measurable physical parameter from each diffraction still or wedge to cluster the data into cate- gories which then can be merged, one hopes, to yield the electron density from a single protein form. Since these physical parameters are often largely independent from one another, it should be possible to greatly improve the efficacy of data clustering software by using a multi-stage partitioning strategy. Here, we have demonstrated one possible approach to multi-stage data clustering. Our strategy is to use unit-cell clustering until merged data is sufficiently complete then to use intensity-based clustering. We have demonstrated that, using this strategy, we are able to accurately cluster datasets from crystals that have subtle differences.",

Understanding the physics of such motor-filament materials is critical to developing a physical model of the cytoskeleton and the design of biomimetic active materials. Here, we demonstrate through experiments and simulations that the rigidity and connectivity of filaments in active biopolymer networks regulates the anisotropy and the length scale of the underlying deformations, yielding materials with varying contractility. Semi-flexible filaments that can be compressed and bent by motor stresses undergo deformations that are predominantly biaxial. By contrast, rigid filament bundles contract via actomyosin sliding deformations that are predominantly uniaxial. Networks dominated by filament buckling are robustly contractile under a wide range of connectivities, while networks dominated by actomyosin sliding can be tuned from contractile to extensile through reduced connectivity via cross-linking. These results identify physical parameters that control the forces generated within motor-filament arrays, and provide insight into the self-organization and mechanics of cytoskeletal assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Human Kif15 is a tetrameric kinesin-12 that contributes critically to bipolar spindle assembly in eukaryotes. Here we examine its single molecule mechanics. Under hindering loads, Kif15 steps predominantly towards microtubule plus ends, with its forestep:backstep ratio decreasing exponentially with load and stall occurring at ~6pN. Between steps, Kif15 binds stably, usually via a single head domain. By complete contrast, under assisting loads, Kif15 detaches rapidly, even in AMPPNP. Furthermore, Kif15 can autoinhibit, via an interaction requiring its C-terminus. Autoinhibited Kif15 binds microtubules nucleotide-independently, resists both hindering and assisting loads, and is further stabilized by Tpx2, which interacts with the Kif15 C-terminus. Our data reveal the mechanics of Kif15 to be extraordinarily sensitive to loading direction. When unloaded, it walks rapidly; when pulled forwards it slips and when pulled backwards it grips. We discuss the implications of this unique mechanical behaviour for the roles of Kif15 in spindle function.",

    "abstract": "Intercropping systems have been implemented in many parts of the world due to their beneficial effects on yield and biomass. In intercropping systems, changes in plant growth are usually related to variations in root distribution and phosphorus (P) levels, however, root distributions and root tendencies are difficult to study, as root systems grow beneath the soil surface. Therefore, we have a relatively poor understanding of the relationship between plant root interactions and plant growth in intercropping systems. In this study, a custom apparatus consisting of a transparent manual root box was used to observe intact root systems in situ. We investigated how root distribution and root tendency changed in a tomato/potato onion intercropping system under two P treatments, and how tomato plant growth was influenced. The results showed that the shoot and total biomass for the tomato plants were increased by intercropping with potato onion plants under both tested P levels, the root distribution of intercropped tomato plants was deeper than that of monocultured plants, and the tomato roots tended to grow away from the potato onion roots. Our research reveals that a deeper and more evasive root distribution is more conductive to the plant growth of the intercropped tomato.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTOur study can help more people clearly know the relationship between the root interactions and plant growth in mixed cultures.",

We demonstrate that RecBCD forces each protein into its nearest adjacent neighbor, causing rapid disruption of the underlying protein-nucleic acid interface. This mechanism is not simply the same way that RecBCD disrupts isolated nucleoprotein complexes on otherwise naked DNA. Instead, molecular crowding itself completely alters the mechanism by which RecBCD removes tightly bound protein obstacles from DNA.\\n\\nSignificance statementChromosomes are crowded places, and any nucleic acid motor proteins that act upon DNA must function within these crowded environments. How crowded environments affect motor protein behaviors remains largely unexplored. Here, we use single molecule fluorescence microscopy visualize the ATP-dependent motor protein RecBCD as it travels along crowded DNA molecules bearing long tandem arrays of DNA-binding proteins. Our findings show that RecBCD can push through highly crowded protein arrays while evicting the proteins from DNA. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that RecBCD forces the proteins into once another, causing rapid disruption of the protein-DNA interface. These findings may provide insights into how other types of motor proteins travel along crowded nucleic acids.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer surgery can promote tumour metastases and worsen prognosis, but the effects of perioperative complications such as sepsis, blood loss, and hypothermia on subsequent cancer metastases have not been addressed.\\n\\nObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of common perioperative factors on postoperative tumour metastases in murine models of cancer surgery. We hypothesize that perioperative blood loss, hypothermia, and sepsis facilitate tumour metastases in these murine models.\\n\\nMethodsPrior to surgery, pulmonary metastases were established by intravenous challenge of CT26LacZ colon cancer cells in Balb/c mice or B16LacZ melanoma cells in C57Bl/6 mice. Surgical stress was generated through partial hepatectomy (PH) or left nephrectomy (LN). Sepsis was induced by puncturing the cecum to express stool into the abdomen. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by removal of 30% of total blood volume via saphenous vein. Hypothermia was induced by removing the heating apparatus during surgery and lowering core body temperatures to 30{degrees}C. Lung tumour burden was quantified 3 days following surgery.\\n\\nResultsSurgically stressed mice subjected to Stage 3 hemorrhagic shock or hypothermia did not show an additional increase in lung tumour burden. In contrast, surgically stressed mice subjected to intraoperative sepsis demonstrated an additional 2-fold increase in the number of tumour metastases. Furthermore, natural killer (NK) cell function, as assessed by YAC-1 tumour cell lysis, was significantly attenuated in surgically stressed mice subjected to intraoperative sepsis. Both NK cell-mediated cytotoxic function and lung metastases were improved with perioperative administration of polyI:C, which is a ligand for toll-like receptor (TLR)-3\\n\\nConclusionsPerioperative sepsis, but not hemorrhagic shock or hypothermia, enhances the prometastatic effect of surgery in murine models of cancer. Identification of the mechanisms underlying perioperative immune suppression will be critical in the development of immunomodulation strategies that aim to attenuate perioperative metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional arrangement of the human genome comprises a complex network of structural and regulatory chromatin loops important for coordinating changes in transcription during human development. To better understand the mechanisms underlying context-specific 3D chromatin structure and transcription during cellular differentiation, we generated comprehensive in situ Hi-C maps of DNA loops during human monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. We demonstrate that dynamic looping events are regulatory rather than structural in nature and uncover widespread coordination of dynamic enhancer activity at preformed and acquired DNA loops. Enhancer-bound loop formation and enhancer-activation of preformed loops represent two distinct modes of regulation that together form multi-loop activation hubs at key macrophage genes. Activation hubs connect 3.4 enhancers per promoter and exhibit a strong enrichment for Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) binding events, suggesting multi-loop activation hubs driven by cell-type specific transcription factors may represent an important class of regulatory chromatin structures for the spatiotemporal control of transcription.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIHigh resolution and high sensitivity of loop detection via deeply sequenced in situ Hi-C experiments during monocyte to macrophage differentiation (> 10 billion total reads)\\nC_LIO_LIMulti-loop interaction communities identified surrounding key macrophage genes.\\nC_LIO_LIMulti-loop communities connect dynamic enhancers through both static and newly acquired DNA loops, forming hubs of activation\\nC_LIO_LIMacrophage activation hubs are enriched for AP-1 bound long-range enhancer interactions, suggesting cell-type specific TFs drive changes in 3D structure and transcription through regulatory DNA loops\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified over 150 regions of the genome that are associated with disease risk, yet there is little evidence that coding mutations contribute to this disorder. To explore the mechanism of non-coding regulatory elements in schizophrenia, we performed ATAC-seq on adult prefrontal cortex brain samples from 135 individuals with schizophrenia and 137 controls, and identified 118,152 ATAC-seq peaks. These accessible chromatin regions in brain are highly enriched for SNP-heritability for schizophrenia (10.6 fold enrichment, P=2.4x10-4, second only to genomic regions conserved in Eutherian mammals) and replicated in an independent dataset (9.0 fold enrichment, P=2.7x10-4). This degree of enrichment of schizophrenia heritability was higher than in open chromatin found in 138 different cell and tissue types. Brain open chromatin regions that overlapped highly conserved regions exhibited an even higher degree of heritability enrichment, indicating that conservation can identify functional subsets within regulatory elements active in brain. However, we did not identify chromatin accessibility differences between schizophrenia cases and controls, nor did we find an interaction of chromatin QTLs with case-control status. This indicates that although causal variants map within regulatory elements, mechanisms other than differential chromatin may govern the contribution of regulatory element variation to schizophrenia risk. Our results strongly implicate gene regulatory processes involving open chromatin in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and suggest a strategy to understand the hundreds of common variants emerging from large genomic studies of complex brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Nearly half of the human genome is made up of transposable elements (TEs) and there is evidence that TEs are involved in gene regulation. Here, we have integrated publicly available genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic data to investigate this in a genome-wide manner. A bootstrapping statistical method was applied to minimize the confounder effects from different repeat types. Our results show that although most TE classes are primarily associated with reduced gene expression, Alu elements are associated with up regulated gene expression. Furthermore, Alu elements had the highest probability of any TE class of contributing to regulatory regions of any type defined by chromatin state. This suggests a general model where clade specific SINEs may contribute more to gene regulation than ancient/ancestral TEs. Finally, non-coding regions were found to have a high probability of TE content within regulatory sequences, most notably in repressors. Our exhaustive analysis has extended and updated our understanding of TEs in terms of their global impact on gene regulation, and suggests that the most recently derived types of TEs, i.e. clade or species specific SINES, have the greatest overall impact on gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "During the last few years, rich-club (RC) organization has been studied as a possible brain-connectivity organization model for large-scale brain networks. At the same time, empirical and simulated data of neurophysiological models have demonstrated the significant role of intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling among distinct brain areas. The current study investigates further the importance of these couplings using recordings of resting-state magnetoencephalographic activity obtained from 30 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) subjects and 50 healthy controls. Intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling modes are incorporated in a single graph to detect group differences within individual rich-club subnetworks (type I networks) and networks connecting RC nodes with the rest of the nodes (type II networks). Our results show a higher probability of inter-frequency coupling for ({delta}-{gamma}1), ({delta}-{gamma}2), ({theta}-{beta}), ({theta}-{gamma}2), (-{gamma}2), ({gamma}1-{gamma}2) and intra-frequency coupling for ({gamma}1-{gamma}1) and ({delta}-{delta}) for both type I and type II networks in the mTBI group. Additionally, mTBI and control subjects can be correctly classified with high accuracy (98.6%), whereas a general linear regression model can effectively predict the subject group using the ratio of type I and type II coupling in the ({delta}, {theta}), ({delta}, {beta}), ({delta}, {gamma}1), and ({delta}, {gamma}2) frequency pairs. These findings support the presence of an RC organization simultaneously with dominant frequency interactions within a single functional graph. Our results demonstrate a hyperactivation of intrinsic RC networks in mTBI subjects compared to controls, which can be seen as a plausible compensatory mechanism for alternative frequency-dependent routes of information flow in mTBI subjects.",

    "abstract": "In the resting-state, extended regions of the human cortex engage in electrical oscillations within the alpha-frequency band (7-14 Hz) that can be measured outside the head by magnetoencephalography (MEG). Given the accumulating evidence that alpha oscillations play a fundamental role in attentional processing and working memory, it becomes increasingly important to characterize their cortical organization. Event-related studies have demonstrated that attentional allocation can modulate alpha power selectively within the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, as well as in higher-level regions. Such studies demonstrate the existence of multiple generators by exploiting experimental contrasts and trial-averaging. The identification of alpha generators from resting-state data alone has proven much harder and, consequently, relatively little is known about their organization: Apart from the classical visual, somatosensory, and auditory rhythms, it is unclear how many more generators can be observed with MEG and how they are organized into functional networks. Such knowledge, however, possibly enables to delineate separate cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes that co-occur in the resting-state and is therefore important. In this study we use the resting-state MEG data-set provided by the Human Connectome Project to identify cortical alpha generators and to characterize their organization into functional networks. The large number of subjects (N = 94), multiple scans per subject, and state-of-the-art surface-based cortical registration enable a detailed characterization of alpha in human cortex. By applying non-negative matrix factorization to source-projected power fluctuations, we identify 16 reliable cortical generators in each hemisphere. These include the classical sensory alpha rhythms as well as several additional ones in the lateral occipital and temporal lobes and in inferior parietal cortex. We show that the generators are coordinated across hemispheres and hence form resting-state networks (RSNs), two of which are the default mode network (DMN) and the ventral attention network (VAN). Our study hence provides a further subdivision of RSNs within the alpha frequency band and shows that these RSNs are supported by alpha generators. As such, it links the classical literature on human alpha with more recent research into electrophysiological RNSs.",

Modularity allows some degree of segregation between different parts of the network and has been suggested to be a prerequisite for the evolvability of biological systems. In technology, modularity defines a clear division of tasks and it is an explicit design target. However, many natural and artificial systems experience a breakdown in their modular pattern of connections, which has been associated to failures in hub nodes or the activation of global stress responses. In spite of its importance, no general theory of the breakdown of modularity and its implications has been advanced yet. Here we propose a new, simple model of network landscape where it is possible to exhaustively characterise the breakdown of modularity in a well-defined way. We found that evolution cannot reach maximally modular networks under the presence of functional and cost constraints, implying the breakdown of modularity is an adaptive feature.",

    "abstract": "Diverse human ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis (NPHP), Meckel syndrome (MKS) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS), can be caused by mutations affecting components of the transition zone, a ciliary domain near its base. The transition zone controls the protein composition of the ciliary membrane, but how it does so is unclear. To better understand the transition zone and its connection to ciliopathies, we defined the arrangement of key proteins in the transition zone using two-color stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). This mapping revealed that NPHP and MKS complex components form nested rings comprised of nine-fold doublets. The NPHP complex component RPGRIP1L forms a smaller diameter transition zone ring within the MKS complex rings. JBTS-associated mutations in RPGRIP1L disrupt the architecture of the MKS and NPHP rings, revealing that vertebrate RPGRIP1L has a key role in organizing transition zone architecture. JBTS-associated mutations in TCTN2, encoding an MKS complex component, also displace proteins of the MKS and NPHP complexes from the transition zone, revealing that RPGRIP1L and TCTN2 have interdependent roles in organizing transition zone architecture. To understand how altered transition zone architecture affects developmental signaling, we examined the localization of the Hedgehog pathway component SMO in human fibroblasts derived from JBTS-affected individuals. We found that diverse ciliary proteins, including SMO, accumulate at the transition zone in wild type cells, suggesting that the transition zone is a way station for proteins entering and exiting the cilium. JBTS-associated mutations in RPGRIP1L disrupt SMO accumulation at the transition zone and the ciliary localization of SMO. We propose that the disruption of transition zone architecture in JBTS leads to a failure of SMO to accumulate at the transition zone, disrupting developmental signaling in JBTS.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma mobile is a bacterium that uses a unique mechanism to glide on solid surfaces at a velocity of up to 4.5 {micro}m/s. Its gliding machinery comprises hundreds of units that generate the force for gliding based on the energy derived from ATP; the units catch and pull on sialylated oligosaccharides fixed to solid surfaces. In the present study, we measured the stall force of wild-type and mutant strains of M. mobile carrying a bead manipulated using optical tweezers. The strains that had been enhanced for binding exhibited weaker stall forces than the wild-type strain, indicating that stall force is related to force generation rather than to binding. The stall force of the wild-type strain decreased linearly from 113 to 19 pN following the addition of 0-0.5 mM free sialyllactose (a sialylated oligosaccharide), with a decrease in the number of working units. Following the addition of 0.5 mM sialyllactose, the cells carrying a bead loaded using optical tweezers exhibited stepwise movements with force increments. The force increments ranged from 1 to 2 pN. Considering the 70-nm step size, this small unit force may be explained by the large gear ratio involved in the M. mobile gliding machinery.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEMycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that parasitizes animals. Dozens of Mycoplasma species glide over the tissues of their hosts during infection. The gliding machinery of Mycoplasma mobile, the fastest species, includes intracellular motors and hundreds of legs on the cell surface. In the present study, we precisely measured force generation using a highly focused laser beam arrangement (referred to as optical tweezers) under various conditions. The measurements obtained in this study suggest that the rapid gliding exhibited by M. mobile arises from the large gear ratio of its gliding machinery.",

Many studies have investigated the association between MTNR1B polymorphism rs10830963 C>G and GDM risk, but the conclusion is inconsistent. PubMed, Google Scholar and CNKI databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Pooled OR with corresponding 95% CI was used to estimate the strength of the association between rs10830963 and GDM risk using a fixed- or random-effect model. 12 eligible studies with a number of 4,782 GDM patients and 5,605 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Results indicated that the variant G allele of rs10830963 polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM (CG vs. CC: OR=1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.34, Pheterogeneity = 0.23; GG vs. CC: OR=1.74, 95% CI =1.41-2.15, Pheterogeneity = 0.002).

    "abstract": "States have fared differently in their progress towards eliminating the black-white life expectancy gap. Our objective is to describe the pattern of contributions of each of six major causes of deaths to the sex-specific black-white life expectancy gap across states over the last half-century, and identify divergent states.\\n\\nUsing vital statistics and census data, we extracted the number of deaths and population sizes for the years 1969 to 2013, by state, gender, race, 19 age groups, and six major causes of death.\\n\\nAlthough mortality from cardiovascular disease has decreased dramatically, its contribution to the life expectancy gap increased over time for men (from 0.9 to 1.2 years), but decreased for women (from 2.4 to 1 years). The contribution of non-communicable diseases to the gap was stable over time for men (approximately 0.4 years) but decreased for women (from 0.7 to 0.2 years), while cancers exhibited an inverted-U trend for men (peaking at 1.1 years in 1988) and a stable contribution for women (approximately 0.5 years). Both genders exhibited a decreased contribution from injuries (men: 2.2 to 0.4 years), that became negative for women (women: 0.5 to -0.1 years). Several states diverged from these general trends.\\n\\nLife expectancy for both races has improved substantially in the US. For men, much of this improvement was due to narrowing differences in injury-related mortality, but these contributions were rivaled by an increasing gap in CVD-related mortality. In women, a crossover in injury-related mortality led to a narrower gap, realized partially by increasing mortality among whites.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya is an emerging arbovirus that reached the Western Hemisphere at the end of 2013. Studies conducted in Indie Ocean and India suggest that many of deaths associated with chikungunya cannot be recognized by passive surveillance system. The occurrence of these deaths can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics. To evaluate the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in Brazil, we studied monthly mortality by age group comparing the pre-chikungunya period with the chikungunya epidemic period in the most affected states of Brazil. We obtained official data from National System of Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) and Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. It was possible to identify a significant increase in all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, there was no similar mortality in previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4,842 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (51.4/100,000 inhabitants), the most affected age groups were the elderly and under 1 year of age, the same pattern occurred in all states. Further studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise guidelines to recognize the real mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are natural, resilient films formed when microorganisms adhere to a surface and form a complex three-dimensional structure that allows them to persist in a wide variety of environments. Readily forming in hospitals and on medical equipment, biofilms are frequent causes of infections and their subsequent complications. Due to the complexity of these structures, systematically studying individual bacterial cells and their interactions with their surrounding environment will provide a deeper understanding of the processes occurring within the biofilm as whole versus bulk population based methods that do not differentiate individual cells or species. Methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) are particularly suited to the study of individual cells, but are underutilized for the study of bacterial electrical properties. The ability of electrical currents to impair bacterial attachment is well documented, but to utilize electrical current as an effective antibacterial treatment, it is important to understand the electrical properties of bacteria. Therefore, we used AFM, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and ResiScope to measure the surface potential and conductance of Psuedomonas aeruginosa and methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on gold and stainless steel. This is the first study to directly measure the electrical resistance of single bacterial cells using ResiScope. Our goal was to develop a framework for measuring biological molecules using conductive atomic force microscopy. We found that the average resistance for P. aeruginosa was 135.4{+/-}25.04 G{Omega}, while MRSA had an average of 173.4{+/-}16.28 G{Omega}. Using KPFM, the surface potential of MRSA shifted from -0.304 V to 0.153 V and from -0.280 V to 0.172 V for P. aeruginosa on gold versus stainless steel substrates, respectively. In an attempt to identify a potential charge carrier, peptidoglycan was also measured with the ResiScope module and shown to have a resistance of 105 G{Omega}.",

    "abstract": "High throughput sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform is a pervasive and critical molecular ecology resource, and has provided the data underlying many recent advances. A recent study has suggested that  index switching, where reads are misattributed to the wrong sample, may be higher in new versions of the HiSeq platform. This has the potential to invalidate both published and in-progress work across the field. Here, we test for evidence of index switching in an exemplar whole genome shotgun dataset sequenced on both the Illumina HiSeq 2500, which should not have the problem, and the Illumina HiSeq X, which may. We leverage unbalanced heterozygotes, which may be produced by index switching, and ask whether the under-sequenced allele is more likely to be found in other samples in the same lane than expected based on the allele frequency. Although we validate the sensitivity of this method using simulations, we find that neither the HiSeq 2500 nor the HiSeq X have evidence of index switching. This suggests that, thankfully, index switching may not be a ubiquitous problem in HiSeq X sequence data. Lastly, we provide scripts for applying our method so that index switching can be tested for in other datasets.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetics has witnessed dramatic increases in the sizes of data matrices assembled to resolve branches of the tree of life, motivating the development of programs for fast, yet accurate, inference. For example, several different fast programs have been developed in the very popular maximum likelihood framework, including RAxML/ExaML, PhyML, IQ-TREE, and FastTree. Although these four programs are widely used, a systematic evaluation and comparison of their performance using empirical genome-scale data matrices has so far been lacking. To address this question, we evaluated these four programs on 19 empirical phylogenomic data sets from diverse animal, plant, and fungal lineages with respect to likelihood maximization, tree topology, and computational speed. For single-gene tree inference, we found that the more exhaustive and slower strategies (ten searches per alignment) outperformed faster strategies (one tree search per alignment) using RAxML, PhyML, or IQ-TREE. Interestingly, single-gene trees inferred by the three programs yielded comparable coalescent-based species tree estimations. For concatenation-based species tree inference, IQ-TREE consistently achieved the best-observed likelihoods for all data sets, and RAxML/ExaML was a close second. In contrast, PhyML often failed to complete concatenation-based analyses, whereas FastTree was the fastest but generated lower likelihood values and more dissimilar tree topologies in both types of analyses. Finally, data matrix properties, such as the number of taxa and the strength of phylogenetic signal, sometimes substantially influenced the relative performance of the programs. Our results provide real-world gene and species tree phylogenetic inference benchmarks to inform the design and execution of large-scale phylogenomic data analyses.",

    "abstract": "In line with the goal of limiting health risk behaviors in adolescence, a growing literature investigates whether individual differences in functional brain responses can be related to vulnerability to engage in risky decision-making. We review this body of work, investigate when and in what way findings converge, and provide best practice recommendations. We identified 23 studies that examined individual differences in brain responsivity and adolescent risk taking. Findings varied widely in terms of the neural regions identified as relating to risky behavior. This heterogeneity is likely due to the abundance of approaches used to assess risk taking, and to the disparity of fMRI tasks. Indeed, brain-behavior correlations were typically found in regions showing a main effect of task. However, results from a test of publication bias suggested that region of interest approaches lacked evidential value. The findings suggest that neural factors differentiating riskier teens are not localized to a single region. Therefore, approaches that utilize data from the entire brain, particularly in predictive analyses, may yield more reliable and applicable results. We discuss several decision points that researchers should consider when designing a study, and emphasize the importance of precise research questions that move beyond a general desire to address adolescent risk taking.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and episodic memory. Mechanistic models predict that hippocampal subfields have computational specializations that differentially support memory. However, there is little empirical evidence suggesting differences between the subfields, particularly in humans. To clarify how hippocampal subfields support human spatial and episodic memory, we developed a virtual reality paradigm where participants passively navigated through houses (spatial contexts) across a series of videos (episodic contexts). We then used multivariate analyses of high-resolution fMRI data to identify neural representations of contextual information during recollection. Multi-voxel pattern similarity analyses revealed that CA1 represented objects that shared an episodic context as more similar than those from different episodic contexts. CA23DG showed the opposite pattern, differentiating between objects encountered in the same episodic context. The complementary characteristics of these subfields explain how we can parse our experiences into cohesive episodes while retaining the specific details that support vivid recollection.",

    "abstract": "Complex traits and diseases like human height or cancer are often not caused by a single mutation or genetic variant, but instead arise from multiple factors that together functionally perturb the underlying molecular network. Biological networks are known to be highly modular and contain dense \\\"communities\\\" of genes that carry out cellular processes, but these structures change between tissues, during development, and in disease. While many methods exist for inferring networks, we lack robust methods for quantifying changes in network structure. Here, we describe ALPACA (ALtered Partitions Across Community Architectures), a method for comparing two genome-scale networks derived from different phenotypic states to identify condition-specific modules. In simulations, ALPACA leads to more nuanced, sensitive, and robust module discovery than currently available network comparison methods. We used ALPACA to compare transcriptional networks in three contexts: angiogenic and non-angiogenic subtypes of ovarian cancer, human fibroblasts expressing transforming viral oncogenes, and sexual dimorphism in human breast tissue. In each case, ALPACA identified modules enriched for processes relevant to the phenotype. For example, modules specific to angiogenic ovarian tumors were enriched for genes associated with blood vessel development, interferon signaling, and flavonoid biosynthesis. In comparing the modular structure of networks in female and male breast tissue, we found that female breast has distinct modules enriched for genes involved in estrogen receptor and ERK signaling. The functional relevance of these new modules indicate that not only does phenotypic change correlate with network structural changes, but also that ALPACA can identify such modules in complex networks.\\n\\nSignificance statementDistinct phenotypes are often thought of in terms of unique patterns of gene expression. But the expression levels of genes and proteins are driven by networks of interacting elements, and changes in expression are driven by changes in the structure of the associated networks. Because of the size and complexity of these networks, identifying functionally significant changes in network topology has been an ongoing challenge. We describe a new method for comparing networks derived from related conditions, such as healthy and disease tissue, and identifying emergent modules associated with the phenotypic differences between the conditions. We show that this method can find both known and previously unreported pathways involved in three contexts: ovarian cancer, tumor viruses, and breast tissue development.",

    "abstract": "The chemosensory system is key to establishing and maintaining social structure in eusocial insects. Ants exhibit cooperative colonial behaviors reflective of an advanced form of sociality with an extensive dependency on communication. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) serve as pheromones and cues that regulate multiple aspects of social interactions and behaviors in ants. The perception of CHCs entails odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) that express specific odorant receptors (ORs) encoded by a dramatically expanded Or gene family in ants. Until recently, studies of the biological functions of ORs in eusocial insects were stymied by the lack of genetic tools. In most eusocial insect species, only one or a few queens in a colony can transmit the genetic information to their progeny. In contrast, any worker in the ant Harpegnathos saltator can be converted into a gamergate (pseudo-queen), and used as a foundress to engender an entire new colony and be crossed for genetic experiments. This feature facilitated CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting to generate a germline mutation in the orco gene that encodes the obligate co-receptor whose mutation should significantly impact ant olfaction. Our results show that Orco exhibits a conserved role in the perception of general odorants but also a role in reproductive physiology and social behavior plasticity in ants. Surprisingly, and in contrast to other insect systems, the loss of OR functionality also dramatically reduces the development of the ant antennal lobe where ORNs project. Taken together, these findings open the possibility of studying the genetics of eusociality and provide inroads towards understanding the function of the expanded ORs family in eusocial insects in regulating caste determination, social communication and neuronal plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dual roles of demographic and selective processes in the buildup of population divergence is one of the most challenging tasks in evolutionary biology. In the Northern hemisphere in particular, species genetic makeup has been largely influenced by severe climatic oscillations of the Quaternary Period. Here, we investigated the demographic history of Atlantic Salmon across the entire species range using 2035 anadromous individuals from 77 sampling sites from North America and Eurasia genotyped at 4,656 SNPs. By combining results from admixture graphs, geogenetic maps and an approximate Bayesian computation framework, we validate previous hypotheses pertaining to secondary contact between European and Northern American populations, but also demonstrate that European populations from different glacial refugia have been exchanging alleles in contemporary times. We further identify the major sources of admixture from the southern range of North America to more northern populations along with a strong signal of secondary gene flow between genetic regional groups. We hypothesize that these patterns reflects the spatial redistribution of ancestral variation across the entire American range. Results also point to a role for linked selection in the form of background selection and or positive hitchhiking. Altogether, differential introgression and linked selective effects likely played an underappreciated role in shaping the genomic landscape of species in the Northern hemisphere Therefore we conclude that such heterogeneity among loci should be systematically integrated into demographic inferences of the divergence process, even between incompletely reproductively isolated populations.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data contains a wealth of information which has to be inferred computationally from the observed sequencing reads. As the ability to sequence more cells improves rapidly, existing computational tools suffer from three problems. (1) The decreased reads-per-cell implies a highly sparse sample of the true cellular transcriptome. (2) Many tools simply cannot handle the size of the resulting datasets. (3) Prior biological knowledge such as bulk RNA-seq information of certain cell types or qualitative marker information is not taken into account. Here we present UNCURL, a preprocessing framework based on non-negative matrix factorization for scRNA-seq data, that is able to handle varying sampling distributions, scales to very large cell numbers and can incorporate prior knowledge.\\n\\nResultsWe find that preprocessing using UNCURL consistently improves performance of commonly used scRNA-seq tools for clustering, visualization, and lineage estimation, both in the absence and presence of prior knowledge. Finally we demonstrate that UNCURL is extremely scalable and parallelizable, and runs faster than other methods on a scRNA-seq dataset containing 1.3 million cells.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code is available at https://github.com/yjzhang/uncurl_python\\n\\nContactksreeram@uw.edu, gseelig@uw.edu",

    "abstract": "KCC2 is a neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter essential for establishing the Cl- gradient required for hyperpolarizing inhibition. KCC2 is highly localized to excitatory synapses where it regulates spine morphogenesis and AMPA receptor confinement. Aberrant KCC2 function contributes to numerous human neurological disorders including epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Using unbiased functional proteomics, we identified the KCC2-interactome in the mouse brain to determine KCC2-protein interactions that regulate KCC2 function. Our analysis revealed that KCC2 interacts with a diverse set of proteins, and its most predominant interactors play important roles in postsynaptic receptor recycling. The most abundant KCC2 interactor is a neuronal endocytic regulatory protein termed PACSIN1 (SYNDAPIN1). We verified the PACSIN1-KCC2 interaction biochemically and demonstrated that shRNA knockdown of PACSIN1 in hippocampal neurons significantly increases KCC2 expression and hyperpolarizes the reversal potential for Cl-. Overall, our global native-KCC2 interactome and subsequent characterization revealed PACSIN1 as a novel and potent negative regulator of KCC2.",
