    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions can be stabilized against invasion by non-cooperative individuals by putting such \\\"cheaters\\\" at a selective disadvantage. Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality -- yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance, but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts ability to sanction non-cooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice-versa. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. These results predict that mutualists can maintain variation in recognition of partner signals or in the ability to sanction non-cooperators without destabilizing mutualism, and reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism should consider communication between partners as well as the exchange of benefits.",

    "abstract": "The aging brain undergoes structural changes, affecting brain homeostasis, neuronal function and consequently cognition. The complex architecture of dendritic arbors poses a challenge to understanding age-dependent morphological alterations, behavioral plasticity and remodeling following brain injury. Here, we use the PVD polymodal neurons of C. elegans as a model to study how aging affects neuronal plasticity. Using confocal live imaging of C. elegans PVD neurons, we demonstrate age-related progressive morphological alterations of intricate dendritic arbors. We show that insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutations (daf-2) fail to inhibit the progressive morphological aging of dendrites and do not prevent the minor decline in response to harsh touch during aging. We uncovered that PVD aging is characterized by a major decline in regenerative potential of dendrites following experimental laser dendrotomy. Furthermore, the remodeling of transected dendritic trees via AFF-1-mediated self-fusion can be restored in old animals by DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutations, and can be differentially reestablished by ectopic expression of AFF-1 fusion protein (fusogen). Thus, AFF-1 fusogen ectopically expressed in the PVD and mutations in DAF-2/IGF-1R, differentially rejuvenate some aspects of dendritic regeneration following injury.\\n\\nSummary statementEctopic expression of AFF-1 fusogen or low activity of IGF-1R/DAF-2 rejuvenate the regeneration potential of dendrites following injury in aging C. elegans",

They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response.

Here, we identify PRDM9 orthologs from genome and transcriptome data in 225 species. We find the complete PRDM9 ortholog across distantly related vertebrates but, despite this broad conservation, infer a minimum of six partial and three complete losses. Strikingly, taxa carrying the complete ortholog of PRDM9 are precisely those with rapid evolution of its predicted binding affinity, suggesting that all domains are necessary for directing recombination. Indeed, as we show, swordtail fish carrying only a partial but conserved ortholog share recombination properties with PRDM9 knock-outs.",

    "abstract": "Cyclically stretched cells are known to exhibit a strain-induced reorientation response. In this study, we comprehensively analyse this behaviour for human fibroblasts subjected to a highly non-uniform strain field within a polymethylsiloxane microdevice. We demonstrate a strong correlation between the strain amplitude and the degree of cell alignment perpendicular to the principal strain direction (stretching avoidance). Analogously, our results indicate that the strain gradient amplitude and direction also regulate this reorientation through a coordinated gradient avoidance response. We stipulate that strain gradients are thus biologically relevant mechanical cues sensed by cells. To gain insight into the underlying mechanosensing processes, we also studied focal adhesion reorganization and the effect of modulating myosin-II contractility. The extracted focal adhesion orientation distributions are similar to those obtained for the cell bodies, and their density is increased by the presence of stretching forces. Moreover, it was found that the myosin-II activity promoter calyculin-A has little effect on the cellular response, while the inhibitor blebbistatin suppresses cell and focal adhesion alignment and reduces focal adhesion density. These results confirm that similar internal structures involved in sensing and responding to strain direction and amplitude are also key players in strain gradient mechanosensing and avoidance.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical reactions within individual cells result from the interactions of molecules, often in small numbers. Consequently, the inherent stochasticity of binding and diffusion processes generate noise along the cascade that leads to the synthesis of a protein from its encoding gene. As a result, isogenic cell populations display phenotypic variability even in homogeneous environments. The extent and consequences of this stochastic gene expression have only recently been assessed on a genome-wide scale, in particular owing to the advent of single cell transcriptomics. However, the evolutionary forces shaping this stochasticity have yet to be unraveled. We took advantage of two recently published data sets of the single-cell transcriptome of the domestic mouse Mus musculus in order to characterize the effect of natural selection on gene-specific transcriptional stochasticity. We showed that noise levels in the mRNA distributions (a.k.a. transcriptional noise) significantly correlate with three-dimensional nuclear domain organization, evolutionary constraint on the encoded protein and gene age. The position of the encoded protein in biological pathways, however, is the main factor that explains observed levels of transcriptional noise, in agreement with models of noise propagation within gene networks. Because transcriptional noise is under widespread selection, we argue that it constitutes an important component of the phenotype and that variance of expression is a potential target of adaptation. Stochastic gene expression should therefore be considered together with mean expression level in functional and evolutionary studies of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTranslation initiation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression. In addition to the annotated translation initiation sites (TISs), the translation process may also start at multiple alternative TISs (including both AUG and non-AUG codons), which makes it challenging to predict TISs and study the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, the advent of several high-throughput sequencing techniques for profiling initiating ribosomes at single-nucleotide resolution, e.g., GTI-seq and QTI-seq, provides abundant data for systematically studying the general principles of translation initiation and the development of computational method for TIS identification.\\n\\nMethodsWe have developed a deep learning based framework, named TITER, for accurately predicting TISs on a genome-wide scale based on QTI-seq data. TITER extracts the sequence features of translation initiation from the surrounding sequence contexts of TISs using a hybrid neural network and further integrates the prior preference of TIS codon composition into a unified prediction framework.\\n\\nResultsExtensive tests demonstrated that TITER can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction methods in identifying TISs. In addition, TITER was able to identify important sequence signatures for individual types of TIS codons, including a Kozak-sequence-like motif for AUG start codon. Furthermore, the TITER prediction score can be related to the strength of translation initiation in various biological scenarios, including the repressive effect of the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) on gene expression and the mutational effects influencing translation initiation efficiency.\\n\\nAvailabilityTITER is available as an open-source software and can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhangsaithu/titer\\n\\nContactlzhang20@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn and zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn",

    "abstract": "Selection is commonly described by assigning constant relative fitness values to genotypes. Yet population density is often regulated by crowding. Relative fitness may then depend on density, and selection can change density when it acts on a density-regulating trait. When strong density-dependent selection acts on a density-regulating trait, selection is no longer describable by density-independent relative fitnesses, even in demographically stable populations. These conditions are met in most previous models of density-dependent selection (e.g. \\\"K-selection\\\" in the logistic and Lotka-Volterra models), suggesting that density-independent relative fitnesses must be replaced with more ecologically explicit absolute fit-nesses unless selection is weak. Here we show that density-independent relative fitnesses can also accurately describe strong density-dependent selection under some conditions. We develop a novel model of density-regulated population growth with three ecologically intuitive traits: fecundity, mortality, and competitive ability. Our model, unlike the logistic or Lotka-Volterra, incorporates a density-dependent juvenile \\\"reproductive excess\\\", which largely decouples density-dependent selection from the regulation of density. We find that density-independent relative fitnesses accurately describe strong selection acting on any one trait, even fecundity, which is both density-regulating and subject to density-dependent selection. Pleiotropic interactions between these traits recovers the familiar K-selection behavior. In such cases, or when the population is maintained far from demographic equilibrium, our model offers a possible alternative to relative fitness.",

We found that CPP was associated with recruitment of nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons to fire in the cocaine-paired location, and this recruitment was driven predominantly by selective strengthening of hippocampal inputs arising from place cells that encode the cocaine-paired location. These findings provide in vivo evidence that the synaptic potentiation in the accumbens caused by repeated cocaine administration preferentially affects inputs that were active at the time of drug exposure. This provides a potential physiological mechanism by which drug use becomes associated with specific environmental contexts.",

Additionally, using computational experiments of infection spread, we determined the disease costs of each social system.\\nC_LIO_LIWe find that relatively solitary species have large variation in number of social partners, that socially hierarchical species are the least clustered in their interactions, and that social networks of gregarious species tend to be the most fragmented. However, these structural differences are primarily driven by weak connections, which suggests that different social systems have evolved unique strategies to organize weak ties.\\nC_LIO_LIOur synthetic disease experiments reveal that social network organization can mitigate the disease costs of group living for socially hierarchical species when the pathogen is highly transmissible. In contrast, highly transmissible pathogens cause frequent and prolonged epidemic outbreaks in gregarious species.\\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluate the implications of network organization across social systems despite methodological challenges, and our findings offer new perspective on the debate about the disease costs of group living.

Not only the local concentration but also duration of morphogen exposure is critical for correct cell fate decisions. Yet, how and when cells temporally integrate signals from a morphogen remains unclear. Here, we use optogenetic manipulation to switch off Bicoid-dependent transcription in the early Drosophila embryo with high temporal resolution, allowing time-specific and reversible manipulation of morphogen signalling. We find that Bicoid transcriptional activity is dispensable for embryonic viability in the first hour after fertilization, but persistently required throughout the rest of the blastoderm stage. Short interruptions of Bicoid activity alter the most anterior cell fate decisions, while prolonged inactivation expands patterning defects from anterior to posterior. Such anterior susceptibility correlates with high reliance of anterior gap gene expression on Bicoid. Therefore, cell fates exposed to higher Bicoid concentration require input for longer duration, demonstrating a previously unknown aspect of morphogen decoding.",

    "abstract": "In the past six years worldwide capacity for human genome sequencing has grown by more than five orders of magnitude, with costs falling by nearly two orders of magnitude over the same period [1], [2]. The rapid expansion in the production of next-generation sequence data and the use of these data in a wide range of new applications has created a need for improved computational tools for data processing. The Sentieon Genomics tools provide an optimized reimplementation of the most accurate pipelines for calling variants from next-generation sequence data, resulting in more than a 10-fold increase in processing speed while providing identical results to best practices pipelines. Here we demonstrate the consistency and improved performance of Sentieons tools relative to BWA, GATK, MuTect, and MuTect2 through analysis of publicly available human exome, low-coverage genome, and high-depth genome sequence data.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, biofilms have become a central subject of research in the fields of microbiology, medicine, agriculture, or systems biology amongst others. The sociomicrobiology of multispecies biofilms, however, is still poorly understood. Here, we report a screening system that allowed us to identify soil bacteria, which induce architectural changes in biofilm colonies when cocultured with B. subtilis. We identified the soil bacterium Lysinibacillus fusiformis M5 as inducer of wrinkle-formation in B. subtilis colonies mediated by a diffusible signaling molecule. This compound was isolated by bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation. The elicitor was identified to be the purine hypoxanthine using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that the induction of wrinkle formation by hypoxanthine is not dependent on signal recognition by the histidine kinases KinA, KinB, KinC, and KinD, which are generally involved in phosphorylation of the master regulator Spo0A. Likewise, we show that hypoxanthine signaling does not induce the expression of biofilm-matrix related operons epsA-O and tasA-sipW-tapA. Finally, we demonstrate that the purine permease PbuO, but not PbuG, is necessary for hypoxanthine to induce an increase in wrinkle formation of B. subtilis biofilm colonies. Our results suggest that hypoxanthine-stimulated wrinkle development is not due to a direct induction of biofilm-related gene expression, but rather caused by the excess of hypoxanthine within B. subtilis cells, which may lead to cell stress and death.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms are a bacterial lifestyle with high relevance regarding diverse human activities. Biofilms can be favorable, for instance in crop protection. In nature, biofilms are commonly found as multispecies communities displaying complex social behaviors and characteristics. The study of interspecies interactions will thus lead to a better understanding and use of biofilms as they occur outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a screening method suitable for the identification of multispecies interactions, and showcase L. fusiformis as a soil bacterium that is able to live alongside B. subtilis and modify the architecture of its biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Sensory attenuation refers to the cortical suppression of self-generated sensations relative to externally-generated sensations. This attenuation of cortical responsiveness is the result of internal forward models which make precise predictions about forthcoming sensations. Forward models of sensory attenuation in the auditory domain are thought to operate along auditory white matter pathways such as the arcuate fasciculus and the frontal aslant. The aim of this study was to investigate whether brain regions that are structurally connected via these white matter pathways are also effectively connected during overt speech, as well as as when listening to externally-generated speech that is temporally predictable via a visual cue. Using Electroencephalography (EEG) and Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) we investigated network models that link the primary auditory cortex to Wernickes and Brocas area either directly or indirectly through Geschwinds territory, which are structurally connected via the arcuate fasciculus. Connections between Brocas and supplementary motor area, which are structurally connected via the frontal aslant, were also included. Our results revealed that bilateral areas interconnected by indirect and direct pathways of the arcuate fasciculus, in addition to regions interconnected by the frontal aslant best explain the EEG responses to both self-generated speech, and speech that is externally-generated but temporally predictable. These findings indicate that structurally connected brain regions thought to be involved in auditory attenuation are also effectively connected. Critically, our findings expand on the notion of internal forward models, whereby sensory consequences of our actions are internally predicted and reflected in reduced cortical responsiveness to these sensations.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIEffective connectivity of auditory attenuation to self-generated and predictable speech\\nC_LIO_LIEEG and DCM were used to investigate several plausible network models\\nC_LIO_LIStructurally connected brain areas of auditory attenuation are effectively connected\\nC_LIO_LIInternal forward models modulate self-generated and predictable speech\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis, a significant source of mortality in immunocompromised individuals, typically HIV/AIDS patients from developing countries. Despite the worldwide emergence of this ubiquitous infection, little is known about the global molecular epidemiology of this fungal pathogen. Here we sequence the genomes of 188 diverse isolates and characterized the major subdivisions, their relative diversity and the level of genetic exchange between them. While most isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii belong to one of three major lineages (VNI, VNII, and VNB), some haploid isolates show hybrid ancestry including some that appear to have recently interbred, based on the detection of large blocks of each ancestry across each chromosome. Many isolates display evidence of aneuploidy, which was detected for all chromosomes. In diploid isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A/A) and of hybrids with C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype A/D) such aneuploidies have resulted in loss of heterozygosity, where a chromosomal region is represented by the genotype of only one parental isolate. Phylogenetic and population genomic analyses of isolates from Brazil revealed that the previously  African VNB lineage occurs naturally in the South American environment. This suggests migration of the VNB lineage between Africa and South America prior to its diversification, supported by finding ancestral recombination events between isolates from different lineages and regions. The results provide evidence of substantial population structure, with all lineages showing multi-continental distributions demonstrating the highly dispersive nature of this pathogen.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCryptococcus neoformans var. grubii is a human fungal pathogen of immunocompromised individuals that has global clinical impact, causing half a million deaths per year. Substantial genetic substructure exists for this pathogen, with two lineages found globally (VNI, VNII) whereas a third has appeared confined to sub-Saharan Africa (VNB). Here, we utilized genome sequencing of a large set of global isolates to examine the genetic diversity, hybridization, and biogeography of these lineages. We found that while the three major lineages are well separated, recombination between the lineages has occurred, notably resulting in hybrid isolates with segmented ancestry across the genome. In addition, we showed that isolates from South America are placed within the VNB lineage, formerly thought to be confined to Africa, and that there is phylogenetic separation between these geographies that substantially expands the diversity of these lineages. Our findings provide a new framework for further studies of the dynamics of natural populations of C. neoformans var. grubii.",

    "abstract": "Poliovirus (PV) infection induces membranes with elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and invaginated, tubular structures that appear as vesicular clusters in cross section. Here, we characterize PV mutants, termed EG and GG, which exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor that can delay the onset of genome replication and/or impair virus assembly. For WT PV, changes to the PI4P pool were observed as early as 30 min post-infection. PI4P remodeling occurred even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor. Vesicular clusters were not apparent until 3 h post-infection, a time too slow for these structures to be responsible for genome replication. Delays in the onset of genome replication observed for EG and GG PVs were explained completely by the reduced kinetics of virus-induced remodeling of PI4P pools, consistent with PI4P serving as a marker of the genome-replication organelle. Infectious virus produced by GG PV is known to be reduced nearly 5 logs. We show that GG PV was unable to make virus-induced vesicular clusters. Instead, GG PV-infected cells accumulated elongated tubules. Our results are consistent with the existence of distinct organelles for genome-replication and virus assembly. We suggest that the pace of formation and spatiotemporal dynamics of PV induced organelles may be set by the rate of P3 precursor processing to form 3AB and/or 3CD proteins.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAll positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with host cell membranes. PV does not just remodel existing membranes, but induces membranes with unique structure and lipid composition. There has been some suggestion that the functions of the PV induced structures observed during infection may not be those that perform genome-replication. This study uses kinetic analysis of virus-induced membrane formation and PI4P induction by two PV mutants to provide evidence for the existence of a virus-induced genome-replication organelle distinct from a second organelle, the absence of which impairs virus assembly. In addition, our studies suggest that formation of both organelles may require participation of viral proteins, 3AB and/or 3CD. Therefore, this study provides a new perspective on the cell biology of PV infection and should inspire a fresh look at picornavirus-induced organelles, their functions and the role of P3 proteins in their formation.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide molecular gene expression studies generally compare expression values for each gene across multiple conditions followed by cluster and gene set enrichment analysis to determine whether differentially expressed genes are enriched in specific biochemical pathways, cellular components, biological processes, and/or molecular functions, etc. This approach to analyzing differences in gene expression enables discovery of gene function, but is not useful to determine whether pre-defined groups of genes share or diverge in their expression patterns in response to treatments nor to assess the correctness of pre-defined gene set groupings. Here we present a simple method that changes the dimension of comparison by treating genes as variable traits to directly assess significance of differences in expression levels among pre-defined gene groups. Because expression distributions are typically skewed (thus unfit for direct assessment using Gaussian statistical methods) our method involves transforming expression data to approximate a normal distribution followed by dividing the genes into groups, then applying Gaussian parametric methods to assess significance of observed differences. This method enables the assessment of differences in gene expression distributions within and across samples, enabling hypothesis-based comparison among groups of genes. We demonstrate this method by assessing the significance of specific gene groups differential response to heat stress conditions in maize.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "If the brain is inherently Bayesian, then behavior should show the signatures of Bayesian computation from an early stage in life without the need for learning. Children should integrate probabilistic information from prior and likelihood distributions to reach decisions and should be as statistically efficient as adults. To test this idea, we examined the integration of prior and likelihood information in a simple position estimation task comparing children aged 6-11 years and adults. During development, estimation performance became closer to the statistical optimum. Children use likelihood information as well as adults but are limited in their use of priors. This finding suggests that Bayesian behavior is not inherent but learnt over the course of development.",

Prospero level is low in neural stem cells and their immediate progeny, but is upregulated in larval neurons and it is unknown how this process is controlled. Here, we use single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridisation to show that larval neurons selectively transcribe a long prospero mRNA isoform containing a 15 kb 3 untranslated region, which is bound in the brain by the conserved RNA-binding protein Syncrip/hnRNPQ. Syncrip binding increases the mRNA stability of the long prospero isoform, which allows an upregulation of Prospero protein production.

Moreover, little is known about genetic determinants of fitness and physical activity, and modifiable effects of exercise in individuals with elevated genetic risk of CVD. Finally, causal analyses of exercise traits are limited.\\n\\nMethodsWe estimated associations of grip strength, physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness with CVD and all-cause death in up to 502,635 individuals from the UK Biobank. We also examined these associations in individuals with different genetic burden on coronary heart disease (CHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Finally, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) of grip strength and physical activity, as well as Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the causal role of grip strength in CHD.\\n\\nFindingsGrip strength, physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness showed strong inverse associations with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause death (for composite CVD; HR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.77-0.80; HR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.93-0.95, and HR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.63-0.71, per SD change, respectively).

Its fisheries showed a great importance in the past decades, however, now mainly relies on artisanal management of wild stocks. Feeding is one of the important factors that have restrained the establishment of large scale field rearing of loco. C. concholepas food preferences consist of mytilids and cirripeds, however its digestive physiology has not been studied and its digestive enzymes have not been yet characterized. The purification of amylase and protease from the digestive gland and the gland of Leiblein of C. concholepas were performed by ionic exchange chromatography (DEAE-cellulose), and substrate-PAGE indicated the presence of the amylase and protease in the fractions collected from the column. Amylase enzymatic assays showed its maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 50{degrees}C in the digestive gland. Protease on the other hand showed a great acidic activity, specifically at pH 3.0 in both organs, also at 50{degrees}C. Inhibition of the amylolytic activity was observed in the presence of EDTA, and metal ions like MnCl2, MgCl2, ZnSO4, while it was enhanced in the presence of CaCl2, NaCl, KCl. Protease inhibition assays were also performed evidencing mainly the presence of aspartic proteases and a low but not inexistent presence of serine proteases. Our results provide evidence of important proteolytic but also amylolytic activities present in the digestive system of loco, providing evidence that this mollusc has wider digestive capabilities than initially though, which could potentially lead to the development of alternative food diets.",

    "abstract": "The high-risk pedigree (HRP) design is an established strategy to discover rare, highly-penetrant, Mendelian-like causal variants. Its success, however, in complex traits has been modest, largely due to challenges of genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance models. We describe a HRP strategy that addresses intra-familial heterogeneity, and identifies inherited segments important for mapping regulatory risk. We apply this new Shared Genomic Segment (SGS) method in 11 extended, Utah, multiple myeloma (MM) HRPs, and subsequent exome sequencing in SGS regions of interest in 1063 MM / MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance - a precursor to MM) cases and 964 controls from a jointly-called collaborative resource, including cases from the initial 11 HRPs. One genome-wide significant 1.8 Mb shared segment was found at 6q16. Exome sequencing in this region revealed predicted deleterious variants in USP45 (p.Gln691*, p.Gln621Glu), a gene known to influence DNA repair through endonuclease regulation. Additionally, a 1.2 Mb segment at 1p36.11 is inherited in two Utah HRPs, with coding variants identified in ARID1A (p.Ser90Gly, p.Met890Val), a key gene in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Our results provide compelling statistical and genetic evidence for segregating risk variants for MM. In addition, we demonstrate a novel strategy to use large HRPs for risk-variant discovery more generally in complex traits.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAlthough family-based studies demonstrate inherited variants play a role in many common and complex diseases, finding the genes responsible remains a challenge. High-risk pedigrees, or families with more disease than expected by chance, have been helpful in the discovery of variants responsible for less complex diseases, but have not reached their potential in complex diseases. Here, we describe a method to utilize high-risk pedigrees to discover risk-genes in complex diseases. Our method is appropriate for complex diseases because it allows for genetic-heterogeneity, or multiple causes of disease, within a pedigree. This method allows us to identify shared segments that likely harbor disease-causing variants in a family. We apply our method in Multiple Myeloma, a heritable and complex cancer of plasma cells. We identified two genes USP45 and ARID1A that fall within shared segments with compelling statistical evidence. Exome sequencing of these genes revealed likely-damaging variants inherited in Myeloma high-risk families, suggesting these genes likely play a role in development of Myeloma. Our Myeloma findings demonstrate our high-risk pedigree method can identify genetic regions of interest in large high-risk pedigrees that are also relevant to smaller nuclear families and overall disease risk. In sum, we offer a strategy, applicable across phenotypes, to revitalize high-risk pedigrees in the discovery of the genetic basis of common and complex disease.",

    "abstract": "Pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is crucial for producing genetically normal gametes, and is dependent upon repair of SPO11-induced double stranded breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination. To prevent transmission of genetic defects, diverse organisms have evolved mechanisms to eliminate meiocytes containing unrepaired DSBs or unsynapsed chromosomes. Here, we show that the CHK2 (CHEK2)-dependent DNA damage checkpoint culls not only recombination-defective mouse oocytes, but also SPO11-deficient oocytes that are severely defective in homolog synapsis. The checkpoint is triggered by spontaneous DSBs that arise in late prophase I, accumulating above the checkpoint activation threshold ([~]10 DSBs) because presence of HORMAD1/2 on unsynapsed chromosome axes prevents their repair. Furthermore, Hormad2 deletion rescued fertility and meiotic DSB repair of oocytes containing a synapsis-proficient, non-crossover recombination defective mutation in a gene (Trip13) required for removal of HORMADs from synapsed chromosomes, indicating that a substantial fraction of meiotic DSBs are normally repaired by intersister recombination in mice.",

To expand this toolset, we have developed a screening strategy for the direct engineering of self-complementing split FPs. Via this strategy, we have generated a yellow-green split-mNeonGreen21-10/11 that improves the ratio of complemented signal to the background of FP1-10-expressing cells compared to the commonly used split-GFP1-10/11, as well as a 10-fold brighter red-colored split-sfCherry21-10/11. Based on split-sfCherry2, we have engineered a photoactivatable variant that enables single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy. We have demonstrated dual-color endogenous protein tagging with sfCherry211 and GFP11, revealing that endoplasmic reticulum translocon complex Sec61B has reduced abundance in certain peripheral tubules. These new split FPs not only offer multiple colors for imaging interaction networks of endogenous proteins, but also hold the potential to provide orthogonal handles for biochemical isolation of native protein complexes.",

In this work, we seek to answer the following fundamental question: what is the relationship between protein-induced spontaneous mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature at a membrane neck? Using an augmented Helfrich model for lipid bilayers to include membrane-protein interaction, we solve the shape equation on catenoids to find the field of spontaneous curvature that satisfies mechanical equilibrium of membrane necks. In this case, the shape equation reduces to a variable coefficient Helmholtz equation for spontaneous curvature, where the source term is proportional to the Gaussian curvature. We show how this latter quantity is responsible for non-uniform distribution of spontaneous curvature in minimal surfaces. We then explore the energetics of catenoids with different spontaneous curvature boundary conditions and geometric asymmetries to show how heterogeneities in spontaneous curvature distribution can couple with Gaussian curvature to result in membrane necks of different geometries.",

In this study, I took advantage of these characteristics to investigate the development of the organism as one reverse-engineers an industrial product. First, the spatial expression of 211 genes was digitalized. Some genes showed variable expression patterns, which might reflect multiple snapshots of a single temporally dynamic expression at different times. Several developmental territories of the embryo were considered to be very similar to each other; however, this digitalization of gene expression patterns showed that differences occurred between individual blastomeres even within a single developmental territory. Furthermore, Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) was expressed in those blastomeres in which both Fox (forkhead-box) A-a and Zic (zinc-finger) L were expressed, these proteins being upstream regulators of Ci-Bra.

    "abstract": "Spatially-explicit approaches are widely recommended for ecosystem management. The quality of the data, such as presence/absence or habitat maps, affects the management actions recommended, and is, therefore, key to management success. However, available data are often biased and incomplete. Previous studies have advanced ways to resolve data bias and missing data, but questions remain about how we design ecological surveys to develop a dataset through field surveys. Ecological surveys may have multiple spatial scales, including the spatial extent of the target ecosystem (observation window), the resolution for mapping individual distributions (mapping unit), and the survey area within each mapping unit (sampling unit). We developed an ecological survey method for mapping individual distributions by applying spatially-explicit stochastic models. We used spatial point processes to describe individual spatial placements using either random or clustering processes. We then designed ecological surveys with different spatial scales and individual detectability. We found that the choice of mapping unit affected the presence mapped fraction, and the fraction of the total individuals covered by the presence mapped patches. Tradeoffs were found between these quantities and the map resolution, associated with equivalent asymptotic behaviors for both metrics at sufficiently small and large mapping unit scales. Our approach enabled consideration of the effect of multiple spatial scales in surveys, and estimation of the survey outcomes such as the presence mapped fraction and the number of individuals situated in the presence detected units. The developed theory may facilitate management decision-making and inform the design of monitoring and data gathering.",

    "abstract": "Convergence is the process by which several species independently evolve similar traits. This evolutionary process is not only strongly related to fundamental questions such as the predictability of evolution and the role of adaptation, its study also may provide new insights about genes involved in the convergent character. We focus on this latter question and aim to detect molecular basis of a given phenotypic convergence. After pointing out a number of concerns about detection methods based on ancestral reconstruction, we propose a novel approach combining an original measure of the extent to which a site supports a phenotypic convergence, with a statistical framework for selecting genes from the measure of their sites. First, our measure of \\\"convergence level\\\" outperforms two previous ones in distinguishing simulated convergent sites from non-convergent ones. Second, by applying our detection approach to the well-studied case of convergent echolocation between dolphins and bats, we identified a set of genes which is very significantly annotated with audition-related GO-terms. This result constitutes an indirect evidence that genes involved in a phenotypic convergence can be identified with a genome-wide approach, a point which was highly debated, notably in the echolocation case (the latest articles published on this topic were quite pessimistic). Our approach opens the way to systematic studies of numerous examples of convergent evolution in order to link (convergent) phenotype to genotype.",

Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rate (FDR). Here we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91.8%), specificity (94.7%), accuracy (94.3%), and precision (90.6%) in model plants. LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5X genome coverage in Arabidopsis, the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5'-TG..CA-3' termini, LTR_retriever also identifies non-canonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of non-canonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of non-canonical LTRs are Copia elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other Copia elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA Copia elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and potential as mutagenesis tools.",

    "abstract": "Superfast muscles (SFM) are extremely fast synchronous muscles capable of contraction rates up to 250 Hz, enabling precise motor execution at the millisecond time scale. To allow such speed, the archetypal SFM, found in the toadfish swimbladder, has hallmark structural and kinetic adaptations at each step of the conserved excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) pathway. More recently SFM phenotypes have been discovered in most major vertebrate lineages, but it remains unknown whether all SFM share ECC adaptations for speed, and if SFM arose once, or from independent evolutionary events. Here we use genomic analysis to identify the myosin heavy chain genes expressed in bat and songbird SFM to achieve rapid actomyosin crossbridge kinetics and demonstrate that these are evolutionarily and ontologically distinct. Furthermore, by quantifying cellular morphometry and calcium signal transduction combined with force measurements we show that all known SFM share multiple functional adaptations that minimize ECC transduction times. Our results suggest that SFM evolved independently in sound producing organs in ray-finned fish, birds, and mammals, and that SFM phenotypes operate at a maximum operational speed set by fundamental constraints in synchronous muscle. Consequentially, these constraints set a fundamental limit to the maximum speed of fine motor control.",

When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, we show that answers to the second query vary systematically depending on the structure of the first query.

Our results demonstrate that these modules exhibit a high degree of functional coherence and reveal known as well as previously unknown functional relationships. We argue that the high functional coherence observed for the extracted modules is a consequence of the similar-yet-diverse nature of the cyanobacterial phylum. We provide a simple toolbox that facilitates further analysis of our results with respect to specific cyanobacterial genes of interest.",

    "abstract": "Cell-to-cell communication networks have critical roles in diverse organismal processes, such as coordinating tissue development or immune cell response. However, compared to intracellular signal transduction networks, the function and engineering principles of cell-to-cell communication networks are far less understood. Here, we study cell-to-cell communication networks using a framework that models the input-to-output relationship of intracellular signal transduction networks with a single function--the response-time distribution. We identify a prototypic response-time distribution--the gamma distribution--arising in both experimental data sets and mathematical models of signal-transduction pathways. We find that simple cell-to-cell communication circuits can generate bimodal response-time distributions, and can control synchronization and delay of cell-population responses independently. We apply our modeling approach to explain otherwise puzzling data on cytokine secretion onset times in T cells. Our approach can be used to predict communication network structure using experimentally accessible input-to-output measurements and without detailed knowledge of intermediate steps.",

In practice, however, it is hardly possible to measure fitness for all genotypes in a natural population. Here, we present quantitative tools to make inferences about epistatic gene interactions when the fitness landscape is only incompletely determined due to imprecise measurements or missing observations. We demonstrate that genetic interactions can often be inferred from fitness rank orders, where all genotypes are ordered according to fitness, and even from partial fitness orders. We provide a complete characterization of rank orders that imply higher order epistasis. Our theory applies to all common types of gene interactions and facilitates comprehensive investigations of diverse genetic interactions.

    "abstract": "The proteostasis network (PN) comprises a plethora of proteins that are dedicated to aid in protein folding; some with over-lapping functions. Despite this, there are multiple pathophysiological states associated with depletion of chaperones. This is counter-intuitive assuming cells have the ability to re-program transcriptional outputs in accordance with its proteostasic limitations. To this effect, we have used S. cerevisiae to understand the route a cell takes as a response when challenged with different proteostasis impairments. Using 14 single deletion strains of genes of Protein Quality Control (PQC) system, we quantify their proteostasis impairment and the transcriptional response. In most cases cellular response was incapable of restoring proteostasis. The response did not activate proteostasis components or pathways that could complement the function of the missing PQC gene. Over-expression of alternate machineries, could restore part of the proteostasis defect in deletion strains. We posit that epistasis guided synthetic biology approaches may be helpful in realizing the true potential of the cellular chaperone machinery.",

In the quest to infer accurate ancestral rearrangement scenarios, it is often the case that parsimony principal alone does not impose enough constraints. Thus, the current challenge is to consider more biological information in the inference process. In previous work, we introduced a model for such a task, based on a partition into equivalence classes of the adjacencies between genes. Such a partition is amenable to the representation of spacial constraints as given by Hi-C data. A major open question is the validity of such a model. In this note, we show that the quality of a clustering of the adjacencies based on Hi-C data is directly correlated to the quality of a rearrangement scenario that we compute between Drosophila melanogaster and D. yakuba.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas is a bacterial and archaeal adaptive immune system that uses short, invader-derived sequences termed spacers to target invasive nucleic acids. Upon recognition of previously encountered invaders, the system can stimulate secondary spacer acquisitions, a process known as primed adaptation. Previous studies of primed adaptation have been complicated by intrinsically high interference efficiency of most systems against bona fide targets. As such, most primed adaptation to date has been studied within the context of imperfect sequence complementarity between spacers and targets. Here, we take advantage of a native type I-C CRISPR-Cas system in Legionella pneumophila that displays robust primed adaptation even within the context of a perfectly matched target. Using next-generation sequencing to survey acquired spacers, we observe strand bias and positional preference that are consistent with a 3' to 5' translocation of the adaptation machinery. We show that spacer acquisition happens in a wide range of frequencies across the plasmid, including a remarkable hotspot that predominates irrespective of the priming strand. We systematically characterize protospacer sequence constraints in both adaptation and interference and reveal extensive flexibilities regarding the protospacer adjacent motif in both processes. Lastly, in a strain with a genetically truncated CRISPR array, we observe greatly increased interference efficiency coupled with a dramatic shift away from spacer acquisition towards spacer loss. Based on these observations, we propose that the Legionella type I-C system represents a powerful model to study primed adaptation and the interplay between CRISPR interference and adaptation.",

Only for a small fraction of the spacers, homologous sequences, termed protospacers, are detectable in viral, plasmid or microbial genomes 3,4. The rest of the spacers remain the CRISPR \\\"dark matter\\\". We performed a comprehensive analysis of the spacers from all CRISPR-cas loci identified in bacterial and archaeal genomes, and found that, depending on the CRISPR-Cas subtype and the prokaryotic phylum, protospacers were detectable for 1 to about 19% of the spacers ([~]7% global average). Among the detected protospacers, the majority, typically, 80 to 90%, originate from viral genomes, and among the rest, the most common source are genes integrated in microbial chromosomes but involved in plasmid conjugation or replication. Thus, almost all spacers with identifiable protospacers target mobile genetic elements (MGE). The GC-content, as well as dinucleotide and tetranucleotide compositions, of microbial genomes, their spacer complements, and the cognate viral genomes show a nearly perfect correlation and are almost identical. Given the near absence of self-targeting spacers, these findings are best compatible with the possibility that the spacers, including the dark matter, are derived almost completely from the species-specific microbial mobilomes.",

    "abstract": "The trial-to-trial response variability that is shared between pairs of neurons (termed spike count correlations1 or rSC) has been the subject of many recent studies largely because it might limit the amount of information that can be encoded by neuronal populations. Spike count correlations are flexible and change depending on task demands2-7. However, the relationship between correlated variability and information coding is a matter of current debate2-14. This debate has been difficult to resolve because testing the theoretical predictions would require simultaneous recordings from an experimentally unfeasible number of neurons. We hypothesized that if correlated variability limits population coding, then spike count correlations in visual cortex should a) covary with subjects performance on visually guided tasks and b) lie along the dimensions in neuronal population space that contain information that is used to guide behavior. We focused on two processes that are known to improve visual performance: visual attention, which allows observers to focus on important parts of a visual scene15-17, and perceptual learning, which slowly improves observers ability to discriminate specific, well-practiced stimuli18-20. Both attention and learning improve performance on visually guided tasks, but the two processes operate on very different timescales and are typically studied using different perceptual tasks. Here, by manipulating attention and learning in the same task, subjects, trials, and neuronal populations, we show that there is a single, robust relationship between correlated variability in populations of visual neurons and performance on a change-detection task. We also propose an explanation for the mystery of how correlated variability might affect performance: it is oriented along the dimensions of population space used by the animal to make perceptual decisions. Our results suggest that attention and learning affect the same aspects of the neuronal population activity in visual cortex, which may be responsible for learning- and attention-related improvements in behavioral performance. More generally, our study provides a framework for leveraging the activity of simultaneously recorded populations of neurons, cognitive factors, and perceptual decisions to understand the neuronal underpinnings of behavior.",

We refer to the latter as quadratic or parabolic models. The parabolic-like and strictly parabolic voltage nullclines coincide at their extrema (minima or maxima) and are well approximated by each other in vicinities of these extrema whose size depend on the model parameters. Quadratic models are simplified by a change of variables that translates these extrema into the origin of the phase-plane diagram. A further simplification (parameter reduction) can be achieved by nondimensionalizing the quadratic models. This procedure can be extended to three-dimensional models having a parabolic-cylinder-like shaped voltage nullsurface and to models having time-dependent inputs and synaptic currents.",

Systemic knockdown of Fxn in adult mice led to multiple phenotypes paralleling those observed in human patients across multiple organ systems. By reversing knockdown after clinical features appear, we were able to determine to what extent observed phenotypes represent reversible cellular dysfunction. Remarkably, upon restoration of near wild-type FXN levels, we observed significant recovery of function, associated pathology and transcriptomic dysregulation even after substantial motor dysfunction and pathology were observed. This model will be of broad utility in therapeutic development and in refining our understanding of the relative contribution of reversible cellular dysfunction at different stages in disease.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage checkpoints are cellular mechanisms that protect the integrity of the genome during cell cycle progression. In response to genotoxic stress, these checkpoints halt cell cycle progression until the damage is repaired, allowing cells enough time to recover from damage before resuming normal proliferation. Here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of DNA damage checkpoints in individual proliferating cells by observing cell cycle phase transitions following acute DNA damage. We find that in gap phases (G1 and G2), DNA damage triggers an abrupt halt to cell cycle progression in which the duration of arrest correlates with the severity of damage. However, cells that have already progressed beyond a proposed \\\"commitment point\\\" within a given cell cycle phase readily transition to the next phase, revealing a relaxation of checkpoint stringency during later stages of certain cell cycle phases. In contrast to G1 and G2, cell cycle progression in S phase is significantly less sensitive to DNA damage. Instead of exhibiting a complete halt, we find that increasing DNA damage doses leads to decreased rates of S-phase progression followed by arrest in the subsequent G2. Moreover, these phase-specific differences in DNA damage checkpoint dynamics are associated with corresponding differences in the proportions of irreversibly arrested cells. Thus, the precise timing of DNA damage determines the sensitivity, rate of cell cycle progression, and functional outcomes for damaged cells. These findings should inform our understanding of cell fate decisions after treatment with common cancer therapeutics such as genotoxins or spindle poisons, which often target cells in a specific cell cycle phase.",

MERIDIAN allows us to estimate the joint probability distribution over signaling parameters that is consistent with experimentally observed cell-to-cell variability in abundances of network species. We apply the developed approach to investigate the heterogeneity in the signaling network activated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leading to phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Using the inferred parameter distribution, we also predict heterogeneity of phosphorylated Akt levels and the distribution of EGF receptor abundance hours after EGF stimulation.

By tracing the histories of individual cells over multiple generations, we found that cells whose offspring were destined to differentiate showed decreased expression of OCT4 long before exposure to the differentiation stimulus. OCT4 levels were lineage-dependent; however, during cell division, mother cells distributed OCT4 asymmetrically to daughters. The resulting ratio of OCT4 between sister cells--established within minutes of mitosis--was predictive of downstream fates: cells receiving a greater ratio of maternal OCT4 showed sustained OCT4 levels and a reduced capacity to differentiate. Our observations imply that the choice between two developmental fates is almost entirely predetermined at the time of cell birth through inheritance of a pluripotency factor.",

We found that Arginase 1 (Arg1), an enzyme that converts L-arginine to urea and ornithine, was markedly elevated in Lrp5-/- lungs compared with wild-type mice after bleomycin injury. We show that this induction is not apparently due to the expression of Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, but instead is due to Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, which negatively regulates Arg1 expression in lung macrophages. Although Arg1 expression in macrophages has been used to define an alternatively activated phenotype, flow cytometry analysis of alveolar and interstitial macrophage sub-populations in Lrp5-/- lungs 14 days after bleomycin injury revealed no clear evidence of skewing from a classical to an alternatively activated phenotype. Upregulation of Arg1 expression and arginase activity might diminish lung arginine levels with consequent alterations in collagen or cytokine production. However, dietary supplementation of bleomycin-treated Lrp5-/- mice with the Arg1 substrate, L-arginine, failed to alter lung collagen content or cytokine levels 21 days after bleomycin injury. These findings demonstrate that Arg1 is negatively regulated by {beta}-catenin signaling in macrophages, raising the possibility that Wnt signaling directs alterations in immune cell metabolism that may be relevant to lung repair after injury.",

    "abstract": "For decades, academic biologists have advocated for making conservation decisions in light of evolutionary history. Specifically, they suggest that policymakers should prioritize conserving phylogenetically diverse assemblages. The most prominent argument is that conserving phylogenetic diversity (PD) will also conserve diversity in traits and features (functional diversity; FD), which may be valuable for a number of reasons. The claim that PD-maximized ( maxPD) sets of taxa will also have high FD is often taken at face value and in cases where researchers have actually tested it, they have done so by measuring the phylogenetic signal in ecologically important functional traits. The rationale is that if traits closely mirror phylogeny, then saving the maxPD set of taxa will tend to maximize FD and if traits do not have phylogenetic structure, then saving the maxPD set of taxa will be no better at capturing FD than criteria that ignore PD. Here, we suggest that measuring the phylogenetic signal in traits is uninformative for evaluating the effectiveness of using PD in conservation. We evolve traits under several different models and, for the first time, directly compare the FD of a set of taxa that maximize PD to the FD of a random set of the same size. Under many common models of trait evolution and tree shapes, conserving the maxPD set of taxa will conserve more FD than conserving a random set of the same size. However, this result cannot be generalized to other classes of models. We find that under biologically plausible scenarios, using PD to select species can actually lead to less FD compared to a random set. Critically, this can occur even when there is phylogenetic signal in the traits. Predicting exactly when we expect using PD to be a good strategy for conserving FD is challenging, as it depends on complex interactions between tree shape and the assumptions of the evolutionary model. Nonetheless, if our goal is to maintain trait diversity, the fact that conserving taxa based on PD will not reliably conserve at least as much FD as choosing randomly raises serious concerns about the general utility of PD in conservation.",

    "abstract": "Our recent study on mathematical modeling of microbial genome evolution indicated that, on average, genomes of bacteria and archaea evolve in the regime of mutation-selection balance defined by positive selection coefficients associated with gene acquisition that is counter-acted by the intrinsic deletion bias. This analysis was based on the strong assumption that parameters of genome evolution are universal across the diversity of bacteria and archaea, and yielded extremely low values of the selection coefficient. Here we further refine the modeling approach by taking into account evolutionary factors specific for individual groups of microbes using two independent fitting strategies, an ad hoc hard fitting scheme and an hierarchical Bayesian model. The resulting estimate of the mean selection coefficient of s[~]10-10 associated with the gain of one gene implies that, on average, acquisition of a gene is beneficial, and that microbial genomes typically evolve under a weak selection regime that might transition to strong selection in highly abundant organisms with large effective population sizes. The apparent selective pressure towards larger genomes is balanced by the deletion bias, which is estimated to be consistently greater than unity for all analyzed groups of microbes. The estimated values of s are more realistic than the lower values obtained previously, indicating that global and group-specific evolutionary factors synergistically affect microbial genome evolution that seems to be driven primarily by adaptation to existence in diverse niches.",

    "abstract": "Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death for children globally, causing 760,000 deaths each year in children under the age of 5. Amoebic dysentery contributes significantly to this burden, especially in developing countries. We hypothesize that genetic variation contributes to susceptibility to diarrhea-associated Entamoeba histolytica infection in Bangladeshi infants; thus, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two independent birth cohorts of diarrhea-associated E. histolytica infection. Cases were defined as children with at least one diarrheal episode positive for E. histolytica through either PCR or ELISA within the first year of life. Controls were children without any episodes positive for E. histolytica in the same time frame. Meta-analyses under a fixed-effects inverse variance weighting model identified variants in two neighboring genes on chromosome 10: CUL2 (cullin 2) and CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) associated with E. histolytica infection, with SNP rs58000832 achieving genome-wide significance (Pmeta=4.2x10-10). Each additional risk allele (an intergenic insertion between CREM and CCNY) of rs58000832 conferred 2.5 increased odds of a diarrhea-associated E. histolytica infection. The most associated SNP within a gene was in an intron of CREM (rs58468685, Pmeta=2.3x10-9), which with CUL2, has been implicated as a susceptibility locus for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Crohns Disease. Gene expression resources suggest these loci are related to the higher expression of CREM, but not CUL2. Increased CREM expression is also observed in early E. histolytica infection. Further, CREM-/- mice were more susceptible to E. histolytica amebic colitis. These genetic associations reinforce the pathological similarities observed in gut inflammation between E. histolytica infection and IBD.",

We also identified multiple pre-eclampsia associated genes which are differentially expressed in Homo sapiens when compared to the other 13 species. Multiple genes are significantly associated with placenta morphology, including EREG and WNT5A which are both associated with placental shape.\\n\\nDiscussion115 genes are important for the core functions of the placenta in all eutherian species analyzed. The molecular functions and pathways enriched in the core placenta align with the evolutionarily conserved functionality of the placenta.",

    "abstract": "Depression, anxiety, and stress are common in pregnant women. One of the primary pharmacological treatments for anxiety and depression is the antidepressant fluoxetine (Flx). Maternal stress, depression, and Flx exposure are known to effect neurodevelopment of the offspring, however, their combined effects have been scarcely studied, especially in female offspring. The present study investigated the combined effects of maternal stress during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to Flx on the behaviour of female mice as adults. METHODS: Mouse dams were exposed to either chronic unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), or FLX (E15-postnatal day 12), or a combination of stress and FLX or left untreated. At two months of age, the female offspring went through a comprehensive behavioural test battery. RESULTS: Maternal stress led to increased activity and alterations of prepulse inhibition in the adult female offspring. Maternal treatment with Flx had a potentially beneficial effect on spatial memory. The combination of prenatal stress and perinatal Flx exposure did not interact in their effects. These results suggest that gestational Flx exposure may have a limited negative impact on female offspring.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to predict protein expression from DNA sequence alone remains poor, reflecting our limited understanding of cis-regulatory grammar and hampering the design of engineered genes for synthetic biology applications. Here, we generate a model that predicts the translational efficiency of the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a library of half a million 50-nucleotide-long random 5 UTRs and assayed their activity in a massively parallel growth selection experiment. The resulting data allow us to quantify the impact on translation of Kozak sequence composition, upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and secondary structure. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the random library and showed that it performs well at predicting the translational efficiency of both a held-out set of the random 5 UTRs as well as native S. cerevisiae 5 UTRs. The model additionally was used to computationally evolve highly translating 5 UTRs. We confirmed experimentally that the great majority of the evolved sequences lead to higher translation rates than the starting sequences, demonstrating the predictive power of this model.",

    "abstract": "The posterior medial barrel subfield (PMBSF) of rat primary somatosensory cortex exquisitely demonstrates topography and columnar organization, defining features of sensory cortices in the mammalian brain. Optical imaging and neuronal recordings in rat PMBSF demonstrates how evoked cortical activity following single whisker stimulation also rapidly spreads laterally into surrounding cortices, disregarding columnar and modality boundaries. The current study quantifies the spatial prominence of such lateral activity spreads by demonstrating that functional connectivity between laterally spaced cortical locations is actually stronger than between vertically spaced cortical locations. Further, the total amount of evoked activity within and beyond single column boundaries was quantified based on intrinsic signal optical imaging, single units and local field potentials (LFPs) recordings, revealing that the vast majority of whisker evoked activity in PMBSF occurs beyond columnar boundaries. Finally, a simple two layer artificial neural network model of PMBSF demonstrates the capacity of extra-columnar evoked activity spread to provide a foundation for accurate whisker stimulus classification that is robust to random scaling of inputs and local noise. Indeed, classification performance improved when more of the lateral spread was included in the model, providing further evidence for the relevance of the lateral spread.",
