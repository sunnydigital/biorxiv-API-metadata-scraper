    "abstract": "Mitotic rounding (MR) during cell division is critical for the robust segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells and is frequently perturbed in cancerous cells. MR has been studied extensively in individual cultured cells, but the physical mechanisms regulating MR in intact tissues are still poorly understood. A cell undergoes mitotic rounding by simultaneously reducing adhesion with its neighbors, increasing actomyosin contraction around the cortex, and increasing the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. Whether these changes are purely additive, synergistic or impact separate aspects of MR is not clear. Specific modulation of these processes in dividing cells within a tissue is experimentally challenging, because of off-target effects and the difficulty of targeting only dividing cells. In this study, we analyze MR in epithelial cells by using a newly developed multi-scale, cell-based computational model that is calibrated using experimental observations from a model system of epithelial tissue growth, the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. The model simulations predict that increase in apical surface area of mitotic cells is solely driven by increasing cytoplasmic pressure. MR however is not achieved within biological constraints unless all three properties (cell-cell adhesion, cortical stiffness and pressure) are simultaneously regulated by the cell. The new multi-scale model is computationally implemented using a parallelization algorithm on a cluster of graphic processing units (GPUs) to make simulations of tissues with a large number of cells feasible. The model is extensible to investigate a wide range of cellular phenomena at the tissue scale.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMitotic rounding (MR) during cell division is critical for the robust segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells and is frequently perturbed in cancerous cells. MR has been studied extensively in individual cultured cells, but the physical mechanisms regulating MR in intact tissues are still poorly understood. The newly developed computational model Epi-scale enables one to produce new hypotheses about the underlying biophysical mechanisms governing MR of epithelial cells within the developing tissue micro-environment. In particular, our simulations results predict that robust mitotic rounding requires co-current changes in cell-cell adhesion, cortical stiffness and cytoplasmic pressure, and explains how regulation of each property impacts the shapes of dividing cells in tissues.",

    "abstract": "Slowing is a common feature of ageing, yet a direct relationship between neural slowing and brain atrophy is yet to be established in healthy humans. We combine magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measures of neural processing speed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of white- and gray-matter in a large (N=617, 18-88yrs), population-derived cohort (www.cam-can.org) to investigate the relationship between age-related structural differences and VEF and AEF delay across two different tasks. Using a novel technique, we show that VEFs exhibit a constant delay, whereas AEPs exhibit delay that accumulates over time. Visual delay is mediated by white-matter microstructure in the optic radiation, presumably reflecting increased transmission time, whereas auditory delay is mediated by gray-matter differences in auditory cortex, presumably reflecting less efficient local processing. Our results demonstrate that age has dissociable effects on neural processing speed, and that these effects relate to different types of brain atrophy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and other various next-generation sequencing (-omics) fields are known for their production of large datasets, especially across single-cell sequencing studies. Visualizing such big data has posed technical challenges in biology, both in terms of available computational resources as well as programming acumen. Since heatmaps are used to depict high-dimensional numerical data as a colored grid of cells, efficiency and speed have often proven to be critical considerations in the process of successfully converting data into graphics. For example, rendering interactive heatmaps from large input datasets (e.g., 100k+ rows) has been computationally infeasible on both desktop computers and web browsers. In addition to memory requirements, programming skills and knowledge have frequently been barriers-to-entry for creating highly customizable heatmaps.\\n\\nResultsWe propose shinyheatmap: an advanced user-friendly heatmap software suite capable of efficiently creating highly customizable static and interactive biological heatmaps in a web browser. shinyheatmap is a low memory footprint program, making it particularly well-suited for the interactive visualization of extremely large datasets that cannot typically be computed in-memory due to size restrictions. Also, shinyheatmap features a built-in high performance web plug-in, fastheatmap, for rapidly plotting interactive heatmaps of datasets as large as 105 - 107 rows within seconds, effectively shattering previous performance benchmarks of heatmap rendering speed.\\n\\nConclusionsshinyheatmap is hosted online as a freely available web server with an intuitive graphical user interface: http://shinyheatmap.com. The methods are implemented in R, and are available as part of the shinyheatmap project at: https://github.com/Bohdan-Khomtchouk/shinyheatmap. Users can access fastheatmap directly from within the shinyheatmap web interface, and all source code has been made publicly available on Github: https://github.com/Bohdan-Khomtchouk/fastheatmap.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is involved in regulation of gene expression. Although modern methods profile DNA methylation at single CpG sites, methylation levels are usually averaged over genomic regions in the downstream analyses. In this study we demonstrate that single CpG methylation can serve as a more accurate predictor of gene expression compared to average promoter / gene body methylation. CpG positions with significant correlation between methylation and expression of a gene nearby (named CpG traffic lights) are evolutionary conserved and enriched for exact TSS positions and active enhancers. Among all promoter types, CpG traffic lights are especially enriched in poised promoters. Genes that harbor CpG traffic lights are associated with development and signal transduction. Methylation levels of individual CpG traffic lights vary between cell types dramatically with the increased frequency of intermediate methylation levels, indicating cell population heterogeneity in CpG methylation levels. Being in line with the concept of the inherited stochastic epigenetic variation, methylation of such CpG positions might contribute to transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, one can hypothesize that traffic lights are markers of absent gene expression resulting from inactivation of their regulatory elements. The CpG traffic lights provide a promising insight into mechanisms of enhancer activity and gene regulation linking methylation of single CpG to expression.",

It was demonstrated that the amphioxus homologue of RAG1-RAG2 is encoded in an active transposon, belonging to the transposase DDE superfamily. The data provided supports to the possibility that the RAG transposon has been active through the deuterostome evolution and is still active in several lineages. The RAG transposon corresponds to several families present in deuterostomes. RAG1-RAG2 V(D)J recombinase evolved from one of them, partially due to the new ability of the transposon to interact with the cellular reparation machinery. Considering the fact that the RAG transposon survived millions of years in many different lineages, in multiple copies, and that DDE transposases evolved their association with proteins involved in repair mechanisms, we propose that the apparition of V(D)J recombination machinery could be a predictable genetic event.",

In fact, impairments in memory flexibility are associated with pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder or autism; however the underlying mechanisms that enable memory flexibility are still poorly understood. Here we identified the transcriptional repressor Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) as a critical synaptic plasticity regulator that decreases memory strength, promoting memory flexibility. WT1 was activated in the hippocampus following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or learning. WT1 knockdown enhanced CA1 neuronal excitability, LTP and long-term memory whereas its over-expression weakened memory retention. Moreover, forebrain WT1-deficient mice showed deficits in both reversal, sequential learning tasks and contextual fear extinction, exhibiting impaired memory flexibility. We conclude that WT1 limits memory strength or promotes memory weakening, thus enabling memory flexibility, a process that is critical for learning from new experience.",

    "abstract": "Directed connectivity inference has become a cornerstone in neuroscience following the recent progress in neuroimaging and elctrophysiological techniques to characterize anatomical and functional networks. This paper focuses on the detection of existing connections from the observed activity in networks of 50 to 150 nodes with linear feedback in discrete time. Through the variation of multiple network parameters, our numerical results indicate that directed connections - in the time domain - are more accurately estimated based on the coefficients obtained from multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) than Granger causality analysis, which is based on the error residuals of the same MVAR linear regression. Based on these findings, we propose a non-parametric significance test for connectivity detection, which achieves a good control of false positives (type 1 error) and is robust to various network topologies. When generating surrogate distributions, we compare the effects of circular shifts, random permutations and phase randomization of the observed time series, each breaking down covariances in a specific manner: the MVAR estimates from those shuffled covariances build a null-hypothesis distribution for each connection, from which the original connectivity estimate can be compared. We apply our method to multiunit activity data recorded from Utah electrode arrays in monkey and examine the detected interactions between 25 channels for a proof of concept. The results unravel a non-trivial underlying connectivity structure, which differentiates the effect of incoming and outgoing connections.",

Here we combine population genomic, biophysical modeling, and evolutionary simulations to predict future adaptation of the common coral Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef. Loss of coral cover in recent decades did not yet have detectable effect on genetic diversity in our species. Genomic analysis of migration patterns closely matched the biophysical model of larval dispersal in favoring the spread of existing heat-tolerant alleles from lower to higher latitudes. Given these conditions we find that standing genetic variation could be sufficient to fuel rapid adaptation of A. millepora to warming for the next 100-200 years, although random thermal anomalies would drive increasingly severe mortality episodes. However, this adaptation will inevitably cease unless the warming is slowed down, since no realistic mutation rate could replenish adaptive genetic variation fast enough.",

In RNA-Seq experiments, the expression level of a gene is measured by the count of short reads that are mapped to the gene region. Although some normal-based statistical methods may also be applied to log-transformed read counts, they are not ideal for directly modeling RNA-Seq data. Two discrete distributions, Poisson distribution and negative binomial distribution, have been commonly used in the literature to model RNA-Seq data, where the latter is a natural extension of the former with allowance of overdispersion. Due to the technical difficulty in modeling correlated counts, most existing classifiers based on discrete distributions assume that genes are independent of each other. However, as we show in this paper, the independence assumption may cause non-ignorable bias in estimating the discriminant score, making the classification inaccurate. To this end, we drop the independence assumption and explicitly model the dependence between genes using Gaussian copula. We apply a Bayesian approach to estimate covariance matrix and the overdispersion parameter in negative binomial distribution. Both synthetic data and real data are used to demonstrate the advantages of our model.",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the decision to mate or invade relies on environmental cues that converge on a shared transcription factor, Ste12. Specificity toward invasion occurs via Ste12 binding cooperatively with the co-factor Tec1. Here, we characterize the in vitro binding preferences of Ste12 to identify a defined spacing and orientation of dimeric sites, one that is common in pheromone-regulated genes. We find that single amino acid changes in the DNA-binding domain of Ste12 can shift the preference of yeast toward either mating or invasion. These mutations define two distinct regions of this domain, suggesting alternative modes of DNA binding for each trait. Some exceptional Ste12 mutants promote hyperinvasion in a Tec1-independent manner; these fail to bind cooperative sites with Tec1 and bind to unusual dimeric Ste12 sites that contain one highly degenerate half site. We propose a model for how activation of invasion genes could have evolved with Ste12 alone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is related to cognitive sequelae in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and can have serious impacts on quality of life after recovery. Although various pathogenic pathways are involved in SAE development, little is known concerning the global role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SAE.\\n\\nMethodsHerein, we employed transcriptome sequencing approaches to characterize the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on lncRNA expression patterns in brain tissue isolated from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with and without SAE. We performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing after LPS was intraperitoneally injected and predicted targets and functions using bioinformatics tools. Subsequently, we explored the results in detail according to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses.\\n\\nResultsLncRNAs were differentially expressed in brain tissue after LPS treatment. After 6 h of LPS exposure, expression of 400 lncRNAs were significantly changed, including an increase in 316 lncRNAs and a decrease in 84 lncRNAs. In addition, 155 mRNAs were differentially expressed, with 84 up-regulated and 71 down-regulated. At 24 h post-treatment, expression of 117 lncRNAs and 57 mRNAs was consistently elevated, while expression of 79 lncRNAs and 21 mRNAs was decreased (change > 1.5-fold; p < 0.05). We demonstrated for the first time that differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted to be enriched in a post-chaperonin tubulin folding pathway (GO : 007023), which is closely related to the key step in the tubulin folding process.\\n\\nInterestingly, the predicted pathway (KEGG 04360: axon guidance) was significantly changed under the same conditions. These results reveal that LPS might influence the construction and polarization of microtubules, which exert predominant roles in synaptogenesis and related biofunctions in the rodent central nervous system (CNS).\\n\\nConclusionsAn inventory of LPS-modulated expression profiles from the rodent CNS is an important step toward understanding the function of mRNAs, including lncRNAs, and suggests that microtubule malformation and dysfunction may be involved in SAE pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is a major factor of genome evolution, deeply characterized in only a few model species, notably the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Consequently, little is known about variations of its properties across species. In this respect, we explored the recombination landscape of Lachancea kluyveri, a protoploid yeast species that diverged from the Saccharomyces genus more than 100 million years ago and we found striking differences with S. cerevisiae. These variations include a lower recombination rate, a higher frequency of chromosomes segregating without any crossover and the absence of recombination on the chromosome arm containing the sex locus. In addition, although well conserved within the Saccharomyces clade, the S. cerevisiae recombination hotspots are not conserved over a broader evolutionary distance. Finally and strikingly, we found evidence of frequent reversion of meiotic commitment to mitotic growth allowing allele shuffling without meiosis completion. Identification of this major but underestimated evolutionary phenomenon illustrates the relevance of exploring non-model species.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMeiotic recombination promotes accurate chromosome segregation and genetic diversity. To date, the mechanisms and rules lying behind recombination were dissected using model organisms such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To assess the conservation and variation of this process over a broad evolutionary distance, we explored the meiotic recombination landscape in Lachancea kluyveri, a budding yeast species that diverged from S. cerevisiae more than 100 million years ago. The meiotic recombination map we generated revealed that the meiotic recombination landscape and properties significantly vary across distantly related yeast species, supporting that recombination hotspots conservation across yeast species is likely associated to the conservation of synteny. Finally, the frequent meiotic reversions we observed led us to re-evaluate their evolutionary importance.",

Using a novel diagnostic test measuring the expression of four RNA biomarkers in blood (SeptiCyte LAB) we aimed to distinguish between infection and inflammation in this setting.\\n\\nMethodsWe enrolled hospitalized patients with ARF requiring prompt intubation in the ICU from 2011 to 2013. We excluded patients having an established infection diagnosis or an evidently non-infectious reason for intubation. Blood samples were collected upon ICU admission. Test results were categorized into four probability bands (with higher bands indicating a higher probability of infection) and compared with the plausibility of infection as rated by post-hoc assessment using predefined definitions.\\n\\nResultsOf 467 included patients, 373 (80%) were treated for a suspected infection at admission. Plausibility of infection was classified as ruled-out, undetermined, or confirmed in 41 (11%), 135 (36%), and 197 (53%) of these, respectively. Overall, the pre-test probability of infection was 42%. Test results correlated with the plausibility of infection (Spearmans rho 0.332; p<0.001). After exclusion of undetermined cases, positive predictive values were 29%, 54%, and 76% for probability bands 2, 3, and 4, respectively, whereas the negative predictive value for band 1 was 76%. However, SeptiCyte LAB did not outperform CRP when comparing diagnostic discrimination (AUC 0.731; 95%CI 0.677-0.786 vs. 0.727; 95%CI 0.666-0.788).\\n\\nConclusionIn a setting of hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU with ARF, the diagnostic value of SeptiCyte LAB seems limited.",

    "abstract": "It is common to find that major-effect genes are an important cause of variation in susceptibility to infection. Here we have characterised natural variation in a gene called pastrel that explains over half of the genetic variance in susceptibility to the virus DCV in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We found extensive allelic heterogeneity, with a sample of seven alleles of pastrel from around the world conferring four phenotypically distinct levels of resistance. By modifying candidate SNPs in transgenic flies, we show that the largest effect is caused by an amino acid polymorphism that arose when an ancestral threonine was mutated to alanine, greatly increasing resistance to DCV. Overexpression of the ancestral susceptible allele provides strong protection against DCV, indicating that this mutation acted to improve an existing restriction factor. The pastrel locus also contains complex structural variation and cis-regulatory polymorphisms altering gene expression. We find that higher expression of pastrel is associated with increased survival after DCV infection. To understand why this variation is maintained in populations, we investigated genetic variation surrounding the amino acid variant that is causing flies to be resistant. We found no evidence of natural selection causing either recent changes in allele frequency or geographical variation in frequency, suggesting that this is an old polymorphism that has been maintained at a stable frequency. Overall, our data demonstrate how complex genetic variation at a single locus can control susceptibility to a virulent natural pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The cryptic diversity of microbial communities represent an untapped biotechnological resource for biomining, biorefining and synthetic biology. Revealing this information requires the recovery of the exact sequence of DNA bases (or \\\"haplotype\\\") that constitutes the genes and genomes of every individual present. This is a computationally difficult problem complicated by the requirement for environmental sequencing approaches (metagenomics) due to the resistance of the constituent organisms to culturing in vitro.\\n\\nHaplotypes are identified by their unique combination of DNA variants. However, standard approaches for working with metagenomic data require simplifications that violate assumptions in the process of identifying such variation. Furthermore, current haplotyping methods lack objective mechanisms for choosing between alternative haplotype reconstructions from microbial communities.\\n\\nTo address this, we have developed a novel probabilistic approach for reconstructing haplotypes from complex microbial communities and propose the \\\"metahaplome\\\" as a definition for the set of haplotypes for any particular genomic region of interest within a metagenomic dataset. Implemented in the twin software tools Hansel and Gretel, the algorithm performs incremental probabilistic haplotype recovery using Naive Bayes -- an efficient and effective technique.\\n\\nOur approach is capable of reconstructing the haplotypes with the highest likelihoods from metagenomic datasets without a priori knowledge or making assumptions of the distribution or number of variants. Additionally, the algorithm is robust to sequencing and alignment error without altering or discarding observed variation and uses all available evidence from aligned reads. We validate our approach using synthetic metahaplomes constructed from sets of real genes, and demonstrate its capability using metagenomic data from a complex HIV-1 strain mix. The results show that the likelihood framework can allow recovery from microbial communities of cryptic functional isoforms of genes with 100% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Theta rhythms govern rodent sniffing and whisking, and human language processing. Human psychophysics suggests a role for theta also in visual attention. Yet, little is known about theta in visual areas and its attentional modulation. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from areas V1, V2, V4 and TEO of two macaque monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. We found a {approx}4 Hz theta rhythm within both the V1-V2 and the V4-TEO region, and theta synchronization between them, with a predominantly feedforward directed influence. ECoG coverage of large parts of these regions revealed a surprising spatial correspondence between theta and visually induced gamma. Furthermore, gamma power was modulated with theta phase. Selective attention to the respective visual stimulus strongly reduced these theta-rhythmic processes, leading to an unusually strong attention effect for V1. Microsaccades (MSs) were partly locked to theta. Yet, neuronal theta rhythms tended to be even more pronounced for epochs devoid of MSs. Thus, we find an MS-independent theta rhythm specific to visually driven parts of V1-V2, which rhythmically modulates local gamma and entrains V4-TEO, and which is strongly reduced by attention. We propose that the less theta-rhythmic and thereby more continuous processing of the attended stimulus serves the exploitation of this behaviorally most relevant information. The theta-rhythmic and thereby intermittent processing of the unattended stimulus likely reflects the ecologically important exploration of less relevant sources of information.",

    "abstract": "Mood instability is a core clinical feature of affective and psychotic disorders. In keeping with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, it may be a useful construct for identifying biology that cuts across psychiatric categories. We aimed to investigate the biological validity of a simple measure of mood instability and evaluate its genetic relationship with several psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mood instability in 53,525 cases and 60,443 controls from UK Biobank, identifying four independently-associated loci (on chromosomes eight, nine, 14 and 18), and a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimate of approximately 8%. We found a strong genetic correlation between mood instability and MDD (rg=0.60, SE=0.07, p=8.95 x 10-17) and a small but significant genetic correlation with both schizophrenia (rg=0.11, SE=0.04, p=0.01) and anxiety disorders (rg=0.28, SE=0.14, p=0.04), although no genetic correlation with BD, ADHD or PTSD. Several genes at the associated loci may have a role in mood instability, including the DCC netrin 1 receptor (DCC) gene, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit beta (eIF2B2), placental growth factor (PGF), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D (PTPRD). Strengths of this study include the very large sample size, but our measure of mood instability may be limited by the use of a single question. Overall, this work suggests a polygenic basis for mood instability. This simple measure can be obtained in very large samples; our findings suggest that doing so may offer the opportunity to illuminate the fundamental biology of mood regulation.",

    "abstract": "The shaping of a multicellular body and repair of adult tissues require fine-tuning of cell adhesion, cell mechanics and intercellular transmission of mechanical load. Adherens junctions (AJs) are the major intercellular junctions by which cells sense and exert mechanical force on each other. However, how AJs adapt to mechanical stress and how this adaptation contributes to cell-cell cohesion and eventually to tissue-scale dynamics and mechanics remains largely unknown. Here, by analyzing the tension-dependent recruitment of vinculin, -catenin and F-actin as a function of stiffness, as well as the dynamics of GFP-tagged wild-type and mutated -catenins, altered for their binding capability to vinculin, we demonstrate that the force-dependent binding of vinculin stabilizes -catenin and is responsible for AJ adaptation to force. Challenging cadherin complexes mechanical coupling with magnetic tweezers, and cell-cell cohesion during collective cell movements, further highlight that tension-dependent adaptation of AJs regulates cell-cell contact dynamics and coordinated collective cell migration. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the force-dependent -catenin/vinculin interaction, manipulated here by mutagenesis and mechanical control, is a core regulator of AJ mechanics and long-range cell-cell interactions.\\n\\nSummary statementCombining cell biology and biomechanical analysis, we show here that the coupling between cadherin complexes and actin trough tension-dependent -catenin/vinculin association is regulating AJ stability and dynamics as well as tissue-scale mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Global dynamics in the brain can be captured using fMRI, MEG, or electrocorticography (ECoG), but models are often restricted by anatomical constraints. Complementary single-/multi-unit recordings have described local fast temporal dynamics. However, because of anatomical constraints, global fast temporal dynamics remain incompletely understood. Therefore, we compared temporal aspects of cross-area propagations of single-unit recordings and ECoG, and investigated their anatomical bases. First, we demonstrated how both evoked and spontaneous ECoGs can accurately predict latencies of single-unit recordings. Next, we estimated the propagation velocity (1.0-1.5 m/s) from brain-wide data and found that it was fairly stable among different conscious levels. We also found that the anatomical topology strongly predicted the latencies. Finally, Communicability, a novel graph-theoretic measure, could systematically capture the balance between shorter or longer pathways. These results demonstrate that macro-connectomic perspective is essential for evaluating detailed temporal dynamics in the brain.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThis study produced four main findings: First, we demonstrated that ECoG signals could predict the timing of evoked electrical spikes of neurons elicited by visual stimuli. Second, we showed that spontaneous ECoG recorded under a blindfold condition (without any stimuli) could also predict the timing of visually evoked neuronal spikes. We also clarified that performance predictions from blindfold data are essentially supported by the constraints of structural paths. Third, we quantified the propagation velocity (conductance velocity) as 1.0-1.5 m/s, and found that the velocity was stable among different conscious levels. Fourth, Communicability successfully characterized the relative contributions of shorter and longer paths. This study represents an important contribution to the theoretical understanding of the brain in terms of connectomics, dynamical propagations, and multi-scale architectures.",

    "abstract": "Loss of natural landscapes surrounding major conservation areas compromise their future and threaten long-term conservation. We evaluate the effectiveness of fully and lesser protected areas within Katavi-Rukwa and Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystems in south-western Tanzania to protecting natural landscapes within their boundaries over the past four decades. Using a time series of Landsat satellite imageries of September 1972, July 1990 and September 2015, we assess the extent to which natural habitat has been lost within and around these areas mainly through anthropogenic activities. We also test the viability of the remaining natural habitat to provide connectivity between the two ecosystems. Our analysis reveals that while fully protected areas remained intact over the past four decades, lesser protected areas lost a combined total area of about 5,984 km2 during that period which is about 17.5% of habitat available in 1972. We also find that about 3,380 km2 of natural habitat is still available for connectivity between the two ecosystems through Piti East and Rungwa South Open Areas. We recommend relevant authorities to establish conservation friendly village land use plans in all villages surrounding and between the two ecosystems to ensure long-term conservation of these ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "As climate change shifts species' climatic envelopes across the landscape, equilibrium between geographic ranges and niches is likely diminishing due to time lags in demography and dispersal. If a species' range and niche are out of equilibrium, then population performance should decrease from cool, \\\"leading\\\" range edges, where populations are expanding into recently ameliorated habitats, to warm, \\\"trailing\\\" range edges, where populations are contracting from newly unsuitable areas. Population contraction signals that compensatory changes in vital rates are insufficient to buffer population growth from deteriorating environments. Life history theory predicts tradeoffs between fast development, high reproduction, and short longevity at low latitudes and slow development, less frequent but multiple bouts of reproduction, and long lifespan at high latitudes. If demographic compensation is driven by life history evolution, compensatory negative correlations in vital rates may be associated with this fast-slow continuum. An outstanding question is whether range limits and range contractions reflect inadequate compensatory life history shifts along environmental gradients, causing population growth rates to fall below replacement levels at range edges. We surveyed demography of 32 populations of the scarlet monkeyflower (Erythranthe cardinalis) spanning 11{degrees} latitude in western North America and used integral projection models to infer population dynamics and assess demographic compensation. Population growth rates decreased from north to south, consistent with leading-trailing dynamics. Southern populations are declining due to reduced survival, growth, and recruitment, despite compensatory increases in reproduction and faster life history characteristics, suggesting that demographic compensation will not rescue populations at the trailing range edge.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhile climate change is causing poleward shifts in many species' geographic distributions, some species' ranges have remained stable, particularly at low-latitude limits. One explanation for why some species' ranges have not shifted is demographic compensation, whereby declines in some demographic processes are offset by increases in others, potentially buffering populations from extinction. However, we have limited understanding of whether demographic compensation can prevent collapse of populations facing climate change. We examined the demography of natural populations of a perennial herb spanning a broad latitudinal gradient. Despite increases in reproduction, low-latitude populations declined due to diminished survival, growth, and recruitment. Thus, demographic compensation may not be sufficient to rescue low-latitude, warm-edge populations from extinction.",

    "abstract": "Fast adaptation to changes in the environment requires both natural and artificial agents to be able to dynamically tune an exploration-exploitation trade-off during learning. This trade-off usually determines a fixed proportion of exploitative choices (i.e. choice of the action that subjectively appears as best at a given moment) relative to exploratory choices (i.e. testing other actions that now appear worst but may turn out promising later). The problem of finding an efficient exploration-exploitation trade-off has been well studied both in the Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience fields. Rather than using a fixed proportion, non-stationary multi-armed bandit methods in the former have proven that principles such as exploring actions that have not been tested for a long time can lead to performance closer to optimal - bounded regret. In parallel, researches in the latter have investigated solutions such as progressively increasing exploitation in response to improvements of performance, transiently increasing exploration in response to drops in average performance, or attributing exploration bonuses specifically to actions associated with high uncertainty in order to gain information when performing these actions. In this work, we first try to bridge some of these different methods from the two research fields by rewriting their decision process with a common formalism. We then show numerical simulations of a hybrid algorithm combining bio-inspired meta-learning, kalman filter and exploration bonuses compared to several state-of-the-art alternatives on a set of non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandit tasks. While we find that different methods are appropriate in different scenarios, the hybrid algorithm displays a good combination of advantages from different methods and outperforms these methods in the studied scenarios.",

These species migrate from nesting grounds in South America to feed on gelatinous zooplankton (jellyfish) in the North Atlantic off the coast of the United States and Canada. The seasonal foraging grounds of sea turtles heavily overlap with areas of high fishing effort for the longline tuna and swordfish fleet, a fishery that has significantly high rates of sea turtle incidents. The dynamic nature of sea turtle foraging patterns renders static spatio-temporal fishing area closures ineffective. Rather, turtle by-catch mitigation requires small-scale, event-triggered closures and decentralized management to reduce incidents while minimizing the negative socio-economic impact of area closures on fishermen. A number of methods that increase fishing selectivity have been implemented in other commercial fisheries around the globe and are suggested for the Atlantic Canadian fleet moving forward.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated many low-penetrance loci in schizophrenia. However, its pathological mechanisms are poorly understood, which in turn hampers the development of novel pharmacological treatments. Pathway and gene set analyses carry the potential to generate hypotheses about disease mechanisms and have provided biological context to genome-wide data of schizophrenia. We aimed to examine which biological processes are likely candidates to underlie schizophrenia by integrating novel and powerful pathway analysis tools using data from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia GWAS (N = 79 845) and the most recent 2018 schizophrenia GWAS (N = 105 318). By applying a primary unbiased analysis (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation; MAGMA) to weigh the role of biological processes from the MSigDB database, we identified enrichment of common variants in synaptic plasticity and neuron differentiation gene sets. We supported these findings using MAGMA, Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA) and Interval Enrichment Analysis (INRICH) on detailed synaptic signaling pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and found enrichment in mainly the dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses. Moreover, shared genes involved in these neurotransmitter systems had a large contribution to the observed enrichment, protein products of top genes in these pathways showed more direct and indirect interactions than expected by chance, and expression profiles of these genes were largely similar among brain tissues. In conclusion, we provide strong and consistent genetics and protein-interaction informed evidence for the role of postsynaptic signaling processes in schizophrenia, opening avenues for future translational and psychopharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing studies on cancer somatic mutations have discovered that driver mutations tend to appear in most tumor samples, but they barely overlap in any single tumor sample, presumably because a single driver mutation can perturb the whole pathway. Based on the corresponding new concepts of coverage and mutual exclusivity, new methods can be designed for de novo discovery of mutated driver pathways in cancer. Since the computational problem is a combinatorial optimization with an objective function involving a discontinuous indicator function in high dimension, many existing optimization algorithms, such as a brute force enumeration, gradient descent and Newton's methods, are practically infeasible or directly inapplicable. We develop a new algorithm based on a novel formulation of the problem as non-convex programming and nonconvex regularization. The method is computationally more efficient, effective and scalable than existing Monte Carlo searching and several other algorithms, which have been applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We also extend the new method for integrative analysis of both mutation and gene expression data. We demonstrate the promising performance of the new methods with applications to three cancer datasets to discover de novo mutated driver pathways.",

Especially bird survey methods have been tested using classical point counts and autonomous sound recording techniques.\\n2) We review the latest information by comparing both survey methods' standardization, verifiability, sampling completeness, data types, compatibility, and practicality by means of a systematic review and a meta-analysis of alpha and gamma species richness levels sampled by both methods across 20 separate studies.\\n3) Although sound recording surveys have hitherto not enjoyed the most effective setups, they yield very similar results in terms of alpha and gamma species richness. We also reveal the crucial importance of the microphone (high signal-to-noise ratio) as the sensor that replaces human senses.\\n4) We discuss key differences between both methods, while richness estimates are closely related and 81% of all species were detected by both methods. Sound recording techniques provide a more powerful and promising tool to monitor birds in a standardized, verifiable, and exhaustive way against the golden standard of point counts. Advantages include the capability of sampling continuously through day or season and of difficult-to-reach regions in an autonomous way, avoidance of observer bias and human disturbance effects and higher detection probability of rare species due to extensive recordings.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParasites can either respond to differences in immune defenses that exist between individual hosts plastically or, alternatively, follow a genetically canalized (\\\"hard wired\\\") program of infection. Assuming that large-scale functional plasticity would be discernible in the parasite transcriptome we have performed a dual RNA-seq study of the full lifecycle of Eimeria falciformis using infected mice with different immune status (e.g. naive versus immune animals) as models for coccidian infections.\\n\\nResultsWe compared parasite and host transcriptomes (dual transcriptome) between naive and challenge infected mice, as well as between immune competent and immune deficient ones. Mice with different immune competence show transcriptional differences as well as differences in parasite reproduction (oocyst shedding). Broad gene categories represented by differently abundant host genes indicate enrichments for immune reaction and tissue repair functions. More specifically, TGF-beta, EGF, TNF and IL-1 and IL-6 are examples of functional annotations represented differently depending on host immune status. Much in contrast, parasite transcriptomes were neither different between Coccidia isolated from immune competent and immune deficient mice, nor between those harvested from naive and challenge infected mice. Instead, parasite transcriptomes have distinct profiles early and late in infection, characterized largely by biosynthesis or motility associated functional gene groups, respectively. Extracellular sporozoite and oocyst stages showed distinct transcriptional profiles and sporozoite transcriptomes were found enriched for species specific genes and likely pathogenicity factors.\\n\\nConclusionWe propose that the niche and host-specific parasite E. falciformis uses a genetically canalized program of infection. This program is likely fixed in an evolutionary process rather than employing phenotypic plasticity to interact with its host. In turn this might (negatively) influence the ability of the parasite to use different host species and (positively or negatively) influence its evolutionary potential for adaptation to different hosts or niches.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure RNA expression at the single-cell level, thus paving the way for exploring expression heterogeneity among individual cells. Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols are complex and introduce technical biases that vary across cells, which can bias downstream analysis without proper adjustment. To account for cell-to-cell technical differences, we propose a statistical framework, TASC (Toolkit for Analysis of Single Cell RNA-seq), an empirical Bayes approach to reliably model the cell-specific dropout rates and amplification bias by use of external RNA spike-ins. TASC incorporates the technical parameters, which reflect cell-to-cell batch effects, into a hierarchical mixture model to estimate the biological variance of a gene and detect differentially expressed genes. More importantly, TASC is able to adjust for covariates to further eliminate confounding that may originate from cell size and cell cycle differences. In simulation and real scRNA-seq data, TASC achieves accurate Type I error control and displays competitive sensitivity and improved robustness to batch effects in differential expression analysis, compared to existing methods. TASC is programmed to be computationally efficient, taking advantage of multi-threaded parallelization. We believe that TASC will provide a robust platform for researchers to leverage the power of scRNA-seq.",

    "abstract": "Infrastructures for data, such as repositories, curation systems, aggregators, indexes and standards are public goods. This means that finding sustainable economic models to support them is a challenge. This is due to free-loading, where someone who does not contribute to the support of the infrastructure nonetheless gains the benefit of it. The work of Mancur Olson (1974) suggests there are only three ways to address this for large groups: compulsion (often as some form of taxation) to support the infrastructure; the provision of non-collective (club) goods limited to those who contribute as a side-effect of providing the collective good; or mechanisms that lower the effective number of participants in the negotiation (oligopoly).\\n\\nIn this paper I use Olsons framework to analyze existing scholarly infrastructures and proposals for the sustainability of new infrastructures. I argue that the focus on sustainability models prior to seeking a set of agreed governance principles is the wrong approach. Rather we need to understand how to navigate from club-like to public-like goods. We need to define the communities that contribute and identify club-like benefits for those contributors. We need interoperable principles of governance and resourcing to provide public-like goods and we should draw on the political economics of taxation to develop this.",

In reinforcement learning, the agent learns the value of the states in the task, collectively constituting the task state space, and use the knowledge to choose actions and acquire desired outcomes. It has been proposed that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes the task state space during reinforcement learning. However, it is not well understood how the OFC acquires and stores task state information. Here, we propose a neural network model based on reservoir computing. Reservoir networks exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic activity patterns that are suitable to encode task states. The information can be extracted by a linear readout trained with reinforcement learning. We demonstrate how the network acquires and stores the task structures. The network exhibits reinforcement learning behavior and its aspects resemble experimental findings of the OFC. Our study provides a theoretical explanation of how the OFC may contribute to reinforcement learning and a new approach to understanding the neural mechanism underlying reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Pedigrees, though straightforward and versatile, lack the ability to tell us information about many individuals. Though numerical systems have been developed, there is currently no system to quantify the probability of a pedigree following certain inheritance systems. My system intends to fulfill that chasm by creating a flexible numerical system and testing it for variance. First, my system attempts to adapt inheritance system to known pedigree data. Then, it calculates the difference between the calculated values and the known pedigree data. It aggregates these values, then it uses a chi-squared analysis in order to determine the likelihood of said inheritance system. This is done for many different systems, until we have a general idea of which systems are probable and which are not.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a complex disease and studying DNA methylation (DNAm) in tumors is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We compared DNAm in breast tumors with normal-adjacent breast samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We constructed models stratified by tumor stage and PAM50 molecular subtype and performed cell-type reference-free deconvolution on each model. We identified nineteen differentially methylated gene regions (DMGRs) in early stage tumors across eleven genes (AGRN, C1orf170, FAM41C, FLJ39609, HES4, ISG15, KLHL17, NOC2L, PLEKHN1, SAMD11, WASH5P). These regions were consistently differentially methylated in every subtype and all implicated genes are localized on chromosome 1p36.3. We also validated seventeen DMGRs in an independent data set. Identification and validation of shared DNAm alterations across tumor subtypes in early stage tumors advances our understanding of common biology underlying breast carcinogenesis and may contribute to biomarker development. We also provide evidence on the importance and potential function of 1p36 in cancer.",
