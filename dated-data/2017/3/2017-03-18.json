As these technologies become more common, there is a need for computational tools to explore the data they produce.

We implemented an interactive web-tool to visualize single-cell data using force-directed graph layouts, called SPRING. SPRING reveals more detailed biological relationships than existing approaches when applied to branching gene expression trajectories from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Visualizations from SPRING are also more reproducible than those of stochastic visualization methods such as tSNE, a state-of-the-art tool.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://kleintools.hms.harvard.edu/tools/spring.html,https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/SPRING/\\n\\nContactcalebsw@gmail.com, allon_klein@hms.harvard.edu",

    "abstract": "Myosin Vc (myoVc) is unique among vertebrate class V myosin isoforms in that it requires teams of motors to transport cargo. Single molecules of myoVc cannot take multiple steps on single actin filaments, in stark contrast to the well-studied myosin Va (myoVa) isoform. Consistent with in vivo studies (1), only teams of myoVc motors can move continuously on actin bundles at physiologic ionic strength (2), raising the question of how motor-motor interactions cause this preference. Here, using DNA nanostructures as synthetic cargos for linking defined numbers of myoVa or myoVc molecules, we compared the stepping behavior of myoVa versus myoVc teams, and myoVc stepping patterns on single actin filaments versus actin bundles. Run lengths of both myoVa and myoVc teams increased with motor number, but the run lengths of myoVc teams were longer on actin bundles than on filaments. By resolving the stepping behavior of individual myoVc motors with a Qdot bound to the motor domain, we found that coupling of two myoVc molecules significantly decreases futile back/side steps, which were frequently observed for single myoVc motors. Data showing how changes in the inter-motor distance of two coupled myoVc motors affected stepping dynamics suggested that mechanical tension coordinates the stepping behavior of two molecules for efficient directional motion. Our study thus provides a molecular basis to explain how teams of myoVc motors are suited to transport cargos such as zymogen granules on actin bundles.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal responses in visual cortex show a diversity of complex temporal properties. These properties include sub-additive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. Here, we hypothesize that these seemingly disparate effects can be explained by a single, shared computational mechanism. We propose a model consisting of a linear stage, followed by history-dependent gain control. The model accounts for these various temporal phenomena, tested against an unusually diverse set of measurements - intracranial electrodes in patients, fMRI, and macaque single unit spiking. The model further enables us to uncover a systematic and rich variety of temporal encoding strategies across visual cortex: First, temporal receptive field shape differs both across and within visual field maps. Second, later visual areas show more rapid and pronounced adaptation. Our study provides a new framework to understand the transformation between visual input and dynamical cortical responses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe nervous system extracts meaning from the distribution of light over space and time. Spatial vision has been a highly successful research area, and the spatial receptive field has served as a fundamental and unifying concept that spans perception, computation, and physiology. While there has also been a large interest in temporal vision, the temporal domain has lagged the spatial domain in terms of quantitative models of how signals are transformed across the visual hierarchy. Here we present a model of temporal dynamics of neuronal responses in human cerebral cortex. We show that the model can accurately predict responses at the millisecond scale using intracortical electrodes in patient volunteers, and that the same model generalizes to multiple types of other measurements, including functional MRI and action potentials from monkey cortex. Further, we show that a single model can account for a variety of temporal phenomena, including short-term adaptation and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. By developing a computational model and showing that it successfully generalizes across measurement types, cortical areas, and stimuli, we provide new insights into how time-varying images are encoded and transformed into dynamic cortical responses.",

    "abstract": "An increase of nitrogen deposition resulting from human activities is not only a major threat for global biodiversity, but also for human health, especially in highly populated regions. It is thus important and in some instances legally mandated to monitor reactive nitrogen species in the atmosphere. The utilization of widely distributed biological species suitable for biomonitoring may be a good alternative. We assessed the suitability of an ensemble of atmospheric biomonitors of nitrogen deposition by means of an extensive sampling of a lichen, two mosses, and a bromeliad throughout the Valley of Mexico, whose population reaches 30 million, and subsequent measurements of nitrogen metabolism parameters. In all cases we found significant responses of nitrogen content, C:N ratio and the {delta}15N to season and site. In turn, the {delta}15N for the mosses responded linearly to the wet deposition. Also, the nitrogen content (R2 = 0.7), the C:N ratio (R2 = 0.6), and {delta}15N (R2 = 0.5) for the bromeliad had a linear response to NOx. However, the bromeliad was not found in sites with NOx concentrations exceeding 80 ppb, apparently of as a consequence of exceeding nitrogen. These biomonitors can be utilized in tandem to determine the status of atmospheric nitrogenous pollution in regions without monitoring networks for avoiding health problems for ecosystems and humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMetazoan lineages exhibit a wide range of regenerative capabilities that vary among developmental stage and tissue type. The most robust regenerative abilities are apparent in the phyla Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, and Echinodermata, whose members are capable of whole-body regeneration (WBR). This phenomenon has been well-characterized in planarian and hydra models, but the molecular details of WBR are less established within echinoderms, or any other deuterostome system. Thus, it is not clear to what degree aspects of this regenerative ability are due to deeply conserved mechanisms.\\n\\nResultsWe characterize regeneration in the larval stage of the Bat Star (Patiria miniata). Following bisection along the anterior-posterior axis, larvae progress through phases of wound healing and re-proportioning of larval tissues. The overall number of proliferating cells is reduced following bisection and we find evidence for a re-deployment of genes with known roles in embryonic axial patterning. Following axial re-specification, we observe a significant localization of proliferating cells to the wound region. Analyses of transcriptome data highlight the molecular signatures of functions that are common to regeneration, including specific signaling pathways and cell cycle controls. Notably, we find evidence for temporal conservation among orthologous genes involved in regeneration from published Platyhelminth and Cnidarian regeneration datasets.\\n\\nConclusionsThese analyses show that sea star larval regeneration includes phases of wound response, axis respecification, and wound proximal proliferation. Commonalities of the overall process of regeneration, as well as gene usage between this deuterostome and other species with divergent evolutionary origins suggest a deep conservation of whole-body regeneration among the metazoa.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis of homogenous glycans in quantitative yields represents a major bottleneck to the production of molecular tools for glycoscience, such as glycan microarrays, affinity resins, and reference standards. Here, we describe a combined biological/enzymatic method termed bioenzymatic synthesis that is capable of efficiently converting microbially-derived precursor oligosaccharides into structurally uniform human-type N-glycans. Unlike starting material obtained by chemical synthesis or direct isolation from natural sources, which can be time consuming and costly to generate, bioenzymatic synthesis involves precursors derived from renewable sources including wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycoproteins and lipid-linked oligosaccharides from glycoengineered Escherichia coli. Following deglycosylation of these biosynthetic precursors, the resulting microbial oligosaccharides are subjected to a greatly simplified purification scheme followed by structural remodeling using commercially available and recombinantly produced glycosyltransferases including key N- acetylglucosaminyltransferases (e.g., GnTI, GnTII, and GnTIV) involved in early remodeling of glycans in the mammalian glycosylation pathway. Using this approach, preparative quantities of hybrid and complex-type N-glycans including asymmetric multi-antennary structures were generated all without the need of a specialized skillset. Collectively, our results reveal bioenzymatic synthesis to be a user-friendly methodology for rapidly supplying homogeneous oligosaccharide structures that can be used to understand the human glycome and probe the biological roles of glycans in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The gradual heterogeneity of climatic factors pose varying selection pressures across geographic distances that leave signatures of clinal variation in the genome. Separating signatures of clinal adaptation from signatures of other evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes, genetic drift, and adaptation to non-clinal conditions of the immediate local environment is a major challenge. Here, we examine climate adaptation in five natural populations of the harlequin fly Chironomus riparius sampled along a climatic gradient across Europe. Our study integrates experimental data, individual genome resequencing, Pool-Seq data, and population genetic modelling. Common-garden experiments revealed a positive correlation of population growth rates corresponding to the population origin along the climate gradient, suggesting thermal adaptation on the phenotypic level. Based on a population genomic analysis, we derived empirical estimates of historical demography and migration. We used an FST outlier approach to infer positive selection across the climate gradient, in combination with an environmental association analysis. In total we identified 162 candidate genes as genomic basis of climate adaptation. Enriched functions among these candidate genes involved the apoptotic process and molecular response to heat, as well as functions identified in other studies of climate adaptation in other insects. Our results show that local climate conditions impose strong selection pressures and lead to genomic adaptation despite strong gene flow. Moreover, these results imply that selection to different climatic conditions seems to converge on a functional level, at least between different insect species.",

In the second step, the pore size and the specific surface area of the parent material was increased by the incorporation of swelling agents (long chain carbon amines N-N, Dimethyl-dodecylamine << DMDDA >>) in post-synthesis. Then the selective extraction of the amine and the calcination allowed us to obtain materials with pore sizes and even larger surfaces than those of the starting materials (parent materials). The adsorbents, identified as MCM-41 (P), DMDDA-41 (A), DMDDA-41 (B), DMDDA-41 (C) and MCM-41 (P/C), were characterized regarding their texture, mesoscopic ordering and chemical surface and finally their adsorption capacity was evaluated using two diffrent dyes (anionic: Orange II sodium and cationic: Janus Green B). The results obtained during the adsorption study show the efficiency of these materials, in particular the \\\"amine and calcined\\\" materials for decolorizing aqueous media contaminated with organic dyes. The kinetic studies and the adsorption isotherms were carried out to clarify the method of fixing each of the two dyes on the two materials tested.

Yet, the spatial structure of plant interaction networks in real-world ecosystems has remained elusive so far. Using spatial pattern and network analyses, we found that alpine plant communities are organised in spatially variable and complex networks. Specifically, the cohesiveness of complex networks is promoted by short-distance positive plant interactions. At fine spatial scale, where positive mutual interactions prevailed, networks were characterised by a large connected component. With increasing scale, when negative interactions took over, network architecture became more hierarchical with many detached components that show a network collapse.

    "abstract": "Nematode-insect interactions are ubiquitous, complex, and constantly changing as the host and nematode coevolve. The entomophilic nematode Pristionchus pacificus is found on a myriad of beetle species worldwide, though the molecular dynamics of this relationship are largely unknown. To better understand how host cues affect P. pacificus embryogenesis, we characterized the threshold of sensitivity to the pheromone (Z)-7-tetradecen-2-one (ZTDO) by determining the minimum exposure duration and developmental window that results in P. pacificus embryonic lethality. We found early-stage embryos exposed to volatile ZTDO for as few as four hours all display terminal embryogenesis, characterized by punctuated development up to 48 hours later, with abnormal morphology and limited lumen formation. To determine if the pheromone arrests pre-hatching development by suffocating or permeabilizing the eggshells, we raised embryos under anoxic condition as well as examined eggshell permeability using the lipophilic dye FM4-64. We found that asphyxiating the embryos arrested embryogenesis in a reversible manner but did not phenocopy the effects of ZTDO exposure, whereas the ZTDO-induced disruption of embryogenesis did correlate with increased eggshell permeability. The effects of ZTDO are also highly specific, as other lipid insect compounds do not produce any detectable embryocidal effect. The high specificity and unusual teratogenic effect of ZTDO may be important in mediating the host-nematode relationship by regulating P. pacificus development.\\n\\nSummary StatementInsect-associated nematodes coordinate their development using host cues to \\\"walk the line\\\" between mutualism and pathogenesis.

    "abstract": "In recent years, biofilms have become a central subject of research in the fields of microbiology, medicine, agriculture, or systems biology amongst others. The sociomicrobiology of multispecies biofilms, however, is still poorly understood. Here, we report a screening system that allowed us to identify soil bacteria, which induce architectural changes in biofilm colonies when cocultured with B. subtilis. We identified the soil bacterium Lysinibacillus fusiformis M5 as inducer of wrinkle-formation in B. subtilis colonies mediated by a diffusible signaling molecule. This compound was isolated by bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation. The elicitor was identified to be the purine hypoxanthine using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that the induction of wrinkle formation by hypoxanthine is not dependent on signal recognition by the histidine kinases KinA, KinB, KinC, and KinD, which are generally involved in phosphorylation of the master regulator Spo0A. Likewise, we show that hypoxanthine signaling does not induce the expression of biofilm-matrix related operons epsA-O and tasA-sipW-tapA. Finally, we demonstrate that the purine permease PbuO, but not PbuG, is necessary for hypoxanthine to induce an increase in wrinkle formation of B. subtilis biofilm colonies. Our results suggest that hypoxanthine-stimulated wrinkle development is not due to a direct induction of biofilm-related gene expression, but rather caused by the excess of hypoxanthine within B. subtilis cells, which may lead to cell stress and death.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms are a bacterial lifestyle with high relevance regarding diverse human activities. Biofilms can be favorable, for instance in crop protection. In nature, biofilms are commonly found as multispecies communities displaying complex social behaviors and characteristics. The study of interspecies interactions will thus lead to a better understanding and use of biofilms as they occur outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a screening method suitable for the identification of multispecies interactions, and showcase L. fusiformis as a soil bacterium that is able to live alongside B. subtilis and modify the architecture of its biofilms.",

    "abstract": "The Jurkat cell line has an extensive history as a model of T cell signaling. But at the turn of the 21st century, some irregularities were observed in Jurkats expression of central regulators of T cell receptor signaling, which raised doubts about how closely the cell line paralleled normal human T cells. While numerous expression deficiencies have been described in Jurkat, genetic explanations have only been provided for a handful of defects. Here, we report a comprehensive catolog of genomic variation in the Jurkat cell line based on whole-genome sequencing. With this list of all detectable, non-reference sequences, we prioritize potentially damaging mutations by mining public databases for functional effects. We confirm the majority of documented mutations in Jurkat and propose links from detrimental gene variants to observed expression abnormalities in the cell line. This work ties together decades of molecular experiments and serves as a resource that will streamline both the interpretation of past research and the design of future Jurkat studies.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been put forward as neurobiologically plausible models of the visual hierarchy. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, CNN representations of visual stimuli have previously been shown to correspond to processing stages in the ventral and dorsal streams of the visual system. Whether this correspondence between models and brain signals also holds for activity acquired at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. Here, we addressed this question by combining CNN-based encoding models with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Human participants passively viewed 1000 images of objects while MEG signals were acquired. We modelled their high temporal resolution source-reconstructed cortical activity with CNNs, and observed a feedforward sweep across the visual hierarchy between 75-200 ms after stimulus onset. This spatiotemporal cascade was captured by the network layer representations, where the increasingly abstract stimulus representation in the hierarchical network model was reflected in different parts of the visual cortex, following the visual ventral stream. We further validated the accuracy of our encoding model by decoding stimulus identity in a left-out validation set of viewed objects, achieving state-of-the-art decoding accuracy.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts using long reads has paved the way for the discovery of thousands of novel transcripts, even in very well annotated organisms as mice and humans. Nonetheless, there is a need for studies and tools that characterize these novel isoforms. Here we present SQANTI, an automated pipeline for the classification of long-read transcripts that computes 47 descriptors that can be used to assess the quality of the data and of the preprocessing pipelines. We applied SQANTI to a neuronal mouse transcriptome using PacBio long reads and illustrate how the tool is effective in readily describing the composition of and characterizing the full-length transcriptome. We perform extensive evaluation of ToFU PacBio transcripts by PCR to reveal that an important number of the novel transcripts are technical artifacts of the sequencing approach, and that SQANTI quality descriptors can be used to engineer a filtering strategy to remove them. Most novel transcripts in this curated transcriptome are novel combinations of existing splice sites, result more frequently in novel ORFs than novel UTRs and are enriched in both general metabolic and neural specific functions. We show that these new transcripts have a major impact in the correct quantification of transcript levels by state-of-the-art short-read based quantification algorithms. By comparing our iso-transcriptome with public proteomics databases we find that alternative isoforms are elusive to proteogenomics detection and are variable in protein changes with respect to the principal isoform of their genes. SQANTI allows the user to maximize the analytical outcome of long read technologies by providing the tools to deliver quality-evaluated and curated full-length transcriptomes.

    "abstract": "Because earth is currently experiencing unprecedented climate change, it is important to predict how species will respond to it. However, geographically-explicit predictive studies frequently ignore that species are comprised of genetically diverse individuals that can vary in their degree of adaptation to extreme local environments; properties that will determine the species ability to withstand climate change. Because an increase in extreme drought events is expected to challenge plant communities with global warming, we carried out a greenhouse experiment to investigate which genetic variants predict surviving an extreme drought event and how those variants are distributed across Eurasian Arabidopsis thaliana individuals. Genetic variants conferring higher drought survival showed signatures of polygenic adaptation, and were more frequently found in Mediterranean and Scandinavian regions. Using geoenvironmental models, we predicted that Central European populations might lag behind in adaptation by the end of the 21st century. Further analyses showed that a population decline could nevertheless be compensated by natural selection acting efficiently over standing variation or by migration of adapted individuals from populations at the margins of the species distribution. These findings highlight the importance of within-species genetic heterogeneity in facilitating an evolutionary response to a changing climate.\\n\\nOne-sentence summary\\\"Future genetic changes in A. thaliana populations can be forecast by combining climate change models with genomic predictions based on experimental phenotypic data.\\\"",

    "abstract": "The possibility that bacteria other than Geobacter species might contain genes for electrically conductive pili (e-pili) was investigated by heterologously expressing pilin genes of interest in Geobacter sulfurreducens. Strains of G. sulfurreducens producing high current densities, which are only possible with e-pili, were obtained with pilin genes from Flexistipes sinusarabici, Calditerrivibrio nitroreducens, and Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus. The conductance of pili from these strains was comparable to native G. sulfurreducens e-pili. The e-pili derived from C. nitroreducens, and D. alkaliphilus pilin genes are the first examples of relatively long (> 100 amino acids) pilin monomers assembling into e-pili. The pilin gene from Desulfofervidus auxilii did not yield e-pili, suggesting that the hypothesis that this sulfate reducer wires itself to ANME-1 microbes with e-pili to promote anaerobic methane oxidation should be reevaluated. A high density of aromatic amino acids and a lack of substantial aromatic-free gaps along the length of long pilins may be important characteristics leading to e-pili. This study demonstrates a simple method to screen pilin genes from difficult-to-culture microorganisms for their potential to yield e-pili; reveals new potential sources for biologically based electronic materials; and suggests that a wide phylogenetic diversity of microorganisms may employ e-pili for extracellular electron exchange.",

    "abstract": "Disease risk variants identified by GWAS are predominantly noncoding, suggesting that gene regulation plays an important role. eQTL studies in unaffected individuals are often used to link disease-associated variants with the genes they regulate, relying on the hypothesis that noncoding regulatory effects are mediated by steady-state expression levels. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to estimate the proportion of disease heritability mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed gene expression levels. The method, gene expression co-score regression (GECS regression), relies on the idea that, for a gene whose expression level affects a phenotype, SNPs with similar effects on the expression of that gene will have similar phenotypic effects. In order to distinguish directional effects mediated by gene expression from non-directional pleiotropic or tagging effects, GECS regression operates on pairs of cis SNPs in linkage equilibrium, regressing pairwise products of disease effect sizes on products of cis-eQTL effect sizes. We verified that GECS regression produces robust estimates of mediated effects in simulations. We applied the method to eQTL data in 44 tissues from the GTEx consortium (average NeQTL = 158 samples) in conjunction with GWAS summary statistics for 30 diseases and complex traits (average NGWAS = 88K) with low pairwise genetic correlation, estimating the proportion of SNP-heritability mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed gene expression in the union of the 44 tissues. The mean estimate was 0.21 (s.e. = 0.01) across 30 traits, with a significantly positive estimate (p < 0.001) for every trait. Thus, assayed gene expression in bulk tissues mediates a statistically significant but modest proportion of disease heritability, motivating the development of additional assays to capture regulatory effects and the use of our method to estimate how much disease heritability they mediate.",

    "abstract": "Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is characterized by a variety of clinical symptoms with heterogeneous degrees of severity, including intellectual disability, speech impairment, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It results from a deletion of the 22q13 locus that in most cases includes the SHANK3 gene. SHANK3 is considered a major gene for PMS, but the factors modulating the severity of the syndrome remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated 85 PMS patients with different 22q13 rearrangements (78 deletions, 7 duplications). We first explored their clinical features and provide evidence for frequent corpus callosum abnormalities. We then mapped candidate genomic regions at the 22q13 locus associated with risk of clinical features, and suggest a second locus associated with absence of speech. Finally, in some cases, we identified additional rearrangements at loci associated with ASD, potentially modulating the severity of the syndrome. We also report the first SHANK3 deletion transmitted to five affected daughters by a mother without intellectual disability nor ASD, suggesting that some individuals could compensate for such mutations. In summary, we shed light on the genotype-phenotype relationship of PMS, a step towards the identification of compensatory mechanisms for a better prognosis and possibly treatments of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.",

An inherent problem with this approach is that the presence of specific cell surface markers does not directly reflect the transcriptional state of a cell. Here we used a marker-free approach to computationally reconstruct the blood lineage tree in zebrafish and order cells along their differentiation trajectory, based on their global transcriptional differences. Within the population of transcriptionally similar stem and progenitor cells our analysis revealed considerable cell-to-cell differences in their probability to transition to another, committed state. Once fate decision was executed, the suppression of transcription of ribosomal genes and up-regulation of lineage specific factors coordinately controlled lineage differentiation. Evolutionary analysis further demonstrated that this haematopoietic program was highly conserved between zebrafish and higher vertebrates.",

Frequently each modality is analyzed separately using, for instance, dimensionality reduction techniques which result in a loss of mutual information. We propose a novel regularization method to estimate the association between the brain structure features and a scalar outcome within the linear regression framework. Our regularization technique provides a principled approach to utilizing external information arising from the structural brain connectivity to inform the estimation of the regression coefficients. Our proposal extends the classical Tikhonov regularization framework by defining a penalty term based on the structural connectivity-derived Laplacian matrix. In the work presented, we address both theoretical and computational issues. The approach is illustrated using simulated data and compared with other penalized regression methods. Finally, we apply our regularization method to study the associations between the alcoholism phenotypes and brain cortical thickness using a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived measure of structural connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Environmental factors relating to soil pH are widely known to be important in structuring soil bacterial communities, yet the relationship between taxonomic community composition and functional diversity remains to be determined. Here, we analyze geographically distributed soils spanning a wide pH gradient and assess the functional gene capacity within those communities using whole genome metagenomics. Low pH soils consistently had fewer taxa (lower alpha and gamma diversity), but only marginal reductions in functional alpha diversity and equivalent functional gamma diversity. However, coherent changes in the relative abundances of annotated genes between pH classes were identified; with functional profiles clustering according to pH independent of geography. Differences in gene abundances were found to reflect survival and nutrient acquisition strategies, with organic-rich acidic soils harboring a greater abundance of cation efflux pumps, C and N direct fixation systems and fermentation pathways indicative of anaerobiosis. Conversely, high pH soils possessed more direct transporter-mediated mechanisms for organic C and N substrate acquisition. These findings show that bacterial functional versatility may not be constrained by taxonomy, and we further identify the range of physiological adaptations required to exist in soils of varying nutrient availability and edaphic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Precisely defining how viral mutations affect HIVs sensitivity to antibodies is vital to the development and evaluation of vaccines and antibody immunotherapeutics. But despite great effort, a full map of escape mutants has not yet been delineated for even a single anti-HIV antibody. Here we describe a massively parallel experimental approach to quantify how all single amino-acid mutations to Envelope (Env) affect HIVs sensitivity to a neutralizing antibody. We applied this approach to PGT151 and identified novel sites of escape in addition to those previously defined by structural and functional studies, such as glycans at sites 611 and 637, residue 647, and sites in the fusion peptide. Evaluating the effect of each amino acid at each site lends insight into the biochemical basis of escape throughout the epitope. Thus, comprehensive mapping of HIV antibody escape gives a quantitative, mutation-level view of the ways that Env can evade neutralization.",

    "abstract": "Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or  latent personality traits that explain broad patterns of behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g. factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e. uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4 - 10 months, 10 months - 3 years, 3 - 6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303).\\n\\nHowever, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness.\\n\\nFurthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate  aggressive personality trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.",

    "abstract": "Hebbian plasticity, a synaptic mechanism which detects and amplifies co-activity between neurons, is considered a key ingredient underlying learning and memory in the brain. However, Hebbian plasticity alone is unstable, leading to runaway neuronal activity, and therefore requires stabilization by additional compensatory processes. Traditionally, a diversity of homeostatic plasticity phenomena found in neural circuits are thought to play this role. However, recent modelling work suggests that the slow evolution of homeostatic plasticity, as observed in experiments, is insufficient to prevent instabilities originating from Hebbian plasticity. To remedy this situation, we suggest that homeostatic plasticity is complemented by additional rapid compensatory processes, which rapidly stabilize neuronal activity on short timescales.",
