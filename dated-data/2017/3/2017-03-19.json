    "abstract": "Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is a powerful clinical diagnostic tool for discovering the genetic basis of many diseases. A major shortcoming of WES is uneven coverage of sequence reads over the exome targets contributing to many low coverage regions, which hinders accurate variant calling. In this study, we devised two novel metrics, Cohort Coverage Sparseness (CCS) and Unevenness (UE) Scores for a detailed assessment of the distribution of coverage of sequence reads. Employing these metrics we revealed non-uniformity of coverage and low coverage regions in the WES data generated by three different platforms. This non-uniformity of coverage is both local (coverage of a given exon across different platforms) and global (coverage of all exons across the genome in the given platform). The low coverage regions encompassing functionally important genes were often associated with high GC content, repeat elements and segmental duplications. While a majority of the problems associated with WES are due to the limitations of the capture methods, further refinements in WES technologies have the potential to enhance its clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "0Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with other machine learning techniques. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict if a customer would like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. We also explore how the K nearest neighbour approach can be used with both positive and negative information, in which case the goal of the algorithm is to fill missing entries from a matrix (imputation). By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized to ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100020). Predicting and managing contemporary adaption requires a proper understanding of the determinants of genetic variation. Spatial heterogeneity of the environment may stably maintain polymorphism when habitat contribution to the next generation can be considered independent of the degree of adaptation of local populations within habitats (i.e., under soft selection). In contrast, when habitats contribute proportionally to the mean fitness of the populations they host (hard selection), polymorphism is not expected to be maintained by selection. Although mathematically established decades ago, this prediction had never been properly explored. Here we provide an experimental test in which polymorphic populations of Escherichia coli growing in heterogeneous habitats were exposed to hard and soft selection regimes. As predicted by theory, polymorphism was longer preserved under soft selection. Complementary tests established that soft selection slowed down fixation processes and could even protect polymorphism on the long term by providing a systematic advantage to rare genotypes.",

Prominent hypotheses posit that accumulation of beta-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides drives the neurodegeneration that underlies memory loss, however the spatial origins of the lesions remain elusive. Using SWITCH, we created a spatiotemporal map of A{beta} deposition in a mouse model of amyloidosis. We report that structures connected by the fornix show primary susceptibility to A{beta} accumulation and demonstrate that aggregates develop in increasingly complex networks with age. Notably, the densest early A{beta} aggregates occur in the mammillary body coincident with electrophysiological alterations. In later stages, the fornix itself also develops overt A{beta} burden. Finally, we confirm A{beta} in the mammillary body of postmortem patient specimens.

    "abstract": "AbstractsFSHD is a genetically dominant myopathy caused by mutations that cause expression of the normally silent DUX4 gene. This transcription factor has been shown to interfere with myogenesis when misexpressed at very low levels in myoblasts, and to cause cell death when overexpressed at high levels. A previous report using adeno-associated virus to deliver high levels of DUX4 to mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated severe pathology that was suppressed on a p53 knockout background, implying that DUX4 acted through the p53 pathway. Here, we investigate the p53-dependence of DUX4 using both in vitro cellular and the transgenic iDUX4[2.7] mouse models. We find that inhibiting p53 has no effect on the cytoxicity of DUX4 in vitro. When crossed onto the p53 null background, we find no suppression of the male-specific lethality or skin phenotypes of the DUX4 transgene, and find that primary myoblasts from this mouse are still killed by DUX4 expression. These data challenge the notion that the p53 pathway is central to the pathogenicity of DUX4.\\n\\nSummary StatementDUX4 is thought to mediate cytopathology through p53. Here, DUX4 is shown to kill primary myoblasts and promote pathological phenotypes in the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model on the p53-null background, calling into question this notion.",

    "abstract": "A broad range of health benefits have been attributed to resveratrol (RSV) supplementation in mammalian systems, including the increases in longevity. Nonetheless, despite the growing number of studies performed with RSV, the molecular mechanism by which it acts still remains unknown. Recently, it has been proposed that inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation activity is the principal mechanism of RSV action. This mechanism suggests that RSV might induce mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxidative damage to cells with a concomitant decrease of cell viability and cellular life span. To prove this hypothesis, the chronological life span (CLS) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied as it is accepted as an important model of oxidative damage and aging. In addition, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release were measured in order to determine the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction. The results demonstrated that the supplementation of S. cerevisiae cultures with 100 M RSV decreased CLS in a glucose-dependent manner. At high-level glucose, RSV supplementation increased oxygen consumption during the exponential phase yeast cultures, but inhibited it in chronologically aged yeast cultures. However, at low-level glucose, oxygen consumption was inhibited in yeast cultures in the exponential phase as well as in chronologically aged cultures. Furthermore, RSV supplementation promoted the polarization of the mitochondrial membrane in both cultures. Finally, RSV decreased the release of H2O2 with high-level glucose and increased it at low-level glucose. Altogether, this data supports the hypothesis that RSV supplementation decreases CLS as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and this phenotype occurs in a glucose-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Almost all species show sexual discordance in many traits and diseases. DNA methylation is known to contribute to these differences through well-established mechanisms including X-inactivation in females, imprinting and parent-of-origin effects. Here we investigate sex discordance in DNA methylation throughout childhood in a sample of 700 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We show that autosomal sex-discordant methylation is widespread, affecting approximately 12,000 CpG sites at any given age, and stable; at least 8,500 sites are consistently different across all time points and a large proportion discordant in both the fetal and adult brain cortices. Just over 1,000 methylation differences change from birth to late adolescence, 90% of these between birth and around age seven. Sexually discordant CpG sites are enriched in genomic loci containing androgen but not estrogen targets and in genes involved in tissue development but not housekeeping functions. A methylation-derived sex score capturing the variance was calculated at each time point and found to be highly correlated between time points. This score is nominally associated with sex hormone levels in childhood as well as some phenotypes previously linked to sex hormone levels. These findings suggest that sex-discordant autosomal DNA methylation is widespread throughout the genome, likely due to the first androgen exposures in utero. It is then stably maintained from birth to late adolescence. Methylation variation at sex-discordant sites within the sexes, as summarized by the methylation sex score, likely reflects in utero androgen exposure which is relevant to human health.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAlthough we know that sex hormones are critical for establishing sexual discordance, less is known about how this discordance is achieved and maintained. Here we present evidence for widespread differences in DNA methylation between male and female children. We show that most of these differences are established prenatally, likely due to the first androgen exposures in utero, and then stably maintained throughout childhood, despite extreme fluctuations in the levels of these very same hormones. Our results support a role for DNA methylation as a means for recording and maintaining the effects of exposure to sex hormones and thus to better understand sexual variation and how it is driven by the prenatal environment.",

    "abstract": "Because earth is currently experiencing unprecedented climate change, it is important to predict how species will respond to it. However, geographically-explicit predictive studies frequently ignore that species are comprised of genetically diverse individuals that can vary in their degree of adaptation to extreme local environments; properties that will determine the species ability to withstand climate change. Because an increase in extreme drought events is expected to challenge plant communities with global warming, we carried out a greenhouse experiment to investigate which genetic variants predict surviving an extreme drought event and how those variants are distributed across Eurasian Arabidopsis thaliana individuals. Genetic variants conferring higher drought survival showed signatures of polygenic adaptation, and were more frequently found in Mediterranean and Scandinavian regions. Using geoenvironmental models, we predicted that Central European populations might lag behind in adaptation by the end of the 21st century. Further analyses showed that a population decline could nevertheless be compensated by natural selection acting efficiently over standing variation or by migration of adapted individuals from populations at the margins of the species distribution. These findings highlight the importance of within-species genetic heterogeneity in facilitating an evolutionary response to a changing climate.\\n\\nOne-sentence summary\\\"Future genetic changes in A. thaliana populations can be forecast by combining climate change models with genomic predictions based on experimental phenotypic data.\\\"",

Here, we leveraged a unique, genetically diverse population of C. neoformans from sub-Saharan Africa, commonly isolated from mopane trees, to determine how selective pressures in the environment coincidentally adapted C. neoformans for human virulence. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 387 isolates, representing the global VNI and African VNB lineages, highlighted a deep, non-recombining split in VNB (herein VNBI and VNBII). VNBII was enriched for clinical samples relative to VNBI, while phenotypic profiling of 183 isolates demonstrated that VNBI isolates were significantly more resistant to oxidative stress and more heavily melanized than VNBII isolates. Lack of melanization in both lineages was associated with loss-of-function mutations in the BZP4 transcription factor. A genome-wide association study across all VNB isolates revealed sequence differences between clinical and environmental isolates in virulence factors and stress response genes. Inositol transporters and catabolism genes, which process sugars present in plants and the human nervous system, were identified as targets of selection in all three lineages. Further phylogenetic and population genomic analyses revealed extensive loss of genetic diversity in VNBI, suggestive of a history of population bottlenecks, along with unique evolutionary trajectories for mating type loci. These data highlight the complex evolutionary interplay between adaptation to natural environments and opportunistic infections, and that selection on specific pathways may predispose isolates to human virulence.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cooperation can be disrupted by non-producers, which can profit from public goods without paying their production cost. A cheater can increase in frequency, exhausting the public good and causing a population collapse. Here we investigate how interactions among two cheaters for distinct social traits influence the short and long-term dynamics of polymorphic populations. Using as a model Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its extensively studied social traits, production of the siderophore pyoverdine and the quorum sensing regulated elastase, we analyzed the social dynamics of polymorphic populations under conditions where the two traits are required for optimal growth. We show that cheaters for either trait compete with both the wild type and each other, and that mutants for pyoverdine production can prevent a drastic population collapse caused by quorum sensing cheaters. A simple mathematical model suggests that the observed social dynamics are determined by the ratio of the costs of each social trait, such that the mutant which avoids paying the highest cost dominates the population. Finally, we demonstrate how quorum sensing regulation can avoid the full loss of cooperation.",
