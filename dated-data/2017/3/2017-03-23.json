    "abstract": "Amino acid propensities at amino acid sites change with time due to epistatic interactions or changing environment, affecting the probabilities of fixation of different amino acids. Such changes should lead to an increased rate of homoplasies (reversals, parallelisms, and convergences) at closely related species. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny of twelve mitochondrial proteins from several thousand metazoan species, and measure the phylogenetic distances between branches at which either the same allele originated repeatedly due to homoplasies, or different alleles originated due to divergent substitutions. The mean phylogenetic distance between parallel substitutions is [~]20% lower than the mean phylogenetic distance between divergent substitutions, indicating that a variant fixed in a species is more likely to be deleterious in a more phylogenetically remote species, compared to a more closely related species. These findings are robust to artefacts of phylogenetic reconstruction or of pooling of sites from different conservation classes or functional groups, and imply that single-position fitness landscapes change at rates similar to rates of amino acid changes.",

    "abstract": "We show that in model neuronal cultures, where the probability of interneuronal connection formation decreases exponentially with increasing distance between the neurons, there exists a small number of spatial nucleation centers of a network spike, from where the synchronous spiking activity starts propagating in the network typically in the form of circular traveling waves. The number of nucleation centers and their spatial locations are unique and unchanged for a given realization of neuronal network but are different for different networks. In contrast, if the probability of interneuronal connection formation is independent of the distance between neurons, then the nucleation centers do not arise and the synchronization of spiking activity during a network spike occurs spatially uniform throughout the network. Therefore one can conclude that spatial proximity of connections between neurons is important for the formation of nucleation centers. It is also shown that fluctuations of the spatial density of neurons at their random homogeneous distribution typical for the experiments in vitro do not determine the locations of the nucleation centers. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.",

One particular example is a database of 2,652 human RNA-seq experiments uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive. Recently, Solomon and Kingsford proposed the Sequence Bloom Tree data structure and demonstrated how it can be used to accurately identify SRA samples that have a transcript of interest potentially expressed. In this paper, we propose an improvement called the AllSome Sequence Bloom Tree. Results show that our new data structure significantly improves performance, reducing the tree construction time by 52.7% and query time by 39 - 85%, with a price of up to 3x memory consumption during queries. Notably, it can query a batch of 198,074 queries in under 8 hours (compared to around two days previously) and a whole set of k-mers from a sequencing experiment (about 27 mil k-mers) in under 11 minutes.",

PCR-free techniques such as shotgun metagenomics are therefore thought to be more suited for biodiversity assessments, but are currently limited by incomplete reference libraries.\\n\\nThe technique of  mitogenome-skimming or  mitogenomics, in which complete mitochondrial genomes are sequenced, is ideal to bridge the techniques of (meta)barcoding and metagenomics. However, without the enrichment of mitochondria, roughly 99 % of all sequencing reads are of non-mitochondrial origin and mostly useless for common applications, e.g. species identification.\\n\\nHere, we present a simple centrifugation protocol that leads to an average 140-fold enrichment of mitochondrial DNA.

The structure of seed networks also helps to determine the epidemiological risk for seedborne disease. We present a new method for evaluating the epidemiological role of nodes in seed networks, and apply it to a regional potato farmer consortium (CONPAPA) in Ecuador. We surveyed farmers to estimate the structure of networks of farmer seed tuber and ware potato transactions, and farmer information sources about pest and disease management. Then we simulated pathogen spread through seed transaction networks to identify priority nodes for disease detection. The likelihood of pathogen establishment was weighted based on the quality and/or quantity of information sources about disease management. CONPAPA staff and facilities, a market, and certain farms are priorities for disease management interventions, such as training, monitoring and variety dissemination. Advice from agrochemical store staff was common but assessed as significantly less reliable. Farmer access to information (reported number and quality of sources) was similar for both genders. Women had a smaller amount of the market share for seed-tubers and ware potato, however. Understanding seed system networks provides input for scenario analyses to evaluate potential system improvements.",

    "abstract": "Predicting whether individuals will colonize a novel habitat is of fundamental ecological interest and is crucial to both conservation efforts and invasive species management. A consistently supported predictor of colonization success is the number of individuals introduced, also called propagule pressure. Propagule pressure increases with the number of introductions and the number of individuals per introduction (the size of the introduction), but it is unresolved which process is a stronger driver of colonization success. Furthermore their relative importance may depend upon the environment, with multiple introductions potentially enhancing colonization of fluctuating environments. To evaluate the relative importance of the number and size of introductions and its dependence upon environmental variability, we paired demographic simulations with a microcosm experiment. Using Tribolium flour beetles as a model system, we introduced a fixed number of individuals into replicated novel habitats of stable or fluctuating quality, varying the number of introductions through time and size of each introduction. We evaluated establishment probability and the size of extant populations after 7 generations. In the simulations and microcosms, we found that establishment probability increased with more, smaller introductions, but was not affected by biologically realistic fluctuations in environmental quality. Population size was not significantly affected by environmental variability in the simulations, but populations in the microcosms grew larger in a stable environment, especially with more introduction events. In general, the microcosm experiment yielded higher establishment probability and larger populations than the demographic simulations. We suggest that genetic mechanisms likely underlie these differences and thus deserve more attention in efforts to parse propagule pressure. Our results highlight the importance of preventing further introductions of undesirable species to invaded sites, and suggest conservation efforts should focus on increasing the number of introductions or re-introductions of desirable species rather than increasing the size of those introduction events.",

This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

    "abstract": "The structure in cortical micro-circuits deviates from what would be expected in a purely random network, which has been seen as evidence of clustering. To address this issue we sought to reproduce the non-random features of cortical circuits by considering several distinct classes of network topology, including clustered networks, networks with distance-dependent connectivity and those with broad degree distributions. To our surprise we found that all these qualitatively distinct topologies could account equally well for all reported non-random features, despite being easily distinguishable from one another at the network level. This apparent paradox was a consequence of estimating network properties given only small sample sizes. In other words, networks which differ markedly in their global structure can look quite similar locally. This makes inferring network structure from small sample sizes, a necessity given the technical difficulty inherent in simultaneous intracellular recordings, problematic. We found that a network statistic called the sample degree correlation (SDC) overcomes this difficulty. The SDC depends only on parameters which can be reliably estimated given small sample sizes, and is an accurate fingerprint of every topological family. We applied the SDC criterion to data from rat visual and somatosensory cortex and discovered that the connectivity was not consistent with any of these main topological classes. However, we were able to fit the experimental data with a more general network class, of which all previous topologies were special cases. The resulting network topology could be interpreted as a combination of physical spatial dependence and non-spatial, hierarchical clustering.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe connectivity of cortical micro-circuits exhibits features which are inconsistent with a simple random network. Here we show that several classes of network models can account for this non-random structure despite qualitative differences in their global properties. This apparent paradox is a consequence of the small numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons in experiment: when inferred via small sample sizes many networks may be indistinguishable, despite being globally distinct. We develop a connectivity measure which successfully classifies networks even when estimated locally, with a few neurons at a time. We show that data from rat cortex is consistent with a network in which the likelihood of a connection between neurons depends on spatial distance and on non-spatial, asymmetric clustering.",

    "abstract": "1. AbstractIn a seminal paper by von Stein and Sarnthein (2000), it was hypothesized that \\\"bottom-up\\\" information processing of \\\"content\\\" elicits local, high frequency (beta-gamma) oscillations, whereas \\\"top-down\\\" processing is \\\"contextual\\\", characterized by large scale integration spanning distant cortical regions, and implemented by slower frequency (theta-alpha) oscillations. This corresponds to a mechanism of cortical information transactions, where synchronization of beta-gamma oscillations between distant cortical regions is mediated by widespread theta-alpha oscillations. It is the aim of this paper to express this hypothesis quantitatively, in terms of a model that will allow testing this type of information transaction mechanism. The basic methodology used here corresponds to statistical mediation analysis, originally developed by (Baron and Kenny 1986). We generalize the classical mediator model to the case of multivariate complex-valued data, consisting of the discrete Fourier transform coefficients of signals of electric neuronal activity, at different frequencies, and at different cortical locations. The \\\"mediation effect\\\" is quantified here in a novel way, as the product of \\\"dual frequency RV-coupling coefficients\\\", that were introduced in (Pascual-Marqui et al 2016, http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05343).

    "abstract": "Propensities for different amino acids within a protein site change in the course of evolution, so that an amino acid deleterious in a particular species may be acceptable at the same site in a different species. Here, we study the amino acid-changing variants in human mitochondrial genes, and analyze their occurrence in non-human species. We show that substitutions giving rise to the human amino acid variant tend to occur in lineages closely related to human more frequently than in more distantly related lineages, indicating that a human variant is more likely to be deleterious in more distant species. Unexpectedly, amino acids corresponding to pathogenic alleles in humans also more frequently originate at more closely related lineages. Therefore, a pathogenic variant still tends to be more acceptable in human mitochondria than a variant that may only be fit after a substantial perturbation of the protein structure.\\n\\nSignificanceHomologous proteins can carry different amino acids at the same position in different species. These changes can be neutral, or can reflect differences in the pressure of selection on these sites. We hypothesized that amino acids observable in human population appear on average more frequently in close than in distant human relatives. For mitochondrial proteins, we observe this for both frequent and rare human alleles. Unexpectedly, substitutions that would be pathogenic in humans also more frequently appear in species more closely related to humans than in distantly related ones. Therefore, despite their pathogenicity, these variants are on average more acceptable in humans than other amino acids that were observed at this site in distantly related species.",

    "abstract": "By profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells, single-cell RNA sequencing provides unparalleled resolution to study cellular heterogeneity. However, this comes at the cost of high technical noise, including cell-specific biases in capture efficiency and library generation. One strategy for removing these biases is to add a constant amount of spike-in RNA to each cell, and to scale the observed expression values so that the coverage of spike-in RNA is constant across cells. This approach has previously been criticized as its accuracy depends on the precise addition of spike-in RNA to each sample, and on similarities in behaviour (e.g., capture efficiency) between the spike-in and endogenous transcripts. Here, we perform mixture experiments using two different sets of spike-in RNA to quantify the variance in the amount of spike-in RNA added to each well in a plate-based protocol. We also obtain an upper bound on the variance due to differences in behaviour between the two spike-in sets. We demonstrate that both factors are small contributors to the total technical variance and have only minor effects on downstream analyses such as detection of highly variable genes and clustering. Our results suggest that spike-in normalization is reliable enough for routine use in single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses.",

    "abstract": "The vegetal pole cytoplasm represents a critical source of maternal signals for patterning the primary dorsoventral axis of the early embryo. Vegetally localized dorsal determinants are essential for the formation of the Spemann organizer, which expresses both bone morphogenetic proteins and their antagonists. The extracellular regulation of BMP signalling activity has been well characterized, however, transcriptional regulation of bmp genes along the dorsoventral axis remains largely unknown. Here, we report a novel mode of maternal regulation of BMP signalling in the lateral and ventral regions by analyzing the unexpected dorsalizing effect following vegetal yolk ablation experiment. We identified Vrtn as a novel vegetally localized maternal factor displaying dorsalizing activity. It functions as a novel transcriptional repressor to regulate bmp2b expression in the marginal region. Mechanistically, Vrtn binds bmp2b upstream sequence and inhibits its transcription independently of maternal Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling. By creating vrtn loss-of-function mutation and analyzing maternal-zygotic mutant embryos, we further showed that Vrtn is required for the formation of dorsoventral axis. Our work thus unveils a novel maternal mechanism regulating BMP gradient during dorsoventral specification.",

Transposons are usually identifiable by their high copy number within genomes. In contrast REP associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs), a recently described class of bacterial transposase, are typically present at just one copy per genome. This suggests that RAYTs no longer copy themselves and thus they no longer function as a typical transposase. Motivated by this possibility we interrogated thousands of fully sequenced bacterial genomes in order to determine patterns of RAYT diversity, their distribution across chromosomes and accessory elements, and rate of duplication. RAYTs encompass exceptional diversity and are divisible into at least five distinct groups. They possess features more similar to housekeeping genes than insertion sequences, are predominantly vertically transmitted and have persisted through evolutionary time to the point where they are now found in 24% of all species for which at least one fully sequenced genome is available. Overall, the genomic distribution of RAYTs suggests that they have been co-opted by host genomes to perform a function that benefits the host cell.",

    "abstract": "As DNA sequencing throughput increases, novel strategies for discovering genes that affect traits of interest become available. One strategy starts with a population of animals and selects individuals over multiple generations for a particular trait. Subsequent whole genome sequencing should identify loci affecting this trait. We apply this strategy by sorting flies for wing length over 18 generations, obtaining two populations that differ in wing length by 20%. Flies with longer wings had increased overall body sizes and elevated TOR activity, suggesting that genetic variation targets TOR signaling to influence body size. High-throughput sequencing of big and small flies identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms that differed between the two populations, leading us to identify five novel regulators of TOR signaling. Surprisingly, stochastic simulations of the process show that large fractions of the genetic differences between the big and small flies are probably biological false positives, selected by chance by random drift. We employ these computer simulations to identify experimental setup parameters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for successfully running sort-and-sequence experiments - a resource which will hopefully be useful for the community.",

However, the mechanisms driving their ordering are not understood. Here we show that local collision-driven nematic alignment interactions among fibroblasts are insufficient to explain observed long-range alignment. One possibility is that there exists another orientation field co-evolving with the cells and reinforcing their alignment. We propose that this field reflects the mechanical cross-talk between the fibroblasts and the underlying fibrous material on which they move. We demonstrate that this new long-range interaction can give rise to high nematic order and to the observed patterning of the cancer microenvironment.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLong-range alignment patterns of fibroblasts have been observed both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has not been much understanding of the underlying mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate that these patterns cannot be simply explained by their steric interaction with one another during collisions. Instead, we propose that fibroblasts may collectively align through non-local interactions arising from their modification of an underlying extracellular matrix. The proposed mechanism explains the observed co-alignment between fibroblasts and collagen fibers around tumors and can be be tested in future experiments that can image the dynamics of this pattern formation in vivo or in vitro",

    "abstract": "New genes, with novel protein functions, can evolve \\\"from scratch\\\" out of intergenic sequences. These de novo genes can integrate the cells genetic network and drive important phenotypic innovations. Therefore, identifying de novo genes and understanding how the transition from noncoding to coding occurs are key problems in evolutionary biology. However, identifying de novo genes is a difficult task, hampered by the presence of remote homologs, fast evolving sequences and erroneously annotated protein coding genes. To overcome these limitations, we developed a procedure that handles the usual pitfalls in de novo gene identification and predicted the emergence of 703 de novo genes in 15 yeast species from two genera whose phylogeny spans at least 100 million years of evolution. We established that de novo gene origination is a widespread phenomenon in yeasts, only a few being ultimately maintained by selection. We validated 82 candidates, by providing new translation evidence for 25 of them through mass spectrometry experiments. We also unambiguously identified the mutations that enabled the transition from non-coding to coding for 30 Saccharomyces de novo genes. We found that de novo genes preferentially emerge next to divergent promoters in GC-rich intergenic regions where the probability of finding a fortuitous and transcribed ORF is the highest. We found a more than 3-fold enrichment of de novo genes at recombination hot spots, which are GC-rich and nucleosome-free regions, suggesting that meiotic recombination would be a major driving force of de novo gene emergence in yeasts.",

Possibly the most common non-autonomous mobile genetic elements in bacteria are REPINs that can occur hundreds of times within a genome. The sum of all REPINs within a genome are an evolving populations because they replicate and mutate. We know the exact composition of this population and the sequence of each member of a REPIN population, in contrast to most other biological populations. Here, we model the evolution of REPINs as quasispecies. We fit our quasispecies model to ten different REPIN populations from ten different bacterial strains and estimate duplication rates. We find that our estimated duplication rates range from about 5 x 10-9 to 37 x 10-9 duplications per generation per genome. The small range and the low level of the REPIN duplication rates suggest a universal trade-off between the survival of the REPIN population and the reduction of the mutational load for the host genome. The REPIN populations we investigated also possess features typical of other natural populations. One population shows hallmarks of a population that is going extinct, another population seems to be growing in size and we also see an example of competition between two REPIN populations.",

As a consequence, fMRI teams worldwide have been encouraged to increase their sample sizes to reach higher power and thus increase the positive predictive value of their findings. However, an often-overlooked factor influencing power is the experimental design: by choosing the appropriate experimental design, the statistical power of a study can be increased within subjects. By optimizing the order and timing of the stimuli, power can be gained at no extra cost. To facilitate design optimization, we created a python package and web-based tool called Neurodesign to maximize the detection power or estimation efficiency within subjects, while controlling for psychological factors such as the predictability of the design. We implemented both a simulation-based optimisation, as well as an optimisation using the genetic algorithm, introduced by Wager and Nichols (2003) and further improved by Kao et al. (2009), to optimize the experimental design. The toolbox Neurodesign allows more complex experimental setups than existing toolboxes, while the GUI provides a more user-friendly experience.

Here we analyze the mutation signature associated with SGS1 deletion in yeast, and find frequent copy number changes flanked by regions of repetitive sequence and high R-loop forming potential. We show that loss of SGS1 increases R-loop accumulation and sensitizes cells to replication-transcription collisions. Accordingly, in sgs1{Delta} cells the genome-wide distribution of R-loops shifts to known sites of Sgs1 action, replication pausing regions, and to long genes. Depletion of the orthologous BLM helicase from human cancer cells also increases R-loop levels, and R-loop-associated genome instability. In support of a direct effect, BLM is found physically proximal to DNA:RNA hybrids in human cells, and can efficiently unwind R-loops in vitro. Together our data describe a conserved role for Sgs1/BLM in R-loop suppression and support an increasingly broad view of DNA repair and replication fork stabilizing proteins as modulators of R-loop mediated genome instability.",

Pulmonary rehabilitation has profound effects upon breathlessness, without influencing lung function. Learned associations can influence brain mechanisms of sensory perception. We therefore hypothesised that improvements in breathlessness with pulmonary rehabilitation may be explained by changing neural representations of learned associations, reducing \\\"over-perception\\\".\\n\\nMethodsIn 31 patients with COPD, we tested how pulmonary rehabilitation altered the relationship between brain activity during learned associations with a word-cue task (using functional magnetic resonance imaging), clinical, and psychological measures of breathlessness.\\n\\nResultsImprovements in breathlessness and breathlessness-anxiety correlated with reductions in word-cue related activity in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (breathlessness), and increased activations in attention regulation and motor networks (breathlessness-anxiety). Greater baseline (pre-rehabilitation) activity in the insula, ACC and prefrontal cortex correlated with the magnitude of improvement in breathlessness and breathlessness anxiety.\\n\\nConclusionsPulmonary rehabilitation reduces the influence of learned associations upon neural processes that generate breathlessness. Patients with stronger word-cue related activity at baseline benefitted more from pulmonary rehabilitation. These findings highlight the importance of targeting learned associations within treatments for COPD, demonstrating how neuroimaging may contribute to patient stratification and more successful personalised therapy.",

Small cells display higher p38 activity and spend more time in G1 than larger cells. Inhibition of p38 MAPK leads to loss of the compensatory G1 length extension in small cells, resulting in faster proliferation, smaller cell size and increased size heterogeneity. We propose a model wherein the p38 pathway responds to changes in cell size and regulates G1 exit accordingly, to increase cell size uniformity.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryThe p38 MAP kinase pathway coordinates cell growth and cell cycle progression by lengthening G1 in small cells, allowing them more time to grow before their next division.",

Zebrafish have been used for many years to valuate the pollution status of water and toxicity of chemicals. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of oxydemeton-methyl on the expression level of liver microsomal cytochrome P450, on the activity of NADPH-P450 reductase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in zebrafish. Adult male and female zebrafish were treated with different concentration of oxydemeton-methyl (10, 50, 100 M) for 5, 10, 20 and 30 days. We found that the oxydemeton-methyl exposure significantly increased the P450 levels and the activity of NAPDH-P450 reductase. ROS generation and the DNA damage were augmented in a dose-dependent manner in the zebrafish. These results indicated that oxydemeton-methyl is able to induce strong oxidative stress and hence highly toxic to the zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "The identification of disease associated modules based on protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) and gene expression data has provided new insights into the mechanistic nature of diverse diseases. A major problem hampering their identification is the detection of protein communities within large-scale, whole-genome PPINs. Current strategies solve the maximal clique enumeration (MCE) problem, i.e., the enumeration of all non-extendable groups of proteins, where each pair of proteins is connected by an edge. The MCE problem however is non-deterministic polynomial time hard and can thus be computationally overwhelming for large-scale, whole-genome PPINs.\\n\\nWe present ModuleDiscoverer, a novel approach for the identification of regulatory modules from PPINs in conjunction with gene-expression data. ModuleDiscoverer is a heuristic that approximates the community structure underlying PPINs. Based on a high-confidence PPIN of Rattus norvegicus and publicly available gene expression data we apply our algorithm to identify the regulatory module of a rat-model of diet induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We validate the module using single-nucleotide polymorphism data from independent genome-wide association studies. Structural analysis of the module reveals 10 sub-modules. These sub-modules are associated with distinct biological functions and pathways that are relevant to the pathological and clinical situation in NASH.\\n\\nModuleDiscoverer is freely available upon request from the corresponding author.",

    "abstract": "Word models (natural language descriptions of molecular mechanisms) are a common currency in spoken and written communication in biomedicine but are of limited use in predicting the behavior of complex biological networks. We present an approach to building computational models directly from natural language using automated assembly. Molecular mechanisms described in simple English are read by natural language processing algorithms, converted into an intermediate representation and assembled into executable or network models. We have implemented this approach in the Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA), which draws on existing natural language processing systems as well as pathway information in Pathway Commons and other online resources. We demonstrate the use of INDRA and natural language to model three biological processes of increasing scope: (i) p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage; (ii) adaptive drug resistance in BRAF-V600E mutant melanomas; and (iii) the RAS signaling pathway. The use of natural language for modeling makes routine tasks more efficient for modeling practitioners and increases the accessibility and transparency of models for the broader biology community.\\n\\nStandfirst textINDRA uses natural language processing systems to read descriptions of molecular mechanisms and assembles them into executable models.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIINDRA decouples the curation of knowledge as word models from model implementation\\nC_LIO_LIINDRA is connected to multiple natural language processing systems and can draw on information from curated databases\\nC_LIO_LIINDRA can assemble dynamical models in rule-based and reaction network formalisms, as well as Boolean networks and visualization formats\\nC_LIO_LIWe used INDRA to build models of p53 dynamics, resistance to targeted inhibitors of BRAF in melanoma, and the Ras signaling pathway from natural language\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Human genetic variability is thought to account for a substantial fraction of individual biochemical characteristics - in biomedical sense, of individual drug response. However, only a handful of human genetic variants have been linked to medication outcomes. Here, we combine data on drug-protein interactions and human genome sequences to assess the impact of human variation on their binding affinity. Using data from the complexes of FDA-drugs and drug-like compounds, we predict SNPs substantially affecting the protein-ligand binding affinities. We estimate that an average individual carries ~6 SNPs affecting ~5 different FDA-approved drugs from among all of the approved compounds. SNPs affecting drug-protein binding affinity have low frequency in the population indicating that the genetic component for many ADEs may be highly personalized with each individual carrying a unique set of relevant SNPs. The reduction of ADEs, therefore, may primarily rely on the application of computational genome analysis in the clinic rather than the experimental study of common SNPs.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster white-eyed w1118 line serves as a blank control, allowing genetic recombination of any gene of interest along with a readily recognizable marker. w1118 flies display behavioral susceptibility to environmental stimulation such as light. It is of great importance to characterize the behavioral performance of w1118 flies because this would provide a baseline from which the effect of the gene of interest could be differentiated. Little work has been performed to characterize the walking behavior in adult w1118 flies. Here we show that pulsed light stimulation increased the regularity of walking trajectories of w1118 flies in circular arenas. We statistically modeled the distribution of distances to center and extracted the walking structures of w1118 flies. Pulsed light stimulation redistributed the time proportions for individual walking structures. Specifically, pulsed light stimulation reduced the episodes of crossing over the central region of the arena. An addition of four genomic copies of mini-white, a common marker gene for eye color, mimicked the effect of pulsed light stimulation in reducing crossing in a circular arena. The reducing effect of mini-white was copy-number-dependent. These findings highlight the rhythmic light stimulation-evoked modifications of walking behavior in w1118 flies and an unexpected behavioral consequence of mini-white in transgenic flies carrying w1118 isogenic background.",

    "abstract": "We performed an integrated analysis of drug chemical structures and drug-induced transcriptional responses. We demonstrated that a network representing 3D structural similarities among 5,452 compounds can be used to automatically group together drugs with similar scaffolds and mode-of-action. We then compared the structural network to a network representing transcriptional similarities among a subset of 1,309 drugs for which transcriptional response were available in the Connectivity Map dataset. Analysis of structurally similar, but transcriptionally different, drugs sharing the same mode of action (MOA) enabled us to detect and remove weak and noisy transcriptional responses, greatly enhancing the reliability and usefulness of transcription-based approaches to drug discovery and drug repositioning. Analysis of transcriptionally similar, but structurally different drugs with unrelated MOA, led us to the identification of a \\\"toxic\\\" transcriptional signature indicative of lysosomal stress (lysosomotropism) and lipid accumulation (phospholipidosis) partially masking the target-specific transcriptional effects of these drugs. We further demonstrated by High Content Screening that this transcriptional signature is caused by the activation of the transcription factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Our results show that chemical structures and transcriptional profiles provide complementary information and that combined analysis can lead to new insights on on- and off-target effects of small molecules.",

    "abstract": "The impact of epistasis on the evolution of multilocus traits depends on recombination. Population genetic theory has been largely developed for eukaryotes, many of which recombine so frequently that epistasis between polymorphisms has not been considered to play a large role in adaptation and has been compared to the fleeting influence of non-heritable effects. Many bacteria also recombine, some to the degree that their populations are described as  panmictic or  freely recombining. However, whether this recombination is sufficient to limit the ability of selection to act on epistatic contributions to fitness is unknown. We create a sensitive method to quantify homologous recombination in five bacterial pathogens and use these parameter estimates in a multilocus model of bacterial evolution with additive and epistatic effects. We find that even for highly recombining species (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori), selection may act on the cumulative effects of weak (as well as strong) interactions between distant mutations since homologous recombination typically transfers only short segments. Furthermore, whether selection acts more efficiently on physically proximal loci depends on the average recombination tract length. Epistasis may thus play an important role in the adaptive evolution of bacteria and, unlike in eukaryotes, does not need to be strong, involve near loci, or require specific metapopulation dynamics.",

Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing was used to genotype this sampling at 7,347 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 334 of which were identified as outlier loci and candidates for divergent selection within at least one ecotype comparison. Eighty-six of these outliers were present in multiple comparisons, with thirty-three detected across multiple catchments. Of particular note, one locus was detected as the most significant outlier between shore and stream-spawning ecotypes in multiple comparisons and across catchments (Columbia, Fraser and Snake). We also detected several islands of divergence, some shared among comparisons, potentially showing linked signals of differential selection. The SNPs and genomic regions identified in our study offer a range of mechanistic hypotheses associated with the genetic basis of O. nerka life history variation and provide novel tools for informing fisheries management.",

    "abstract": "Instinctive defensive behaviors are essential for animal survival. Across the animal kingdom there are sensory stimuli that innately represent threat and trigger stereotyped behaviors such as escape or freezing [1-4]. While innate behaviors are considered to be hard-wired stimulus-responses [5], they act within dynamic environments, and factors such as the properties of the threat [6-9] and its perceived intensity [1, 10, 11], access to food sources [12-14] or expectations from past experience [15, 16], have been shown to influence defensive behaviors, suggesting that their expression can be modulated. However, despite recent work [2, 4, 17-21], little is known about how flexible mouse innate defensive behaviors are, and how quickly they can be modified by experience. To address this, we have investigated the dependence of escape behavior on learned knowledge about the spatial environment, and how the behavior is updated when the environment changes acutely. Using behavioral assays with innately threatening visual and auditory stimuli, we show that the primary goal of escape in mice is to reach a previously memorized shelter location. Memory of the escape target can be formed in a single shelter visit lasting less than 20 seconds, and changes in the spatial environment lead to a rapid update of the defensive action, including changing the defensive strategy from escape to freezing. Our results show that while there are innate links between specific sensory features and defensive behavior, instinctive defensive actions are surprisingly flexible and can be rapidly updated by experience to adapt to changing spatial environments.",

Our limited understanding of Plasmodium biology hinders the elucidation of resistance mechanisms. In this regard, systems biology approaches can facilitate the integration of existing experimental knowledge and further understanding of these mechanisms.\\n\\nRESULTSHere, we developed a novel genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction, iPfal17, of the asexual blood-stage P. falciparum parasite to expand our understanding of metabolic changes that support resistance. We identified 11 metabolic tasks to evaluate iPfal17 performance. Flux balance analysis and simulation of gene knockouts and enzyme inhibition predict candidate drug targets unique to resistant parasites. Moreover, integration of clinical parasite transcriptomes into the iPfal17 reconstruction reveals patterns associated with antimalarial resistance. These results predict that artemisinin sensitive and resistant parasites differentially utilize scavenging and biosynthetic pathways for multiple essential metabolites including folate and polyamines, and others within the mitochondria. Our findings are consistent with experimental literature, while generating novel hypotheses about artemisinin resistance and parasite biology. We detect evidence that resistance parasites maintain greater metabolic flexibility, perhaps representing an incomplete transition to the metabolic state most appropriate for nutrient-rich blood.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONUsing this systems biology approach, we identify metabolic shifts that arise with or in support of the resistant phenotype. This perspective allows us to more productively analyze and interpret clinical expression data for the identification of candidate drug targets for the treatment of resistant parasites.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic enzyme function and evolution is influenced by the larger context of a biochemical pathway - deleterious mutations or perturbations in one enzyme can often be compensated by mutations to others. To explore strategies for mapping adaptive dependencies between enzymes, we used a combination of comparative genomics and experiments to examine interactions with the model metabolic enzyme Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR). Biochemically, DHFR shares a metabolic intermediate with numerous folate metabolic enzymes. In contrast, comparative genomics analyses of synteny and gene co-occurrence indicate a sparse pattern of evolutionary couplings in which DHFR is coupled to the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TYMS), but is relatively independent from the rest of folate metabolism. To test this apparent modularity, we used quantitative growth rate measurements and forward evolution in E. coli to demonstrate that the two enzymes are coupled to one another, and can adapt independently from the remainder of the genome. Mechanistically, the coupling between DHFR and TYMS is driven by a constraint wherein TYMS activity must not greatly exceed that of DHFR - both to avoid depletion of reduced folates and prevent accumulation of the metabolic intermediate dihydrofolate. Extending our comparative genomics analyses genome-wide reveals over 200 gene pairs with statistical signatures similar to DHFR/TYMS, suggesting the possibility that cellular pathways might be decomposed into small adaptive units.",
