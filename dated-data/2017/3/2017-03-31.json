    "abstract": "Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in Mendelian disease diagnosis. Despite their success, the current diagnostic rate for genomic analyses across a variety of rare diseases is approximately 25-50%. Here, we explore the utility of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) as a complementary diagnostic tool in a cohort of 50 patients with genetically undiagnosed rare muscle disorders. We describe an integrated approach to analyze patient muscle RNA-seq, leveraging an analysis framework focused on the detection of transcript-level changes that are unique to the patient compared to over 180 control skeletal muscle samples. We demonstrate the power of RNA-seq to validate candidate splice-disrupting mutations and to identify splice-altering variants in both exonic and deep intronic regions, yielding an overall diagnosis rate of 35%. We also report the discovery of a highly recurrent de novo intronic mutation in COL6A1 that results in a dominantly acting splice-gain event, disrupting the critical glycine repeat motif of the triple helical domain. We identify this pathogenic variant in a total of 27 genetically unsolved patients in an external collagen VI-like dystrophy cohort, thus explaining approximately 25% of patients clinically suggestive of collagen VI dystrophy in whom prior genetic analysis is negative. Overall, this study represents a large systematic application of transcriptome sequencing to rare disease diagnosis and highlights its utility for the detection and interpretation of variants missed by current standard diagnostic approaches.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryTranscriptome sequencing improves the diagnostic rate for Mendelian disease in patients for whom genetic analysis has not returned a diagnosis.",

In recent years various approaches have been used to reveal microbial interaction networks from metagenomic sequencing data, such as time-series analysis, machine learning and statistical techniques. Despite these efforts it is still not possible to capture details of the ecological interactions behind complex microbial dynamics.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed the sparse S-map method (SSM), which generates a sparse interaction network from a multivariate ecological time-series without presuming any mathematical formulation for the underlying microbial processes. The advantage of the SSM over alternative methodologies is that it fully utilizes the observed data using a framework of empirical dynamic modelling. This makes the SSM robust to non-equilibrium dynamics and underlying complexity (nonlinearity) in microbial processes.\\nC_LIO_LIWe showed that an increase in dataset size or a decrease in observational error improved the accuracy of SSM whereas, the accuracy of a comparative equation-based method was almost unchanged for both cases and equivalent to the SSM at best. Hence, the SSM outperformed a comparative equation-based method when datasets were large and the magnitude of observational errors were small. The results were robust to the magnitude of process noise and the functional forms of inter-specific interactions that we tested. We applied the method to a microbiome data of six mice and found that there were different microbial interaction regimes between young to middle age (4-40 week-old) and middle to old age (36-72 week-old) mice.\\nC_LIO_LIThe complexity of microbial relationships impedes detailed equation-based modeling. Our method provides a powerful alternative framework to infer ecological interaction networks of microbial communities in various environments and will be improved by further developments in metagenomics sequencing technologies leading to increased dataset size and improved accuracy and precision.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Chromosome number is a key feature of the higher-order organization of the genome, and changes in chromosome number play a fundamental role in evolution. Dysploid gains and losses in chromosome number, as well as polyploidization events, may drive reproductive isolation and lineage diversification. The recent development of probabilistic models of chromosome number evolution in the groundbreaking work by Mayrose et al. (2010, ChromEvol) have enabled the inference of ancestral chromosome numbers over molecular phylogenies and generated new interest in studying the role of chromosome changes in evolution. However, the ChromEvol approach assumes all changes occur anagenetically (along branches), and does not model events that are specifically cladogenetic. Cladogenetic changes may be expected if chromosome changes result in reproductive isolation. Here we present a new class of models of chromosome number evolution (called ChromoSSE) that incorporate both anagenetic and cladogenetic change. The ChromoSSE models allow us to determine the mode of chromosome number evolution; is chromosome evolution occurring primarily within lineages, primarily at lineage splitting, or in clade-specific combinations of both? Furthermore, we can estimate the location and timing of possible chromosome speciation events over the phylogeny. We implemented ChromoSSE in a Bayesian statistical framework, specifically in the software RevBayes, to accommodate uncertainty in parameter estimates while leveraging the full power of likelihood based methods. We tested ChromoSSEs accuracy with simulations and re-examined chromosomal evolution in Aristolochia, Carex section Spirostachyae, Helianthus, Mimulus sensu lato (s.l.), and Primula section Aleuritia, finding evidence for clade-specific combinations of anagenetic and cladogenetic dysploid and polyploid modes of chromosome evolution.",

Failure to account for fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanisms may explain observed deviations from the expected negative diversity-ecosystem variability relationship, and limits our ability to predict the consequences of future increases in environmental variability. We use a consumer-resource model to explore how coexistence via the temporal storage effect and relative nonlinearity affects ecosystem variability. We show that a positive, rather than negative, diversity-ecosystem variability relationship is possible when ecosystem function is sampled across a natural gradient in environmental variability and diversity. We also show how fluctuation-dependent coexistence can buffer ecosystem functioning against increasing environmental variability by promoting species richness and portfolio effects. Our work provides a general explanation for variation in observed diversity-ecosystem variability relationships and highlights the importance of conserving regional species pools to help buffer ecosystems against predicted increases in environmental variability.",

Here we combine population genomic, biophysical modeling, and evolutionary simulations to predict future adaptation of the common coral Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef. Loss of coral cover in recent decades did not yet have detectable effect on genetic diversity in our species. Genomic analysis of migration patterns closely matched the biophysical model of larval dispersal in favoring the spread of existing heat-tolerant alleles from lower to higher latitudes. Given these conditions we find that standing genetic variation could be sufficient to fuel rapid adaptation of A. millepora to warming for the next 100-200 years, although random thermal anomalies would drive increasingly severe mortality episodes. However, this adaptation will inevitably cease unless the warming is slowed down, since no realistic mutation rate could replenish adaptive genetic variation fast enough.",

There are still many regions of smaller effect size or low frequency left to discover, and better exploitation of existing type 1 diabetes cohorts with meta analysis and imputation can precede the acquisition of new or larger cohorts. An existing dataset of 5,913 case and 8,829 control samples was analysed using genome-wide microarrays (Affymetrix GeneChip 500K and Illumina Infinium 550K) with imputation via IMPUTE2 with the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3) reference panel. Genotyping coverage was doubled in known association regions, and increased by four fold in other regions compared to previous studies. Our analysis resulted in new index variants for 17/57 regions, an expanded set of plausible candidate SNPs for 17 regions, and five novel type 1 diabetes association regions at 1p31.3, 1q24.3, 1q31.2, 2q11.2 and 11q12.2. Candidate genes for the new loci included ITGB3BP, FASLG, RGS1, AFF3 and CD5/CD6.

    "abstract": "The spread of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens pose a major threat to global health. It is widely recognised that the widespread use of antibiotics has generated selective pressures that have driven the emergence of resistant strains. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first observed in 1960, less than one year after the introduction of this second generation {beta}-lactam antibiotic into clinical practice. Epidemiological evidence has always suggested that resistance arose around this period, when the mecA gene encoding methicillin resistance carried on an SCCmec element, was horizontally transferred to an intrinsically sensitive strain of S. aureus. Whole genome sequencing a collection of the very first MRSA isolates allowed us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the archetypal MRSA. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction was applied to infer the time point at which this early MRSA lineage arose and when SCCmec was acquired. MRSA emerged in the mid 1940s, following the acquisition of an ancestral type I SCCmec element, some fourteen years prior to the first therapeutic use of methicillin. Methicillin use was not the original driving factor in the evolution of MRSA as previously thought. Rather it was the widespread use of first generation {beta}-lactams such as penicillin in the years prior to the introduction of methicillin, which selected for S. aureus strains carrying the mecA determinant. Crucially this highlights how new drugs, introduced to circumvent known resistance mechanisms, can be rendered ineffective by unrecognised adaptations in the bacterial population due to the historic selective landscape created by the widespread use of other antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Although recent evidence has pointed to the existence of small open reading frame (smORF)-encoded microproteins in mammals, the functional repertoire of this microproteome remains to be determined1. In skeletal muscle, proper development requires fusion of mononuclear progenitors to form multinucleated myotubes, a critical but poorly understood process2,3. Here we report the identification of a small ORF encoding an essential skeletal muscle specific microprotein we term Minion (microprotein inducer of fusion). Myogenic progenitors lacking Minion differentiate normally but fail to form syncytial myotubes, and Minion-deficient mice die perinatally with marked reduction in fused muscle fibers. This fusogenic activity is conserved to the human Minion ortholog, previously annotated as a long noncoding RNA. Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that Minion is the factor providing muscle specific fusogenic function for the transmembrane protein Myomaker4. Remarkably, we demonstrate that co-expression of Minion and Myomaker is sufficient to induce rapid cytoskeletal rearrangement and homogeneous cellular fusion, even in non-muscle cells. These findings establish Minion as a novel microprotein required for muscle development, and define a two-component program for the induction of mammalian cell fusion, enabling both research and translational applications. Importantly, these data also significantly expand the known functions of smORF-encoded microproteins, an under-explored source of proteomic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal homeostasis depends on a balance between stem cell renewal and terminal differentiation1,2. While progress has been made in characterising the stem and differentiated cell compartments3, the transition between the two cell states, termed commitment4, is poorly understood. Here we characterise commitment by integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data from disaggregated primary human keratinocytes held in suspension for up to 12h. We have previously shown that commitment begins at approximately 4h and differentiation is initiated by 8h5. We find that cell detachment induces a network of protein phosphatases. The pro-commitment phosphatases - including DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 and PPP3CA - promote terminal differentiation by negatively regulating ERK MAPK and positively regulating key API transcription factors. Their activity is antagonised by concomitant upregulation of the anti-commitment phosphatase DUSP10. The phosphatases form a dynamic network of transient positive and negative interactions, with DUSP6 predominating at commitment. Boolean network modelling identifies a mandatory switch between two stable states (stem cell and differentiated cell) via an unstable (committed) state. In addition phosphatase expression is spatially regulated relative to the location of stem cells, both in vivo and in response to topographical cues in vitro. We conclude that an auto-regulatory phosphatase network maintains epidermal homeostasis by controlling the onset and duration of commitment.",

    "abstract": "Mutations are the raw material for evolutionary change. While the mutation rate has been thought constant between individuals, recent research has shown that poor genetic condition can elevate the mutation rate. Mitonuclear genetic conflict is a potential source of poor genetic condition, and considering the high mutation rate of mitochondrial genomes, there should be ample scope for mitochondrial mutations to interfere with genetic condition, with concomitant effects on the nuclear mutation rate. Moreover, because theory suggests mitochondrial genetic effects will often be male-biased, such effects could be more strongly felt in males than females. Here, by mating irradiated male Drosophila melanogaster to isogenic females bearing six distinct mitochondrial haplotypes, we tested whether mitochondrial genetic variation affects DNA repair capacity, and whether effects of mutation load on reproductive function are shaped by interactions between sex and mitochondrial haplotype. We found mitochondrial genetic effects on DNA repair, and that the mutational variance of reproductive fitness was higher in males bearing haplotypes characterized by high female fitness. These results suggest that mitochondrial genome variation may affect the mutation rate, and that induced mutations interact more strongly with male than female reproductive function. The potential for haplotype-specific effects on the nuclear mutation rate has broad implications for evolutionary dynamics, such as the accumulation of genetic load, adaptive potential, and the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",

In some cases, specific chemotherapies and targeted drug treatments are effective against tumors that harbor certain genomic aberrations. However, predictive aberrations (biomarkers) have not been identified for many tumors. One way to address this problem is to examine the downstream, transcriptional effects of genomic aberrations and to identify characteristic patterns. Even though two tumors harbor different genomic aberrations, the transcriptional effects of those aberrations may be similar. These patterns could be used to inform treatment choices.\\n\\nResultsWe hypothesized that by grouping genomic aberrations according to their downstream transcriptional effects, we could identify drug-repurposing candidates that coincide with prior knowledge. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a computational pipeline that uses supervised machine learning to identify similarities among mutually exclusive genomic aberrations based on their transcriptional effects. We used data from 9300 tumors across 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate our approach. Our pipeline recapitulates known relationships in cancer pathways, and it identifies gene pairs known to predict responses to the same treatments.\\n\\nConclusionWe show that transcriptional data offer promise as a way to group genomic aberrations according to their downstream effects, and these groupings recapitulate known relationships.

    "abstract": "Recombination is one of the most important mechanisms of prokaryotic species evolution but its exact roles are still in debate. Here we try to infer genome-wide recombination events within a species uti-lizing a dataset of 104 complete genomes of Escherichia coli from diverse origins, among which 45 from world-wide animal-hosts are in-house sequenced using SMRT (single-molecular real time) technology.Two major clades are identified based on evidences of ecological and physiological characteristics, as well as distinct genomic features implying scarce inter-clade genetic exchange. By comparing the synteny of identical fragments genome-widely searched for each genome pair, we achieve a fine-scale map of re-combination within the population. The recombination is rather extensive within clade, which is able to break linkages between genes but does not interrupt core genome framework and primary metabolic port-folios possibly due to natural selection for physiological compatibility and ecological fitness. Meanwhile,the recombination between clades declines drastically as the phylogenetic distance increases, generally 10-fold reduced than those of the intra-clade, which establishes genetic barrier between clades. These empirical data of recombination suggest its critical role in the early stage of speciation, where recombina-tion rate differs according to phylogentic distance. The extensive intra-clade recombination coheres sister strains into a quasi-sexual group and optimizes genes or alleles to streamline physiological activities,whereas shapely declined inter-clade recombination split the population into clades adaptive to divergent ecological niches.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRoles of recombination in species evolution have been debated for decades due to difficulties in inferring recombination events during the early stage of speciation, especially when recombination is always complicated by frequent gene transfer events of bacterial genomes. Based on 104 high-quality complete E. coli genomes, we infer gene-centric dynamics of recombination in the formation of two E. coli clades or subpopulations, and recombination is found to be rather intensive in a within-clade fashion, which forces them to be quasi-sexual. The recombination events can be mapped among individual genomes in the context of genes and their variations; decreased between-clade and increased intra-claderecombination engender a genetic barrier that further encourages clade-specific secondary metabolic portfolios for better environmental adaptation. Recombination is thus a major force that accelerates bacterial evolution to fit ecological diversity.",

    "abstract": "The vector for the transmission of malaria is a mosquito and like all diseases which are transmitted through mosquitoes are affected by climatic conditions. In the present study, such type of investigation was done to find the influence of different climatic changes such as temperature and humidity on the incidence of malarial cases in Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan from 2000 to 2016. The data relating to malarial cases and climate conditions were collected from District Health Officer (Saidu Sharif) and Meteorological Center respectively. Statistical analysis of the data was done by using MS Office software, i.e., MS Excel. It was found that with the increase in temperature and humidity, an increase in the incidence of Malaria occurred and vice versa. The effect of global warming and the increasing temperature could become an alarming factor in deciding the fate of malarial epidemics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDetailed modelling of the neutral mutational process in cancer cells is crucial for identifying driver mutations and understanding the mutational mechanisms that act during cancer development. The neutral mutational process is very complex: whole-genome analyses have revealed that the mutation rate differs between cancer types, between patients and along the genome depending on the genetic and epigenetic context. Therefore, methods that predict the number of different types of mutations in regions or specific genomic elements must consider local genomic explanatory variables. A major drawback of most methods is the need to average the explanatory variables across the entire region or genomic element. This procedure is particularly problematic if the explanatory variable varies dramatically in the element under consideration.\\n\\nResultsTo take into account the fine scale of the explanatory variables, we model the probabilities of different types of mutations for each position in the genome by multinomial logistic regression. We analyse 505 cancer genomes from 14 different cancer types and compare the performance in predicting mutation rate for both regional based models and site-specific models. We show that for 1000 randomly selected genomic positions, the site-specific model predicts the mutation rate much better than regional based models. We use a forward selection procedure to identify the most important explanatory variables. The procedure identifies site-specific conservation (phyloP), replication timing, and expression level as the best predictors for the mutation rate. Finally, our model confirms and quantifies certain well-known mutational signatures.\\n\\nConclusionWe find that our site-specific multinomial regression model outperforms the regional based models. The possibility of including genomic variables on different scales and patient specific variables makes it a versatile framework for studying different mutational mechanisms. Our model can serve as the neutral null model for the mutational process; regions that deviate from the null model are candidates for elements that drive cancer development.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq has become the most prevalent technology for measuring genome-wide gene expression, but the best practices for processing and analysing RNA-seq data are still an open question. Many statistical methods have been developed to identify genes differentially expressed between sample groups from RNA-seq data. These methods differ by their data distribution assumptions, choice of statistical test, and computational resource requirements. Over 25 methods of differential expression detection were validated and made available through a user-friendly web portal, RNA-seq 2G. All methods are suitable for analysing differential gene expression between two groups of samples. They commonly use a read count matrix derived from RNA-seq data as input and statistically compare groups for each gene. The web portal uses a Shiny app front-end and is hosted by a cloud-based server provided by Amazon Web Service. The comparison of methods showed that the data distribution assumption is the major determinant of differences between methods. Most methods are more likely to find that longer genes are differentially expressed, which substantially impacts downstream gene set-level analysis. Combining results from multiple methods can potentially diminish this bias.

    "abstract": "Each individual cell produces its own set of transcripts, which is the combined result of genetic variation, transcription regulation and post-transcriptional processing. Due to this combinatorial nature, obtaining the exhaustive set of full-length transcripts for a given species is a never-ending endeavor. Yet, each RNA deep sequencing experiment produces a variety of transcripts that depart from the reference transcriptome and should be properly identified. To address this challenge, we introduce a k-mer-based software protocol for capturing local RNA variation from a set of standard RNA-seq libraries, independently of a reference genome or transcriptome. Our software, called DE-kupl, analyzes k-mer contents and detects k-mers with differential abundance directly from the raw data files, prior to assembly or mapping. This enables to retrieve the virtually complete set of unannotated variation lying in an RNA-seq dataset. This variation is subsequently assigned to biological events such as differential lincRNAs, antisense RNAs, splice and polyadenylation variants, introns, expressed repeats, and SNV-harboring or exogenous RNA. We applied DE-kupl to public RNA-seq datasets, including an Epythelial-Mensenchymal Transition model and different human tissues. DE-kupl identified abundant novel events and showed excellent reproducibility when applied to independent deep sequencing experiments. DE-kupl is a new paradigm for analyzing differential RNA-seq data with no preconception on target events, which can also provide fresh insights into existing RNA-seq repositories.",

FUS is composed of N-terminal low-sequence complexity (LC); RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and C-terminal LC domains. FUS belongs to an emerging category of proteins which are capable of forming membraneless organelles in cells via phase separation. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells contain a large network of internal membrane systems. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to address whether membraneless organelles can interact with membranes. Here we attempted to explore this by NMR HSQC titrations of three FUS domains with gradual addition of DMPC/DHPC bicelle, which mimics the bilayer membrane. We found that both N- and C-terminal LC domains showed no significant interaction with bicelle, but its well-folded RRM domain does dynamically interact with bicelle with an interface opposite to that for binding nucleic acids including RNA and ssDNA. If this in vitro observation also occurs in cells, to interact with membrane might represent a mechanism for dynamically organizing membraneless organelles to membranes to facilitate their physiological functions.",

    "abstract": "In response to DNA damage during S phase, cells slow DNA replication. This slowing is orchestrated by the intra-S checkpoint and involves inhibition of origin firing and reduction of replication fork speed. Slowing of replication allows for tolerance of DNA damage and suppresses genomic instability. Although the mechanisms of origin inhibition by the intra-S checkpoint are understood, major questions remain about how the checkpoint regulates replication forks: Does the checkpoint regulate the rate of fork progression? Does the checkpoint affect all forks, or only those encountering damage? Does the checkpoint facilitate the replication of polymerase-blocking lesions? To address these questions, we have analyzed the checkpoint in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe using a single-molecule DNA combing assay, which allows us to unambiguously separate the contribution of origin and fork regulation towards replication slowing, and allows us to investigate the behavior of individual forks. Moreover, we have interrogated the role of forks interacting with individual sites of damage by using three damaging agents--MMS, 4NQO and bleomycin--that cause similar levels of replication slowing with very different frequency of DNA lesions. We find that the checkpoint slows replication by inhibiting origin firing, but not by decreasing fork rates. However, the checkpoint appears to facilitate replication of damaged templates, allowing forks to more quickly pass lesions. Finally, using a novel analytic approach, we rigorously identify fork stalling events in our combing data and show that they play a previously unappreciated role in shaping replication kinetics in response to DNA damage.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFaithful duplication of the genome is essential for genetic stability of organisms and species. To ensure faithful duplication, cells must be able to replicate damaged DNA. To do so, they employ checkpoints that regulate replication in response to DNA damage. However, the mechanisms by which checkpoints regulate DNA replication forks, the macromolecular machines that contain the helicases and polymerases required to unwind and copy the parental DNA, is unknown. We have used DNA combing, a single-molecule technique that allows us to monitor the progression of individual replication forks, to characterize the response of fission yeast replication forks to DNA damage that blocks the replicative polymerases. We find that forks pass most lesions with only a brief pause and that this lesion bypass is checkpoint independent. However, at a low frequency, forks stall at lesions, and that the checkpoint is required to prevent these stalls from accumulating single-stranded DNA. Our results suggest that the major role of the checkpoint is not to regulate the interaction of replication forks with DNA damage, per se, but to mitigate the consequences of fork stalling when forks are unable to successfully navigate DNA damage on their own.",

    "abstract": "The unique architecture of the human connectome is defined initially by genetics and subsequently sculpted over time with experience. Thus, similarities in predisposition and experience that lead to similarities in social, biological, and cognitive attributes should also be reflected in the local architecture of white matter fascicles. Here we employ a method known as local connectome fingerprinting that uses diffusion MRI to measure the fiber-wise characteristics of macroscopic white matter pathways throughout the brain. This fingerprinting approach was applied to a large sample (N=841) of subjects from the Human Connectome Project, revealing a reliable degree of between-subject correlation in the local connectome fingerprints, with a relatively complex, low-dimensional substructure. Using a cross-validated, high-dimensional regression analysis approach, we derived local connectome phenotype (LCP) maps that could reliably predict a subset of subject attributes measured, including demographic, health and cognitive measures. These LCP maps were highly specific to the attribute being predicted but also sensitive to correlations between attributes. Collectively, these results indicate that the local architecture of white matter fascicles reflects a meaningful portion of the variability shared between subjects along several dimensions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe local connectome is the pattern of fiber systems (i.e., number of fibers, orientation, and size) within a voxel and reflects the proximal characteristics of white matter fascicles distributed throughout the brain. Here we show how variability in the local connectome is correlated in a principled way across individuals. This inter-subject correlation is reliable enough that unique phenotype maps can be learned to predict between-subject variability in a range of social, health, and cognitive attributes. This work shows, for the first time, how shared variability across individuals is reflected in the local connectome.",

However, what we remember exactly about a face, namely, the pictorial content of visual memory, remains largely unclear. The current work aims to elucidate this issue by reconstructing face images from both perceptual and memory-based behavioural data. Specifically, our work builds upon and further validates the hypothesis that visual memory and perception share a common representational basis underlying facial identity recognition. To this end, we derived facial features directly from perceptual data and then used such features for image reconstruction separately from perception and memory data. Successful levels of reconstruction were achieved in both cases for newly-learned faces as well as for familiar faces retrieved from long-term memory. Theoretically, this work provides insights into the content of memory-based representations while, practically, it opens the path to novel applications, such as computer-based  sketch artists.",

    "abstract": "Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is commonly used to study the brains intrinsic neural coupling, which reveals specific spatiotemporal patterns in the form of resting state networks (RSN). It has been hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (<0.1 Hz) are driven by underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much faster timescales (>5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices.\\n\\nThe two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individuals alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either alpha oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS).\\n\\nPower-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared to phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brains intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementResting state fMRI has become an important tool to estimate brain connectivity. However, relatively little is known about how slow hemodynamic oscillations measured with fMRI relate to electrophysiological processes.\\n\\nIt was suggested that slowly fluctuating power envelopes of electrophysiological signals synchronize across brain areas and that the topography of this activity is spatially correlated to resting state networks derived from rs-fMRI. Here we take a novel approach to address this problem and establish a causal link between the power fluctuations of electrophysiological signals and rs-fMRI via a new neuromodulation paradigm, which exploits these power-synchronization mechanisms.\\n\\nThese novel mechanistic insights bridge different scientific domains and are of broad interest to researchers in the fields of Medical Imaging, Neuroscience, Physiology and Psychology.",

There are brief bursts of gamma ([~]55-120 Hz) and beta ([~]20-35 Hz) oscillations, the former linked to stimulus information in spiking. We examine these dynamics in relation to read-out from WM, which is still not well understood. Monkeys held a sequence of two objects and had to decide if they matched a subsequent sequence. Changes in the balance of beta/gamma suggested their role in WM control. In anticipation of having to use an object for the match decision, there was an increase in spiking information about that object along with an increase in gamma and a decrease in beta. When an object was no longer needed, beta increased and gamma as well as spiking information about that object decreased. Deviations from these dynamics predicted behavioral errors.

    "abstract": "An intergenic region of human Chromosome 2 (2p25.3) harbours genetic variants which are among those most strongly and reproducibly associated with obesity. The molecular mechanisms mediating these effects remain entirely unknown. The gene closest to these variants is TMEM18, encoding a transmembrane protein localised to the nuclear membrane. The expression of Tmem18 within the murine hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus was altered by changes in nutritional state, with no significant change seen in three other closest genes. Germline loss of Tmem18 in mice resulted in increased body weight, which was exacerbated by high fat diet and driven by increased food intake. Selective overexpression of Tmem18 in the PVN of wild-type mice reduced food intake and also increased energy expenditure. We confirmed the nuclear membrane localisation of TMEM18 but provide new evidence that it is has four, not three, transmembrane domains and that it physically interacts with key components of the nuclear pore complex. Our data support the hypothesis that TMEM18 itself, acting within the central nervous system, is a plausible mediator of the impact of adjacent genetic variation on human adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Herbicide resistance is a major trait of genetically modified (GM) crops. Currently, resistance to phosphinothricin (also known as glufosinate) is the second most widespread genetically engineered herbicide-resistance trait in crops after glyphosate resistance1,2. Resistance to phosphinothricin in plants is achieved by transgenic expression of the bialaphos resistance (BAR) or phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) genes, which were initially isolated from the natural herbicide bialaphos-producing soil bacteria Streptomyces hygroscopicus and S. viridochromogenes, respectively3,4. Mechanistically, BAR and PAT encode phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, which transfers an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to the -NH2 group of phosphinothricin, resulting in herbicide inactivation1. Although early in vitro enzyme assays showed that recombinant BAR and PAT exhibit substrate preference toward phosphinothricin over the 20 proteinogenic amino acids1, whether transgenic expression of BAR and PAT affects plant endogenous metabolism in vivo was not known. Combining metabolomics, plant genetics, and biochemical approaches, we show that transgenic BAR indeed converts two plant endogenous amino acids, aminoadipate and tryptophan, to their respective N-acetylated products in several plant species examined. We report the crystal structures of BAR, and further delineate structural basis for its substrate selectivity and catalytic mechanism. Through structure-guided protein engineering, we generated several BAR variants that display significantly reduced nonspecific activities compared to its wild-type counterpart. Our results demonstrate that transgenic expression of enzymes as a common strategy in modern biotechnology may render unintended metabolic consequences arisen from enzyme promiscuity. Understanding of such phenomena at the mechanistic level will facilitate better design of maximally insulated systems featuring heterologously expressed enzymes.",

The Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, exists as surface populations that inhabit rivers, and multiple independently derived cave populations with convergent evolution on sleep loss. The number of Hypocretin/Orexin (HCRT)-positive hypothalamic neurons is increased significantly in cavefish, and HCRT is upregulated at both the transcript and protein levels. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of HCRT signaling increases sleep duration in cavefish without affecting sleep in surface fish, suggesting enhanced HCRT signaling underlies sleep loss in cavefish. Ablation of the lateral line or starvation, manipulations that selectively promote sleep in cavefish, inhibit hcrt expression in cavefish while having little effect in surface fish. These findings provide the first evidence of genetic and neuronal changes that contribute to the evolution of sleep loss, and support a conserved role for HCRT in sleep regulation.",

It can be undermined by two very different factors, namely inflated false positive rates or inflated false negative rates. Here we investigate the role of the second factor, i.e. the degree to which true effects are not detected reliably. The availability of large public databases and also supercomputing allows us to tackle this problem quantitatively. Specifically, we estimated the reproducibility in task-based fMRI data over different samples randomly drawn from a large cohort of subjects obtained from the Human Connectome Project. We use the full cohort as a standard of reference to approximate true positive effects, and compute the fraction of those effects that was detected reliably using standard software packages at various smaller sample sizes. We found that with standard sample sizes this fraction was less than 25 percent. We conclude that inflated false negative rates are a major factor that undermine reproducibility. We introduce a new statistical inference algorithm based on a novel test statistic and show that it improves reproducibility without inflating false positive rates.",

    "abstract": "Intercellular communication coordinates hypophysis establishment in the Arabidopsis embryo. Previously, TARGET OF MONOPTEROS 7 (TMO7) was reported to be transported to the hypophysis, the founder cell of the root cap, and RNA suppression experiment implicated its function in embryonic root development. However, it remained unclear what protein properties and mechanisms mediate TMO7 protein transport, and what role the movement plays in development. Here, we report that in the post-embryonic root, TMO7 and its close relatives are transported into the root cap through plasmodesmata in a sequence, but not size dependent manner. We also show that nuclear residence is critical for TMO7 transport, and postulate that modification, potentially phosphorylation, labels TMO7 for transport. Additionally, three novel CRISPR/Cas9-induced tmo7 alleles confirmed a role in hypophysis division, but suggest complex redundancies with close relatives in root formation. Finally, we demonstrate that TMO7 transport is biologically meaningful, as local expression partially restores hypophysis division in a plasmodesmatal protein transport mutant. Our study identifies motifs and amino acids critical for TMO7 protein transport and establishes the importance of TMO7 in hypophysis and root development.\\n\\nSummary StatementUnique protein motifs, subcellular localization and post-translational modification, rather than protein size regulate plasmodesmatal transport of TMO7 family proteins during Arabidopsis root development.",

We develop a hybrid model strategy in which cells are represented by coarse-grained individual units calibrated with a high resolution cell model and parameterized measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters. Cell cycle progression in our model is controlled by volumetric strain, the latter being derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After parameter calibration from experiments with mouse colon carcinoma cells growing against the resistance of an elastic alginate capsule, the model adequately predicts the growth curve in i) soft and rigid capsules, ii) in different experimental conditions where the mechanical stress is generated by osmosis via a high molecular weight dextran solution, and iii) for other cell types with varying doubling times. Our model simulation results suggest that the growth response of cell population upon externally applied mechanical stress is the same, as it can be quantitatively predicted using the same growth progression function.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe effect of mechanical resistance on the growth of tumor cells remains today largely unquantified. We studied data from two different experimental setups that monitor the growth of tumor cells under mechanical compression. The existing data in the first experiment examined growing CT26 cells in an elastic permeable capsule. In the second experiment, growth of tumor cells under osmotic stress of the same cell line as well as other cell lines were studied. We have developed and agent-based model with measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters that can simulate both experiments. Cell cycle progression in our model is a Hill function of cell volumetric strain, derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After calibration of the model parameters within the data of the first experiment, we are able predict the growth rates in the second experiment. We show that that the growth response of cell populations upon externally applied mechanical stress in the two different experiments and over different cell lines can be predicted using the same growth progression function once the growth kinetics of the cell lines in abscence of mechanical stress is known.",

    "abstract": "Knowing where north is provides a navigator with invaluable information for learning and recalling a space, particularly in places with limited navigational cues, like complex indoor environments. Although north is effectively used by orienteers, pilots, and military personnel, very little is known about whether non-expert populations can or will use north to create an accurate representation of an indoor space. In the current study, we taught people two non-overlapping routes through a complex indoor environment, with which they were not familiar - a university hospital with few windows and several turns. Along one route, they wore a vibrotactile compass on their arm, which vibrated continuously indicating the direction of north. Along the other route, they were only told where north was at the start of the route. At the beginning, the end, and back at the beginning of each route, participants pointed to well-known landmarks in the surrounding city and campus (external landmarks), and newly-learned landmarks in the hospital (internal landmarks). We found improved performance with the compass only for external landmarks, driven by peoples use of the availability of north to orient these judgments. No such improved orientation occurred for the internal landmarks. These findings reveal the utility of vibrotactile compasses for learning new indoor spaces. We speculate that such cues help users map new spaces onto familiar spaces or to familiar reference frames.Keywords: Spatial navigation; vibrotactile compass; reference frames; spatial memory; pointing; real world navigation.\\n\\nGetting lost in complex indoor spaces, like hospitals, airports, or subways, can be dangerous, distressing, and costly. Unlike outdoor spaces, which typically offer long sightlines and distal landmarks, indoor spaces are often confined, undifferentiated, and labyrinthine. Individual building layouts can be hard to learn if knowledge about direction with respect to the larger world is not easily attained. Confusing layouts, signs, and an inability to see outdoor landmarks compound these problems. Even in places with adequate signs or sight of outdoor landmarks, successful navigation by blind people and people with visual impairments is a substantial problem (Schinazi, 2008; Schinazi, Thrash, & Chebat, 2016). In the current study, we investigate whether providing non-visual directional information aids sighted people in learning an unfamiliar, complex indoor space. Specifically, we tested how people use a commercially-available vibrotactile compass, which vibrates in the direction of north. Unlike visual compasses, people with visual impairments can use vibrotactile compasses. A non-visual aid might also limit divided attention, which complicates the use of visual aids (Gardony, Brunye, & Taylor, 2015).\\n\\nWe tested two competing hypotheses in the current study. These hypotheses stem from a multifarious theoretical framework of navigational ability (Wolbers & Hegarty, 2010). 1. General: People would have access to more spatial information, and thus improve generally. In this case, providing a specific spatial cue decreases the error in the sensory signals, increasing the fidelity of the resulting spatial representations. We would expect improved performance across all aspects of navigation behavior. 2. Specific: People would have access to a specific spatial cue, and thus improve on tasks for which that cue is immediately helpful. In this case, providing a specific spatial cue only improves access to specific information, but in a way that does not create a more accurate general spatial representation. We would expect improved performance only on aspects of navigation behavior that knowledge of the cue is directly relevant. Addressing these questions offers insights into how spatial information is acquired in general, and provides insight into how vibrotactile compasses might aid blind or visually impaired navigators.\\n\\nWhy might people get lost in complex indoor spaces? One reason is that place-based strategies used by humans to navigate are thwarted by indoor spaces. Research on humans and rats reveals two neural systems, which undergird two navigational strategies (Hartley, Maguire,Spiers, & Burgess, 2003; Marchette, Bakker, & Shelton, 2011; McDonald & White, 1994;Morris, Garrud, Rawlins, & OKeefe, 1982; Munn, 1950; Packard & McGaugh, 1996; Restle, 1957; Tolman, Ritchie, & Kalish, 1946). First, a place-based strategy, implemented by the hippocampus, represents space as a cognitive map. A cognitive map is a flexible spatial representation, which affords the opportunity to infer novel shortcuts. Second, a response strategy, implemented by the caudate nucleus, applies a stimulus-response approach to navigation whereby choice points are identified, and responses are recalled (e.g., turn left at the bank, then right at the big tree). The response strategy is relatively inflexible, and generates associations between scenes and actions. In indoor environments, cues that support a place strategy, like distal landmarks and visual discriminability (Restle, 1957) are absent. Instead, place strategies rely on a process of path integration - tracking ones movement away from a starting location by attending to translations and rotations. Unfortunately, unlike rodents, people are poor path integrators (Foo, Duchon, Warren, & Tarr, 2007; Loomis et al., 1993). Thus, in indoor spaces, if people are more likely to adhere to response-based strategies, they are likely to gain less spatial knowledge about the overall environment.\\n\\nA second reason people easily get lost in complex indoor spaces arises from research on reference frames. A large body of evidence (Diwadkar & McNamara, 1997; McNamara, Rump, & Werner, 2003; Meilinger, Riecke, & Bulthoff, 2014; Meilinger, Frankenstein, Watanabe, Bulthoff, & Holscher, 2015; Mou & McNamara, 2002; Mou, McNamara, & Zhang, 2013; Mou & Wang, 2015; Roskos-Ewoldsen, McNamara, Shelton, & Carr, 1998; Shelton & McNamara,2004) supports the idea that spatial knowledge is stored in a preferred reference frame. A reference frame is a spatial representation in which objects or other representations of space are contained, or with respect to which they are ordered, oriented, located, or thought to move; a preferred reference frame is an orientation in which a spatial layout is most easily recalled. A reference frame is considered global if it is common across multiple areas of space (e.g., global north). In familiar, large-scale (i.e., city-sized) spaces, reference frames can be aligned with north (Frankenstein, Mohler, Bulthoff, & Meilinger, 2011), or a salient organizing feature (like a street through a campus; Marchette, Yerramsetti, Burns, & Shelton, 2011; Yerramsetti, Marchette, & Shelton, 2013). Indoor environments, however, provide less access to global reference frames. In the absence of global cues (like distal landmarks), people are likely to organize space into several local reference frames, instead of one global reference frame (Meilinger et al., 2014). In the extreme, using local reference frames means each segment of a route is disconnected from the last, and results in a 1-dimensional representation of space (i.e., an ordered sequence of places, with no 2-dimensional spatial relations specified; Ishikawa & Montello, 2006). Being able to integrate across areas of a learned route to take novel shortcuts, for example, requires some spatial knowledge about how to join local reference frames to each other to form a global reference frame - a difficult and demanding cognitive process (Weisberg & Newcombe, 2016; Weisberg, Schinazi, Newcombe, Shipley, & Epstein, 2014).\\n\\nIf people have direct sensory access to a global spatial direction, like a cardinal direction, they might map an unfamiliar indoor space onto the larger external environment, and construct a more accurate spatial representation of this indoor space. In this way, place-based strategies and global reference frames become more useful in an unfamiliar indoor space. Recent work has begun to characterize the use of vibrotactile compasses in particular. Konig and colleagues (Karcher, Fenzlaff, Hartmann, Nagel, & Konig, 2012; Kaspar, Konig, Schwandt, & Konig, 2014; Konig et al., 2016) developed a feelSpace belt, which provides tactile information about magnetic north. Their work illustrates that, with extensive training (seven weeks), the vibrotactile compass can improve basic homing tasks in sighted individuals (Konig et al., 2016).However, it is unknown how such directional information is incorporated into spatial representations, particularly in complex indoor spaces. Moreover, we were interested in whether this directional information could be incorporated and used to learn a new environment with only rudimentary training in the use of the device.",

Published phylogenies represent an enormous resource that not only facilitate the resolution of questions related to comparative biology, but also provide a resource on which to gauge the development of consensus across the tree of life. From the Open Tree of Life, we gathered 290 avian phylogenies representing all major groups that have been published over the last few decades and analyzed how concordance and conflict develop among these trees through time. Nine large scale backbone trees (including a new synthetic tree from this study) were used for the consensus assessment. We found that conflicts were over-represented both along the backbone (higher-level neoavian relationships) and within the oscine Passeriformes. Importantly, although we have made major strides in our knowledge of major clades, recent published comprehensive trees, as well as trees of individual clades, continue to contribute significantly to the resolution of clades in the avian phylogeny. These findings are somewhat unexpected, given that birds constitute a relatively well-studied and small clade of the tree of life (i.e., Aves). Therefore, our analysis highlights that much work is still needed before we can confidently resolve the less well studied areas of the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "A stochastic version of the Barkai-Leibler model of chemotaxis receptors in Escherichia coli is studied here with the goal of elucidating the effects of intrinsic network noise in their conformational dynamics. The model was originally proposed to explain the robust and near-perfect adaptation of E. coli observed across a wide range of spatially uniform attractant/repellent (ligand) concentrations. In the model, a receptor is either active or inactive and can stochastically switch between the two states. The enzyme CheR methylates inactive receptors while CheB demethylates active receptors and the probability for a receptor to be active depends on its level of methylation and ligand occupation. In a simple version of the model with two methylation sites per receptor (M = 2), we show rigorously, under a quasi-steady state approximation, that the mean active fraction of receptors is an ultrasensitive function of [CheR]/[CheB] in the limit of saturating receptor concentration. Hence the model shows zero-order ultrasensitivity (ZOU), similar to the classical two-state model of covalent modification studied by Goldbeter and Koshland (GK). We also find that in the limits of extremely small and extremely large ligand concentrations, the system reduces to two different two-state GK modules. A quantitative measure of the spontaneous fluctuations in activity is provided by the variance [Formula] in the active fraction, which is estimated mathematically under linear noise approximation (LNA). It is found that [Formula] peaks near the ZOU transition. The variance is a non-monotonic, but weak function of ligand concentration and a decreasing function of receptor concentration. Gillespie simulations are also performed in models with M = 2, 3 and 4. For M = 2, simulations show excellent agreement with analytical results obtained under LNA. Numerical results for M = 3 and M = 4 are qualitatively similar to our mathematical results in M = 2; while all the models show ZOU in mean activity, the variance is found to be smaller for larger M. The magnitude of receptor noise deduced from available experimental data is consistent with our predictions. A simple analysis of the downstream signaling pathway shows that this noise is large enough to affect the motility of the organism, and may have a beneficial effect on it. The response of mean receptor activity to small time-dependent changes in the external ligand concentration is computed within linear response theory, and found to have a bilobe form, in agreement with earlier experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "We present a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing strategy to systematically tag endogenous proteins with fluorescent tags in human inducible pluripotent stem cells. To date we have generated multiple human iPSC lines with GFP tags for 10 proteins representing key cellular structures. The tagged proteins include alpha tubulin, beta actin, desmoplakin, fibrillarin, lamin B1, non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB, paxillin, Sec61 beta, tight junction protein ZO1, and Tom20. Our genome editing methodology using Cas9 ribonuclear protein electroporation and fluorescence-based enrichment of edited cells resulted in <0.1-24% HDR across all experiments. Clones were generated from each edited population and screened for precise editing. [~]25% of the clones contained precise mono-allelic edits at the targeted locus. Furthermore, 92% (36/39) of expanded clonal lines satisfied key quality control criteria including genomic stability, appropriate expression and localization of the tagged protein, and pluripotency. Final clonal lines corresponding to each of the 10 cellular structures are now available to the research community. The data described here, including our editing protocol, genetic screening, quality control assays, and imaging observations, can serve as an initial resource for genome editing in cell biology and stem cell research.",

    "abstract": "Noradrenaline (NA) and hypocretins/orexins (HCRT), and their receptors, dynamically modulate the circuits that configure behavioral states, and their associated oscillatory activities. Salient stimuli activate spiking of locus coeruleus noradrenergic (NALC) cells, inducing NA release and brain-wide noradrenergic signalling, thus resetting network activity, and mediating an orienting response. Hypothalamic HCRT neurons provide one of the densest input to NALC cells. To functionally address the HCRT-to-NA connection, we selectively disrupted the Hcrtr1 gene in NA neurons, and analyzed resulting (Hcrtr1Dbh-CKO) mice, and their control littermates electrocortical response in several contexts of enhanced arousal. Under enforced wakefulness (EW), or after cage change (CC), Hcrtr1Dbh-CKO mice exhibited a weakened ability to lower infra-{theta} frequencies (1-7 Hz), and mount a robust, narrow-bandwidth, high-frequency {theta} rhythm (~8.5 Hz). A fast-{gamma} (55-80 Hz) response, whose dynamics closely parallelled {theta}, also diminished, while {beta}/slow-{gamma} activity (15-45 Hz) increased. Furthermore, EW-associated locomotion was lower. Surprisingly, nestbuilding-associated wakefulness, inversely, featured enhanced {theta} and fast-{gamma} activities. Thus HCRT-to-NA signalling may fine-tune arousal, up in alarming conditions, and down during self-motivated, goal-driven behaviors. Lastly, slow-wave-sleep following EW and CC, but not nestbuilding, was severely deficient in slow-{delta} waves (0.75-2.25 Hz), suggesting that HCRT-to-NA signalling regulates the slow-{delta} rebound characterizing sleep after stress-associated arousal.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) influences plant responses to various (a)biotic stresses; however, the underlying mechanism(s) for this crosstalk is largely unknown. Here we report that type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), some of which are negative regulators of ABA signaling, bind SA. SA binding suppressed the ABA-enhanced interaction between these PP2Cs and various ABA receptors belonging to the PYR/PYL/RCAR protein family. Additionally, SA suppressed ABA-enhanced degradation of PP2Cs and ABA-induced stabilization of SnRK2s. Supporting SAs role as a negative regulator of ABA signaling, exogenous SA suppressed ABA-induced gene expression, whereas SA-deficient sid2-1 mutants displayed heightened PP2C degradation and hypersensitivity to ABA-induced suppression of seed germination. Together, these results suggest a new molecular mechanism through which SA antagonizes ABA signaling. A better understanding of the crosstalk between these hormones is important for improving the sustainability of agriculture in the face of climate change.",
