    "abstract": "Tissue classification plays a crucial role in the investigation of normal neural development, brain-behavior relationships, and the disease mechanisms of many psychiatric and neurological illnesses. Ensuring the accuracy of tissue classification is important for quality research and, in particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct various errors inherent to all currently available segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data, an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software package in any data organization structure. Example configurations for three large, open-source datasets are presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics, regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and complexity of study.",

    "abstract": "\\\"Functional Information\\\"--estimated from the mutual information of protein sequence alignments--has been proposed as a reliable way of estimating the number of proteins with a specified function and the consequent difficulty of evolving a new function. The fantastic rarity of functional proteins computed by this approach emboldens some to argue that evolution is impossible. Random searches, it seems, would have no hope of finding new functions. Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that sequence alignments are a poor estimate functional information. The mutual information of sequence alignments fantastically underestimates of the true number of functional proteins, because it also is strongly influenced by a familys history, mutational bias, and selection. Regardless, even if functional information could be reliably calculated, it tells us nothing about the difficulty of evolving new functions, because it does not estimate the distance between a new function and existing functions. The pervasive observation of multifunctional proteins suggests that functions are actually ver close to one another and abundant. Multifunctional proteins would be impossible if the FI argument against evolution were true.",

However, the mechanisms of resistance to DCS are not well understood. Here we investigated the molecular basis of DCS resistance using in vitro isolated resistant mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\\n\\nMethodsM. tuberculosis H37Rv was subjected to mutant selection on 7H11 agar plates containing varying concentrations of DCS. A total of 35 DCS-resistant mutants were isolated and 18 mutants were subjected to whole genome sequencing. The identified mutations associated with DCS resistance were confirmed by PCR-Sanger sequencing.\\n\\nResultsWe identified mutations in 17 genes that are associated with DCS resistance. Except mutations in alr (rv3423c) which is known to be involved in DCS resistance, 16 new genes rv0059, betP (rv0917), rv0221, rv1403c, rv1683, rv1726, gabD2 (rv1731), rv2749, sugI (rv3331), hisC2 (rv3 772), single mutation in 5 intergenic region of rv3345c and rv1435c, and insertion in 3 region of rv0759c were identified as solo mutations in their respective DCS-resistant mutants. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms of DCS resistance are more complex than previously thought and involve genes participating in different cellular functions such as lipid metabolism, methyltransferase, stress response, and transport proteins.\\n\\nConclusionsNew mutations in diverse genes associated with DCS are identified, which shed new light on the mechanisms of action and resistance of DCS. Future studies are needed to verify these findings in clinical strains so that molecular detection of DCS resistance for improved treatment of MDR-TB can be developed.",

Signals within the stem cell niche maintain the undifferentiated state. However it is unclear whether or how niche signals might also coordinate fate decisions within the progenitor pool. Here we use quantitative microscopy to elucidate distinct roles for Wnt, Hedgehog (Hh), and Notch signalling in progenitor development in the Drosophila ovary. Follicle stem cells (FSCs) self-renew and produce precursors whose progeny adopt distinct polar, stalk, and main body cell fates. We show that a steep gradient of Wnt signalling maintains a multipotent state in proximally located progenitor cells by inhibiting expression of the cell fate determinant Eyes Absent (Eya). A shallower gradient of Hh signalling controls the proliferation to differentiation transition. The combination of Notch and Wnt signalling specifies polar cells. These findings reveal a mechanism by which multiple niche signals coordinate cell fate diversification of progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe advent of in vivo automated single-cell lineaging and sequencing will dramatically increase our understanding of development. New integrative analysis techniques are needed to generate insights from single-cell developmental data.\\n\\nResultsWe applied novel meta-analysis techniques to the EPIC single-cell-resolution developmental gene expression dataset for C. elegans to show that a simple linear combination of the expression levels of the developmental genes is strongly correlated with the developmental age of the organism, irrespective of the cell division rate of different cell lineages. We uncovered a pattern of collective sinusoidal oscillation in gene activation, in multiple dominant frequencies and in multiple orthogonal axes of gene expression, pointing to the existence of a coordinated, multi-frequency global timing mechanism. We developed a novel method based on Fishers Discriminant Analysis (FDA) to identify linear gene expression weightings that are able to produce sinusoidal oscillations of any frequency and phase, adding to the evidence that oscillatory mechanisms likely play an important role in the timing of development. We cross-linked EPIC with gene ontology and anatomy ontology terms, employing FDA methods to identify previously unknown positive and negative genetic contributions to developmental processes and cell phenotypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThis meta-analysis demonstrates new evidence for direct linear and/or sinusoidal mechanisms regulating the timing of development. We uncovered a number of previously unknown positive and negative correlations between developmental genes and developmental processes or cell phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Wheat powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminisb f. sp. tritici is one of the most destructive diseases all over the world. Pm21, transferred from the wild Haynaldia villosa to wheat, confers broad spectrum resistance throughout the whole stage, and this gene has been widely used in wheat production for more than 20 years. Cloning the candidate gene of Pm21 is the prerequisite for elucidating the resistance mechanism, and is a valuable attempt to clone the target genes from the evolutionarily distant wild species. In this study, an innovative approach, which combined cytogenetic stocks development, mutagenesis, RenSeq and PacBio, was tried successfully to clone an NBS-LRR type gene NLR1-V from the Pm21 locus. Firstly, a powdery mildew resistant cryptic alien introgression line HP33 involved very small 6VS segment was developed, and 6 independent susceptible mutants of T6VS {middle dot} 6AL was identified. Then, the transcriptome of H. villosa was obtained by NGS and the full-length NBS-LRR gene database was constructed by RenSeq-PacBio. In the following study, two expressed NLR genes were located to the Pm21 locus using the HP33 as the mapping material, and only NLR1-V showed polymorphism between the wild T6VS {middle dot} 6AL and its six mutants. The functional analysis indicated that silencing of NLR1-V could compromise the resistance of T6VS {middle dot} 6AL completely, and could also decrease the resistance of T6VS {middle dot} 6DL dramatically. Moreover, NLR1-V could recover the resistance of the susceptible mutant and increase the resistance in the susceptible wheat. The study implied that NLR1-V, a CC-NBS-LRR encoding gene, is a potential candidate gene of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21.",

It is expected that basic aspects of the language oscillome result from genetic guidance, what we will here call the language  oscillogenome, for which we will put forward a list of candidate genes. We have considered genes for altered brain rhythmicity in conditions involving language deficits (autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, specific language impairment and dyslexia) for which we have confident genome-oscillome-phenome connections. These selected genes map on to aspects of brain function, particularly on to neurotransmitter function. Our aim is to propose a set of biologically robust genome-to-language linking hypotheses that, given testing, would grant causal and explanatory power to brain rhythms with respect to language processing.",

    "abstract": "Mating system transition from outcrossing to selfing frequently gives rise to sister lineages with contrasting outcrossing rates. The evolutionary fate of such lineages depends on the extent to which they exchange genes. We measured gene flow between outcrossing Geum rivale and selfing G. urbanum, two sister species derived by mating system transition, which frequently hybridise. A draft genome was generated for G. urbanum and used to develop dd-RAD data scorable in both species. Coalescent analysis of RAD data from allopatric populations indicated that the two species diverged 2-3 Mya, and that long term gene flow between them has been very low (M=0.04). G. rivale showed greater genetic diversity in sympatry than allopatry, but genetic divergence between species was no lower in sympatry than allopatry, providing little evidence for recent introgression. Clustering of genotypes revealed that, apart from four early generation hybrids, individuals in sympatric populations fell into two genetically distinct groups with <1% admixture that corresponded exactly to their morphological species classification. Although our data suggest limited gene flow, we observed joint segregation of two putatively introgressed SNPs in G. urbanum populations that was associated with significant morphological variation; this provides tentative evidence for rare introduction of novel genetic diversity by interspecific gene flow. Our results indicate that despite frequent hybridisation, genetic exchange between G. rivale and G. urbanum has been very limited throughout their evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "Effective ecosystem conservation and resource management require quantitative monitoring of biodiversity, including accurate descriptions of species composition and temporal variations of species abundance. Therefore, quantitative monitoring of biodiversity has been performed for many ecosystems, but it is often time- and effort-consuming and costly. Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA), which is released to the environment from macro-organisms living in a habitat, contains information about species identity and abundance. Thus, analyzing eDNA would be a promising approach for more efficient biodiversity monitoring. In the present study, we added internal standard DNAs (i.e., known amounts of short DNA fragments from fish species that have never been observed in a sampling area) to eDNA samples, which were collected weekly from a coastal marine ecosystem in Maizuru-Bay, Kyoto, Japan (from April 2015 to March 2016), and performed metabarcoding analysis using Illumina MiSeq to simultaneously identify fish species and quantify fish eDNA copy numbers. A correction equation was obtained for each sample using the relationship between the number of sequence reads and the added amount of the standard DNAs, and this equation was used to estimate the copy numbers from the sequence reads of non-standard fish eDNA. The calculated copy numbers showed significant positive correlation with those determined by quantitative PCR, suggesting that eDNA metabarcoding with standard DNA enabled useful quantification of eDNA. Furthermore, for samples that show a high level of PCR inhibition, our method might allow more accurate quantification than qPCR because the correction equations generated using internal standard DNAs would include the effect of PCR inhibition. A single run of Illumina MiSeq produced > 70 quantitative fish eDNA time series in our study, showing that our method could contribute to more efficient and quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "High-occupancy target (HOT) regions are the segments of the genome with unusually high number of transcription factor binding sites. These regions are observed in multiple species and thought to have biological importance due to high transcription factor occupancy. Furthermore, they coincide with house-keeping gene promoters and the associated genes are stably expressed across multiple cell types. Despite these features, HOT regions are solemnly defined using ChIP-seq experiments and shown to lack canonical motifs for transcription factors that are thought to be bound there. Although, ChIP-seq experiments are the golden standard for finding genome-wide binding sites of a protein, they are not noise free. Here, we show that HOT regions are likely to be ChIP-seq artifacts and they are similar to previously proposed \\\"hyper-ChIPable\\\" regions. Using ChIP-seq data sets for knocked-out transcription factors, we demonstrate presence of false positive signals on HOT regions. We observe sequence characteristics and genomic features that are discriminatory of HOT regions, such as GC/CpG-rich k-mers and enrichment of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA tertiary structures (G-quadruplex DNA). The artificial ChIP-seq enrichment on HOT regions could be associated to these discriminatory features. Furthermore, we propose strategies to deal with such artifacts for the future ChIP-seq studies.",
