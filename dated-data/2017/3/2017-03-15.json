    "abstract": "Europe has played a major role in dog evolution, harbouring the oldest uncontested Paleolithic remains and having been the centre of modern dog breed creation. We sequenced the whole genomes of an Early and End Neolithic dog from Germany, including a sample associated with one of Europes earliest farming communities. Both dogs demonstrate continuity with each other and predominantly share ancestry with modern European dogs, contradicting a previously suggested Late Neolithic population replacement. Furthermore, we find no genetic evidence to support the recent hypothesis proposing dual origins of dog domestication. By calibrating the mutation rate using our oldest dog, we narrow the timing of dog domestication to 20,000-40,000 years ago. Interestingly, we do not observe the extreme copy number expansion of the AMY2B gene that is characteristic of modern dogs and has previously been proposed as an adaptation to a starch-rich diet driven by the widespread adoption of agriculture in the Neolithic.",

    "abstract": "Human behavioral traits are complex phenotypes that result from both genetic and cultural transmission. But different inheritance systems need not favor the same phenotypic outcome. What happens when there are conflicting selection forces in the two domains? To address this question, we derive a Price equation that incorporates both cultural and genetic inheritance of a phenotype where the effects of genes and culture are additive. We then use this equation to investigate whether a genetically maladaptive phenotype can evolve under dual transmission. We examine the special case of altruism using an illustrative model, and show that cultural selection can overcome genetic selection when the variance in culture is sufficiently high with respect to genes. Finally, we show how our basic result can be extended to non-additive effects models. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the evolution of maladaptive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 1% of the global population is affected by intellectual disability (ID), and the majority receive no molecular diagnosis. Previous studies have indicated high levels of genetic heterogeneity, with estimates of more than 2500 autosomal ID genes, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (AR). Here, we combined microarray genotyping, homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) mapping, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, and whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify disease genes/mutations in 192 multiplex Pakistani and Iranian consanguineous families with non-syndromic ID. We identified definite or candidate mutations (or CNVs) in 51% of families in 72 different genes, including 26 not previously reported for ARID. The new ARID genes include nine with loss-of-function mutations (ABI2, MAPK8, MPDZ, PIDD1, SLAIN1, TBC1D23, TRAPPC6B, UBA7, and USP44), and missense mutations include the first reports of variants in BDNF or TET1 associated with ID. The genes identified also showed overlap with de novo gene sets for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcriptional studies showed prominent expression in the prenatal brain. The high yield of AR mutations for ID indicated that this approach has excellent clinical potential and should inform clinical diagnostics, including clinical whole exome and genome sequencing, for populations in which consanguinity is common. As with other AR disorders, the relevance will also apply to outbred populations.",

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity is important to biological processes, including cancer and development. However, proteome heterogeneity is largely unexplored because of the limitations of existing methods for quantifying protein levels in single cells. To alleviate these limitations, we developed Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), and validated its ability to identify distinct human cancer cell types based on their proteomes. We used SCoPE-MS to quantify over a thousand proteins in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled us to deconstruct cell populations and infer protein abundance relationships. Comparison between single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes indicated coordinated mRNA and protein covariation. Yet many genes exhibited functionally concerted and distinct regulatory patterns at the mRNA and the protein levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms contribute to proteome remodeling during lineage specification, especially for developmental genes. SCoPE-MS is broadly applicable to measuring proteome configurations of single cells and linking them to functional phenotypes, such as cell type and differentiation potentials.",

    "abstract": "We investigate and analyse the data quality of nucleotide sequence databases with the objective of automatic detection of data anomalies and suspicious records. Specifically, we demonstrate that the published literature associated with each data record can be used to automatically evaluate its quality, by cross-checking the consistency of the key content of the database record with the referenced publications. Focusing on GenBank, we describe a set of quality indicators based on the relevance paradigm of information retrieval (IR). Then, we use these quality indicators to train an anomaly detection algorithm to classify records as \\\"confident\\\" or \\\"suspicious\\\".\\n\\nOur experiments on the PubMed Central collection show assessing the coherence between the literature and database records, through our algorithms, is an effective mechanism for assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Although fewer than 0.25% of the records in our data set are known to be faulty, we would expect that there are many more in GenBank that have not yet been identified. By automated comparison with literature they can be identified with a precision of up to 10% and a recall of up to 30%, while strongly outperforming several baselines. While these results leave substantial room for improvement, they reflect both the very imbalanced nature of the data, and the limited explicitly labelled data that is available. Overall, the obtained results show promise for the development of a new kind of approach to detecting low-quality and suspicious sequence records based on literature analysis and consistency. From a practical point of view, this will greatly help curators in identifying inconsistent records in large-scale sequence databases by highlighting records that are likely to be inconsistent with the literature.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence supports the \\\"non-monotonic plasticity\\\" hypothesis that although complete retrieval may strengthen memories, partial retrieval weakens them. Yet, the classic experimental paradigms used to study effects of partial retrieval are not ideally suited to doing so, because they lack the parametric control needed to ensure that the memory is activated to the appropriate degree (i.e., that there is some retrieval, but not enough to cause memory strengthening). Here we present a novel procedure designed to accommodate this need. After participants learned a list of word-scene associates, they completed a cued mental visualization task that was combined with a multiple-object tracking (MOT) procedure, which we selected for its ability to interfere with mental visualization in a parametrically adjustable way (by varying the number of MOT targets). We also used fMRI data to successfully train an \\\"associative recall\\\" classifier for use in this task: this classifier revealed greater memory reactivation during trials in which associative memories were cued while participants tracked one, rather than five MOT targets. However, the classifier was insensitive to task difficulty when recall was not taking place, suggesting it had indeed tracked memory reactivation rather than task difficulty per se. Consistent with the classifier findings, participants' introspective ratings of visualization vividness were modulated by task difficulty. In addition, classifier output and slowing of responses in a post-reactivation memory test suggested that partial reactivation, induced by MOT, weakened memory. We argue that this procedure has desirable properties for future investigation of partial retrieval effects, e.g., in closed-loop experiments.",

Preprints have emerged as a tool that a growing number of microbiologists are using to overcome this bottleneck. Posting preprints can help to transparently recruit a more diverse pool of reviewers prior to submitting to a journal for formal peer-review. Although use of preprints is still limited in the biological sciences, early indications are that preprints are a robust tool that can complement and enhance peer-reviewed publications.

    "abstract": "Hummingbirds can support their high metabolic rates exclusively by oxidizing ingested sugars, which is unsurprising given their sugar-rich nectar diet and use of energetically expensive hovering flight. However, they cannot rely on dietary sugars as a fuel during fasting periods, such as during the night, at first light, or when undertaking long-distance migratory flights, and must instead rely exclusively on onboard lipids. This metabolic flexibility is remarkable both in that the birds can switch between exclusive use of each fuel type within minutes and in that de novo lipogenesis from dietary sugar precursors is the principle way in which fat stores are built, sometimes at exceptionally high rates, such as during the few days prior to a migratory flight. The hummingbird hepatopancreas is the principle location of de novo lipogenesis and likely plays a key role in fuel selection, fuel switching, and glucose homeostasis. Yet understanding how this tissue, and the whole organism, achieves and moderates high rates of energy turnover is hampered by a fundamental lack of information regarding how genes coding for relevant enzymes differ in their sequence, expression, and regulation in these unique animals. To address this knowledge gap, we generated a de novo transcriptome of the hummingbird liver using PacBio full-length cDNA sequencing (Iso-Seq), yielding a total of 8.6Gb of sequencing data, or 2.6M reads from 4 different size fractions. We analyzed data using the SMRTAnalysis v3.1 Iso-Seq pipeline, including classification of reads and clustering of isoforms (ICE) followed by error-correction (Arrow). With COGENT, we clustered different isoforms into gene families to generate de novo gene contigs. We performed orthology analysis to identify closely related sequences between our transcriptome and other avian and human gene sets. We also aligned our transcriptome against the Calypte anna genome where possible. Finally, we closely examined homology of critical lipid metabolic genes between our transcriptome data and avian and human genomes. We confirmed high levels of sequence divergence within hummingbird lipogenic enzymes, suggesting a high probability of adaptive divergent function in the hepatic lipogenic pathways. Our results have leveraged cutting-edge technology and a novel bioinformatics pipeline to provide a compelling first direct look at the transcriptome of this incredible organism.",

Patterns of geographic variation in interacting species may play an important role in understanding how variation is maintained in mutualisms, particularly in introduced ranges. One agriculturally and ecologically important mutualism is the partnership between legume plants and rhizobia. Through characterizing and comparing the population genomic structure of the legume Medicago lupulina and two rhizobial species (Ensifer medicae and E. meliloti), we explored the spatial scale of population differentiation between interacting partners in their introduced range in North America. We found high proportions of E. meliloti in southeastern populations and high proportions of E. medicae in northwestern populations. Medicago lupulina and the Ensifer genus showed similar patterns of spatial genetic structure (isolation by distance). However, we detected no evidence of isolation by distance or population structure within either species of bacteria. Genome-wide nucleotide diversity within each of the two Ensifer species was low, suggesting limited introduction of strains, founder events, or severe bottlenecks. Our results suggest that there is potential for geographically structured coevolution between M. lupulina and the Ensifer genus, but not between M. lupulina and either Ensifer species.",

Whether these amino acid changes in Pols IV and V alter their catalytic properties in comparison to Pol II, from which they evolved, is unknown. Here, we show that Pols IV and V differ from one another, and Pol II, in nucleotide incorporation rate, transcriptional accuracy and the ability to discriminate between ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. Pol IV transcription is notably error-prone, which may be tolerable, or even beneficial, for biosynthesis of siRNAs targeting transposon families in trans. By contrast, Pol V exhibits high fidelity transcription, suggesting a need for Pol V transcripts to faithfully reflect the DNA sequence of target loci in order to recruit siRNA-Argonaute protein silencing complexes.",

Despite its wide taxonomic incidence, we know little about the identity, genomic location and evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic genetic variants. To address these deficits, we use sex-specific fitness data from 202 fully sequenced hemiclonal D. melanogaster fly lines to perform a genome-wide association study of sexual antagonism. We identify ~230 chromosomal clusters of candidate antagonistic SNPs. In contradiction to classic theory, we find no clear evidence that the X chromosome is a hotspot for sexually antagonistic variation. Characterising antagonistic SNPs functionally, we find a large excess of missense variants but little enrichment in terms of gene function. We also assess the evolutionary persistence of antagonistic variants by examining extant polymorphism in wild D. melanogaster populations. Remarkably, antagonistic variants are associated with multiple signatures of balancing selection across the D. melanogaster distribution range, indicating widespread and evolutionarily persistent (>10,000 years) genomic constraints. Based on our results, we propose that antagonistic variation accumulates due to constraints on the resolution of sexual conflict over protein coding sequences, thus contributing to the long-term maintenance of heritable fitness variation.",

Furthermore, the nanopore sequencing library constructed with the last releases of pore chemistry (R9.4) and sequencing kit (SQK-LSK108) permitted to retrieve the higher level of 1D read accuracy sufficient to characterize the microbial species present in each mock community analysed.

In Experiment 1, we compare neurophysiological responses to periodic and nonperiodic (i.e., unpredictable) variable face stimuli in a fast (12 Hz) visual stream of nonface objects. In Experiment 2, we assess potential responses to rare (10%) omissions of periodic face events (i.e., violations of periodicity) in the same fast visual stream. Overall, our observations indicate that long duration category(face)-selective processes elicited in a fast periodic stream of visual objects are immune to temporal predictability. These observations do not support a predictive coding framework interpretation of category-change detection in the human brain and have important implications for understanding human perceptual categorization in a rapidly changing (i.e., dynamic) visual scene.",

    "abstract": "Inference of the causal structure that induces correlations between two traits can be achieved by combining genetic associations with a mediation-based approach, as is done in the causal inference test (CIT) and others. However, we show that measurement error in the phenotypes can lead to mediation-based approaches inferring the wrong causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it is less susceptible to bias in the presence of measurement error; second, it is more statistically efficient; third, it can be performed using only summary level data from genome-wide association studies; and fourth, its sensitivity to measurement error can be evaluated. We apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms. We emphasise that, where possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses alongside other approaches such as CIT is important to triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.",

    "abstract": "Nervous systems use excitatory cell assemblies or \\\"perceptual engrams\\\" to encode and represent sensory percepts. Similarly, synaptically connected cell assemblies or \\\"memory engrams\\\" are thought to represent memories of past experience. Multiple lines of recent evidence indicate that brain systems also create inhibitory replicas of excitatory engrams with important cognitive functions. Such matched inhibitory engrams may form through homeostatic potentiation of inhibition onto postsynaptic cells that show increased levels of excitation. Inhibitory engrams can reduce behavioral responses to familiar stimuli thereby resulting in behavioral habituation. In addition, by preventing inappropriate activation of excitatory memory engrams, inhibitory engrams can make memories quiescent, stored in a latent form that is available for contextrelevant activation. In neural networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory engrams, the release of innate responses and recall of associative memories can occur through focussed disinhibition. Understanding mechanisms that regulate the formation and expression of inhibitory engrams in vivo may help not only to explain key features of cognition, but also to provide insight into transdiagnostic traits associated with psychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",

Assuming that large-scale functional plasticity would be discernible in the parasite transcriptome we have performed a dual RNA-seq study of the full lifecycle of Eimeria falciformis using infected mice with different immune status (e.g. naive versus immune animals) as models for coccidian infections.\\n\\nResultsWe compared parasite and host transcriptomes (dual transcriptome) between naive and challenge infected mice, as well as between immune competent and immune deficient ones. Mice with different immune competence show transcriptional differences as well as differences in parasite reproduction (oocyst shedding). Broad gene categories represented by differently abundant host genes indicate enrichments for immune reaction and tissue repair functions. More specifically, TGF-beta, EGF, TNF and IL-1 and IL-6 are examples of functional annotations represented differently depending on host immune status. Much in contrast, parasite transcriptomes were neither different between Coccidia isolated from immune competent and immune deficient mice, nor between those harvested from naive and challenge infected mice. Instead, parasite transcriptomes have distinct profiles early and late in infection, characterized largely by biosynthesis or motility associated functional gene groups, respectively. Extracellular sporozoite and oocyst stages showed distinct transcriptional profiles and sporozoite transcriptomes were found enriched for species specific genes and likely pathogenicity factors.\\n\\nConclusionWe propose that the niche and host-specific parasite E. falciformis uses a genetically canalized program of infection. This program is likely fixed in an evolutionary process rather than employing phenotypic plasticity to interact with its host. In turn this might (negatively) influence the ability of the parasite to use different host species and (positively or negatively) influence its evolutionary potential for adaptation to different hosts or niches.",

    "abstract": "Studies of structural brain connectivity have revealed many intriguing features of complex cortical networks. To advance integrative theories of cortical organization, an understanding is required of how connectivity interrelates with other aspects of brain structure. Recent studies have suggested that interareal connectivity may be related to a variety of macroscopic as well as microscopic architectonic features of cortical areas. However, it is unclear how these features are inter-dependent and which of them most strongly and fundamentally relate to structural corticocortical connectivity. Here, we systematically investigated the relation of a range of microscopic and macroscopic architectonic features of cortical organization, namely layer III pyramidal cell soma size, dendritic synapse count, dendritic synapse density and dendritic tree size as well as area neuron density, to multiple properties of cortical connectivity, using a comprehensive, up-to-date structural connectome of the primate brain. Importantly, relationships were investigated by multi-variate analyses to account for the interrelations of features. Of all considered factors, the classical architectonic parameter of neuron density most strongly and consistently related to essential features of cortical connectivity (existence and laminar patterns of projections, area degree), and in conjoint analyses largely abolished effects of cellular morphological features. These results reveal neuron density as a central architectonic indicator of the primate cerebral cortex that is closely related to essential aspects of brain connectivity and is also highly indicative of further features of the architectonic organization of cortical areas such as the considered cellular morphological measures. Our findings integrate several aspects of cortical micro-and macroscopic organization, with implications for cortical development and function.",

    "abstract": "Social network analysis has provided important insight into many population processes in wild animals. Constructing social networks requires quantifying the relationship between each pair of individuals in the population. Researchers often use association indices to convert observations into a measure of propensity for individuals to be seen together. At its simplest, this measure is just the probability of observing both individuals together given that one has been seen (the simple ratio index). However, this probability becomes more challenging to calculate if the detection rate for individuals is imperfect. We first evaluate the performance of existing association indices at estimating true association rates under scenarios where (i) only a proportion of all groups are observed (group location errors), (ii) not all individuals are observed despite being present (individual location errors), and (iii) a combination of the two. Commonly-used methods aimed at dealing with incomplete observations perform poorly because they are based on arbitrary observation probabilities. We then derive complete indices that can be calibrated for the different types of observation probabilities to generate accurate estimates of association rates. These are provided in an R package that readily interfaces with existing routines. We conclude that using calibration data is an important step when constructing animal social networks, and that in their absence, researchers should use a simple estimator and explicitly consider the impact of this on their findings.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive psychologists have long hypothesized that experiences are encoded in a temporal context that changes gradually over time. When an episodic memory is retrieved, the state of context is recovered--a jump back in time. We recorded from single units in the MTL of epilepsy patients performing an item recognition task. The population vector changed gradually over minutes during presentation of the list. When a probe from the list was remembered with high confidence, the population vector reinstated the temporal context of the original presentation of that probe during study--a neural contiguity effect that provides a possible mechanism for behavioral contiguity effects. This pattern was only observed for well-remembered probes; old probes that were not well-remembered showed an anti-contiguity effect. These results constitute the first direct evidence that recovery of an episodic memory in humans is associated with retrieval of a gradually-changing state of temporal context--a neural \\\"jump-back-in-time\\\" that parallels the act of remembering.\\n\\nSignificance statementEpisodic memory is the ability to re-live a specific experience from ones life. For decades, researchers have hypothesized that, unlike other forms of memory that can be described as simple associations between stimuli, episodic memory depends on the recovery of a neural representation of spatiotemporal context. During study of a sequence of stimuli, the brain state of epilepsy patients changed slowly over at least a minute. When the participant remembered a particular event from the list, this gradually-changing state was recovered. This provides direct confirmation of the prediction from computational models of episodic memory. The resolution of this point means that the study of episodic memory can focus on the mechanisms by which this representation of spatiotemporal context is maintained and, sometimes recovered.",

    "abstract": "Development of stable male sterility lines is essential for efficient hybrid seed production. We previously showed that knockout of bHLH142 in rice (Oryza sativa) causes pollen sterility by interrupting tapetal programmed cell death (PCD). In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of bHLH142 (OE142) under the control of ubiquitin promoter also leads to male sterility in rice by triggering the premature onset of PCD. Protein of bHLH142 was found to accumulate specifically in the OE142 anthers. Overexpression of bHLH142 induced early expression of several key regulatory transcription factors in pollen development. In particular, the upregulation of EAT1 at the early stage of pollen development promoted premature PCD in the OE142 anthers, while its downregulation at the late stage impaired pollen development by suppressing genes involved in pollen wall biosynthesis, ROS scavenging and PCD. Collectively, these events led to male sterility in OE142. Analyses of related mutants further revealed the hierarchy of these pollen development regulatory genes. Thus, the findings of this study create a new method to generate genic male sterility in rice. Exploitation of this novel functionality of bHLH142 would confer a big advantage to hybrid seed production.\\n\\nHighlightOverexpression of bHLH142 leads to male sterility in transgenic rice due to early onset of tapetal PCD.

As exploring gene expression and function approaches constitute an initial point for investigating pathogen-host interaction, we performed a transcriptional analysis to unravel regulated genes in tomato infected by FOL. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) upon inoculation with FOL were presented at twenty-four hours post-inoculation including four treatments: Moneymaker_H2O, Moneymaker_FOL, Motelle_H2O and Motelle_FOL. A total of more than 182.6 million high quality clean reads from the four libraries were obtained. A large overlap was found in DEGs between susceptible tomato cultivar Moneymaker and resistant tomato cultivar Motelle. All Gene Ontology terms were mainly classified into catalytic activity, metabolic process and binding. However, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis evidenced specific categories in infected Motelle. Statistics of pathway enrichment of DEGs resulted that the taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, the stibenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, the starch and sucrose metabolism were the top three pathway affected in both groups. Interestingly, plant-pathogen pathway was greatly regulated in Motelle treated with FOL. Combining with qRT-PCR facilitated the identification of regulated pathogenicity associated genes upon infected resistant or susceptible tomato. Our data showed that a coordinated machinery played a critical role in prompting the response, which could help in generating models of mediated resistance responses with assessment of genomic gene expression patterns.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic nematodes impose a debilitating health and economic burden across much of the world. Nematode resistance to anthelmintic drugs threatens parasite control efforts in both human and veterinary medicine. Despite this threat, the genetic landscape of potential resistance mechanisms to these critical drugs remains largely unexplored. Here, we exploit natural variation in the model nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae to discover quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control sensitivity to benzimidazoles widely used in human and animal medicine. High-throughput phenotyping of albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole, and thiabendazole responses in panels of recombinant lines led to the discovery of over 15 QTL in C. elegans and four QTL in C. briggsae associated with divergent responses to these anthelmintics. Many of these QTL are conserved across benzimidazole derivatives, but others show drug and dose specificity. We used near-isogenic lines to recapitulate and narrow the C. elegans albendazole QTL of largest effect and identified candidate variants correlated with the resistance phenotype. These QTL do not overlap with known benzimidazole resistance genes from parasitic nematodes and present specific new leads for the discovery of novel mechanisms of nematode benzimidazole resistance. Analyses of orthologous genes reveal significant conservation of candidate benzimidazole resistance genes in medically important parasitic nematodes. These data provide a basis for extending these approaches to other anthelmintic drug classes and a pathway towards validating new markers for anthelmintic resistance that can be deployed to improve parasite disease control.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe treatment of roundworm (nematode) infections in both humans and animals relies on a small number of anti-parasitic drugs. Resistance to these drugs has appeared in veterinary parasite populations and is a growing concern in human medicine. A better understanding of the genetic basis for parasite drug resistance can be used to help maintain the effectiveness of anti-parasitic drugs and to slow or to prevent the spread of drug resistance in parasite populations. This goal is hampered by the experimental intractability of nematode parasites. Here, we use non-parasitic model nematodes to systematically explore responses to the critical benzimidazole class of anti-parasitic compounds. Using a quantitative genetics approach, we discovered unique genomic intervals that control drug effects, and we identified differences in the genetic architectures of drug responses across compounds and doses. We were able to narrow a major-effect genomic region associated with albendazole resistance and to establish that candidate genes discovered in our genetic mappings are largely conserved in important human and animal parasites. This work provides new leads for understanding parasite drug resistance and contributes a powerful template that can be extended to other anti-parasitic drug classes.",

In order to address some of these challenges, developers have leveraged virtualization containers, towards seamless deployment of preconfigured bioinformatics software and pipelines on any computational platform.\\n\\nFindingsWe present an approach for abstracting the complex data operations of multi-step, bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis. As examples, we have deployed two pipelines for RNAseq and CHIPseq, pre-configured within Docker virtualization containers we call Bio-Docklets.

    "abstract": "FimV is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa inner membrane hub protein that modulates levels of the second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP), through activation of the adenylate cyclase, CyaB. Although type IVa pilus (T4aP)-dependent twitching motility is modulated by cAMP levels, mutants lacking FimV are twitching impaired, even when exogenous cAMP is provided. Here we further define FimVs cAMP-dependent and -independent regulation of twitching. We confirmed that the response regulator of the T4aP-associated Chp chemotaxis system, PilG, required both FimV and the CyaB regulator, FimL, to activate CyaB. However, in cAMP-replete backgrounds - lacking the cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA or the CheY-like protein PilH, or expressing constitutively-active CyaB - pilG and fimV mutants failed to twitch. Both cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains of FimV were important for its cAMP-dependent and -independent roles, while its septal peptidoglycan-targeting LysM motif was required only for twitching motility. Polar localization of the sensor kinase PilS, a key regulator of transcription of the major pilin, was FimV-dependent. However, unlike its homologues in other species that localize flagellar system components, FimV was not required for swimming motility. These data provide further evidence to support FimVs role as a key hub protein that coordinates the polar localization and function of multiple structural and regulatory proteins involved in P. aeruginosa twitching motility.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a serious opportunistic pathogen. Type IVa pili (T4aP) are important for its virulence, because they mediate dissemination and invasion via twitching motility, and are involved in surface sensing which modulates pathogenicity via changes in cAMP levels. Here we show that the hub protein FimV and the response regulator of the Chp system, PilG, regulate twitching independently of their roles in modulation of cAMP synthesis. These functions do not require the putative scaffold protein FimL, proposed to link PilG with FimV. PilG may regulate asymmetric functioning of the T4aP system to allow for directional movement, while FimV appears to localize both structural and regulatory elements - including the PilSR two-component system - to cell poles for optimal function.",

    "abstract": "FimV is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa inner membrane hub protein that modulates levels of the second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP), through activation of the adenylate cyclase, CyaB. Although type IVa pilus (T4aP)-dependent twitching motility is modulated by cAMP levels, mutants lacking FimV are twitching impaired, even when exogenous cAMP is provided. Here we further define FimVs cAMP-dependent and -independent regulation of twitching. We confirmed that the response regulator of the T4aP-associated Chp chemotaxis system, PilG, required both FimV and the CyaB regulator, FimL, to activate CyaB. However, in cAMP-replete backgrounds - lacking the cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA or the CheY-like protein PilH, or expressing constitutively-active CyaB - pilG and fimV mutants failed to twitch. Both cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains of FimV were important for its cAMP-dependent and -independent roles, while its septal peptidoglycan-targeting LysM motif was required only for twitching motility. Polar localization of the sensor kinase PilS, a key regulator of transcription of the major pilin, was FimV-dependent. However, unlike its homologues in other species that localize flagellar system components, FimV was not required for swimming motility. These data provide further evidence to support FimVs role as a key hub protein that coordinates the polar localization and function of multiple structural and regulatory proteins involved in P. aeruginosa twitching motility.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a serious opportunistic pathogen. Type IVa pili (T4aP) are important for its virulence, because they mediate dissemination and invasion via twitching motility, and are involved in surface sensing which modulates pathogenicity via changes in cAMP levels. Here we show that the hub protein FimV and the response regulator of the Chp system, PilG, regulate twitching independently of their roles in modulation of cAMP synthesis. These functions do not require the putative scaffold protein FimL, proposed to link PilG with FimV. PilG may regulate asymmetric functioning of the T4aP system to allow for directional movement, while FimV appears to localize both structural and regulatory elements - including the PilSR two-component system - to cell poles for optimal function.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure RNA expression at the single-cell level, thus paving the way for exploring expression heterogeneity among individual cells. Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols are complex and introduce technical biases that vary across cells, which can bias downstream analysis without proper adjustment. To account for cell-to-cell technical differences, we propose a statistical framework, TASC (Toolkit for Analysis of Single Cell RNA-seq), an empirical Bayes approach to reliably model the cell-specific dropout rates and amplification bias by use of external RNA spike-ins. TASC incorporates the technical parameters, which reflect cell-to-cell batch effects, into a hierarchical mixture model to estimate the biological variance of a gene and detect differentially expressed genes. More importantly, TASC is able to adjust for covariates to further eliminate confounding that may originate from cell size and cell cycle differences. In simulation and real scRNA-seq data, TASC achieves accurate Type I error control and displays competitive sensitivity and improved robustness to batch effects in differential expression analysis, compared to existing methods. TASC is programmed to be computationally efficient, taking advantage of multi-threaded parallelization. We believe that TASC will provide a robust platform for researchers to leverage the power of scRNA-seq.",

    "abstract": "Upon genotoxic stress, dynamic relocalization events control DNA repair, and alterations of the transcriptome and proteome enabling stress recovery. How these events may influence one another is only partly known. Beginning with a cytological screen for genome maintenance proteins that move under stress, we find that, upon alkylation stress, the splicing factor Hsh155 localizes to both intranuclear and cytoplasmic protein quality control aggregates. Under stress, an ordered sequestration of Hsh155 occurs at nuclear and then cytoplasmic aggregates in a manner that is regulated by molecular chaperones. This dynamic behavior is preceded by a decrease in splicing efficiency. While DNA replication stress signaling is not required for Hsh155 sequestration, Hsh155 aggregation is cell cycle and TOR pathway dependent. Indeed, loss of a TORC1 regulated ribosomal protein gene transcription factor Sfp1 allows general aggregate formation but prevents Hsh155 recruitment. Together, our analyses suggest a model in which some proteins evicted from chromatin undergoing transcriptional remodeling during stress are targeted to protein quality control sites.",

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction has been proposed as a more rigorous way to define prediction confidence compared to other application domain concepts that have earlier been used for QSAR modelling. One main advantage of such a method is that it provides a prediction region potentially with multiple predicted labels, which contrasts to the single valued (regression) or single label (classification) output predictions by standard QSAR modelling algorithms. Standard conformal prediction might not be suitable for imbalanced datasets. Therefore, Mondrian cross-conformal prediction (MCCP) which combines the Mondrian inductive conformal prediction with cross-fold calibration sets has been introduced. In this study, the MCCP method was applied to 18 publicly available datasets that have various imbalance levels varying from 1:10 to 1:1000 (ratio of active/inactive compounds). Our results show that MCCP in general performed well on cheminformatics datasets with various imbalance levels. More importantly, the method not only provides confidence of prediction and prediction regions compared to standard machine learning methods, but also produces valid predictions for the minority class. In addition, a compound similarity based nonconformity measure was investigated. Our results demonstrate that although it gives valid predictions, its efficiency is much worse than nonconformity measures obtained from supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Social insects protect their colonies from infectious disease through collective defences that result in social immunity. In ants, workers first try to prevent infection of colony members. Here, we show that if this fails and a pathogen establishes an infection, ants employ an efficient multicomponent behaviour - \\\"destructive disinfection\\\" - to prevent further spread of disease through the colony. Ants specifically target infected pupae during the pathogens non-contagious incubation period, relying on chemical  sickness cues emitted by pupae. They then remove the pupal cocoon, perforate its cuticle and administer antimicrobial poison, which enters the body and prevents pathogen replication from the inside out. Like the immune system of a body that specifically targets and eliminates infected cells, this social immunity measure sacrifices infected brood to stop the pathogen completing its lifecycle, thus protecting the rest of the colony. Hence, the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organisation.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, is counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.",

As part of the NIH Protein Capture Reagents Program (PCRP), we have generated a collection of 1406 highly validated, immunoprecipitation (IP) and/or immunoblotting (IB) grade, mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 736 human transcription factors. We used HuProt human protein microarrays to identify mAbs that recognize their cognate targets with exceptional specificity. Using an integrated production and validation pipeline, we validated these mAbs in multiple experimental applications, and have distributed them to the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) and several commercial suppliers. This study allowed us to perform a meta-analysis that identified critical variables that contribute to the generation of high quality mAbs. We find that using full-length antigens for immunization, in combination with HuProt analysis, provides the highest overall success rates. The efficiencies built into this pipeline ensure substantial cost savings compared to current standard practices.",

Harnessing the multiplexing capabilities of CRISPR-Cas9 and Cpf1 systems, we designed a simple and robust co-selection strategy for enriching cells harboring either nuclease-driven non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) events. Selection for dominant alleles of the endogenous sodium-potassium pump (Na+,K+-ATPase) that render cells resistant to ouabain is used to enrich for custom modifications at another unlinked locus of interest, effectively increasing the recovery of engineered cells. The process was readily adaptable to transformed and primary cells, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).
