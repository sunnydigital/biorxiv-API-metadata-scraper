    "abstract": "BackgroundPsychiatric disorders are multigenic diseases with complex etiology contributing significantly to human morbidity and mortality. Although clinically distinct, several disorders share many symptoms suggesting common underlying molecular changes exist that may implicate important regulators of pathogenesis and new therapeutic targets.\\n\\nResultsWe compared molecular signatures across brain regions and disorders in the transcriptomes of postmortem human brain samples. We performed RNA sequencing on tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens from three groups of 24 patients each diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, and from 24 control subjects, and validated the results in an independent cohort. The most significant disease differences were in the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenia samples compared to controls. Transcriptional changes were assessed in an independent cohort, revealing the transcription factor EGR1 as significantly down regulated in both cohorts and as a potential regulator of broader transcription changes observed in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, broad down regulation of genes specific to neurons and concordant up regulation of genes specific to astrocytes was observed in SZ and BPD patients relative to controls. We also assessed the biochemical consequences of gene expression changes with untargeted metabolomic profiling and identified disruption of GABA levels in schizophrenia patients.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive post-mortem transcriptome profile of three psychiatric disorders across three brain regions. We highlight a high-confidence set of independently validated genes differentially expressed between schizophrenia and control patients in the anterior cingulate cortex and integrate transcriptional changes with untargeted metabolite profiling.",

    "abstract": "Brain Computer Interface (BCI), a direct pathway between the human brain and computer, is one of the most pragmatic applications of EEG signal. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signal is one of the monitoring techniques to observe brain functionality. Mental Task Classification (MTC) based on EEG signals is a demanding BCI. Success of BCI system depends on the efficient analysis of these signals. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a filter based heuristic technique which is utilized to analyze EEG signal in recent past. There are several variants of EMD algorithms which have their own merits and demerits. In this paper, we have explored three variants of EMD algorithms named Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) on EEG data for MTC-based BCI. Features are extracted from EEG signal in two phases; in the first phase, the signal is decomposed into different oscillatory functions with the help of different EMD algorithms and eight different parameters (features) are calculated for each function for compact representation in the second phase. These features are fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the different mental tasks. We have formulated two different types of MTC, the first one is binary and second one is multi-MTC. The proposed work outperforms the existing work for both binary and multi mental tasks classification.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of neuroplasticity following stroke is predominantly based on neuroimaging measures that cannot address the subsecond neurodynamics of impaired language processing. We combined behavioral and electrophysiological measures and structural-connectivity estimates to characterize neuroplasticity underlying successful compensation of language abilities after left-hemispheric stroke. We recorded the electroencephalogram from patients with stroke lesions to the left temporal lobe and matched controls during context-driven word retrieval. Participants heard lead-in sentences that either constrained the final word (\\\"He locked the door with the\\\") or not (\\\"She walked in here with the\\\"). The last word was shown as a picture to be named. We conducted individual-participant analyses and focused on oscillatory power as a subsecond indicator of a brain region's functional neurophysiological computations. All participants named pictures faster following constrained than unconstrained sentences, except for two patients, who had extensive damage to the left temporal lobe. Left-lateralized alpha-beta oscillatory power decreased in controls pre-picture presentation for constrained relative to unconstrained contexts. In patients, the alpha-beta power decreases were observed with the same time course as in controls but were lateralized to the intact right hemisphere. The right lateralization depended on the probability of white-matter connections between the bilateral temporal lobes. The two patients who performed poorly behaviorally showed no alpha-beta power decreases. Our findings suggest that incorporating direct measures of neural activity into investigations of neuroplasticity can provide important neural markers to help predict language recovery, assess the progress of neurorehabilitation, and delineate targets for therapeutic neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Telomere shortening has emerged as an important biomarker of aging. Longitudinal studies consistently find that, although telomere length shortens over time on average, there is a subset of individuals for whom telomere length is observed to increase. This apparent lengthening could either be a genuine biological phenomenon, or simply due to measurement and sampling error. Simons, Stulp and Nakagawa [Biogerontology 15: 99-103, 2014] recently proposed a statistical test for detecting when the amount of apparent lengthening in a dataset exceeds that which should be expected due to error, and thus indicating that genuine elongation may be operative in some individuals. The test is however based on a restrictive assumption, namely that each individuals true rate of telomere change is constant over time. It is not currently known whether this assumption is true. Here we show, using simulated datasets, that with perfect measurement and large sample size, the test has high power to detect true lengthening as long as the true rate of shortening is either constant, or moderately stable, over time. If the true rate of lengthening varies randomly from year to year, the test systematically returns type-II errors. We also consider the impact of measurement error. Using estimates of the magnitude of annual attrition and of measurement error derived from the human telomere literature, we show that power of the test is likely to be low in several empirically-realistic scenarios, even in large samples. Thus, whilst a significant result of the proposed test is likely to indicate that true lengthening is present in a data set, type-II errors are a likely outcome, either if measurement error is substantial, and/or the true rate of attrition varies substantially over time within individuals.",

    "abstract": "Effective working memory (WM) functioning depends on the gating process that regulates the balance between maintenance and updating of WM. The present study used the event-based eye-blink rate (ebEBR), which presumably reflects phasic striatal dopamine activity, to examine how the cognitive processes of gating and updating separately facilitate flexible updating of WM contents and the potential involvement of dopamine in these processes. Realtime changes in eye blinks were tracked during performance on the reference-back task, in which demands on these two processes were independently manipulated. In all three experiments, trials that required WM updating and trials that required gate switching were both associated with increased ebEBR. These results may support the prefrontal cortex basal ganglia WM model (PBWM) by linking updating and gating to striatal dopaminergic activity. In Experiment 3, the ebEBR was used to determine what triggers gate switching. We found that switching to an updating mode (gate opening) was more stimulus driven and retroactive than switching to a maintenance mode, which was more context driven. Together, these findings show that the ebEBR - an inexpensive, non-invasive, easy-to-use measure - can be used to track changes in WM demands during task performance and, hence, possibly striatal dopamine activity.",

    "abstract": "Tbx5 is a key transcription factor for vertebrate heart and forelimb development that causes Holt-Oram syndrome when mutated in humans. The classic zebrafish mutant for tbx5a named heartstrings (hst) features recessive absence of pectoral fins and a spectrum of heart defects, most-prominently featuring the name-giving stretched heart tube. The mutation of the hst allele is a stop codon that is predicted to result in a truncated Tbx5a protein that might feature residual activity. Here, using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we generated zebrafish strains for two new tbx5a frameshift alleles in the first coding exon: tbx5a c.21_25del and tbx5a c.22_31del, abbreviated as tbx5a{Delta}5 and tbx5a{Delta}10. Homozygous and trans-heterozygous combinations of these new tbx5a alleles cause fully penetrant loss of pectoral fins and heart defects including changes in cardiac marker expression akin to hst mutants. Nonetheless, distinct from hst mutants, homozygous and trans-heterozygous combinations of these tbx5a frameshift mutants do not readily manifest the stretched hst heart phenotype. Our observation points out the importance and value of comparing phenotypes from different classes of mutant alleles per gene.",

    "abstract": "It has long been suspected that the rate of mutation varies across the human genome at a large scale based on the divergence between humans and other species. It is now possible to directly investigate this question using the large number of de novo mutations (DNMs) that have been discovered in humans through the sequencing of trios. We show that there is variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB, 1MB and 10MB scale that cannot be explained by variation at smaller scales, however the level of this variation is modest at large scales - at the 1MB scale we infer that ~90% of regions have a mutation rate within 50% of the mean. Different types of mutation show similar levels of variation and appear to vary in concert which suggests the pattern of mutation is relatively constant across the genome and hence unlikely to generate variation in GC-content. We confirm this using two different analyses. We find that genomic features explain less than 50% of the explainable variance in the rate of DNM. As expected the rate of divergence between species and the level of diversity within humans are correlated to the rate of DNM. However, the correlations are weaker than if all the variation in divergence was due to variation in the mutation rate. We provide evidence that this is due the effect of biased gene conversion on the probability that a mutation will become fixed. We find no evidence that linked selection affects the relationship between divergence and DNM density. In contrast to divergence, we find that most of the variation in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between divergence and DNM density declines as increasingly divergent species are considered.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUsing a dataset of 40,000 de novo mutations we show that there is large-scale variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB and 1MB scale. We show that different types of mutation vary in concert and in a manner that is not expected to generate variation in base composition; hence mutation bias is not responsible for the large-scale variation in base composition that is observed across human chromosomes. As expected large-scale variation in the rate of divergence between species and the variation within species across the genome, are correlated to the rate of mutation, but the correlation between divergence and the mutation rate is not as strong as they could be. We show that biased gene conversion is responsible for weakening the correlation. In contrast we find that most of the variation across the genome in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between the rate of mutation in humans and the divergence between humans and other species, weakens as the species become more divergent.",

We have found that a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells in the olfactory bulb explicitly represent {Delta}Ct. These concentration change detectors are direction selective: some respond to positive {Delta}Ct, while others represent negative {Delta}Ct. This change detection enhances the contrast between different concentrations and the magnitude of contrast enhancement scales with the size of the concentration step. Further, {Delta}Ct can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells explicitly represents {Delta}Ct, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.",

    "abstract": "Abundance is a key parameter in microbial ecology, and important to estimates of potential metabolite flux, impacts of dispersal, and sensitivity of samples to technical biases such as laboratory contamination. However, modern amplicon-based sequencing techniques by themselves typically provide no information about the absolute abundance of microbes. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR as independent estimates of microbial abundance to test the hypothesis that microbial symbionts have enabled ants to dominate tropical rainforest canopies by facilitating herbivorous diets, and compare these methods to microbial diversity profiles from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Through a systematic survey of ants from a lowland tropical forest, we show that the density of gut microbiota varies across several orders of magnitude among ant lineages, with median individuals from many genera only marginally above detection limits. Supporting the hypothesis that microbial symbiosis is important to dominance in the canopy, we find that the abundance of gut bacteria is positively correlated with stable isotope proxies of herbivory among canopy-dwelling ants, but not among ground-dwelling ants. Notably, these broad findings are much more evident in the quantitative data than in the 16S rRNA sequencing data. Our results help to resolve a longstanding question in tropical rainforest ecology, and have broad implications for the interpretation of sequence-based surveys of microbial diversity.",

However, extracting novel genomes from complex mixtures of metagenomic data can still be challenging and in many respects represents an ill-posed problem which is generally approached with ad hoc methods. Here we present a microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic method which offers a statistically rigorous approach to extract novel microbial genomes from complex samples. In addition, by generating 96 sub-samples from each environmental sample, this method maintains high throughput, reduces sample complexity, and preserves single-cell resolution. We used this approach to analyze two hot spring samples from Yellowstone National Park and extracted 29 new genomes larger than 0.5 Mbps. These genomes represent novel lineages at different taxonomic levels, including three deeply branching lineages. Functional analysis revealed that these organisms utilize diverse pathways for energy metabolism. The resolution of this mini-metagenomic method enabled accurate quantification of genome abundance, even for genomes less than 1% in relative abundance. Our analyses also revealed a wide range of genome level single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distributions with nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio indicative of low to moderate environmental selection. The scale, resolution, and statistical power of microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic make it a powerful tool to dissect the genomic structure microbial communities while effectively preserving the fundamental unit of biology, the single cell.",

    "abstract": "Whether evolution can be predicted is a key question in evolutionary biology. Here we set out to better understand the repeatability of evolution, which is a necessary condition for predictability. We explored experimentally the effect of mutation supply and the strength of selective pressure on the repeatability of selection from standing genetic variation. Different sizes of mutant libraries of an antibiotic resistance gene, TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase in Escherichia coli, were subjected to different antibiotic concentrations. We determined whether populations went extinct or survived, and sequenced the TEM gene of the surviving populations. The distribution of mutations per allele in our mutant libraries--generated by error-prone PCR--followed a Poisson distribution. Extinction patterns could be explained by a simple stochastic model that assumed the sampling of beneficial mutations was key for survival. In most surviving populations, alleles containing at least one known large-effect beneficial mutation were present. These genotype data also support a model which only invokes sampling effects to describe the occurrence of alleles containing large-effect driver mutations. Hence, evolution is largely predictable given cursory knowledge of mutational fitness effects, the mutation rate and population size. There were no clear trends in the repeatability of selected mutants when we considered all mutations present. However, when only known large-effect mutations were considered, the outcome of selection is less repeatable for large libraries, in contrast to expectations. Furthermore, we show experimentally that alleles carrying multiple mutations selected from large libraries confer higher resistance levels relative to alleles with only a known large-effect mutation, suggesting that the scarcity of high-resistance alleles carrying multiple mutations may contribute to the decrease in repeatability at large library sizes.",

Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that sequence alignments are a poor estimate functional information. The mutual information of sequence alignments fantastically underestimates of the true number of functional proteins, because it also is strongly influenced by a familys history, mutational bias, and selection. Regardless, even if functional information could be reliably calculated, it tells us nothing about the difficulty of evolving new functions, because it does not estimate the distance between a new function and existing functions.

New methods control errors sufficiently that sequence variants (SVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer taxonomic resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for SV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits deriving from the status of SVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how those features grant SVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs -- including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed datasets, and forward prediction -- and of de novo OTUs -- including accurate diversity measurement and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that SVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker gene analysis and reporting.",

    "abstract": "Microbial N2 fixation (diazotrophy) represents an important nitrogen source to oligotrophic peatland ecosystems, which are important sinks for atmospheric CO2 and susceptible to changing climate. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the active microbial group and type of nitrogenase mediating diazotrophy in a ombrotrophic Sphagnum-dominated peat bog (the S1 peat bog, Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA); and (ii) to determine the effect of environmental parameters (light, O2, CO2, CH4) on potential rates of diazotrophy measured by acetylene (C2H2) reduction and 15N2 incorporation. Molecular analysis of metabolically active microbial communities suggested that diazotrophy in surface peat was primarily mediated by Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae). Despite higher dissolved vanadium (V; 11 nM) than molybdenum (Mo; 3 nM) in surface peat, a combination of metagenomic, amplicon sequencing and activity measurements indicated that Mo-containing nitrogenases dominate over the V-containing form. Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water content. Incorporation of15N2 was suppressed 90% by O2 and 55% by C2H2, and was unaffected by CH4 and CO2 amendments. These results suggest that peatland diazotrophy is mediated by a combination of C2H2 - sensitive and C2H2 - insensitive microbes that are more active at low O2 and show similar activity at high and low CH4.\\n\\nImportancePrevious studies indicate that diazotrophy provides an important nitrogen source and is linked to methanotrophy in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. However, the environmental controls and enzymatic pathways of peatland diazotrophy, as well as the metabolically active microbial populations that catalyze this process remain in question. Our findings indicate that oxygen levels and photosynthetic activity override low nutrient availability in limiting diazotrophy, and that members of the Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales) catalyze this process at the bog surface using the molybdenum - based form of the nitrogenase enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer through a redox-active exopolysaccharide matrix has been proposed as a strategy for extracellular electron transfer to Fe(III) oxide by Geobacter sulfurreducens, based on the phenotype of a xapD-deficient strain. Central to this model was the assertion that the xapD-deficient strain produced pili decorated with the multi-heme c-type cytochrome OmcS in manner similar to the wild-type strain. Further examination of the xapD-deficient strain with immunogold labeling of OmcS and transmission electron microscopy revealed that OmcS was associated with the outer cell surface rather than pili. PilA, the pilus monomer, could not be detected in the xapD-deficient strain under conditions in which it was readily detected in the wild-type strain. Multiple lines of evidence in previous studies have suggested that long-range electron transport to Fe(III) oxides proceeds through electrically conductive pili and that OmcS associated with the pili is necessary for electron transfer from the pili to Fe(III) oxides. Therefore, an alternative explanation for the Fe(III) oxide reduction phenotype of the xapD-deficient strain is that the pili-OmcS route for extracellular electron transport to Fe(III) oxide has been disrupted in the xapD-deficient strain.",

    "abstract": "We study pattern formation in a 2-D reaction-diffusion (RD) sub-cellular model characterizing the effect of a spatial gradient of a plant hormone distribution on a family of G-proteins associated with root-hair (RH) initiation in the plant cell Arabidopsis thaliana. The activation of these G-proteins, known as the Rho of Plants (ROPs), by the plant hormone auxin, is known to promote certain protuberances on root hair cells, which are crucial for both anchorage and the uptake of nutrients from the soil. Our mathematical model for the activation of ROPs by the auxin gradient is an extension of the model of Payne and Grierson [PLoS ONE, 12(4), (2009)], and consists of a two-component Schnakenberg-type RD system with spatially heterogeneous coefficients on a 2-D domain. The nonlinear kinetics in this RD system model the nonlinear interactions between the active and inactive forms of ROPs. By using a singular perturbation analysis to study 2-D localized spatial patterns of active ROPs, it is shown that the spatial variations in the nonlinear reaction kinetics, due to the auxin gradient, lead to a slow spatial alignment of the localized regions of active ROPs along the longitudinal midline of the plant cell. Numerical bifurcation analysis, together with time-dependent numerical simulations of the RD system are used to illustrate both 2-D localized patterns in the model, and the spatial alignment of localized structures.",

However, accumulating evidence suggests that iPSCs are heterogeneous in comparison with embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and that is attributed to various genetic and epigenetic states of donor cells. In the light of the discovery of cell-type specialized ribosomal protein composition, its role as the cells transit through different stages of reprogramming and when iPSCs differentiate into specialized cell-types has not been explored to understand its influence in the reprogramming and differentiation process and outcome. By re-analyzing the publicly available gene expression datasets among ESCs, various sources of iPSCs and somatic cells and by studying the ribosomal protein gene expression during different stages of reprogramming of somatic cells and different passages of established iPSCs we found distinct patterns of their expression across multiple cell-types. We experimentally validated these results on the cells undergoing reprogramming from human dermal fibroblasts. Finally, by comparing publicly available data from iPSCs, iPSCs derived specialized cells and its in vivo counterparts, we show alterations in ribosomal gene expression during differentiation of specialized cells from iPSCs which may have Implications in the context of ribosomopathies. Our results provide an informatics framework for researchers in efficient generation of iPSCs that are equivalent to ESCs.",

    "abstract": "Masculinization of the rodent brain is driven by estrogen signaling during a perinatal critical period. Genetic deletion of estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1/ER) results in altered hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis signaling and a dramatic reduction of male sexual and territorial behaviors. However, the requirement of ER function in masculinizing distinct classes of neurons, and if these populations mediate components of male-typical behavior, remains unexplored. We deleted ER in excitatory or inhibitory neurons using either a Vglut2 or Vgat driver and assessed male behaviors. We find that Vglut2-Cre;Esr1lox/lox mutant males lack ERa in the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and posterior ventral portion of the medial amygdala (MePV). These mutants recapitulate the increased serum testosterone levels seen with constitutive ER deletion, but have none of the behavioral deficits. In contrast, Vgat-Cre;Esr1lox/lox males with substantial ER deletion in inhibitory neurons, including those of the principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr), posterior dorsal MeA (MePD), and medial preoptic area (MPOA) have normal testosterone levels, but display alterations in mating and territorial behaviors. These mutants also show demasculinized expression of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor beta (Esr2). Our results demonstrate that ER masculinizes GABAergic neurons that gate the display of male-typical behaviors.",

An effective treatment to eradicate the persistent disease is still lacking as the mechanisms of S. aureus persistence are poorly understood. In this study, we performed a comprehensive and unbiased high-throughput mutant screen using S. aureus USA300 and identified argJ, encoding an acetyltransferase in the arginine biosynthesis pathway, whose mutation produced a significant defect in persister formation in multiple drugs and stresses. Genetic complementation and arginine supplementation restored persistence in the ArgJ mutant. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the arg genes were over-expressed under drug stressed conditions and in stationary phase cultures. In addition, the ArgJ mutant had attenuated virulence in both C. elegans and mouse models of infection. Our studies identify a novel mechanism of persistence mediated by arginine metabolism in S. aureus. These findings will not only provide new insights about the mechanisms of S. aureus persistence but also offer novel therapeutic targets that may help to develop more effective treatment of persistent S. aureus infections.",

Genomes from most Bacterial phyla contain at least one or more prophages. We updated our PhiSpy algorithm to improve detection of prophages and to provide a web-based framework for PhiSpy. We have used this algorithm to identify 36,488 prophage regions from 11,941 bacterial genomes, including almost 600 prophages with no known homology to any proteins. Transfer RNA genes were abundant in the prophages, many of which alleviate the limits of translation efficiency due to host codon bias and presumably enable phages to surpass the normal capacity of the hosts translation machinery. We identified integrase genes in 15,765 prophages (43% of the prophages). The integrase was routinely located at either end of the integrated phage genome, and was used to orient and align prophage genomes to reveal their underlying organization. The conserved genome alignments of phages recapitulate early, middle, and late gene order in transcriptional control of phage genes, and demonstrate that gene order, presumably selected by transcription timing and/or coordination among functional modules has been stably conserved throughout phage evolution.",

Analysis of co-variance across multiple sequencing experiments further reveals clusters of coregulated genes, with in situ hybridization confirming the domain-specific expression of novel genes. We then performed mutational analysis of a number of these genes, which uncovered antagonistic functions of two new Edn1 targets, follistatin a (fsta) and emx2, in regulating cartilaginous joints in the hyoid arch. Our unbiased discovery and functional analysis of genes with regional expression in zebrafish arch CNCCs reveals complex regulation by Ednl and points to novel candidates for craniofacial disorders.\\n\\nSummary StatementUsing zebrafish to purify distinct groups of embryonic cells, Askary et al. have created a detailed map of how thousands of genes are deployed to shape the developing face.",

They conclude by strongly advocating that Bayesian implementations of the Mk model should be the default method of analysis for such data. While we appreciate the authors attempt to investigate the accuracy of alternative methods of analysis, their conclusion is based on an inappropriate comparison of the ML point estimate, which does not consider confidence, with the Bayesian consensus, which incorporates estimation credibility into the summary tree. Using simulation, we demonstrate that ML and Bayesian estimates are concordant when confidence and credibility are comparably reflected in summary trees, a result expected from statistical theory. We therefore disagree with the conclusions of PEA and consider their prescription of any default method to be poorly founded. Instead, we recommend caution and thoughtful consideration of the model or method being applied to a morphological dataset.",

Smooth muscle cells are ring-shaped and cover arterioles with circumferential processes, whereas pericytes extend thin processes that run longitudinally along capillaries.

Recent studies suggest that these transitional cells are critical for controlling blood flow to the capillary bed during health and disease, but there remains confusion on how to identify them and where they are located in the brain microvasculature. To address this issue, we measured the morphology, vascular territory, and -smooth muscle actin content of structurally diverse mural cells in adult mouse cortex. We first imaged intact 3-D vascular networks to establish the locations of major gradations in mural cell appearance as arterioles branched into capillaries. We then imaged individual mural cells occupying the regions within these gradations. This revealed two transitional cells that were often similar in appearance, but with sharply contrasting levels of -smooth muscle actin. Our findings highlight the diversity of mural cell morphologies in brain microvasculature, and provide guidance for identification and categorization of mural cell types.",

We present a theory based upon the crystal structure of UCNPs to estimate the molecular weight of UCNPs: enabling insight into UCNP molecular weight for the first time. We estimate the theoretical molecular weight of various UCNPs reported in the literature, predicting that spherical NaYF4 UCNPs {small tilde} 10 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}1 MDa (i.e. 106 g/mol), whereas UCNPs {small tilde} 45 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}100 MDa (i.e. 108 g/mol). We also predict that hexagonal crystal phase UCNPs will be of greater molecular weight than cubic crystal phase UCNPs. Additionally we find that a Gaussian UCNP diameter distribution will correspond to a lognormal UCNP molecular weight distribution. Our approach could potentially be generalised to predict the molecular weight of other arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles: as such, we provide standalone graphic user interfaces to calculate the molecular weight both UCNPs and arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles. We expect knowledge of UCNP molecular weight to be of wide utility in biomedical applications where reporting UCNP quantity in absolute numbers or molarity will be beneficial for inter-study comparison and repeatability.",

    "abstract": "While mutational biases strongly influence neutral molecular evolution, the role of mutational biases in shaping the course of adaptation is less clear. Here we consider the frequency of transitions relative to transversions among adaptive substitutions. Because mutation rates for transitions are higher than those for transversions, if mutational biases influence the dynamics of adaptation, then transitions should be over-represented among documented adaptive substitutions. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a dataset of putatively adaptive amino acid substitutions that have occurred in parallel during evolution in nature or in the laboratory. We find that the frequency of transitions in this dataset is much higher than would be predicted under a null model where mutation has no effect. Our results are qualitatively similar even if we restrict ourself to changes that have occurred, not merely twice, but three or more times. These results suggest that the course of adaptation is biased by mutation.",

Light-sheet microscopy allows observation of the full course of embryonic development from egg to larva. Bringing the two approaches together allows unparalleled precision into the temporal regulation of signaling pathways and cellular processes in vivo. To develop this method, we investigated the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling during anterior-posterior patterning of the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) from Arabidopsis Thaliana was fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and Drosophila {beta}-catenin to form an easy to visualize optogenetic switch. Blue light illumination caused oligomerization of the fusion protein and inhibited downstream Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo. Temporal inactivation of {beta}-catenin confirmed that Wnt signaling is required not only for Drosophila pattern formation, but also for maintenance later in development. We anticipate that this method will be easily extendable to other developmental signaling pathways and many other experimental systems.",

Here we provide another example of a positive relationship, in a group of crustaceans whose genome sizes have not previously been investigated. We analyze genome size estimates for 46 species across Class Ostracoda, including 29 new estimates made using Feulgen image analysis densitometry and flow cytometry. Genome sizes in this group range ~80-fold, a level of variability that is otherwise not seen in crustaceans with the exception of some malacostracan orders. We find a strong positive correlation between genome size and body size across all species, including after phylogenetic correction. We additionally detect evidence of XX/XO sex determination in all three species of myodocopids where male and female genome sizes were estimated. On average, genome sizes are larger but less variable in myodocopids than in podocopids, and marine ostracods have larger genomes than freshwater species, but this appears to be explained by phylogenetic inertia. The relationship between phylogeny, genome size, body size, and habitat is complex in this system, and will benefit from additional data collection across various habitats and ostracod taxa.",

We identified a DEMETER-like (CsDML) cDNA from a winter-enriched cDNA subtractive library in chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.), an economically and ecologically important species. Next, we characterized this DNA demethylase and its putative orthologue in the more experimentally tractable hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x alba), under the signals that trigger bud dormancy in trees. We performed phylogenetic and protein sequence analysis, gene expression profiling and 5mC immunodetection studies to evaluate the role of CsDML and its homologue in poplar, PtaDML6. Transgenic hybrid poplars overexpressing CsDML were produced and analyzed. Short days (SD) and cold temperatures induced CsDML and PtaDML6. Overexpression of CsDML accelerated SD-induced bud formation, specifically from stage 1 to 0. Bud acquired a red-brown coloration earlier than wild type (WT) plants, alongside with the upregulation of flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes and accumulation of flavonoids in the SAM and bud scales. Our data shows that the CsDML gene induces bud formation needed for the survival of the apical meristem under the harsh conditions of winter. This study provides in planta evidence implicating chromatin remodeling by DNA demethylation during SD induction of bud maturation through the induction of flavonoids biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Microsatellite (SSR) is one of the most popular markers for applied genetic research, but generally the current methods to develop SSRs are relatively time-consuming and expensive. Although high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approach has become a practical and relatively inexpensive option so far, only a small percentage of SSR markers turn out to be polymorphic. Here, we designed a new method to enrich polymorphic SSRs through the comparative transcriptome analysis. This program contains five main steps: 1) transcriptome data downloading or RNA-seq; 2) sequence assembly; 3) SSR mining and enrichment of sequences containing SSRs; 4) sequence alignment; 5) enrichment of sequences containing polymorphic SSRs. A validation experiment was performed and the results showed almost all markers (> 90%) that were indicated as putatively polymorphic by this method were indeed polymorphic. The frequency of polymorphic SSRs was significantly higher (P < 0.05) but the cost and running time were much lower than those of traditional and HTS approaches. The method has a practical value for polymorphic SSRs development and might be widely used for genetic analyses in any species.",

    "abstract": "The epigenome has been shown to be influenced by biological factors, such as disease status, and environmental factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index. Although there is a widespread perception that environmental influences on the epigenome are pervasive and profound, there has been little evidence to date in humans with respect to environmental factors that are biologically distal. Here, we provide evidence on the associations between epigenetic modifications--in our case, CpG methylation--and educational attainment (EA), a biologically distal environmental factor that is arguably among of the most important life-shaping experiences for individuals. Specifically, we report the results of an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis of EA based on data from 27 cohort studies with a total of 10,767 individuals. While we find that 9 CpG probes are significantly associated with EA, only two remain associated when we restrict the sample to never-smokers. These two are known to be strongly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, and thus their association with EA could be due to correlation between EA and maternal smoking. Moreover, their effect sizes on EA are far smaller than the known associations between CpG probes and biologically proximal environmental factors. Two analyses that combine the effects of many probes--polygenic methylation score and epigenetic-clock analyses--both suggest small associations with EA. If our findings regarding EA can be generalized to other biologically distal environmental factors, then they cast doubt on the hypothesis that such factors have large effects on the epigenome.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in cancer treatments, early detection of cancer is still the most promising way to improve outcomes. Without homeostatic control, urine reflects early changes in the body and can potentially be used for early cancer diagnosis. In this study, a Walker 256 tumor rat model was established by subcutaneous injection of Walker 256 tumor cells. To identify urinary proteome changes during cancer development, urine samples from Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats were collected at five time points corresponding to before cancer cell implantation, before tumor mass palpability, at tumor mass appearance, during rapid tumor growth, and at cachexia. The urinary protein patterns changed significantly as the tumors progressed, as measured using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The urinary proteome of tumor-bearing rats was identified using Fusion Lumos mass spectrometry with label-free quantification. Then, 30 dynamically changed urinary proteins during cancer progression were selected as more reliable cancer biomarkers, and they were validated by targeted proteomics. Combined with the results of label-free and targeted proteome quantification, a total of 10 urinary proteins (HPT, APOA4, CO4, B2MG, A1AG, CATC, VCAM1, CALB1, CSPG4, and VTDB) changed significantly even before a tumor mass was palpable, and these early changes in urine could also be identified with differential abundance at late stages of cancer.

    "abstract": "The history of maize has been characterized by major demographic events including changes in population size associated with domestication and range expansion as well as gene flow with wild relatives. The interplay between demographic history and selection has shaped diversity across maize populations and genomes. Here, we investigate these processes based on high-depth resequencing data from 31 maize landraces spanning the pre-Columbian distribution of maize as well as four wild progenitor individuals (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) from the Balsas River Valley in Mexico. Genome-wide demographic analyses reveal that maize domestication and spread resulted in pronounced declines in effective population size due to both a protracted bottleneck and serial founder effects, while, concurrently, parviglumis experienced population growth. The cost of maize domestication and spread was an increase in deleterious alleles in the domesticate relative to its wild progenitor. This cost is particularly pronounced in Andean maize, which appears to have experienced a more dramatic founder event when compared to other maize populations. Introgression from the wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana into maize in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala is found found to decrease the prevalence of deleterious alleles, likely due to the higher long-term effective population size of wild maize. These findings underscore the strong interaction between historical demography and the efficiency of selection species- and genome-wide and suggest domesticated species with well-characterized histories may be particularly useful for understanding this interplay.",

Jointly modeling multiple traits genetic profiles has provided insights into the shared genetic basis of many complex traits. However, large-scale inference sets a high bar for both statistical power and biological interpretability. Here we introduce a principled framework to estimate annotation-stratified genetic covariance between traits using GWAS summary statistics. Through theoretical and numerical analyses we demonstrate that our method provides accurate covariance estimates, thus enabling researchers to dissect both the shared and distinct genetic architecture across traits to better understand their etiologies. Among 50 complex traits with publicly accessible GWAS summary statistics (Ntotal {approx} 4.5 million), we identified more than 170 pairs with statistically significant genetic covariance. In particular, we found strong genetic covariance between late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two major neurodegenerative diseases, in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high minor allele frequencies and in SNPs located in the predicted functional genome. Joint analysis of LOAD, ALS, and other traits highlights LOADs correlation with cognitive traits and hints at an autoimmune component for ALS.",

    "abstract": "Current storage technologies can no longer keep pace with exponentially growing amounts of data. 1 Synthetic DNA offers an attractive alternative due to its potential information density of ~ 1018 B/mm3, 107 times denser than magnetic tape, and potential durability of thousands of years.2 Recent advances in DNA data storage have highlighted technical challenges, in particular, coding and random access, but have stored only modest amounts of data in synthetic DNA. 3,4,5 This paper demonstrates an end-to-end approach toward the viability of DNA data storage with large-scale random access. We encoded and stored 35 distinct files, totaling 200MB of data, in more than 13 million DNA oligonucleotides (about 2 billion nucleotides in total) and fully recovered the data with no bit errors, representing an advance of almost an order of magnitude compared to prior work. 6 Our data curation focused on technologically advanced data types and historical relevance, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in over 100 languages,7 a high-definition music video of the band OK Go,8 and a CropTrust database of the seeds stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.9 We developed a random access methodology based on selective amplification, for which we designed and validated a large library of primers, and successfully retrieved arbitrarily chosen items from a subset of our pool containing 10.3 million DNA sequences. Moreover, we developed a novel coding scheme that dramatically reduces the physical redundancy (sequencing read coverage) required for error-free decoding to a median of 5x, while maintaining levels of logical redundancy comparable to the best prior codes. We further stress-tested our coding approach by successfully decoding a file using the more error-prone nanopore-based sequencing. We provide a detailed analysis of errors in the process of writing, storing, and reading data from synthetic DNA at a large scale, which helps characterize DNA as a storage medium and justify our coding approach. Thus, we have demonstrated a significant improvement in data volume, random access, and encoding/decoding schemes that contribute to a whole-system vision for DNA data storage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the pregnancy rates after thawed blastocyst transfers in patients treated with various hormone replacement regimens.\\n\\nMethodsA prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the outcomes in three different hormone replacement protocols for thawed blastocyst transfer. A total of 330 women (median age 38.2 years) who were undergoing IVF at our clinic were enrolled.\\n\\nResultsSerum estradiol (E2) levels were 267.71 pg/ml in Premarin group, 391.22 pg/ml in Estrogel group and 495.12 pg/ml in Estrana tape group. Therefore, serum E2 levels in Estrana tape group were higher than those of the other two groups (P<0.01). The pregnancy rate in the Estrogel group was higher than that in the Premarin group (30.0% versus 17.3%, P=0.026, odds ratio 2.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-3.87). Furthermore, the pregnancy rate in the Estrana tape group was higher than that in the Estrogel group (43.6% versus 30.0%, P=0.036, odds ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.14).\\n\\nConclusionThe serum E2 levels contributed to differences observed in the pregnancy rate among the three different protocols. Thus, Estrana tape has an advantage as a hormone replacement protocol for thawed blastocyst transfer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA high proportion of women start pregnancy overweight/obese. According to the developmental overnutrition hypothesis, this could lead offspring to have metabolic disruption throughout their lives, and, thus perpetuate the obesity epidemic across generations. Concerns about this hypothesis are influencing antenatal care. However, it is unknown whether maternal pregnancy adiposity is associated with long-term risk of adverse metabolic profiles in offspring, and if so, whether this association is causal, via intrauterine mechanisms, or explained by shared familial (genetic, lifestyle, socioeconomic) characteristics. We aimed to determine if associations between maternal body mass index (BMI) with offspring systemic metabolite profile are causal via intrauterine mechanisms or familial factors.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe used one and two-stage individual participant data (IPD) metaanalysis, and a negative-control (paternal BMI) to examine the association between maternal prepregnancy BMI and offspring serum metabolome from three European birth cohorts (offspring age at metabolite assessment 16, 17 and 31 years). Circulating metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics. Results from one-stage IPD meta-analysis (N=5327 to 5377 mother-father-offspring trios) showed that increasing maternal and paternal BMI was associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic profile in offspring. We observed strong positive associations with VLDL-lipoproteins, VLDL-C, VLDL-triglycerides, VLDL-diameter, branched/aromatic amino acids, glycoprotein acetyls, and triglycerides, and strong negative associations with HDL-lipoprotein, HDL-diameter, HDL-C, HDL2-C and HDL3-C (all P<0.003). Stronger magnitudes of associations were present for maternal compared with paternal BMI across these associations, however there was no strong statistical evidence for heterogeneity between them (all bootstrap P >0.003, equivalent to 0.05 after accounting for multiple testing). Results were similar in each individual cohort, and in the two-stage analysis. Offspring BMI showed similar patterns of crosssectional association with metabolic profiles as for parental pre-pregnancy BMI associations, but with greater magnitudes. Adjustment of the parent BMI-offspring metabolite associations for offspring BMI suggested the parental associations were largely due to the association of parental BMI measures with offspring BMI.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings suggest that maternal BMI-offspring metabolome associations are likely to be largely due to shared genetic or familial lifestyle confounding, rather than intrauterine programming mechanisms. They do not support the introduction of measures to reduce maternal BMI in order to prevent adverse offspring cardio-metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites can manipulate mosquito feeding behaviours such as motivation and avidity to feed on vertebrate hosts in ways that increase parasite transmission. However, in natural conditions, not all vertebrate blood-sources are suitable hosts for the parasite. Whether malaria parasites can manipulate mosquito host choice in ways that enhance parasite transmission toward suitable hosts and/or reduce mosquito attraction to unsuitable hosts (i.e. specific manipulation) is unknown. To address this question, we experimentally infected three species of mosquito vectors (Anopheles coluzzii, Anopheles gambiae, and Anopheles arabiensis) with wild isolates of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and examined the effects of immature (oocyst) and mature (sporozoite) infections on mosquito behavioural responses (activation rate and odour choice) to combinations of calf odour, human odour and outdoor air using a dual-port olfactometer. Regardless of parasite developmental stage and mosquito species, P. falciparum infection did not alter mosquito activation rate or their choice for human odours. The overall expression pattern of host choice of all three mosquito species was consistent with a high degree of anthropophily, with both infected and uninfected individuals showing higher attraction toward human odour over calf odour, human odour over outdoor air, and outdoor air over calf odour. Our results suggests that, in this system, the parasite may not be able to manipulate the early long-range behavioural steps involved in the mosquito host-feeding process, including initiation of host-seeking and host orientation. Future studies examining mosquito host-feeding behaviours at a shorter range (i.e. the \\\"at-host\\\" foraging activities) are required to test whether malaria parasites can modify their mosquito host choice to enhance transmission toward suitable hosts and/or reduce biting on unsuitable hosts.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have expended considerable effort to understand the causes and correlates of criminal victimization. More recently, scholars have focused on identifying individual-level traits that increase the odds of victimization. Generally absent from this line of research, however, is examining the extent to which previously unmeasured genetic and environmental influences contribute to the covariation between victimization and individual-level risk factors. The current study aims to replicate and extend prior research by examining the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on the association between intelligence and victimization by analyzing twin and sibling data from two nationally representative samples of American youth. Quantitative genetic analyses indicate that common additive genetic factors, as well as non-shared environmental factors, explained the phenotypic association between intelligence and victimization. Finally, our results revealed that after correcting for possible familial confounding, the effect of intelligence on victimization experiences remained statistically significant. The findings of the current study replicate and extend prior research on the phenotypic association between indicators of general intelligence and the experience of victimization.",

    "abstract": "Sex is beneficial in the long-term, because it can prevent mutational meltdown through increased effectiveness of selection. This idea is supported by empirical evidence of deleterious mutation accumulation in species with a recent transition to asexuality. Here, we studied the effectiveness of purifying selection in oribatid mites, which have lost sex millions of years ago and diversified into different families and species while reproducing asexually. We compared the accumulation of deleterious coding and non-coding mutations between three asexual and three sexual lineages using transcriptome data. Contrasting studies of young asexual lineages, we find evidence for strong purifying selection that is more effective in asexual compared to sexual oribatid mite lineages. Our results suggest that large populations likely sustain effective purifying selection and facilitate the escape of mutational meltdown in the absence of sex. Thus, sex per se is not a prerequisite for the long-term persistence of animal lineages.",

    "abstract": "In humans and other mammals, female cells carry two X-chromosomes, whereas male cells carry a single X and Y-chromosome. To achieve an equal expression level of X-linked genes in both sexes, a dosage compensation mechanism evolved, which results in transcriptional silencing of one X-chromosome in females. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is random with respect to the parental origin of the X, occurs early during embryonic development, and is then stably maintained through a near infinite number of cell divisions. As a result of this, every female individual consists of a mosaic of two different cell populations, in which either the maternally or paternally derived X-chromosome is inactivated. As the X-chromosome harbors more than a thousand genes, of which many are implicated in human disease when mutated, this mosaicism has important disease implications. Whereas X-linked disorders are usually more severe in hemizygous males harboring a single X-chromosome, a more variable phenotype is observed in females. This variability is a direct consequence of the XCI-mosaicism, and is affected by the randomness of the XCI process. Here we review the latest insights into the regulation of this important female specific process, and discuss mechanisms that influence mosaicism in females, with a focus on the clinical consequences related to X-linked diseases in females.",
