    "abstract": "Characteristics of male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been well-described, but the genetic basis of male-female copulation is largely unknown. Here we show that the white (w) gene, a classical gene for eye color, is associated with copulation success. 82.5 % of wild-type Canton-S flies copulated within 60 minutes in circular arenas, whereas few white-eyed mutants mated successfully. The w+ allele exchanged to the X chromosome or duplicated to the Y chromosome in the white-eyed genetic background rescued the defect of copulation success. The w+-associated copulation success was independent of eye color phenotype. Addition of the mini-white (mw+) gene to the white-eyed mutant rescued the defect of copulation success in a manner that was mw+ copy number-dependent. Lastly, male-female sexual experience mimicked the effects of w+/mw+ in improving successful copulation. These data suggest that the w+ gene controls copulation success in Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have investigated general properties of the genetic architecture of gene expression variation. Most of these used controlled crosses and it is unclear whether their findings extend to natural populations. Furthermore, systems biology has established that biological networks are buffered against large effect mutations, but there remains little data resolving this with natural variation of gene expression. Here we utilise RNA-Sequencing to assay gene expression in winter buds undergoing bud flush in a natural population of Populus tremula. We performed expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping and identified 164,290 significant eQTLs associating 6,241 unique genes (eGenes) with 147,419 unique SNPs (eSNPs). We found approximately four times as many local as distant eQTLs, which had significantly higher effect size. eQTLs were primarily located in regulatory regions of genes (UTRs or flanking regions), regardless of whether they were local or distant. We used the gene expression data to infer a co-expression network and investigated to what degree eQTLs could explain the structure of the network: eGenes were present in the core of 28 of 38 network modules, however, eGenes were overall underrepresented in cores and overrepresented in the periphery of the network, with a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and network connectivity. We also observed a negative correlation between eQTL effect size and allele frequency and found that core genes have experienced stronger selective constraint. Our integrated genetics and genomics results suggest that prevalent purifying selection is the primary mechanism underlying the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression in P. tremula and that highly connected network hubs are buffered against deleterious effects as a result of regulation by numerous eSNPs, each of minor effect.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNumerous studies have shown that many genomic polymorphisms contributing to phenotypic variation are located outside of protein coding regions, suggesting that they act by modulating gene expression. Furthermore, phenotypes are seldom explained by individual genes, but rather emerge from networks of interacting genes. The effect of regulatory variants and the interaction of genes can be described by co-expression networks, which are known to contain a small number of highly connected nodes and many more lowly connected nodes, making them robust to random mutation. While previous studies have examined the genetic architecture of gene expression variation, few were performed in natural populations with fewer still integrating the co-expression network.\\n\\nWe undertook a study using a natural population of European aspen (Populus tremula), showing that expression variance is substantially smaller among individuals than between tissues within the same individual, suggesting that stabilizing selection may act to restrict the scale of expression variation. We further show that highly connected genes within the co-expression network are associated with polymorphisms of lower than average effect size, suggesting purifying selection. These genes are therefore buffered against large expression modulation, providing a mechanistic explanation of how network robustness is created and maintained at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here, we provide cross-validated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial EEG recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (\\\"degenerate\\\") and is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to particularly affect the activity of resection regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes pre-seizure networks dynamics as a cascade of two sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation is commonly observed in nature: organisms perform well in their natal environment, but poorly outside it. Correlations between traits and latitude, or latitudinal clines, are among the most common pieces of evidence for local adaptation, but identifying the traits under selection and the selective agents is challenging. Here, we investigated a latitudinal cline in growth and photosynthesis across 16 populations of the perennial herb Erythranthe cardinalis (Phrymaceae). Using machine learning methods, we identify interannual variation in precipitation as a likely selective agent: Southern populations from more variable environments had higher photosynthetic rates and grew faster. We hypothesize that selection may favor a more annualized life history - grow now rather than save for next year - in environments where severe droughts occur more often. Thus our study provides insight into how species may adapt if Mediterranean climates become more variable due to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Organ development is driven by a set of patterned inductive signals. However, how these signals are integrated to coordinate tissue patterning is still poorly understood. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are critical signaling components involved in signal integration and are regulated by a core Ca2+ signaling toolkit. Ca2+ signaling encodes a significant fraction of information in cells through both amplitude and frequency-dependent regulation of transcription factors and key regulatory enzymes. A range of intercellular Ca2+ transients, including coordinated oscillations, recently have been reported in Drosophila wing discs. In an accompanying paper, we show that impaired Ca2+ signaling impacts the final size and shape of the wing. Here, we discover specific spatiotemporal signatures of Ca2+ transients during wing disc development. To do so, we developed a new neural-network-based approach for registration of oscillatory signals in organs that frequently move during imaging, and a pipeline for spatiotemporal analysis of intercellular Ca2+ oscillations. As a specific test case, we further demonstrated that the morphogen pathway, Hedgehog, controls frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations uniformly in the tissue and is required for spatial patterning of oscillation amplitudes. Thus, the time-averaged dynamics of spontaneous intercellular Ca2+ transients reflect the morphogenetic signaling state of the tissue during development. This suggests a general mechanism of physiological signaling that provides a memory of morphogenetic patterns. Additionally, our study provides a powerful approach for registering and quantifying oscillatory dynamics in developing organs.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal responses in visual cortex show a diversity of complex temporal properties. These properties include sub-additive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. Here, we hypothesize that these seemingly disparate effects can be explained by a single, shared computational mechanism. We propose a model consisting of a linear stage, followed by history-dependent gain control. The model accounts for these various temporal phenomena, tested against an unusually diverse set of measurements - intracranial electrodes in patients, fMRI, and macaque single unit spiking. The model further enables us to uncover a systematic and rich variety of temporal encoding strategies across visual cortex: First, temporal receptive field shape differs both across and within visual field maps. Second, later visual areas show more rapid and pronounced adaptation. Our study provides a new framework to understand the transformation between visual input and dynamical cortical responses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe nervous system extracts meaning from the distribution of light over space and time. Spatial vision has been a highly successful research area, and the spatial receptive field has served as a fundamental and unifying concept that spans perception, computation, and physiology. While there has also been a large interest in temporal vision, the temporal domain has lagged the spatial domain in terms of quantitative models of how signals are transformed across the visual hierarchy. Here we present a model of temporal dynamics of neuronal responses in human cerebral cortex. We show that the model can accurately predict responses at the millisecond scale using intracortical electrodes in patient volunteers, and that the same model generalizes to multiple types of other measurements, including functional MRI and action potentials from monkey cortex. Further, we show that a single model can account for a variety of temporal phenomena, including short-term adaptation and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. By developing a computational model and showing that it successfully generalizes across measurement types, cortical areas, and stimuli, we provide new insights into how time-varying images are encoded and transformed into dynamic cortical responses.",

    "abstract": "There is a long-standing experimental observation that the melting of topologically constrained DNA, such as circular-closed plasmids, is less abrupt than that of linear molecules. This finding points to an important role of topology in the physics of DNA denaturation, which is however poorly understood. Here, we shed light on this issue by combining large-scale Brownian Dynamics simulations with an analytically solvable phenomenological Landau mean field theory. We find that the competition between melting and supercoiling leads to phase coexistence of denatured and intact phases at the single molecule level. This coexistence occurs in a wide temperature range, thereby accounting for the broadening of the transition. Finally, our simulations show an intriguing topology-dependent scaling law governing the growth of denaturation bubbles in supercoiled plasmids, which can be understood within the proposed mean field theory.",

    "abstract": "Computational modeling has been applied to simulate the heterogeneity of cancer behavior. The development of Cervical Cancer (CC) is a process in which the cell acquires dynamic behavior among non-deleterious and deleterious mutations, exhibiting chromosomal alterations as a manifestation of this dynamic. To further determine the progression of chromosomal alterations in precursor lesions and CC, we introduce a computational model to study the dynamic of deleterious and non-deleterious mutations as an outcome of tumor progression. Analysis of chromosomal alterations mediated by our model reveals that multiple deleterious mutations are more frequent in precursor lesions than in CC. Cells with lethal deleterious mutations would be eliminated, which would mitigate cancer progression; on the other hand, cells with non-deleterious mutations would become dominant, which could predispose to cancer progression. The study of somatic alterations by computer simulations during cancer progression provides a feasible pathway for insights into the transformation of cell mechanisms in humans. During cancer progression, tumors may acquire new phenotype traits, such as the ability to invade and metastasize or to become clinically important when they develop drug resistance. Chromosomal alterations non deleterious contributes to this progression.",

    "abstract": "Proper neural circuit formation requires the precise regulation of neuronal migration, axon guidance and dendritic arborization. Mutations affecting the function of the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy that is frequently associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Despite its importance in brain development, the role for dystroglycan in regulating retinal development remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of dystroglycanopathy (ISPDL79*) and conditional dystroglycan mutants of both sexes, we show that dystroglycan is critical for the proper migration, axon guidance and dendritic stratification of neurons in the inner retina. Using genetic approaches, we show that dystroglycan functions in neuroepithelial cells as an extracellular scaffold to maintain the integrity of the retinal inner limiting membrane (ILM). Surprisingly, despite the profound disruptions in inner retinal circuit formation, spontaneous retinal activity is preserved. These results highlight the importance of dystroglycan in coordinating multiple aspects of retinal development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extracellular environment plays a critical role in coordinating neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth during neural circuit development. The transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan functions as a receptor for multiple extracellular matrix proteins, and its dysfunction leads to a form of muscular dystrophy frequently associated with neurodevelopmental defects. Our results demonstrate that dystroglycan is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) in the developing retina. In the absence of functional dystroglycan, ILM degeneration leads to defective migration, axon guidance and mosaic spacing of neurons, and a loss of multiple neuron types during retinal development. These results demonstrate that disorganization of retinal circuit development is a likely contributor to visual dysfunction in patients with dystroglycanopathy.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments and simulations have demonstrated that proteins can fold on the ribosome. However, the extent and generality of fitness effects resulting from co-translational folding remain open questions. Here we report a genome-wide analysis that uncovers evidence of evolutionary selection for co-translational folding. We describe a robust statistical approach to identify loci within genes that are both significantly enriched in slowly translated codons and evolutionarily conserved. Surprisingly, we find that domain boundaries can explain only a small fraction of these conserved loci. Instead, we propose that regions enriched in slowly translated codons are associated with co-translational folding intermediates, which may be smaller than a single domain. We show that the intermediates predicted by a native-centric model of co-translational folding account for the majority of these loci across more than 500 E. coli proteins. By making a direct connection to protein folding, this analysis provides strong evidence that many synonymous substitutions have been selected to optimize translation rates at specific locations within genes. More generally, our results indicate that kinetics, and not just thermodynamics, can significantly alter the efficiency of self-assembly in a biological context.",

Greater Antillean anoles have repeatedly evolved six similar forms or ecomorphs: crown-giant, grass-bush, twig, trunk, trunk-crown, and trunk-ground. Members of each ecomorph category possess a specific set of morphological, ecological and behavioural characteristics which have been acquired convergently. Here we test whether the semicircular canal system - the organ of balance - is also convergent among ecomorphs, reflecting the shared sensory requirements of their ecological niches. As semicircular canal shape has been shown to reflect different locomotor strategies, we hypothesised that each Anolis ecomorph would have a unique canal morphology. Using 3D semilandmarks and geometric morphometrics, semicircular canal shape was characterised in 41 Anolis species from the Greater Antilles and the relationship between canal shape and ecomorph grouping, phylogenetic history, size, and perch characteristics was assessed. Further, canal morphology of modern species was used to predict the ecomorph affinity of five fossil anoles from the Miocene of the Dominican Republic. Our study recovered ecomorph as the single-most important covariate of canal morphology in modern taxa; although phylogenetic history and size also showed a small, yet significant correlation with shape. Surprisingly, perch characteristics were not found to be significant covariates of canal shape, even though they are important habitat variables. Using posterior probabilities, we found that the fossil anoles have different semicircular canals shapes to modern ecomorph groupings implying extinct anoles may have been interacting with their Miocene environment in different ways to modern Anolis species.",

    "abstract": "Archaeal homologs of eukaryotic C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (C/D box sRNAs) guide precise 2'-O-methyl modification of ribosomal and transfer RNAs. Although C/D box sRNA genes constitute one of the largest RNA gene families in archaeal thermophiles, most genomes have incomplete sRNA gene annotation because reliable, fully automated detection methods are not available. We expanded and curated a comprehensive gene set across six species of the crenarchaeal genus Pyrobaculum, particularly rich in C/D box sRNA genes. Using high-throughput small RNA sequencing, specialized computational searches, and comparative genomics, we analyzed 526 Pyrobaculum C/D box sRNAs, organizing them into 110 families based on synteny and conservation of guide sequences which determine methylation targets. We examined gene duplications and rearrangements, including one family that has expanded in a pattern similar to retrotransposed repetitive elements in eukaryotes. New training data and inclusion of kink-turn secondary structural features enabled creation of an improved search model. Our analyses provide the most comprehensive, dynamic view of C/D box sRNA evolutionary history within a genus, in terms of modification function, feature plasticity, and gene mobility.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila type II neuroblasts produce numerous neurons and glia due to transiently amplifying, intermediate neural progenitors (INP). Consecutively born INPs produce morphologically distinct progeny, presumably due to temporal patterning in type II neuroblasts. We therefore profiled type II neuroblasts transcriptome across time. Our results reveal opposing temporal gradients of Imp and Syp RNA-binding proteins (descending and ascending, respectively). Maintaining Imp expression throughout brain development expands the number of neurons/glia with early temporal fate at the expense of cells with late fate. Conversely, precocious upregulation of Syp reduces the number of cells with early fate. Further, we reveal that the transcription factor, Seven-up initiates progression of the Imp/Syp gradients. Interestingly, genetic manipulations that fix Imp or Syp levels still yield progeny with a small range of early fates. We propose that the Seven-up-initiated Imp/Syp gradients create coarse temporal windows within type II neuroblasts to pattern INPs, which subsequently undergo fine-tuned subtemporal patterning.",

    "abstract": "EEG can be used to characterise functional networks using a variety of connectivity (FC) metrics. Unlike EEG source reconstruction, scalp analysis does not allow to make inferences about interacting regions, yet this latter approach has not been abandoned. Although the two approaches use different assumptions, conclusions drawn regarding the topology of the underlying networks should, ideally, not depend on the approach. The aim of the present work was to find an answer to the following questions: does scalp analysis provide a correct estimate of the network topology? how big are the distortions when using various pipelines in different experimental conditions? EEG recordings were analysed with amplitude- and phase-based metrics, founding a strong correlation for the global connectivity between scalp- and source-level. In contrast, network topology was only weakly correlated. The strongest correlations were obtained for MST leaf fraction, but only for FC metrics that limit the effects of volume conduction/signal leakage. These findings suggest that these effects alter the estimated EEG network organization, limiting the interpretation of results of scalp analysis. Finally, this study also suggests that the use of metrics that address the problem of zero lag correlations may give more reliable estimates of the underlying network topology.",

This study examined 1) the time courses of photosynthetic injury in cotton (Gossypium hirsutisms L.) leaves treated with methomyl [S-methyl-N-[(methyl carbamoyl)oxy]-thioacetimidate] and 2) the relationships between carbon exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter FX/FP, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase (rubisco) activity. Plots were sprayed with either 0 or 0.84 kg methomyl{middle dot}ha-1 when cotton was in mid-reproductive growth. Starting on the day of spraying, CER, stomatal conductance, FX/FP, and rubisco activity were measured daily for five consecutive days [4, 28, 52, 76 and 100 hours after spraying (HAS)]. In methomyl-treated leaves, CER decreased within hours after spraying, reached their lowest point at 28 HAS in experiment I and 76 HAS in experiment II, then recovered near-control levels by 100 HAS. At their lowest points, CER of methomyl-treated leaves decreased from 20 to 50% compared to controls. Stomatal conductance, FX/FP, and rubisco activity followed similar patterns to CER. Stomatal conductance was more closely related to CER than were FX/FP and rubisco activity. Chlorophyll fluorescence recovered more quickly than did CER. Rubisco activity did not decrease till after CER. From the parameters measured in this study, stomatal conductance appeared to be the major factor influencing methomyl-induced changes in CER, although all three parameters may be involved in the process of CER change.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Phytohormone biosynthesis produces metabolites with profound effects on plant growth and development. Modulation of hormone levels during developmental events, in response to the environment, by genetic polymorphism, or by chemical application can reveal the plant processes most responsive to a phytohormone. In many cases, chemical inhibitors are applied and the levels of specific phytohormones are measured to determine if, and which, phytohormone is affected by a molecule. In many cases, the sensitivity of biochemical testing has determined multiple pathways affected by a single inhibitor. Genetic studies are not subject to this problem, and a wealth of data about the morphological impacts of hormone biosynthetic inhibition has accumulated through the study of enzyme mutants. We previously identified a complex interplay between brassinosteroid (BR) and gibberellin (GA) in maize, where the interdependence of the two differs dependent on the developmental context. We found that: GA is required for loss of BR to induce retained pistils in the tassel florets (POPIT); BR is required for the loss of GA to induce tiller outgrowth; BR and GA are additive for plant height; BR has no effect on the induction of anther retention in ear florets of GA mutants. In this work, we sought to assess the specificity of three triazole inhibitors of cytochrome P450s by determining their abilities to recapitulate the phenotype of double mutants. The GA biosynthetic inhibitors uniconazole (UCZ) and paclobutrazol (PAC) were applied to the BR biosynthetic mutant na2 and all double mutant phenotypes were recovered in the UCZ treatment. PAC was unable to suppress the retention of pistils in the tassels of nana plant2 (na2) mutant plants. The BR biosynthetic inhibitor propiconazole (PCZ) suppressed tiller outgrowth in the GA biosynthetic mutant dwarf5 (d5). All treatments were additive with genetic mutants for effects on plant height. Due to additional measurements done here but not in previous studies of the double mutants, we detected new interactions between GA and BR biosynthesis affecting plastochron index and tassel branching. These experiments, a refinement of our previous model, and a discussion of the extension of this type of work are presented.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a genetic disorder in the first place. Therefore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) based discovery of somatically acquired genetic variants has gained widespread attention. Computational prediction of somatic variants, however, is affected by a variety of confounding factors. In addition to the uncertainties that one commonly encounters also in germline variation prediction, such as misplaced and/or inaccurate read alignments, cancer heterogeneity and impure samples significantly add to the issues. Overall, this hampers state-of-the-art indel discovery tools to discover somatic indels at operable performance rates, although they perform excellently when calling germline indels. While affecting all size ranges, both common and cancer-specific problems interfere in particularly unfavorable ways in the prediction of somatic midsize (30-150 bp) insertions and deletions.\\n\\nHere, we present a latent variable model that can take the major confounding factors and uncertainties into a unifying account. Using this modeling framework, we first demonstrate how to efficiently compute the probability for a (putative) indel to be somatic, thereby resolving a principled computational runtime bottleneck in Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Second, we show how to reliably estimate the allele frequencies for a given list of indels. Third, we also present an intuitive and effective way to control the false discovery rate, an issue in genetic variant discovery that has been found notoriously hard to deal with. As a tool that implements all methodology developed, we present PROSIC (PROcessing Somatic Indel Calls). PROSIC achieves significant improvements in particular in terms of recall when applied to deletion call sheets, as provided by prevalent state-of-the-art tools, in comparison to their integrated somatic indel calling routines.\\n\\nThe software is publicly available at https://prosic.github.io and can be easily installed via https://bioconda.github.io.",

Current cryo-EM model refinement procedures work with the experimental density map that remains constant throughout the process. Here, we introduce a general procedure that iteratively improves cryo-EM density maps based on prior knowledge of an atomic reference structure. The procedure optimizes contrast of cryo-EM densities by local amplitude scaling (LocScale) based on an atomic model without introducing model bias. We alternate the procedure with consecutive rounds of model refinement and tested it on four cryo-EM structures of TRPV1, {beta}-galactosidase, {gamma}-secretase and RNA polymerase III. We demonstrate that LocScale density improvement reveals previously undiscovered map features and improves the quality of atomic models. The presented approach enhances the interpretability of cryo-EM density maps and provides an implementation reminiscent of iterative density improvement as it is routinely employed in the refinement of X-ray crystallographic models.",

Here, we report that the same conditions result in secretion of another signal sequence lacking protein, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Similar to Acb1, SOD1 export requires Grh1 and a subset of ESCRT components. Importantly, our analysis reveals the existence of a conserved di-acidic motif (Asp-Glu) in SOD1 and Acb1 that is required for their respective export. This sequence is different from the di-acidic motif (Asp-X-Glu) necessary for export of transmembrane proteins from the ER. We propose that the Asp-Glu sequence acts as a targeting motif for the entry of SOD1 and Acb1, and likely many other proteins, upon nutrient starvation into a common albeit ER-Golgi independent pathway of secretion.",

Here we show that the hormone ecdysone is required to down-regulate Chinmo/Imp and activate Syncrip, plus two late neuroblast factors, Broad and E93. We show that Seven-up triggers Chinmo/Imp to Syncrip/Broad/E93 transition by inducing expression of the Ecdysone receptor in mid-larval neuroblasts, rendering them competent to respond to the systemic hormone ecdysone.

    "abstract": "A trophic radiation in the South-American annual killifish genus Austrolebias has led to the evolution of large specialized piscivores from small generalized carnivores. It has been proposed that this occurred in a single series of vicariant speciation events. An alternative hypothesis is denoted giant-dwarf speciation: piscivores would have evolved in sympatry by character displacement and cannibalism. We test the plausibility of both scenarios using size measures combined with distributional data and new phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers.\\n\\nOur analysis uses historical biogeography models and Ornstein-Uehlenbeck processes describing trait evolution across the posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees. Large species most likely evolved three times from small ones. For the clade containing A. elongatus, we argue that vicariance was not involved in the origin of these large and specialized piscivores. They experience stabilizing selection with an optimum shifted towards larger bodies and longer jaws. The branch leading to this clade has the fastest evolving jaw lengths across the phylogeny, in agreement with expectations for giant-dwarf speciation. For A. wolterstorffi, the support for giant-dwarf speciation is weaker. When the species is placed at the root of Austrolebias, ancestral reconstructions are unreliable and vicariance cannot be ruled out. For the remaining large species, we can reject vicariance and giant dwarf speciation. Our results give rise to two new additional scenarios for the evolution of specialized piscivores. In the first, two successive speciation events in sympatry or parapatry produced large and piscivorous species. In the second, the immigration of a different annual killifish genus (Cynopoecilus) in the Patos area of endemism has contributed to in-situ diversification of Austrolebias species.",

We find that initial genotype strongly affects adaptability and can alter the genetic basis of future evolution. Initial genotype also affects the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation for fitness in a different environment. This genetic variation in adaptability and pleiotropy is largely determined by initial fitness, according to a rule of declining adaptability with increasing initial fitness, but several individual QTLs also have a significant idiosyncratic role. Our results demonstrate that both adaptability and pleiotropy are complex traits, with extensive heritable differences arising from naturally occurring variation.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional silencing by heritable cytosine-5 methylation is an ancient strategy to repress transposable elements. It was previously thought that mammals possess four DNA methyltransferase paralogs--Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and Dnmt3l--that establish and maintain cytosine-5 methylation. Here we identify a fifth paralog, Dnmt3c, that is essential for retrotransposon methylation and repression in the mouse male germline. From a phenotype-based forward genetics screen, we isolated a mutant mouse called  rahu, which displays severe defects in double-strand-break repair and homologous chromosome synapsis during male meiosis, resulting in sterility. rahu is an allele of a transcription unit (Gm14490, renamed Dnmt3c) that was previously mis-annotated as a Dnmt3-family pseudogene. Dnmt3c encodes a cytosine methyltransferase homolog, and Dnmt3crahu mutants harbor a non-synonymous mutation of a conserved residue within one of its cytosine methyltransferase motifs, similar to a mutation in human DNMT3B observed in patients with immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial anomalies syndrome. The rahu mutation lies at a potential dimerization interface and near the potential DNA binding interface, suggesting that it compromises protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions required for normal DNMT3C function in vivo. Dnmt3crahu mutant males fail to establish normal methylation within LINE and LTR retrotransposon sequences in the germline and accumulate higher levels of transposon-derived transcripts and proteins, particularly from distinct L1 and ERVK retrotransposon families. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Dnmt3c arose during rodent evolution by tandem duplication of Dnmt3b, after the divergence of the Dipodoidea and Muroidea superfamilies. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics and functional specialization of the transposon suppression machinery critical for mammalian sexual reproduction and epigenetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "The developmental origins of human adults right hemispheric specialization for face perception remain unclear. On the one hand, infant studies have generally shown a right hemispheric advantage for face perception. On the other hand, the adult right hemispheric lateralization for face perception is thought to slowly emerge during childhood, due to reading acquisition, which increases left lateralized posterior responses to competing written material (i.e., visual letters and words). Since methodological approaches used in infant and children usually differ, resolving this issue has been difficult. Here we tested 5-year-old preschoolers varying in their level of visual letter knowledge with the same fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm leading to strongly right lateralized electrophysiological occipito-temporal face-selective responses in 4- to 6-month-old infants (de Heering & Rossion, 2015). Childrens face-selective response was much larger and more complex than in infants, but did not differ across hemispheres. However, there was a small positive correlation between preschoolers letter knowledge and their right hemispheric specialization for faces. These observations suggest that several factors contribute to the adult right hemispheric lateralization for faces, and point to the value of FPVS coupled with electroencephalography to assess specialized face perception processes throughout development with the same methodology.",

    "abstract": "How are neural circuits organized and tuned to achieve stable function and produce robust behavior? The organization process begins early in development and involves a diversity of mechanisms unique to this period. We summarize recent progress in theoretical neuroscience that has substantially contributed to our understanding of development at the single neuron, synaptic and network level. We go beyond classical models of topographic map formation, and focus on the generation of complex spatiotemporal activity patterns, their role in refinements of particular circuit features, and the emergence of functional computations. Aided by the development of novel quantitative methods for data analysis, theoretical and computational models have enabled us to test the adequacy of specific assumptions, explain experimental data and propose testable hypotheses. With the accumulation of larger data sets, theory and models will likely play an even more important role in understanding the development of neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Research on social influence has mainly focused on the target of influence (e.g. consumer, voter), while the cognitive and neurobiological underpinnings of the source of the influence (e.g. marketer, politician) remain unexplored. Here we show that advisers managed their influence over their client strategically, by modulating the confidence of their advice, depending on the interaction between advisers level of influence on the client (i.e., being ignored or chosen by the client), and relative merit (i.e., their accuracy in comparison with a rival). Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that these sources of social information were tracked in distinct regions of the brains social and valuation systems: relative merit in the medial-prefrontal cortex, and selection by client in the temporo-parietal junction. In addition, increased functional connectivity between these two regions during positive merit trials predicted their effect on behaviour. Both sources of social information modulated the activity in the ventral striatum. These results further our understanding of human interactions and provide a framework for investigating the neurobiology of how we try to influence others.",

High-throughput and systematic investigations into the multiplexed biological systems and disease conditions require simultaneous expression and coordinated functioning of multiple sgRNAs. However, current co-transfection based sgRNA co-expression systems remain poorly efficient and virus-based transfection approaches are relatively costly and labor intensive. Here we established a vector-independent method allowing multiple sgRNA expression cassettes to be assembled in series into a single plasmid. This synthetic biology-based strategy excels in its efficiency, controllability and scalability. Taking the flexibility advantage of this all-in-one sgRNA expressing system, we further explored its applications in single non-repetitive genomic locus imaging as well as coordinated gene regulation in live cells. With its strong potency, our method will greatly facilitate the understandings in genome structure, function and dynamics, and will contribute to the systemic investigations into complex physiological and pathological conditions.",

Structural studies have demonstrated the multi-domain architecture of Cas9 and sequential domain movements upon binding to the sgRNA and the target DNA. These studies also hinted at the flexibility between domains, but whether these flexible movements occur in solution is unclear. Here, we directly observed dynamic fluctuations of multiple Cas9 domains, using single-molecule FRET. The flexible domain movements allow Cas9 to adopt transient conformations beyond those captured in the crystal structures. Importantly, the HNH nuclease domain in Cas9 only accessed the DNA cleavage position during such flexible movements, suggesting the importance of this flexibility in the DNA cleavage process. Our FRET data also revealed the conformational flexibility of apo-Cas9, which may play a role in the assembly with the sgRNA. Collectively, our results highlight the potential role of domain fluctuations in driving Cas9-catalyzed DNA cleavage.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of cells to reversibly alter their phenotypes in response to signals, presents a significant clinical challenge to treating solid tumors. Tumor cells utilize phenotypic plasticity to evade therapies, metastasize, and colonize distant organs. As a result, phenotypic plasticity can accelerate tumor progression. A well-studied example of phenotypic plasticity is the bidirectional conversions among epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype(s). These conversions can alter a repertoire of cellular traits associated with multiple hallmarks of cancer, such as metabolism, immune-evasion, and invasion and metastasis. To tackle the complexity and heterogeneity of these transitions, mathematical models have been developed that seek to capture the experimentally-verified molecular mechanisms and act as   hypothesis-generating machines. Here, we discuss how these quantitative mathematical models have helped us explain existing experimental data, guided further experiments, and provided an improved conceptual framework for understanding how multiple intracellular and extracellular signals can drive epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity at both the single-cell and population levels. We also discuss the implications of this plasticity in driving multiple aggressive facets of tumor progression.",

Recently, it has been shown that high-throughput experimental measurements of mutational effects made via deep mutational scanning can inform site-specific phylogenetic substitution models of gene evolution. However, there is currently no software tailored for such analyses.\\n\\nResultsWe describe software that efficiently performs phylogenetic analyses with substitution models informed by deep mutational scanning. This software, phydms, is [~]100-fold faster than existing programs that accommodate such substitution models. It can be used to compare the results of deep mutational scanning experiments to the selection on genes in nature. For instance, phydms enables rigorous comparison of how well different experiments on the same gene describe natural selection. It also enables the re-scaling of deep mutational scanning data to account for differences in the stringency of selection in the lab and nature. Finally, phydms can identify sites that are evolving differently in nature than expected from experiments in the lab.\\n\\nConclusionsThe phydms software makes it easy to use phylogenetic substitution models informed by deep mutational scanning experiments. As data from such experiments becomes increasingly widespread, phydms will facilitate quantitative comparison of the experimental results to the actual selection pressures shaping evolution in nature.",

    "abstract": "Motivationk-mer-based algorithms have become increasingly popular in the processing of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. These algorithms span the gamut of the analysis pipeline from k-mer counting (e.g., for estimating assembly parameters), to error correction, genome and transcriptome assembly, and even transcript quantification. Yet, these tasks often use very different k-mer representations and data structures. In this paper, we set forth the fundamental operations for maintaining multisets of k-mers and classify existing systems from a data-structural perspective. We then show how to build a k-mer-counting and multiset-representation system using the counting quotient filter (CQF), a feature-rich approximate membership query (AMQ) data structure. We introduce the k-mer-counting/querying system Squeakr (Simple Quotient filter-based Exact and Approximate Kmer Representation), which is based on the CQF. This off-the-shelf data structure turns out to be an efficient (approximate or exact) representation for sets or multisets of k-mers.\\n\\nResultsSqueakr takes 2x-3;4.3x less time than the state-of-the-art to count and perform a random-point-query workload. Squeakr is memory-efficient, consuming 1.5X-4.3X less memory than the state-of-the-art. It offers competitive counting performance, and answers point queries (i.e. queries for the abundance of a particular k-mer) over an order-of-magnitude faster than other systems. The Squeakr representation of the k-mer multiset turns out to be immediately useful for downstream processing (e.g., de Bruijn graph traversal) because it supports fast queries and dynamic k-mer insertion, deletion, and modification.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/splatlab/squeakr\\n\\nContact ppandey@cs.stonybrook.edu",

    "abstract": "Spectraplakins are evolutionarily well conserved cytoskeletal linker molecules that are true members of three protein families: plakins, spectrins and Gas2-like proteins. Spectraplakin genes encode at least 7 characteristic functional domains which are combined in a modular fashion into multiple isoforms, and which are responsible for an enormous breadth of cellular functions. These functions are related to the regulation of actin, microtubules, intermediate filaments, intracellular organelles, cell adhesions and signalling processes during the development and maintenance of a wide variety of tissues. To gain a deeper understanding of this enormous functional diversity, invertebrate genetic model organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila, can be used to develop concepts and mechanistic paradigms that can inform the investigation in higher animals or humans. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of our current knowledge of the Drosophila spectraplakin Short stop (Shot). We describe its functional domains and isoforms and compare them with those of the mammalian spectraplakins dystonin and MACF1. We then summarise its roles during the development and maintenance of the nervous system, epithelia, oocytes and muscles, taking care to compare and contrast mechanistic insights across these functions in the fly, but especially also with related functions of dystonin and MACF1 in mostly mammalian contexts. We hope that this review will improve the wider appreciation of how work on Drosophila Shot can be used as an efficient strategy to promote the fundamental concepts and mechanisms that underpin spectraplakin functions, with important implications for biomedical research into human disease.",

Feelings are thought to be coordinated in the brain stem of animals and are evolutionarily ancient. One function of the brain is to prioritise between competing mental states, and thus groups of physiological functions and in turn behaviour. Anger, fear or pain call for immediate action whereas hunger, or thirst, signify longer term needs and a requirement for search. Plants use groups of coordinated physiological activities to deal with defined environmental situations but currently have no known mental state to prioritise any order of response. Plants do have a nervous system based on phloem which is highly cross linked. Its potential for forming a mental state is unknown but it could be used to distinguish between different and even contradictory signals and thus determine a priority of response. The vascular nervous system stretches throughout the whole plant providing the potential for assessment in all parts and commensurate with its self-organising, phenotypically plastic behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Proteome balance is safeguarded by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that evolved to maintain native function of the diverse ensemble of protein species, ensuring cellular and organismal health. Proteostasis imbalances and collapse are implicated in a spectrum of human diseases, from neurodegeneration to cancer. The characteristics of PN disease alterations however have not been assessed in a systematic way. Zooming in on the chaperome as a central PN component we turned to a curated functional ontology of the human chaperome that we connect in a high-confidence physical protein-protein interaction network. Challenged by the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations in the heterogeneous spectrum of human cancers, we assessed gene expression across more than 10,000 patient biopsies covering 22 solid cancers. We derived a novel customized Meta-PCA dimension reduction approach yielding M-scores as quantitative indicators of disease expression changes to condense the complexity of cancer transcriptomics datasets into quantitative functional network topographies. We confirm upregulation of the HSP90 family and also highlight HSP60s, Prefoldins, HSP100s, ER- and mitochondria-specific chaperones as pan-cancer enriched. Our analysis also reveals a surprisingly consistent strong downregulation of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and we stratify two cancer groups based on the preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones. Strikingly, our analysis highlight similarities between stem cell and cancer proteostasis, and diametrically opposed chaperome deregulation between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We developed a web-based Proteostasis Profiler tool (Pro2) enabling intuitive analysis and visual exploration of proteostasis disease alterations using gene expression data. Our study showcases a comprehensive profiling of chaperome shifts in human cancers and sets the stage for a systematic global analysis of PN alterations across the human diseasome towards novel hypotheses for therapeutic network re-adjustment in proteostasis disorders.",

Genes that are intolerant to inactivating variants in the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC) were depleted for SVs in parents, specifically within fetal-brain promoters, UTRs and exons. Rare paternally-inherited SVs that disrupt promoters or UTRs were over-transmitted to probands (P = 0.0013) and not to their typically-developing siblings. Recurrent functional noncoding deletions implicate the gene LEO1 in ASD. Protein-coding SVs were also associated with ASD (P = 0.0025).

    "abstract": "Planarian flatworms have an indefinite capacity to regenerate missing or damaged body parts owing to a population of pluripotent adult stems cells called neoblasts (NBs). Currently, little is known about the importance of the epigenetic status of NBs and how histone modifications regulate homeostasis and cellular differentiation. We have developed an improved and optimized ChIP-seq protocol for NBs in Schmidtea mediterranea and have generated genome-wide profiles for the active marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, and suppressive marks H3K4me1 and H3K27me3. The genome-wide profiles of these marks were found to correlate well with NB gene expression profiles. We found that genes with little transcriptional activity in the NB compartment but which switch on in post-mitotic progeny during differentiation are bivalent, being marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at promoter regions. In further support of this hypothesis bivalent genes also have a high level of paused RNA Polymerase II at the promoter-proximal region. Overall, this study confirms that epigenetic control is important for the maintenance of a NB transcriptional program and makes a case for bivalent promoters as a conserved feature of animal stem cells and not a vertebrate specific innovation. By establishing a robust ChIP-seq protocol and analysis methodology, we further promote planarians as a promising model system to investigate histone modification mediated regulation of stem cell function and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Animals show different behaviors that can consist of various spatially or temporally separated sub-reactions. Even less complex organisms, like ciliated larvae that display important behaviors (e.g. metamorphosis, defense, feeding), need to coordinate coherent sub-reactions with their simple nervous system. These behaviors can be triggered by neuropeptides, which are short signaling peptides. Despite the high diversity of neuropeptides in animals, and although their immunoreactivity is widely used in morphological studies of animal nervous systems (e.g. FMRFamide), their function and role in trochozoan larval behavior has so far only been tested in a few cases. When mechanically disturbed, the planktonic larvae of the brachiopod Terebratalia transversa protrude their stiff and pointy chaetae in a defensive manner and sink down slowly: a startle reaction that is known from different chaetous trochozoan larvae. We found that both of these reactions can be induced simultaneously by the FMRFamide-related neuropeptide FLRFamide. We deorphanized the Terebratalia FLRFamide receptor and found its expression spatially separated in the apical lobe at the prototroch of the larvae and in the trunk musculature, which correlates with the tissues that are responsible to perform the two sub-reactions. A behavioral assay showed a decreasing efficiency of modified peptides in triggering this behavior, which correlates with the decreasing efficiency of activating the FLRFamide receptor in transfected CHO-K1 cells. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization show FLRFamidergic neurons in the apical lobe as well as next to the trunk musculature. Our results show that the single neuropeptide FLRFamide can specifically induce the two coherent sub-reactions of the T. transversa startle behavior.",

    "abstract": "Annual dormancy-growth cycle is a developmental and physiological process essential for the survival of temperate and boreal forests. Seasonal control of shoot growth in woody perennials requires specific genetic programs integrated with the environmental signals. The environmental-controlled mechanisms that regulate the shift between winter dormancy to growth promoting genetic program are still unknown. Here, we show that dynamics in genomic DNA methylation (gDNA) levels regulate dormancy-growth cycle in poplar. We proved that the reactivation of cell division in the apical shoot that lead bud break process in spring, is preceded by a progressive reduction of gDNA methylation in apex tissue. We also identified that the induction in apex tissue of a chilling-dependent poplar DEMETER-LIKE 10 (PtaDML10) DNA demethylase precedes shoot growth reactivation. Transgenic poplars showing down-regulation of PtaDML8/10 caused delayed bud break. Genome wide transcriptome and methylome analysis and data mining revealed the gene targets of active DML-dependent DNA demethylation genetically associated to bud break. These data point to a chilling dependent-DEMETER-like DNA demethylase controlling the genetic shift from winter dormancy to a condition that promotes shoot apical vegetative growth in poplar.",

This paper delineates the architecture of the application, and includes results of a five-part evaluation we conducted. Researchers and developers can use the existing codebase as a foundation from which to generate their own annotation tabs when analyzing and annotating posters.\\n\\nAvailabilityAlpha EXPLANe software is available as an open source application at https://github.com/ngopal/EXPLANe\\n\\nContactSean D.

This cost may limit the efficacy of selection and thus reduce genetic gains in breeding programs for these species. Understanding when and how deleterious mutations accumulate can also provide insight into fundamental questions about the interplay of demography and selection. Here we describe the evolutionary processes that may contribute to deleterious variation accrued during domestication and improvement, and review the available evidence for  the cost of domestication in animal and plant genomes. We identify gaps and explore opportunities in this emerging field, and finally offer suggestions for researchers and breeders interested in understanding or avoiding the consequences of an increased number or frequency of deleterious variants in domesticated species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalaria was eliminated from Southern and Southeastern Brazil over 50 years ago. However, an increasing number of autochthonous episodes attributed to Plasmodium vivax have been recently reported in the Atlantic forest region of Rio de Janeiro State. As P. vivax-like non-human primate malaria parasite species Plasmodium simium is locally enzootic, we performed a molecular epidemiological investigation in order to determine whether zoonotic malaria transmission is occurring.\\n\\nMethodsBlood samples of humans presenting signs and/or symptoms suggestive of malaria as well as from local howler-monkeys were examined by microscopy and PCR. Additionally, a molecular assay based on sequencing of the parasite mitochondrial genome was developed to distinguish between P. vivax and P. simium, and applied to 33 cases from outbreaks occurred in 2015 and 2016.\\n\\nResultsOf 28 samples for which the assay was successfully performed, all were shown to be P. simium, indicating the zoonotic transmission of this species to humans in this region. Sequencing of the whole mitochondrial genome of three of these cases showed that P. simium is most closely related to P. vivax parasites from South American.\\n\\nFindingsThe explored malaria outbreaks were caused by P. simium, previously considered a monkey-specific malaria parasite, related to but distinct from P. vivax, and which has never conclusively been shown to infect humans before.\\n\\nInterpretationThis unequivocal demonstration of zoonotic transmission, 50 years after the only previous report of P. simium in man, leads to the possibility that this parasite has always infected humans in this region, but that it has been consistently misdiagnosed as P. vivax due to a lack of molecular typing techniques. Thorough screening of the local non-human primate and anophelines is required to evaluate the extent of this newly recognized zoonotic threat to public health and malaria eradication in Brazil.\\n\\nFundingFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Rio de Janeiro (Faperj), The Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), JSPS Grant-in-Aid for scientific research, Secretary for Health Surveillance (SVS) of the Ministry of Health, Global Fund, and PRONEX Program of the CNPq.",

    "abstract": "Abscission is a process in plants for shedding unwanted organs such as leaves, flowers, fruits, or floral organs. Shedding of leaves in the fall is the most visually obvious display of abscission in nature. The very shape plants take is forged by the processes of growth and abscission. Mankind manipulates abscission in modern agriculture to do things like prevent pre-harvest fruit drop prior to mechanical harvesting in fruit orchards. Abscission occurs specifically at abscission zones that are laid down as the organ that will one day abscise is developed. A sophisticated signaling network initiates abscission when it is time to shed the unwanted organ. In this article, we review recent advances in understanding the signaling mechanisms that activate abscission. Physiological advances and roles for hormones in abscission are also addressed. Finally, we discuss current avenues for basic abscission research and potentially lucrative future directions for its application to modern agriculture.",

While existing methods are powerful, none allow quantitative library-on-library characterization of PPIs in a modifiable extracellular environment. Here, we show that sexual agglutination of S. cerevisiae can be reprogrammed to link PPI strength with mating efficiency using yeast synthetic agglutination (YSA). Validation of YSA with 96 previously characterized interactions shows a strong log-linear relationship between mating efficiency and PPI strength for interactions with KDs ranging from 500 pM to 25 M. Using induced chromosomal translocation to pair barcodes representing interacting proteins, thousands of distinct interactions can be screened in a single pot. YSA binding interactions occur in a controllable extracellular environment, and thus studying the effects of environmental factors on PPI networks is possible. YSA enables the high-throughput, quantitative characterization of PPI networks in a fully defined extracellular environment at a library-on-library scale.",
