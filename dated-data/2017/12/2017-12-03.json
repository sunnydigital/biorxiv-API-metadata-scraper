    "abstract": "In gravity below Earth normal, a person should be able to take higher leaps in running. We asked ten subjects to run on a treadmill in five levels of simulated reduced gravity and optically tracked center of mass kinematics. Subjects consistently reduced ballistic height compared to running in normal gravity. We explain this trend by considering the vertical takeoff velocity (defined as maximum vertical velocity). Energetically optimal gaits should balance energetic costs of ground-contact collisions (favouring lower takeoff velocity), and step frequency penalties such as leg swing work (favouring higher takeoff velocity, but less so in reduced gravity). Measured vertical takeoff velocity scaled with the square root of gravitational acceleration, following energetic optimality predictions and explaining why ballistic height decreases in lower gravity. The success of work-based costs in predicting this behaviour challenges the notion that gait adaptation in reduced gravity results from an unloading of the stance phase. Only the relationship between takeoff velocity and swing cost changes in reduced gravity; the energetic cost of the down-to-up transition for a given vertical takeoff velocity does not change with gravity. Because lower gravity allows an elongated swing phase for a given takeoff velocity, the motor control system can relax the vertical momentum change in the stance phase, so reducing ballistic height, without great energetic penalty to leg swing work. While it may seem counterintuitive, using less \\\"bouncy\\\" gaits in reduced gravity is a strategy to reduce energetic costs, to which humans seem extremely sensitive.\\n\\nSummary StatementDuring running, humans take higher leaps in normal gravity than in reduced gravity, in order to optimally balance the competing costs of stance and leg-swing work.",

    "abstract": "Oocyte meiotic maturation is a critical process for sexually reproducing animals, and its core cytoplasmic regulators are highly conserved between species. In contrast, the few known Maturation Inducing Hormones (MIHs) that act on oocytes to initiate this process have highly variable molecular natures. Using the hydrozoan jellyfish species Clytia and Cladonema, which undergo oocyte maturation in response to dark-light and light-dark transitions respectively, we deduced from gonad transcriptome data amidated tetrapeptide sequences and found that synthetic peptides could induce maturation of isolated oocytes at nanomolar concentrations. Antibody preabsorption experiments conclusively demonstrated that these W/RPRPamide-related neuropeptides account for endogenous MIH activity produced by isolated gonads. We further showed that the MIH peptides are synthesised by neural-type cells in the gonad, are released following dark-light / light-dark transitions, and probably act on the oocyte surface. They are produced by male as well as female jellyfish and can trigger both sperm and egg release, suggesting a role in spawning coordination. We propose an evolutionary link between hydrozoan MIH and the neuropeptide hormones that regulate reproduction upstream of MIH in bilaterian species.",

    "abstract": "Across the animal kingdom, environmental light cues are widely involved in regulating gamete release, but the molecular and cellular bases of the photoresponsive mechanisms are poorly understood. In hydrozoan jellyfish, spawning is triggered by dark-light or light-dark transitions acting on the gonad, and is mediated by oocyte maturation-inducing neuropeptide hormones (MIHs) released from the ectoderm. We determined in Clytia hemisphaerica that blue-cyan light triggers spawning in isolated gonads. A candidate opsin (Opsin9) was found co-expressed with MIH within specialised ectodermal cells. Opsin9 knockout jellyfish generated by CRISPR/Cas9 failed to undergo oocyte maturation and spawning, a phenotype reversible by synthetic MIH. Gamete maturation and release in Clytia is thus regulated by gonadal photosensory-neurosecretory cells that secrete MIH in response to light via Opsin9. Similar cells in ancestral eumetazoans may have allowed tissue-level photo-regulation of diverse behaviours, a feature elaborated in cnidarians in parallel with expansion of the opsin gene family.",

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation is the most effective treatment for promoting the recovery of motor deficits after stroke. Despite its importance, the processes associated with rehabilitative intervention are poorly understood. One of the most challenging experimental goals is to unambiguously link specific circuit changes induced by rehabilitation to improved behavior. Here, we investigate which facets of cortical remodeling are induced by rehabilitation by combining optical imaging and manipulation tools in a mouse model of stroke. We demonstrate the progressive restoration of cortical motor maps and of cortical activity in parallel with the reinforcement of inter-hemispheric connectivity after rehabilitation. Furthermore, we reveal that the increase in vascular density goes along with the stabilization of peri-infarct neural circuitry at synaptic level. The present work provides the first evidences that rehabilitation is sufficient to promote the combined recovery of distinct structural and functional features distinctive of healthy neuronal networks.",

    "abstract": "In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neurons receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. While the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacologically manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVisual neurons are selective for specific stimulus features in a region of visual space known as the receptive field, but can be modulated by stimuli outside of the receptive field. The SSN model has been proposed to account for these and other modulatory influences, and tested in V1. As this model is not specific to any particular stimulus feature or brain region, we wondered whether similar modulatory influences might be observed for other stimulus dimensions and other regions. We tested for specific patterns of modulatory influences in the domain of motion direction, using electrophysiological recordings from MT. Our data confirm the predictions of the SSN in MT, suggesting that the SSN computations might be a generic feature of sensory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Procedural memories, such as for riding a bicycle, can be maintained without practice for long periods of time and are thought to be supported by the persistent reorganization of sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1). Whereas enhanced synaptic strength and structural changes accompany the learning of motor tasks, the persistent molecular modifications that store long-term procedural memories within specific layers of sensorimotor cortex have not been identified. The persistent increase in the autonomously active, atypical PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is a putative molecular mechanism for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength during long-term potentiation (LTP) and several forms of long-term memory. Here we examine whether persistent increases in PKM{zeta} store long-term memory for a reaching task in rat sensorimotor cortex that could reveal the sites of procedural memory storage. Perturbing PKM{zeta} synthesis with PKM{zeta} -antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or blocking atypical PKC activity with zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) in S1/M1 disrupts and erases the maintenance of long-term motor memories. Only memories that are maintained without daily reinforcement are affected, indicating atypical PKCs (via ZIP) and PKM{zeta} specifically (via antisense) stores consolidated long-term procedural memories. Analysis of changes in the amount of PKM{zeta} in S1/M1 reveals PKM{zeta} increases in layers II/III and V of both S1 and M1 cortices as performance improves to an asymptote during training. After storage for 1 month without reinforcement, the increase in M1 layer V but not other layers persists without decrement. Thus, the sustained increases in PKM{zeta} reveal that the persistent molecular changes storing long-term procedural memory are localized to the descending output layer of primary motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "Excitation-inhibition (EI) balance controls excitability, dynamic range, and input gating in many brain circuits. Subsets of synaptic input can be selected or  gated by precise modulation of finely tuned EI balance, but assessing the granularity of EI balance requires combinatorial analysis of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Using patterned optogenetic stimulation of hippocampal CA3 neurons, we show that hundreds of unique CA3 input combinations recruit excitation and inhibition with a nearly identical ratio, demonstrating precise EI balance at the hippocampus. Crucially, the delay between excitation and inhibition decreases as excitatory input increases from a few synapses to tens of synapses. This creates a dynamic millisecond-range window for postsynaptic excitation, controlling membrane depolarization amplitude and timing via subthreshold divisive normalization. We suggest that this combination of precise EI balance and dynamic EI delays forms a general mechanism for millisecond-range input gating and subthreshold gain control in feedforward networks.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining an intact tumor environment is critical for quantitation of receptor-ligand engagement in a targeted drug development pipeline. However, measuring receptor-ligand engagement in vivo and non-invasively in preclinical settings is extremely challenging. We found that quantitation of intracellular receptor-ligand binding can be achieved using whole-body macroscopic lifetime-based Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging in intact, live animals bearing tumor xenografts. We determined that FRET levels report on ligand binding to transferrin receptors conversely to raw fluorescence intensity. We then established that FRET levels in heterogeneous tumors correlate with intracellular ligand binding but strikingly, not with ubiquitously used ex vivo receptor expression assessment. Hence, MFLI-FRET provides a direct measurement of systemic delivery, target availability and intracellular drug delivery in intact animals. Here, we have used MFLI to measure FRET longitudinally in intact animals for the first time. MFLI-FRET is well-suited for guiding the development of targeted drug therapy in heterogeneous intact, live small animals.",

We conducted phylogenomic analyses that incorporate deeply sequenced transcriptomes from representatives of collodictyonids (diphylleids), rigifilids, Mantamonas and ancyromonads (planomonads). Analyses of 351 genes, using site-heterogeneous mixture models, strongly support a novel supergroup-level clade that includes collodictyonids, rigifilids and Mantamonas, which we name  CRuMs. Further, they robustly place CRuMs as the closest branch to Amorphea (including animals and fungi). Ancyromonads are strongly inferred to be more distantly related to Amorphea than are CRuMs. They emerge either as sister to malawimonads, or as a separate deeper branch. CRuMs and ancyromonads represent two distinct major groups that branch deeply on the lineage that includes animals, near the most commonly inferred root of the eukaryote tree. This makes both groups crucial in examinations of the deepest-level history of extant eukaryotes.",

RNase E formed clusters along the central axis of the cell, while weak clusters of ribosomal protein L1 were deployed throughout the cytoplasm. These results contrast with RNase E and ribosome distribution in E. coli, where RNase E co-localizes with the cytoplasmic membrane and ribosomes accumulate in polar nucleoid-free zones. For both RNase E and ribosomes in Caulobacter, we observed a decrease in confinement and clustering upon transcription inhibition and subsequent depletion of nascent RNA, suggesting that RNA substrate availability for processing, degradation, and translation facilitates confinement and clustering. Moreover, RNase E cluster positions correlate with the subcellular location of chromosomal loci of two highly transcribed ribosomal RNA genes, suggesting that RNase Es function in ribosomal RNA processing occurs at the site of rRNA synthesis. Thus, components of the RNA degradosome and ribosome assembly are spatiotemporally organized in Caulobacter, with chromosomal readout serving as the template for this organization.",

    "abstract": "Correct wiring in the neocortex requires that responses to an individual guidance cue vary among neurons in the same location, and within the same neuron over time. Nestin is an atypical intermediate filament expressed highly in neural progenitors and is thus used widely as a progenitor marker. Here we show a subpopulation of embryonic cortical neurons which transiently express nestin in their axons. Nestin expression is thus not restricted to neural progenitors but persists at lower levels in some newborn neurons for 2-3 days. We found that nestin-expressing neurons have smaller growth cones, suggesting that nestin affects cytoskeletal dynamics. Nestin, unlike other intermediate filament subtypes, regulates cdk5 kinase. Cdk5 activity is induced by the repulsive guidance cue Sema3a leading to growth cone collapse in vitro. Therefore, we tested whether nestin-expressing neurons showed altered responses to Sema3a. We find that nestin-expressing newborn neurons are more sensitive to Sema3a in a roscovitine-sensitive manner, whereas nestin knockdown results in lowered sensitivity to Sema3a. We propose that nestin functions in immature neurons to modulate cdk5 and thereby the Sema3a response. Thus, the transient expression of nestin could allow for temporal modulation of a neuron's response to Sema3a particularly during early axon guidance decisions.",

    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide is a volatile and broad signal of many organic processes, and serves as a convenient cue for insects in search of blood hosts1-6, flowers7, decaying matter8-11, communal nests12, fruit13, and wildfires14. Curiously, although Drosophila melanogaster feed on yeast that produce CO2 and ethanol during fermentation, laboratory experiments suggest that flies actively avoid CO215-25. Here, we resolve this paradox by showing that both flying and walking fruit flies do actually find CO2 attractive, but only when they are in an active state associated with foraging. Aversion at low activity levels may be an adaptation to avoid CO2-seeking-parasites, or succumbing to respiratory acidosis in the presence of high concentrations of CO2 that are occasionally found in nature26,27. In contrast to CO2, flies are attracted to ethanol in all behavioral states, and invest twice as much time searching near ethanol compared to CO2. These behavioral differences reflect the fact that whereas CO2 is a generated by many natural processes, ethanol is a unique signature of yeast fermentation. Using genetic tools, we determined that the evolutionarily ancient ionotropic co-receptor IR25a is required for both CO2 and ethanol attraction, and that the receptors previously identified for CO2 avoidance are not involved. Our study lays the foundation for future research to determine the neural circuits underlying both state- and odorant-dependent decision making in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an important class of natural products that include many antibiotics and a variety of other bioactive compounds. While recent breakthroughs in RiPP discovery raised the challenge of developing new algorithms for their analysis, peptidogenomic-based identification of RiPPs by combining genome/metagenome mining with analysis of tandem mass spectra remains an open problem. We present here MetaRiPPquest, a software tool for addressing this challenge that is compatible with large-scale screening platforms for natural product discovery. After searching millions of spectra in the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure against just six genomic and metagenomic datasets, MetaRiPPquest identified 27 known and discovered 5 novel RiPP natural products.",

    "abstract": "Kinases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in the regulation of critical cellular pathways and have been implicated in several cancers. Consequently, the kinetics and thermodynamics of prototypical kinases are of interest and have been the subject of numerous experimental studies. In-silico modeling of the conformational ensembles of these enzymes, on the other hand, is lacking due to inherent computational limitations. Recent algorithmic advances combined with homology modeling and parallel simulations allow us to address this computational sampling bottleneck. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics (MD) studies for seven Src family kinase (SFK) members Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Yes, and Blk. We present a sequence invariant extension to Markov state models (MSMs), which allows us to quantitatively compare the structural ensembles of the seven kinases. Our findings indicate that in the absence of their regulatory partners, SFK members have similar in-silico dynamics with active state populations ranging from 4-40% and activation timescales in the hundreds of microseconds. Furthermore, we observe several potentially druggable intermediate states, including a pocket next to the ATP binding site that could be potentially targeted via a small molecule inhibitors. These results establish the utility of MSMs for studying protein families.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDWith the onset of next generation sequencing technologies, we have made great progress in identifying recurrent mutational drivers of cancer. As cancer tissues are now frequently screened for specific sets of mutations, a large amount of samples has become available for analysis. Classification of patients with similar mutation profiles may help identifying subgroups of patients who might benefit from specific types of treatment. However, classification based on somatic mutations is challenging due to the sparseness and heterogeneity of the data.\\n\\nMETHODSHere, we describe a new method to de-sparsify somatic mutation data using biological pathways. We applied this method to 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, including samples from 5, 805 primary tumors.\\n\\nRESULTSWe show that, for most cancer types, de-sparsified mutation data associates with phenotypic data. We identify poor prognostic subtypes in three cancer types, which are associated with mutations in signal transduction pathways for which targeted treatment options are available. We identify subtype-drug associations for 14 additional subtypes. Finally, we perform a pan-cancer subtyping analysis and identify nine pan-cancer subtypes, which associate with mutations in four overarching sets of biological pathways.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThis study is an important step towards understanding mutational patterns in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide Association Study has presented a promising way to understand the association between human genomes and complex traits. Many simple polymorphic loci have been shown to explain a significant fraction of phenotypic variability. However, challenges remain in the non-triviality of explaining complex traits associated with multifactorial genetic loci, especially considering the confounding factors caused by population structure, family structure, and cryptic relatedness. In this paper, we propose a Squared-LMM (LMM2) model, aiming to jointly correct population and genetic confounding factors. We offer two strategies of utilizing LMM2 for association mapping: 1) It serves as an extension of univariate LMM, which could effectively correct population structure, but consider each SNP in isolation. 2) It is integrated with the multivariate regression model to discover association relationship between complex traits and multifactorial genetic loci. We refer to this second model as sparse Squared-LMM (sLMM2). Further, we extend LMM2/sLMM2 by raising the power of our squared model to the LMMn/sLMMn model. We demonstrate the practical use of our model with synthetic phenotypic variants generated from genetic loci of Arabidopsis Thaliana. The experiment shows that our method achieves a more accurate and significant prediction on the association relationship between traits and loci. We also evaluate our models on collected phenotypes and genotypes with the number of candidate genes that the models could discover. The results suggest the potential and promising usage of our method in genome-wide association studies.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental and important challenge in modern datasets of ever increasing dimensionality is variable selection, which has taken on renewed interest recently due to the growth of biological and medical datasets with complex, non-i.i.d. structures. Naively applying classical variable selection methods such as the Lasso to such datasets may lead to a large number of false discoveries. Motivated by genome-wide association studies in genetics, we study the problem of variable selection for datasets arising from multiple subpopulations, when this underlying population structure is unknown to the researcher. We propose a unified framework for sparse variable selection that adaptively corrects for population structure via a low-rank linear mixed model. Most importantly, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of sample structure in the data and adaptively selects a covariance structure of the correct complexity. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of this framework over existing methods. Further, we test our method on three different genomic datasets from plants, mice, and human, and discuss the knowledge we discover with our method.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in cognitive function have been shown to correlate with brain-wide functional connectivity, suggesting a common foundation relating connectivity to cognitive function across healthy populations. However, it remains unknown whether this relationship is preserved in cognitive deficits seen in a range of psychiatric disorders. Using machine learning methods, we built a prediction model of working memory function from whole-brain functional connectivity among a healthy population (N = 17, age 19-24 years). We applied this normative model to a series of independently collected resting state functional connectivity datasets (N = 968), involving multiple psychiatric diagnoses, sites, ages (18-65 years), and ethnicities. We found that predicted working memory ability was correlated with actually measured working memory performance in both schizophrenia patients (partial correlation,{rho} = 0.25, P = 0.033, N = 58) and a healthy population (partial correlation,{rho} = 0.11, P = 0.0072, N = 474). Moreover, the model predicted diagnosis-specific severity of working memory impairments in schizophrenia (N = 58, with 60 controls), major depressive disorder (N = 77, with 63 controls), obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 46, with 50 controls), and autism spectrum disorder (N = 69, with 71 controls) with effect sizes g = -0.68, -0.29, -0.19, and 0.09, respectively. According to the model, each diagnosiss working memory impairment resulted from the accumulation of distinct functional connectivity differences that characterizes each diagnosis, including both diagnosis-specific and diagnosis-invariant functional connectivity differences. Severe working memory impairment in schizophrenia was related not only with fronto-parietal, but also widespread network changes. Autism spectrum disorder showed greater negative connectivity that related to improved working memory function, suggesting that some non-normative functional connections can be behaviorally advantageous. Our results suggest that the relationship between brain connectivity and working memory function in healthy populations can be generalized across multiple psychiatric diagnoses. This approach may shed new light on behavioral variances in psychiatric disease and suggests that whole-brain functional connectivity can provide an individual quantitative behavioral profile in a range of psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota comprises a dynamic ecological system that contributes significantly to human health and disease. The ecological forces that govern community assembly and stability in the gut microbiota remain unresolved. We developed a generalizable model-guided framework to predict higher-order consortia from time-resolved measurements of lower-order assemblages. This method was employed to decipher microbial interactions in a diverse 12-member human gut microbiome synthetic community. We show that microbial growth parameters and pairwise interactions are the major drivers of multi-species community dynamics, as opposed to context-dependent (conditional) interactions. The inferred microbial interaction network as well as a top-down approach to community assembly pinpointed both ecological driver and responsive species that were significantly modulated by microbial inter-relationships. Our model demonstrated that negative pairwise interactions could generate history-dependent responses of initial species proportions on physiological timescales that frequently does not originate from bistability. The model elucidated a topology for robust coexistence in pairwise assemblages consisting of a negative feedback loop that balances disparities in monospecies fitness levels. Bayesian statistical methods were used to evaluate the constraint of model parameters by the experimental data. Measurements of extracellular metabolites illuminated the metabolic capabilities of monospecies and potential molecular basis for competitive and cooperative interactions in the community. However, these data failed to predict influential organisms shaping community assembly. In sum, these methods defined the ecological roles of key species shaping community assembly and illuminated network design principles of microbial communities.",

The nonHDLC was calculated with TC minus HDLC. Correlation between TG, TC, nonHDLC, and LDLC were analyzed using Spearmans rank approach. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive of TG, TC and nonHDLC for the normal LDLC level(less than 130mg/dL).\\n\\nResultsBoth TC(r = 0.870) and nonHDLC (r = 0.893) were significantly positively correlated with LDLC.

The model converges an order of magnitude faster compared to existing methods whilst achieving similar levels of estimation accuracy. Further, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by extending the model to higher-dimensional latent spaces that can be used to simultaneously infer pseudotime and other structure such as branching.

    "abstract": "Freshwater recreational fisheries constitute complex adaptive social-ecological systems (SES) where mobile anglers link spatially structured ecosystems. We present a general social-ecological model of a spatial recreational fishery for northern pike (Esox lucius) that included an empirically measured mechanistic utility model driving angler behaviors. We studied emergent properties at the macro-scale (e.g., region) as a result of local-scale fish-angler interactions, while systematically examining key heterogeneities (at the angler and ecosystem level) and sources of uncertainty. We offer three key insights. First, the angler population size and the resulting latent reginal angling effort exerts a much greater impact on the overall regional-level overfishing outcome than any residential pattern (urban or rural), while the residential patterns strongly affects the location of local overfishing pockets. Second, simplifying a heterogeneous angler population to a homogenous one representing the preference and behaviours of an average angler risks severely underestimating landscape-level effort and regional overfishing. Third, we did not find that ecologically more productive lakes were more systematically overexploited than lower-productive lakes. We conclude that understanding regional-level outcomes depends on considering four key ingredients: regional angler population size, the angler population composition, the specific residential pattern in place and spatial ecological variation. Simplification of any of these may obscure important dynamics and render the system prone to collapse.",

    "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate on the contribution of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 to the onset of compulsive behaviors. Here we use behavioral, electrophysiological, molecular and viral approaches in male and female mice to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which EAAC1 controls the execution of repeated motor behaviors. Our findings show that in the striatum, a brain region implicated with movement execution, EAAC1 limits group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluRI) activation, facilitates D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) expression and ensures long-term synaptic plasticity. Blocking mGluRI in slices from mice lacking EAAC1 restores D1R expression and synaptic plasticity. Conversely, activation of intracellular signaling pathways coupled to mGluRI in D1R-expressing striatal neurons of mice expressing EAAC1 leads to reduced D1R expression and increased stereotyped movement execution. These findings identify new molecular mechanisms by which EAAC1 can shape glutamatergic and dopaminergic signals and control repeated movement execution.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGenetic studies implicate Slc1a1, a gene encoding the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). EAAC1 is abundantly expressed in the striatum, a brain region that is hyperactive in OCD. What remains unknown is how EAAC1 shapes synaptic function in the striatum. Our findings show that EAAC1 limits activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRI) in the striatum and, by doing so, it promotes D1R expression. Targeted activation of signaling cascades coupled to mGluRI in mice expressing EAAC1 reduces D1R expression and triggers repeated motor behaviors in mice. These findings provide new information on the molecular basis of OCD and suggest new avenues for its treatment.",

Trial-to-trial timing of changes in subthalamic neuronal activity, relative to cue onset versus production onset, revealed that locking to cue presentation was associated more with units that decreased firing rate, while locking to speech onset was associated more with units that increased firing rate. These uniquely acquired data indicate that subthalamic activity is dynamic during the production of speech, reflecting temporally-dependent inhibition and excitation of separate populations of subthalamic neurons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReward-based decision-making is impaired in patients with schizophrenia (PSZ) as reflected by increased choice switching. The underlying cognitive and motivational processes as well as associated neural signatures remain unknown. Reinforcement Learning (RL) and hierarchical Bayesian learning account for choice switching in different ways. We hypothesized that enhanced choice switching, as seen in PSZ during reward-based decision-making, relates to higher-order beliefs about environmental volatility and examined the associated neural activity.\\n\\nMethods46 medicated PSZ and 43 healthy controls (HC) performed a reward-based decision-making task requiring flexible responses to changing action-outcome contingencies during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Detailed computational modeling of choice data was performed, including RL and the hierarchical Gaussian filter (HGF). Trajectories of learning from computational modeling informed the analysis of fMRI data.\\n\\nResultsA three-level HGF accounted best for the observed choice data. This model revealed a heightened initial belief about environmental volatility and a stronger influence of volatility on lower-level learning of action-outcome contingencies in PSZ as compared to HC. This was replicated in an independent sample of non-medicated PSZ. Beliefs about environmental volatility were reflected by higher activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of PSZ as compared to HC.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study suggests that PSZ inferred the environment as overly volatile, which may explain increased choice switching. In PSZ, activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more strongly related to beliefs about environmental volatility. Our computational phenotyping approach may provide useful information to dissect clinical heterogeneity and could improve prediction of outcome.",

Furthermore, there continues to be strong annotation bias in the GO annotations where 58% of the annotations are for 16% of the human genes.

    "abstract": "Background: Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows large-scale screening of gene essentiality in cancer. A confounding factor when interpreting CRISPR-Cas9 screens is the high false-positive rate in detecting essential genes within copy number amplified regions of the genome. We have developed the computational tool CRISPRcleanR which is capable of identifying and correcting gene-independent responses to CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. CRISPRcleanR uses an unsupervised approach based on the segmentation of single-guide RNA fold change values across the genome, without making any assumption about the copy number status of the targeted genes.\\n\\nResults Applying our method to existing and newly generated genome-wide essentiality profiles from 15 cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that CRISPRcleanR reduces false positives when calling essential genes, correcting biases within and outside of amplified regions, while maintaining true positive rates. Established cancer dependencies and essentiality signals of amplified cancer driver genes are detectable post-correction. CRISPRcleanR reports sgRNA fold changes and normalised read counts, is therefore compatible with downstream analysis tools, and works with multiple sgRNA libraries.\\n\\nConclusions CRISPRcleanR is a versatile open-source tool for the analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify essential genes.",

This results in the clonal model used to explain cancer evolution. Some recent results gives a strong evidence that recurrent and back mutations are present in the evolutionary history of tumors [5,21], thus showing that more general models then the Perfect Phylogeny are required. We propose a new approach that incorporates the possibility of losing a previously acquired mutation, extending the Persistent Phylogeny model [1].\\n\\nWe exploit our model to provide an ILP formulation of the problem of reconstructing trees on mixed populations, where the input data consists of the fraction of cells in a set of samples that have a certain mutation. This is a fundamental problem in cancer genomics, where the goal is to study the evolutionary history of a tumor. An experimental analysis shows the usefulness of allowing mutation losses, by studying some real and simulated datasets where our ILP approach provides a better interpretation than the one obtained under perfect phylogeny assumption.

Using data from lymphoblastoid cell lines, TF2Exp models achieved suitable performance for 3,060 genes. Alterations within DNase I hypersensitive, CTCF-bound, and tissue-specific TF-bound regions were the greatest contributors to the models. Our cis-regulatory variant-based TF2Exp models performed as well as the state-of-the-art SNP-based models, both in cross-validation and external validation.

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein coding genes can be studied using long-read next generation sequencing. However, high rates of indel sequencing errors are problematic, corrupting the reading frame. Even the consensus of multiple independent sequence reads retains indel errors. To solve this problem, we introduce RIFRAF, a sequence consensus algorithm that takes a set of error-prone reads and a reference sequence and infers an accurate in-frame consensus. RIFRAF uses a novel structure, analogous to a two-layer hidden Markov model: the consensus is optimized to maximize alignment scores with both the set of noisy reads and with a reference. The template-to-reads component of the model encodes the preponderance of indels, and is sensitive to the per-base quality scores, giving greater weight to more accurate bases. The reference-to-template component of the model penalizes frame-destroying indels. A local search algorithm proceeds in stages to find the best consensus sequence for both objectives.\\n\\nResultsUsing Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequences of NL4-3 env, we compare our approach to other consensus and frame correction methods. RIFRAF consistently finds a consensus sequence that is more accurate and in-frame, especially with small numbers of reads. It was able to perfectly reconstruct over 80% of consensus sequences from as few as three reads, whereas the best alternative required twice as many. RIFRAF is able to achieve these results and keep the consensus in-frame even with a distantly related reference sequence. Moreover, unlike other frame correction methods, RIFRAF can detect and keep true indels while removing erroneous ones.\\n\\nAvailabilityRIFRAF is implemented in Julia, and source code is publicly available at https://github.com/MurrellGroup/Rifraf.jl\\n\\nContactbmurrell@ucsd.edu",

    "abstract": "This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of CLC-2 \"fast\" (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLUex. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLUex away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLUex results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low ([~]1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLUex rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population ([~]1%), is only accessible when GLUex is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLUex protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the brain, the roles and mechanisms of sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-selective ion channels are well established. In contrast, chloride-selective channels have been studied much less and are not sufficiently understood, despite known associations of chloride-channel defects with brain disorders. The most broadly expressed voltage-activated chloride channel in the brain is CLC-2 (one of 9 human CLC homologs). In this work, we use simulations to model the conformational dynamics of the CLC-2 chloride ion channel selectivity filter (SF), which is the part of the protein that controls whether the channel is in an ion-conducting or non-conducting state. Our analysis identifies four primary conformational states and a specific progression through these states. Our results are consistent with structural and functional data in the literature and provide a high-resolution model for guiding further studies of CLC-2. These results will inform our understanding of how CLC-2 governs electrical activity and ion homeostasis in the brain.",

    "abstract": "In malignant transformation, cellular stress response pathways are dynamically mobilized to counterbalance oncogenic activity, keeping cancer cells viable. Therapeutic disruption of this riskily balanced homeostasis might change the outcome of many human cancers, particularly those for which no effective therapy is available. Here, we report the use of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) to demonstrate that further mitogenic activation disrupts cellular homeostasis and strongly sensitizes cancer cells to stress-targeted therapeutic inhibitors. We show that FGF2 enhanced replication and proteotoxic stresses in a K-Ras-driven murine cancer cell model, and combinations of FGF2 and proteasome or DNA damage response-checkpoint inhibitors triggered cell death. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated K-Ras depletion suppressed the malignant phenotype and prevented these synergic toxicities in these murine cells. Moreover, in a panel of human Ewings sarcoma family tumor cells, sub-lethal concentrations of bortezomib (proteasome-inhibitor) or VE-821 (ATR-inhibitor) induced cell death when combined with FGF2. Sustained MAPK-ERK1/2 overactivation induced by FGF2 underlies these synthetic lethalities, once late pharmacological inhibition of this pathway restored cell homeostasis and prevented these described synergies. Our results highlight how mitotic signaling pathways frequently overridden in malignant transformation might be exploited to disrupt the risky robustness of cancer cells, ultimately sensitizing them to stress-targeted therapies. This approach provides a new therapeutic rationale for human cancers, with important implications for tumors still lacking effective treatment, and for those that frequently relapse after available therapies.",

The model correctly predicted the outcome of competition in 71% of the pairwise experiments.

ProteomeVis interactively creates protein chain graphs, where edges between nodes represent structure and sequence similarities within user-defined ranges, to study the long time scale effects of protein structure evolution. The short time scale effects of protein sequence evolution is studied by sequence evolutionary rate (ER) correlation analyses with protein properties that span from the molecular to the organismal level.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate the utility and versatility of ProteomeVis by investigating the distribution of edges per node in organismal protein chain universe graphs (oPCUGs) and putative ER determinants. S. cerevisiae and E. coli oPCUGs are scale-free with scaling constants of 1.78 and 1.50, respectively. Both scaling constants can be explained by a previously reported theoretical model describing protein structure evolution (Dokholyan et al., 2002).

    "abstract": "The core diagnostic criteria for autism comprise two symptom domains - social and communication difficulties, and unusually repetitive and restricted behaviour, interests and activities. There is some evidence to suggest that these two domains are dissociable, yet, this hypothesis has not been tested using molecular genetics. We test this using a GWAS of a non-social autistic trait, systemizing (N = 51,564), defined as the drive to analyse and build systems. We demonstrate that systemizing is heritable and genetically correlated with autism. In contrast, we do not identify significant genetic correlations between social autistic traits and systemizing. Supporting this, polygenic scores for systemizing are significantly positively associated with restricted and repetitive behaviour but not with social difficulties in autistic individuals. These findings strongly suggest that the two core domains of autism are genetically dissociable, and point at how to fractionate the genetics of autism.",

    "abstract": "Macropinocytosis is a conserved endocytic process used by Dictyostelium amoebae for feeding on liquid medium. To further Dictyostelium as a model for macropinocytosis, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay for macropinocytosis, and used it to identify inhibitors and investigate the physiological regulation of macropinocytosis. Dictyostelium has two feeding states: phagocytic and macropinocytic. When cells are switched from phagocytic growth on bacteria to liquid media, the rate of macropinocytosis slowly increases, due to increased size and frequency of macropinosomes. Upregulation is triggered by a minimal medium of 3 amino acids plus glucose and likely depends on macropinocytosis itself. Bacteria suppress macropinocytosis while their product, folate, partially suppresses upregulation of macropinocytosis. Starvation, which initiates development, does not of itself suppress macropinocytosis: this can continue in isolated cells, but is shut down by a conditioned-medium factor or activation of PKA signalling. Thus macropinocytosis is a facultative ability of Dictyostelium cells, regulated by environmental conditions that are identified here.\\n\\nSummaryA high-throughput flow cytometry assay shows that macropinocytosis in D. discoideum is upregulated in the presence of nutrients and absence of bacteria. Development and bacteria induce cells to downregulate macropinocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Affective decoding is the inference of human emotional states using brain signal measurements. This approach is crucial to develop new therapeutic approaches for psychiatric rehabilitation, such as affective neurofeedback protocols. To reduce the training duration and optimize the clinical outputs, an ideal clinical neurofeedback could be trained using data from an independent group of volunteers before being used by new patients. Here, we investigated if this subject-independent design of affective decoding can be achieved using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals from frontal and occipital areas. For this purpose, a linear discriminant analysis classifier was first trained in a dataset (49 participants, 24.65{+/-}3.23 years) and then tested in a completely independent one (20 participants, 24.00{+/-}3.92 years). Significant balanced accuracies between classes were found for positive vs. negative (64.50 {+/-} 12.03%, p<0.01) and negative vs. neutral (68.25 {+/-} 12.97%, p<0.01) affective states discrimination during a reactive block consisting in viewing affective-loaded images. For an active block, in which volunteers were instructed to recollect personal affective experiences, significant accuracy was found for positive vs. neutral affect classification (71.25 {+/-} 18.02%, p<0.01). In this last case, only three fNIRS channels were enough to discriminate between neutral and positive affective states. Although more research is needed, for example focusing on better combinations of features and classifiers, our results highlight fNIRS as a possible technique for subject-independent affective decoding, reaching significant classification accuracies of emotional states using only a few but biologically relevant features.",

    "abstract": "To faithfully encode complex stimuli, sensory neurons should correct, via adaptation, for stimulus properties that corrupt pattern recognition. Here, we investigate sound intensity adaptation in the Drosophila auditory system, which is largely devoted to processing courtship song. Mechanosensory neurons (JONs) in the antenna are sensitive not only to sound-induced antennal vibrations, but also to wind or gravity, which affect the antennas mean position. Song pattern recognition therefore requires adaptation to antennal position (stimulus mean) in addition to sound intensity (stimulus variance). We discover fast variance adaptation in Drosophila JONs, which corrects for background noise over the behaviorally relevant intensity range. We determine where mean and variance adaptation arises and how they interact. A computational model explains our results using a sequence of subtractive and divisive adaptation modules, interleaved by rectification. These results lay the foundation for identifying the molecular and biophysical implementation of adaptation to the statistics of natural sensory stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Strigolactones (SLs) are an important class of carotenoid-derived signalling molecule in plants, which function both as exogenous signals in the rhizosphere, and as endogenous plant hormones. In flowering plants, SLs are synthesized by a core pathway of four enzymes, and are perceived by the DWARF14 (D14) receptor, leading to degradation of SMAX1-LIKE7 (SMXL7) target proteins in a manner dependent on the SCFMAX2 ubiquitin ligase. The evolutionary history of SLs is poorly understood, and it is not clear whether SL synthesis and signalling are present in all land plant lineages, nor when these traits evolved. We have utilized recently-generated genomic and transcriptomic sequences from across the land plant clade to resolve the origin of each known component of SL synthesis and signalling. We show that all enzymes in the core SL synthesis pathway originated at or before the base of land plants, consistent with the previously observed distribution of SLs themselves in land plant lineages. We also show that the late-acting enzyme LATERAL BRANCHING OXIDOREDUCTASE (LBO) is considerably more ancient than previously thought. We perform a detailed phylogenetic analysis of SMXL proteins, and show that specific SL target proteins only arose in flowering plants. We also assess diversity and protein structure in the SMXL family, identifying several previously unknown clades. Overall, our results suggest that SL synthesis is much more ancient than canonical SL signalling, consistent with the idea that SLs first evolved as rhizosphere signals, and were only recruited much later as hormonal signals.",

    "abstract": "The cochlea not only transduces sound-induced vibration into neural spikes, it also amplifies weak sound to boost its detection. Actuators of this active process are sensory outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, whereas the inner hair cells transduce the resulting motion into electric signals that propagate via the auditory nerve to the brain. However, how the outer hair cells modulate the stimulus to the inner hair cells remains unclear. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and experimental measurements near the cochlear apex to study the way in which length changes of the outer hair cells deform the organ of Corti. We develop a geometry-based kinematic model of the apical organ of Corti that reproduces salient, yet counter-intuitive features of the organs motion. Our analysis further uncovers a mechanism by which a static length change of the outer hair cells can sensitively tune the signal transmitted to the sensory inner hair cells. When the outer hair cells are in an elongated state, stimulation of inner hair cells is largely inhibited, whereas outer hair cell contraction leads to a substantial enhancement of sound-evoked motion near the hair bundles. This novel mechanism for regulating the sensitivity of the hearing organ applies to the low frequencies that are most important for the perception of speech and music. We suggest that the proposed mechanism might underlie frequency discrimination at low auditory frequencies, as well as our ability to selectively attend auditory signals in noisy surroundings.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOuter hair cells are highly specialized force producers inside the inner ear: they can change length when stimulated electrically. However, how exactly this electromotile effect contributes to the astonishing sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the inner ear has remained unclear. Here we show for the first time that static length changes of outer hair cells can sensitively regulate how much of a sound signal is passed on to the inner hair cells that forward the signal to the brain. Our analysis holds for the apical region of the inner ear that is responsible for detecting the low frequencies that matter most in speech and music. This shows a mechanisms for how frequency-selectivity can be achieved at low frequencies. It also opens a path for the efferent neural system to regulate hearing sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons Disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by alterations in the huntingtin gene (htt). Transcriptional dysregulation is an early event in HD progression. Protein acetylation and methylation particularly on histones regulates chromatin structure thereby preventing or facilitating transcription. Although protein acetylation has been found to affect HD symptoms, little is known about the potential role of protein methylation in HD pathology. In recent years, a series of proteins have been described that are responsible for methylating and demethylating histones as well as other proteins. We carried out systematic genetic interaction studies testing lysine and arginine methylases and demethylases in a Drosophila melanogaster HD model. We found that modulating methylation enzymes that typically affect histone positions H3K4, H3K36 or H3K79 had varying effects on HD pathology while modulating ones that typically affect constitutive heterochromatin marks at H3K9 and H4K20 generally had limited impact on HD pathology. In contrast, modulating enzymes acting on the facultative heterochromatin mark at H3K27 had specific effects on HD pathology, with reduction of the demethylase Utx rescuing HTT induced pathology while reducing PRC2 complex core methylase components led to more aggressive pathology. Further exploration of the mechanism underlying the methylation-specific interactions suggest that these lysine and arginine methylases and demethylases are likely exerting their influence through non-histone targets. These results highlight a novel therapeutic approach for HD in the form of Utx inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Formation of A{beta} plaques from peptide oligomers and development of neurofibrillary tangles from hyperphosphorylated tau are hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD). These markers of AD severity are further associated with impaired glucose metabolism. However, the exact role of glucose metabolism on disease progression has not been elucidated. In this study, the effects of glucose on A{beta} and tau-mediated toxicity are investigated using a C. elegans model system. We find that addition of glucose or 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DOG) to the growth medium delayed A{beta}-associated paralysis, though it was unable to restore previously impaired acetylcholine neurotransmission in pre-existing A{beta}-mediated pathology. Glucose also inhibited egg laying and hatching in the worms that express A{beta}. The harmful effects of glucose were associated with an increase in toxic A{beta} oligomers. Increased phosphorylation of tau is associated with formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and increased severity of AD, but O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation can inhibit phosphorylation of adjacent phosphorylation sites. We reasoned that high glucose levels might induce tau O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation, thereby protecting against tau phosphorylation. Contrary to our expectation, glucose increased tau phosphorylation but not O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation. Increasing O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation, either with Thiamet-G (TMG) or by suppressing the O-GlcNAcase (oga-1) gene does interfere with and therefore reduce tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, reducing O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation by suppressing O-GlcNAc transferase (ogt-1) gene causes an increase in tau phosphorylation. These results suggest that protective O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation is not induced by glucose. Instead, as with vertebrates, we demonstrate that high levels of glucose exacerbate disease progression by promoting A{beta} aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation, resulting in disease symptoms of increased severity. The effects of glucose cannot be effectively managed by manipulating O-{beta}-GlcNAcylation in the tau models of AD in C. elegans. Our observations suggest that glucose enrichment is unlikely to be an appropriate therapy to minimize AD progression.",
