    "abstract": "Human behavior and cognition result from a complex pattern of interactions between brain regions. The flexible reconfiguration of these patterns enables behavioral adaptation, such as the acquisition of a new motor skill. Yet, the degree to which these reconfigurations depend on the brains baseline sensorimotor integration is far from understood. Here, we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in sensorimotor networks at baseline were predictive of individual differences in future learning. We analyzed functional MRI data from 19 participants prior to six weeks of training on a new motor skill. We found that visual-motor connectivity was inversely related to learning rate: sensorimotor autonomy at baseline corresponded to faster learning in the future. Using three additional scans, we found that visual-motor connectivity at baseline is a relatively stable individual trait. These results suggest that individual differences in motor skill learning can be predicted from sensorimotor autonomy at baseline prior to task execution.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISensorimotor autonomy at rest predicts faster motor learning in the future.\\nC_LIO_LIConnection between calcarine and superior precentral sulci form strongest predictor.\\nC_LIO_LISensorimotor autonomy is a relatively stable individual trait.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "FGIN-1-27 is an agonist at the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a cholesterol transporter that is associated with neurosteroidogenesis. This protein has been identified as a peripheral binding site for benzodiazepines; in anamniotes, however, a second TSPO isoform that is absent in amniotes has been implicated in erythropoiesis. Functional conservation of the central benzodiazepine-binding site located in the GABAA receptors has been demonstrated in anamniotes and amniotes alike; however, it was not previously demonstrated for TSPO. The present investigation explored the behavioral effects of FGIN-1-27 on an anxiety test in zebrafish (Danio rerio, Family: Cyprinide) and on a mixed anxiety/panic test on wall lizards (Tropidurus oreadicus, Family: Tropiduridae). Results showed that FGIN-1-27 reduced anxiety-like behavior in the zebrafish light/dark preference test similar to diazepam, but with fewer sedative effects. Similarly, FGIN-1-27 also reduced anxiety- and fear-like behaviors in the defense test battery in wall lizards, again producing fewer sedative-like effects than diazepam; the benzodiazepine was also unable to reduce fear-like behaviors in this species. These results A) underline the functional conservation of TSPO in defensive behavior in anamniotes; B) strengthen the proposal of using anamniote behavior as models in behavioral pharmacology; and C) suggest TSPO/neurosteroidogenesis as a target in treating anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Executive function (EF) is a regulatory construct of learning and general cognitive abilities. Genetic variations underlying the architecture of cognitive phenotypes are likely to affect EF and associated behaviors. Mice lacking one of Ntng gene paralogs, encoding the vertebrate brain-specific presynaptic Netrin-G proteins, exhibit prominent deficits in the EF control. Brain areas responsible for gating the bottom-up and top-down information flows differentially express Ntng1 and Ntng2, distinguishing neuronal circuits involved in perception and cognition. As a result, high and low cognitive demand tasks (HCD and LCD, respectively) modulate Ntng1 and Ntng2 associations either with attention and impulsivity (AI) or working memory (WM), in a complementary manner. During the LCD Ntng2supported neuronal gating of AI and WM dominates over the Ntng1-associated circuits. This is reversed during the HCD, when the EF requires a larger contribution of cognitive control, supported by Ntng1, over the Ntng2 pathways. Since human NTNG orthologs have been reported to affect human IQ (1), and an array of neurological disorders (2), we believe that mouse Ntng gene paralogs serve an analogous role but influencing brain executive functioning.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is thought to impact evolutionary trajectories by shifting trait values in a direction that is either favored by natural selection (\\\"adaptive plasticity\\\") or disfavored (\\\"nonadaptive\\\" plasticity). However, it is unclear how commonly each of these types of plasticity occurs in natural populations. To answer this question, we measured glucosinolate defensive chemistry and reproductive fitness in over 1,500 individuals of the wild perennial mustard Boechera stricta, planted in four common gardens across central Idaho, USA. Glucosinolate profiles--including total glucosinolate quantity as well as the relative abundances and overall diversity of different compounds--were strongly plastic both among habitats and within habitats. Patterns of glucosinolate plasticity varied greatly among genotypes. More often than expected by chance, glucosinolate profiles shifted in a direction that matched the direction of natural selection, indicating that plasticity among habitats tended to increase relative fitness. In contrast, we found no evidence for within-habitat selection on glucosinolate reaction norm slopes (i.e., plasticity along a continuous environmental gradient). Together, our results indicate that glucosinolate plasticity may improve the ability of B. stricta populations to persist after migration to new habitats.",

As proof of principle, we use our miniring approach to establish organoids of high-grade serous tumors and one carcinosarcoma of the ovaries and screen hundreds of protein kinase compounds currently FDA-approved or in clinical development.

    "abstract": "Growing concerns about the quality of aggregated biodiversity data are lowering trust in large-scale data networks. Aggregators frequently respond to quality concerns by recommending that biologists work with original data providers to correct errors \\\"at the source\\\". We show that this strategy falls systematically short of a full diagnosis of the underlying causes of distrust. In particular, trust in an aggregator is not just a feature of the data signal quality provided by the sources to the aggregator, but also a consequence of the social design of the aggregation process and the resulting power balance between individual data contributors and aggregators. The latter have created an accountability gap by downplaying the authorship and significance of the taxonomic hierarchies - frequently called \\\"backbones\\\" - they generate, and which are in effect novel classification theories that operate at the core of data-structuring process. The Darwin Core standard for sharing occurrence records plays an under-appreciated role in maintaining the accountability gap, because this standard lacks the syntactic structure needed to preserve the taxonomic coherence of data packages submitted for aggregation, potentially leading to inferences that no individual source would support. Since high-quality data packages can mirror competing and conflicting classifications, i.e., unsettled systematic research, this plurality must be accommodated in the design of biodiversity data integration. Looking forward, a key directive is to develop new technical pathways and social incentives for experts to contribute directly to the validation of taxonomically coherent data packages as part of a greater, trustworthy aggregation process.",

In this study, EEG equipment was adapted for use and transportation in a backpack while cycling. Participants performed an auditory oddball task while cycling outside and sitting in an isolated chamber inside the lab. Cycling increased EEG noise and marginally diminished alpha amplitude. However, this increased noise did not influence the ability to measure reliable event related potentials (ERP). The P3 was similar in topography, and morphology when outside on the bike, with a lower amplitude in the outside cycling condition. There was only a minor decrease in the statistical power to measure reliable ERP effects. Unexpectedly, when biking outside significantly decreased P2 and increased N1 amplitude were observed when evoked by both standards and targets compared with sitting in the lab. This may be due to attentional processes filtering the overlapping sounds between the tones used and similar environmental frequencies. This study established methods for mobile recording of ERP signals. Future directions include investigating auditory P2 filtering inside the laboratory.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIA backpack containing all the equipment necessary to record ERP and EEG was worn by participants as they rode a bicycle outside along a street\\nC_LIO_LIEEG and ERP data from an auditory oddball task is compared with data acquired within-subject inside the lab\\nC_LIO_LIReliable MMN/N2b and P3 responses were measured during bicycle riding outside equal in magnitude to those obtained inside the lab\\nC_LIO_LIA surprising decrease in the P2 component of the ERP evoked by targets and standards was observed when doing the task outside on a bicycle, which we attribute to increased auditory filtering\\nC_LI",

Our simulation showed that experienced individuals can benefit from relying mostly on the opinions of seemingly similar people; inexperienced individuals, in contrast, cannot reliably estimate similarity and are better off picking the mainstream option despite differences in taste. Crucially, the level of experience beyond which people should switch to similarity-heavy strategies varies substantially across individuals and depends on (i) how mainstream (or alternative) an individuals tastes are and (ii) the level of dispersion in taste similarity with the other people in the group.",

This ratio may be under the dynamic control of neuromodulatory systems, which are in turn implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, the catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and noradrenergic) and cholinergic systems have highly specific effects on excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, which might translate into changes in the local net E/I ratio. Here, we assessed and compared their net effects on net E/I ratio in human cortex, through an integrated application of computational modeling, placebo-controlled pharmacological intervention, magnetoencephalographic recordings of cortical activity dynamics, and perceptual psychophysics. We found that catecholamines, but not acetylcholine, altered both the temporal structure of intrinsic activity fluctuations in visual and parietal cortex, and the volatility of perceptual inference based on ambiguous visual input. Both effects indicate that catecholamines increase the net E/I ratio in visual and parietal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Error detection in motor behavior is a fundamental cognitive function heavily relying on cortical information processing. Neural activity in the high-gamma frequency band (HGB) closely reflects such local cortical processing, but little is known about its role in error processing, particularly in the healthy human brain. Here we characterize the error-related response of the human brain based on data obtained with noninvasive EEG optimized for HGB mapping in 31 healthy subjects (15 females, 16 males), and additional intracranial EEG data from 9 epilepsy patients (4 females, 5 males). Our findings reveal a comprehensive picture of the global and local dynamics of error-related HGB activity in the human brain. On the global level as reflected in the noninvasive EEG, the error-related response started with an early component dominated by anterior brain regions, followed by a shift to parietal regions, and a subsequent phase characterized by sustained parietal HGB activity. This phase lasted for more than 1 s after the error onset. On the local level reflected in the intracranial EEG, a cascade of both transient and sustained error-related responses involved an even more extended network, spanning beyond frontal and parietal regions to the insula and the hippocampus. HGB mapping appeared especially well suited to investigate late, sustained components of the error response, possibly linked to downstream functional stages such as error-related learning and behavioral adaptation. Our findings establish the basic spatio-temporal properties of HGB activity as a neural correlate of error processing, complementing traditional error-related potential studies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThere is great interest to understand how the human brain reacts to errors in goal-directed behavior. An important index of cortical and subcortical information processing is fast oscillatory brain activity, particularly in the high-gamma band (above 50 Hz). Here we show that it is possible to detect signatures of errors in event-related high-gamma responses with noninvasive techniques, characterize these responses comprehensively, and validate the EEG procedure for the detection of such signals. In addition, we demonstrate the added value of intracranial recordings pinpointing the fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns in error-related brain networks. We anticipate that the optimized noninvasive EEG techniques as described here will be helpful in many areas of cognitive neuroscience where fast oscillatory brain activity is of interest.",

    "abstract": "Higher cognition may require the globally coordinated integration of specialized brain regions into functional networks. A collection of structural cortical hubs - referred to as the rich club - has been hypothesized to support task-specific functional integration. In the present paper, we use a whole-cortex model to estimate directed interactions between 68 cortical regions from fMRI activity for four different tasks (reflecting different cognitive domains) and resting state. We analyze the state-dependent input and output effective connectivity of the structural rich club and relate these to whole-cortex dynamics and network reconfigurations. We find that the cortical rich club exhibits an increase in outgoing effective connectivity during task performance as compared to rest while incoming connectivity remains constant. Increased outgoing connectivity targets a sparse set of peripheral regions with specific regions strongly overlapping between tasks. At the same time, community detection analyses reveal massive reorganizations of interactions among peripheral regions, including those serving as target of increased rich club output. This suggests that while peripheral regions may play a role in several tasks, their concrete interplay might nonetheless be task-specific. Furthermore, we observe that whole-cortex dynamics are faster during task as compared to rest. The decoupling effects usually accompanying faster dynamics appear to be counteracted by the increased rich club outgoing effective connectivity. Together our findings speak to a gating mechanism of the rich club that supports fast-paced information exchange among relevant peripheral regions in a task-specific and goal-directed fashion, while constantly listening to the whole network.",

Besides the effects of sleep depth we investigated how sleep-specific EEG patterns (i.e. sleep spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]) relate to stimulus processing. Using 256-channel EEG we studied processing of auditory stimuli by means of event-related oscillatory responses (de-/ synchronisation, ERD/ERS) and potentials (ERPs) in N = 17 healthy sleepers. We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (SON vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic emotional relevance (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice, FV/UFV). Results reveal that evaluation of voice familiarity continues during all NREM sleep stages and even REM sleep suggesting a  sentinel processing mode of the human brain in the absence of wake-like consciousness. Especially UFV stimuli elicit larger responses in a 1-15 Hz range suggesting they continue being salient. Beyond this, we find that sleep spindles and the negative slope of SOs attenuate information processing. However, unlike previously suggested they do not uniformly inhibit information processing, but inhibition seems to be scaled to stimulus salience.\\n\\nFundingCB is supported by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V. and CB, MW and DPJH are supported by a grant from the Austrian Science Fund FWF (Y-777).

    "abstract": "Diversified smallholder agriculture is the main human land-use affecting the western Amazon, home to the worlds richest terrestrial biota, but the scant available data to date have suggested that the biodiversity impacts of this land-use are small. Here, we present comprehensive surveys of birds and trees in primary forest and smallholder agricultural mosaics in northern Peru. These surveys reveal substantial biodiversity losses that have been overlooked by other studies. Avian biodiversity losses arise primarily from biotic homogenization across infrequently surveyed forest habitats (a loss of beta-diversity). Furthermore, tree species richness declines much more steeply than bird richness. Statistical modeling of local habitat features that allow forest-associated species to persist in the smallholder mosaic strongly suggests that our results represent a best-case scenario for Amazonian agricultural biodiversity. We conclude that previous assessments of the biodiversity value of Amazonian smallholder agriculture have been overly optimistic because they are restricted to upland habitat, thereby missing losses in beta diversity; do not evaluate trees; and/or rely on generalizations from less speciose areas of the Neotropics, where habitat specialization amongst species is less prevalent. Smallholder agriculture will likely expand in western Amazonia due to infrastructure development, and it must be seen as a serious threat to the regions biodiversity.",

The total flux across the membranes were shown to average 3.86 liters/m2h (LMH). The presence of ethanol increased the relative rate of water transport across the membrane.

    "abstract": "The transport of proteins across or into membranes is a vital biological process, achieved in every cell by the conserved Sec machinery. In bacteria, SecYEG combines with the SecA motor protein for secretion of pre-proteins across the plasma membrane, powered by ATP hydrolysis and the trans-membrane proton-motive-force (PMF). The activities of SecYEG and SecA are modulated by membrane lipids, particularly by cardiolipin, a specialised phospholipid known to associate with a range of energy-transducing machines. Here, we identify two specific cardiolipin binding sites on the Thermotoga maritima SecA-SecYEG complex, through application of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We validate the computational data and demonstrate the conserved nature of the binding sites using in vitro mutagenesis, native mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis of Escherichia coli SecYEG. The results show that the two sites account for the preponderance of functional cardiolipin binding to SecYEG, and mediate its roles in ATPase and protein transport activity. In addition, we demonstrate an important role for cardiolipin in the conferral of PMF-stimulation of protein transport. The apparent transient nature of the CL interaction might facilitate proton exchange with the Sec machinery and thereby stimulate protein transport, by an as yet unknown mechanism. This study demonstrates the power of coupling the high predictive ability of coarse-grained simulation with experimental analyses, towards investigation of both the nature and functional implications of protein-lipid interactions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany proteins are located in lipid membranes surrounding cells and cellular organelles. The membrane can impart important structural and functional effects on the protein, making understanding of this interaction critical. Here, we apply computational simulation to the identification of conserved lipid binding sites on an important highly conserved bacterial membrane protein, the Sec translocase (SecA-SecYEG), which uses ATP and the proton motive force (PMF) to secrete proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane. We experimentally validate and reveal the conserved nature of these binding sites, and use functional analyses to investigate the biological significance of this interaction. We demonstrate that these interactions are specific, transient, and critical for both ATP- and PMF- driven protein secretion.",

    "abstract": "The transport of proteins across membranes is a fundamental and essential process, achieved in every cell by the  Sec translocon. In prokaryotes, SecYEG associates with the motor protein SecA to carry out ATP-driven pre-protein secretion - a vital step in the biogenesis of most periplasmic, outer membrane and secreted proteins. Structural data of the SecA-SecYEG complex has provided considerable insight into underlying mechanism of this process. Previously, we have proposed a Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation, whereby the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis favours the progression of pre-protein across the membrane from the cytosol toward the outside [Allen, Corey et al. eLife 2016]. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of a SecA-SecYEG complex engaged with preprotein to further address the mechanism underlying this process. The data describe pre-protein secondary structure formation within the channel, which exhibits a nucleotide-dependent asymmetry between the cytoplasmic and exterior cavities. The results suggest ATP-dependent pre-protein transport is partly driven by pre-protein secondary structure formation. The model previously described, and refined here, could easily be adapted for the transport of proteins across various other membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial inner membranes.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the opportunity to delineate individual-specific brain networks. A major question is whether individual-specific network topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) is behaviorally relevant. Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the MS-HBM explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, MS-HBM parcellations generalized better to new rs-fMRI and task-fMRI data from the same subjects. More specifically, MS-HBM parcellations estimated from a single rs-fMRI session (10 minutes) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by two state-of-the-art methods using five sessions (50 minutes). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by MS-HBM was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity strength, individual-specific network topography might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.",

    "abstract": "Life on Earth was dominated by bacteria for billions of years1. About 600 million years ago, animal life emerged and micro-organisms played a crucial role in shaping animal development, physiology and evolution2-4. The two partners committed to a symbiotic relationship that persists in nearly all animals today. Such beneficial interactions are pervasive throughout nature and have been extensively characterized5,6. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that drive the emergence and evolution of the symbiont benefits to their animal hosts remain largely elusive. Here we show that the host nutritional environment, instead of the host, is a predominant driving force in this evolutionary process and we identify a mechanism resulting from the bacterial adaptation to the diet, which confers improved functional benefit to the host. By applying experimental evolution to a model of host-bacteria beneficial symbiosis: Drosophila melanogaster associated with Lactobacillus plantarum, one of its growth promoting symbiotic bacteria7,8, we found that the de novo mutations in the same acetate kinase (ackA) locus invariably emerge first, rapidly become fixed, and such evolution occurs with or without the host. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ackA mutations trigger the increased production of N-acetyl-glutamine, which is sufficient to confer improved host growth capabilities to the evolved bacterial strains. Our study therefore identifies a specific mechanism by which a symbiotic bacterium increases its benefit to its animal host and reveals that adaptation to the host diet is a foremost step in the determination of the evolutionary course of symbiosis between an animal and its gut microbes.",

    "abstract": "For stable perception of odor intensity, there must exist a neural correlate that is invariant across other parameters, such as the highly variable sniff cycle. Previous hypotheses suggest that variance in inhalation dynamics alters odor concentration profiles in the naris despite a constant environmental concentration. Using whole cell recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice, we directly demonstrate that increased sniffing frequency mimics the effect of odor concentration increase at the level of both mitral and tufted cell (MTC) firing rate responses and temporal responses. In contrast, we find that mice are capable of discriminating concentrations within short timescales despite highly variable sniffing behavior. We reason that the only way mice can differentiate a change in sniff parameters and a change in concentration is to encode information about the inhalation parameters in parallel. While conceivably this could be achieved via corollary discharge from respiration control centres, we find that the sniff-driven activity of MTCs without odor input is informative of the kind of inhalation that just occurred, allowing rapid detection of a change in inhalation. Thus, a possible reason for sniff modulation of the early olfactory system may be to inform downstream centres of nasal flow dynamics, so that an inference can be made about environmental concentration independent of sniff variance.",

    "abstract": "In malignant transformation, cellular stress response pathways are dynamically mobilized to counterbalance oncogenic activity, keeping cancer cells viable. Therapeutic disruption of this riskily balanced homeostasis might change the outcome of many human cancers, particularly those for which no effective therapy is available. Here, we report the use of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) to demonstrate that further mitogenic activation disrupts cellular homeostasis and strongly sensitizes cancer cells to stress-targeted therapeutic inhibitors. We show that FGF2 enhanced replication and proteotoxic stresses in a K-Ras-driven murine cancer cell model, and combinations of FGF2 and proteasome or DNA damage response-checkpoint inhibitors triggered cell death. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated K-Ras depletion suppressed the malignant phenotype and prevented these synergic toxicities in these murine cells. Moreover, in a panel of human Ewings sarcoma family tumor cells, sub-lethal concentrations of bortezomib (proteasome-inhibitor) or VE-821 (ATR-inhibitor) induced cell death when combined with FGF2. Sustained MAPK-ERK1/2 overactivation induced by FGF2 underlies these synthetic lethalities, once late pharmacological inhibition of this pathway restored cell homeostasis and prevented these described synergies. Our results highlight how mitotic signaling pathways frequently overridden in malignant transformation might be exploited to disrupt the risky robustness of cancer cells, ultimately sensitizing them to stress-targeted therapies. This approach provides a new therapeutic rationale for human cancers, with important implications for tumors still lacking effective treatment, and for those that frequently relapse after available therapies.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of behavior requires that the underlying neuronal circuits are identified and genetically isolated. In several major model species--most notably Drosophila, neurogeneticists identify and isolate neural circuits with a binary heterologous expression-control system: Gal4-UASG. One limitation of Gal4-UASG is that expression patterns are often too broad to map circuits precisely. To help refine the range of Gal4 lines, we developed an intersectional genetic AND operator. Interoperable with Gal4, the new systems key component is a fusion protein in which the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 has been replaced with a zinc finger domain with a different DNA-binding specificity. In combination with its cognate binding site (UASZ) the zinc-finger-replaced Gal4 ( Zal1) was functional as a standalone transcription factor. Zal1 transgenes also refined Gal4 expression ranges when combined with UASGZ, a hybrid upstream activation sequence. In this way, combining Gal4 and Zal1 drivers captured restricted cell sets compared with single drivers and improved genetic fidelity. This intersectional genetic AND operation presumably derives from the action of a heterodimeric transcription factor: Gal4-Zal1. Configurations of Zal1-UASZ and Zal1-Gal4-UASGZ are versatile tools for defining, refining, and manipulating targeted neural expression patterns with precision.",

    "abstract": "O_LIUnderstanding how changes in biodiversity will impact the stability and functioning of ecosystems is a central challenge in ecology. Food-web approaches have been advocated to link community composition with ecosystem functioning by describing the fluxes of energy among species or trophic groups. However, estimating such fluxes remains problematic because current methods become unmanageable as network complexity increases.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a generalisation of previous indirect estimation methods assuming a steady state system [1, 2, 3]: the model estimates energy fluxes in a top-down manner assuming system equilibrium; each nodes losses (consumption and physiological) balances its consumptive gains. Jointly, we provide theoretical and practical guidelines to use the fluxweb R package (available on CRAN at https://bit.ly/2OC0uKF).\\nWe also present how the framework can merge with the allometric theory of ecology [4] to calculate fluxes based on easily obtainable organism-level data (i.e. body masses and species groups -eg, plants animals), opening its use to food webs of all complexities. Physiological losses (metabolic losses or losses due to death other than from predation within the food web) may be directly measured or estimated using allometric relationships based on the metabolic theory of ecology, and losses and gains due to predation are a function of ecological efficiencies that describe the proportion of energy that is used for biomass production.\\nC_LIO_LIThe primary output is a matrix of fluxes among the nodes of the food web. These fluxes can be used to describe the role of a species, a function of interest (e.g. predation; total fluxes to predators), multiple functions, or total energy flux (system throughflow or multitrophic functioning). Additionally, the package includes functions to calculate network stability based on the Jacobian matrix, providing insight into how resilient the network is to small perturbations at steady state.\\nC_LIO_LIOverall, fluxweb provides a flexible set of functions that greatly increase the feasibility of implementing food-web energetic approaches to more complex systems. As such, the package facilitates novel opportunities for mechanistically linking quantitative food webs and ecosystem functioning in real and dynamic natural landscapes.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Tanshinones, one group of bioactive diterpenes, were widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. WRKYs play important roles in plant metabolism, but their regulation mechanism in S. miltiorrhiza remains elusive. In this study, one WRKY transcription factor SmWRKY1 was isolated and characterized from S. miltiorrhiza. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis showed SmWRKY1 shared high homology with other plant WRKYs such as CrWRKY1. SmWRKY1 were predominantly expressed in leaves and stems, and was responsive to salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and nitric oxide (NO) treatment. Subcellular localization analysis found that SmWRKY1 was localized in the nucleus. Over-expression of SmWRKY1 significantly elevated the transcripts of genes involved in MEP pathway especially 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (SmDXS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (SmDXR), resulted in over 6 folds increase in tanshinones production in transgenic lines (up to 13.731mg/g dry weight (DW)) compared with the control lines. Dual-luciferase (Dual-LUC) assay showed that SmWRKY1 can positively regulate SmDXR expression by binding to its promoter. Our work revealed that SmWRKY1 participated in the regulation of tanshinones biosynthesis and acted as a positive regulator through activating SmDXR in the MEP pathway, thus discloses a new insight to further excavate the regulation mechanism of tanshinones biosynthesis.",

While this can be prevented by enforced expression of the related SOXB1 proteins, SOX1 or SOX3, the roles of SOXB1 proteins in epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) pluripotency are unknown. Here we show that Sox2 can be deleted from EpiSCs with impunity. This is due to a shift in the balance of SoxB1 expression in EpiSCs, which have decreased Sox2 and increased Sox3 compared to ESCs. Consistent with functional redundancy, Sox3 can also be deleted from EpiSCs without eliminating self-renewal. However, deletion of both Sox2 and Sox3 prevents self-renewal. The overall SOXB1 levels in ESCs affect differentiation choices: neural differentiation of Sox2 heterozygous ESCs is compromised, while increased SOXB1 levels divert the ESC to EpiSC transition towards neural differentiation. Therefore, optimal SOXB1 levels are critical for each pluripotent state and for cell fate decisions during exit from naive pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBoth olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) require the transcription factor Atf5 for maturation and survival. In OSNs, ATF5 translation is controlled by olfactory receptor (OR) expression-mediated activation of the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response. This study evaluated whether OSNs and VSNs share genetic requirements for ATF5 translation.\\n\\nMethodsATF5 immunoreactivity was assayed in whole vomeronasal organs from a series of genetic mutant animals identified in studies of OR gene choice, OR feedback, and regulation and OSN development.\\n\\nResultsATF5 expression in VSNs required the histone demethylase Lsd1, which has been previously reported to be required for OR expression. ATF5 expression also required PERK-mediated phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2. Finally, unlike previous observations in OSNs, ATF5 was found to be widespread in the mature VNO and co-expressed with mature VSN markers.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest that the initiation of ATF5 translation in VSNs and OSNs is under similar regulation, and that persistent/prolonged ATF5 translation in VSNs may serve VSN-specific gene regulatory programs. This study firmly establishes the unfolded protein response as a major controller of sensory neuronal maturation and diversification.",

    "abstract": "Low estrogen states, exemplified by postmenopausal women, are associated with increased adiposity and metabolic dysfunction. We recently reported a paradox, in which a conditional estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) mutant mouse shows a hyper-metabolic phenotype with enhanced brown/beige cell formation (\\\"browning/beiging\\\"). These observations led us to consider that although systemic deficiency of estrogen or ER in mice results in obesity and glucose intolerance at room-temperature, cold-exposure might induce enhanced browning/beiging and improve glucose metabolism. Remarkably, studying cold-exposure in mouse models of inhibited estrogen signaling - ERKO mice, ovariectomy, and treatment with the ER antagonist Fulvestrant - supported this notion. ER/estrogen deficient mice demonstrated enhanced cold-induced beiging, reduced adiposity and increased glucose sensitivity. Fulvestrant was also effective in diet-induced obesity settings. Mechanistically, ER inhibition sensitized cell-autonomous beige cell differentiation and stimulation, including {beta}3-adrenoreceptor-dependent adipocyte beiging. Taken together, our findings highlight a therapeutic potential for obese/diabetic postmenopausal patients.",

    "abstract": "The range of hosts that a parasite can infect in nature is a trait determined by its own evolutionary history and that of its potential hosts. However, knowledge on host range diversity and evolution at the family level is often lacking. Here, we investigate host range variation and diversification trends within the Sclerotiniaceae, a family of Ascomycete fungi. Using a phylogenetic framework, we associate diversification rates, the frequency of host jump events, and host range variation during the evolution of this family. Variations in diversification rate during the evolution of the Sclerotiniaceae define three major macro-evolutionary regimes with contrasted proportions of species infecting a broad range of hosts. Host-parasite co-phylogenetic analyses pointed towards parasite radiation on distant hosts long after host speciation (host jump or duplication events) as the dominant mode of association with plants in the Sclerotiniaceae. The intermediate macro-evolutionary regime showed a low diversification rate, high frequency of duplication events, and the highest proportion of broad host range species. Consistent with previous reports on oomycete parasites, our findings suggest that host jump and radiation, possibly combined with low speciation rates, could associate with the emergence of generalist pathogens. These results have important implications for our understanding of fungal parasites evolution and are of particular relevance for the durable management of disease epidemics.",

We tested the diagnostic and prognostic value of TL measurement by flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (flowFISH) in individuals with mutations in telomerase and telomere maintenance genes, and examined prospectively whether TL altered treatment decisions for patients with bone marrow failure. TL had a definable normal range across populations with discrete lower and upper boundaries. TL above the 50th age-adjusted percentile had a 100% negative predictive value for clinically relevant mutations in telomere maintenance genes, but the lower threshold for diagnosis was age-dependent. The extent of deviation from the age-adjusted median correlated with the age at diagnosis of a telomere syndrome as well as the predominant complication. Mild short telomere defects manifested in adults as pulmonary fibrosis-emphysema, while severely short TL manifested in children as bone marrow failure and immunodeficiency. Among 38 newly diagnosed patients with bone marrow failure, TL shorter than the 1st age-adjusted percentile enriched for patients with germline mutations in inherited bone marrow failure genes, such as RUNX1, in addition to telomere maintenance genes. The TL result modified the hematopoietic stem cell donor choice and/or treatment regimen in one-fourth of the cases (9 of 38,24%). TL testing by flowFISH has diagnostic and predictive value in definable clinical settings. In patients with bone marrow failure, it altered treatment decisions for a significant subset.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative variation in morphology is pervasive in all species and is the basis for the evolution of differences among species. The developmental causes of such variation are a relatively neglected research topic. Quantitative comparisons of variation arising at different developmental stages with the variation in the final structure enable us to determine when variation arises, and to generate hypotheses about the causes of that variation. We measured shape and size variation in the wing of Drosophila melanogaster at three developmental stages: late third instar, post-pupariation and in the adult fly. Flies of a wild-type and two mutants (shf and ds) with effects on the adult wing shape and size were studied. Despite experimental noise related to the difficulty of comparing developing structures, we found consistent differences in wing shape and size at each developmental stage between genotypes. In addition we provide linear rules allowing to link late disc morphology with early wings. Our approach provides a framework to analyze quantitative morphological variation in the developing fly wing. This framework should help to characterize the natural variation of the larval and pupal wing shape, and to measure the contribution of the processes occurring during these developmental stages to the natural variation in adult wing morphology.",

The investigated wavelength range was 249 nm to 338 nm with an approximate step of 5 nm. The novel concept can significantly reduce the amount of antibiotics needed for eradicating mature bacterial biofilms. The irradiation treatment was combined with tobramycin and its efficiency was compared to combinatory antibiotic treatment and highly concentrated antibiotic monotherapy. The eradication efficacies, on mature biofilms, achieved by light assisted antibiotic and by the antibiotic monotherapy at 10-fold higher concentration, were equivalent.

As a perfect illustration, heteroecious rust fungi require two alternate host plants to complete their life cycle.

High-depth RNA sequencing was applied to three key developmental stages of M. larici-populina infection on larch: basidia, pycnia and aecia. Comparative transcriptomics of infection on poplar and larch hosts was performed using available expression data. Secreted protein was the only significantly over-represented category among differentially expressed M. larici-populina genes in basidia, pycnia and aecia compared together, highlighting their probable involvement in the infection process. Comparison of fungal transcriptomes in larch and poplar revealed a majority of rust genes commonly expressed on the two hosts and a fraction exhibiting a host-specific expression. More particularly, gene families encoding small secreted proteins presented striking expression profiles that highlight probable candidate effectors specialized on each host.

    "abstract": "Filamentous plant pathogens exhibit extraordinary levels of genomic variability that is proposed to facilitate rapid adaptation to changing host environments. However, the impact of genomic variation on phenotypic differentiation in pathogen populations is largely unknown. Here, we address the extent of variability in infection phenotypes of the hemibiotrophic wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici by studying three field isolates collected in Denmark, Iran, and the Netherlands. These three isolates differ extensively in genome structure and gene content, but produce similar disease symptoms in the same susceptible wheat cultivar. Using advanced confocal microscopy, staining of reactive oxygen species, and comparative analyses of infection stage-specific RNA-seq data, we demonstrate considerable variation in the temporal and spatial course of infection of the three isolates. Based on microscopic observation, we determined four core infection stages: establishment, biotrophic growth, lifestyle transition, and necrotrophic growth and asexual reproduction. Comparative analyses of the fungal transcriptomes, sequenced for every infection stage, revealed that the gene expression profiles of the isolates differed significantly, and 20% of the genes are differentially expressed between the three isolates during infection. The genes exhibiting isolate-specific expression patterns are enriched in genes encoding effector candidates that are small, secreted, cysteine-rich proteins and putative virulence determinants. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes were located significantly closer to transposable elements, which are enriched for the heterochromatin-associated histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 on the accessory chromosomes. This observation indicates that transposable elements and epigenetic regulation contribute to the infection-associated transcriptional variation between the isolates. Our findings illustrate how high genetic diversity in a pathogen population can result in highly differentiated infection and expression phenotypes that can support rapid adaptation in changing environments. Furthermore, our study reveals an exceptionally high extent of plasticity in the infection program of an important wheat pathogen and shows a substantial redundancy in infection-related gene expression.\\n\\nAuthor summaryZymoseptoria tritici is a pathogen that infects wheat and induces necrosis in leaf tissue. Z. tritici field populations exhibit high levels of genetic diversity, and here we addressed the consequences of this diversity on infection phenotypes. We conducted a detailed comparison of the infection processes of three Z. tritici isolates collected in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Iran. We inoculated leaves of a susceptible wheat cultivar and monitored development of disease symptoms and infection structures in leaf tissue by confocal microscopy. The three isolates exhibited highly differentiated spatial and temporal patterns of infection, although quantitative disease was similar. Furthermore, more than 20% of the genes were differentially expressed in the three isolates during wheat infection. Variation in gene expression is particularly associated with transposable elements, suggesting a role of epigenetic regulation in transcriptional variation among the three isolates. Finally, we find that genes encoding putative virulence determinants were enriched among the differentially expressed genes, suggesting that each of the three Z. tritici isolates utilizes different strategies to manipulate host defenses. Our results emphasize that phenotypic diversity plays an important role in pathogen populations and should be considered when developing crop protection strategies.",

    "abstract": "Silicon is reported to reduce the toxic effects of Al on root elongation but the in planta mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. Using seedlings of soybean (Glycine max) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), we examined the effect of up to 2 mM Si on root elongation rate (RER) in Al-toxic nutrient solutions. Synchrotron-based low energy X-ray fluorescence (LEXRF) was then used for the in situ examination of the distribution of Al and Si within cross-sections cut from the apical tissues of sorghum roots. The addition of Si potentially increased RER in Al-toxic solutions, with RER being up to ca. 0.3 mm h-1 (14 %) higher for soybean and ca. 0.2 mm h-1 (17 %) higher for sorghum relative to solutions without added Si. This improvement in RER could not be attributed to a change in Al-chemistry of the bulk nutrient solution, nor was it due to a change in the concentration of Al within the apical (0-10 mm) root tissues. Using LEXRF to examine sorghum, it was demonstrated that in roots exposed to both Al and Si, much of the Al was co-located with Si in the mucigel and outer apoplast. These observations suggest that Si reduces the toxicity of Al in planta through formation of Al-Si complexes in mucigel and outer cellular tissues, thereby decreasing the binding of Al to the cell wall where it is known to inhibit wall loosening as required for cell elongation.",

    "abstract": "A deeper understanding of inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity is a critical factor for the advancement of next generation strategies against cancer. The heterogeneous morphology exhibited by solid tumors is mirrored by their metabolic heterogeneity. Defining the basic biological mechanisms that underlie tumor cell variability will be fundamental to the development of personalized cancer treatments. Variability in the molecular signatures found in local regions of cancer tissues can be captured through an untargeted analysis of their metabolic constituents. Here we demonstrate that DESI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) combined with network analysis can provide detailed insight into the metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC). We show that network modules capture signatures which differentiate tumor metabolism in the core and in the surrounding region. Moreover, module preservation analysis of network modules between patients with and without metastatic recurrence explains the inter-subject metabolic differences associated with diverse clinical outcomes such as metastatic recurrence.\\n\\nSignificanceNetwork analysis of DESI-MSI data from CRC human tissue reveals clinically relevant co-expression ion patterns associated with metastatic susceptibility. This delineates a more complex picture of tumor heterogeneity than conventional hard segmentation algorithms. Using tissue sections from central regions and at a distance from the tumor center, ion co-expression patterns reveal common features among patients who developed metastases (up of > 5 years) not preserved in patients who did not develop metastases. This offers insight into the nature of the complex molecular interactions associated with cancer recurrence. Presently, predicting CRC relapse is challenging, and histopathologically like-for-like cancers frequently manifest widely varying metastatic tendencies. Thus, the methodology introduced here more robustly defines the risk of metastases based on tumor biochemical heterogeneity.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsP.I., Z.T., R.C.G.: designed the study, developed the workflow, analyzed the data, interpreted the results, wrote the paper; N.S. collected the MS, performed the H...E staining, wrote the paper; L.D.: interpreted the results, wrote the paper; A.M.: collected the MS; A.S.: histological assessment; L.P.: collected the tissue specimens and clinical metadata; A.D.: collected the MS; H.K.: performed the H...E staining; R.M.: collected the tissue specimens and clinical metadata.

    "abstract": "Hyperactive RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling has a well-defined role in cancer biology. Aberrant pathway activation occurs mostly upstream of MEK; however, MEK mutations are prevalent in some cancer subsets. Here we show that cancer-related MEK mutants can be classified as those activated by relieving the inhibitory role of helix A, and those with in-frame deletions of {beta}3-C loop, which exhibit differential resistance to MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. The {beta}3-C loop deletions activate MEK1 through enhancing homodimerization that can drive intradimer cross-phosphorylation of activation loop. Further, we demonstrate that MEK1 dimerization is required both for its activation by RAF and for its catalytic activity towards ERK. Our study identifies a novel group of MEK mutants, illustrates some key steps in RAF/MEK/ERK activation, and has important implications for the design of therapies targeting hyperactive RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling in cancers.",

Tumor sequence surveys have frequently ranked the importance of substitutions to cancer growth by P value or a false-discovery conversion thereof. However, P values are thresholds for belief, not metrics of effect. Their frequent misuse as metrics of effect has often been vociferously decried. Here, we estimate the effect sizes of all recurrent single nucleotide variants in 23 cancer types, quantifying relative importance within and between driver genes. Some of the variants with the highest effect size, such as EGFR L858R in lung adenocarcinoma and BRAF V600E in primary skin cutaneous melanoma, have yielded remarkable therapeutic responses.

Sequences are classified by learning sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize learned motifs along with information about their positional and class enrichment. The package runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU and provides a simple interface to train and evaluate a network with a handful lines of code. Using an RNA A-to-I editing data set and CLIP-seq binding site sequences we demonstrate that pysster classifies sequences with higher accuracy than other methods and is able to recover known sequence and structure motifs.\\n\\nAvailabilitypysster is freely available at https://github.com/budach/pysster.\\n\\nContactbudach@molgen.mpg.de, marsico@molgen.mpg.de",

This approach employs features derived from chromatin accessibility, binding motifs, gene expression, genomic sequence and annotation to train classifiers using a supervised, discriminative learning principle. Two further key aspects of this approach are learning classifier parameters in an iterative training procedure that successively adds additional negative examples to the training set, and creating an ensemble prediction by averaging over classifiers obtained for different training cell types.\\n\\nIn post-challenge analyses, we benchmark the influence of different feature sets and find that chromatin accessiblity and binding motifs are sufficient to yield state-of-the-art performance for in-vivo binding site predictions.

    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are a central component for the biological synthesis of proteins, and they are among the most highly conserved and frequently transcribed genes in all living things. Despite their clear significance for fundamental cellular processes, the forces governing tRNA evolution are poorly understood. We present evidence that transcription-associated mutagenesis and strong purifying selection are key determinants of patterns of sequence variation within and surrounding tRNA genes in humans and diverse model organisms. Remarkably, the mutation rate at broadly expressed cytosolic tRNA loci is likely between seven and ten times greater than the nuclear genome average. Furthermore, evolutionary analyses provide strong evidence that tRNA genes, but not their flanking sequences, experience strong purifying selection, acting against this elevated mutation rate. We also find a strong correlation between tRNA expression levels and the mutation rates in their immediate flanking regions, suggesting a simple new method for estimating individual tRNA gene activity. Collectively, this study illuminates the extreme competing forces in tRNA gene evolution, and implies that mutations at tRNA loci contribute disproportionately to mutational load and have unexplored fitness consequences in human populations.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhile transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) has been demonstrated for protein coding genes, its implications in shaping genome structure at transfer RNA (tRNA) loci in metazoans have not been fully appreciated. We show that cytosolic tRNAs are a striking example of TAM because of their variable rates of transcription, well-defined boundaries and internal promoter sequences. tRNA loci have a mutation rate approximately seven-to tenfold greater than the genome-wide average, and these mutations are consistent with signatures of TAM. These observations indicate that tRNA loci are disproportionately large contributors to mutational load in the human genome. Furthermore, the correlations between tRNA locus variation and transcription implicate that prediction of tRNA gene expression based on sequence variation data is possible.",

    "abstract": "The melioidosis bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is increasingly being recognized as a pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have recently catalogued genome-wide variation of paired, isogenic B. pseudomallei isolates from seven Australasian CF cases, which were collected between four and 55 months apart. Here, we extend this investigation by documenting the transcriptomic changes in B. pseudomallei in five cases. Following growth in an artificial CF sputum medium, four of the five paired isolates exhibited significant differential gene expression (DE) that affected between 32 and 792 genes. The greatest number of DE events was observed between patient CF9 strains, consistent with the hypermutator status of the latter strain, which is deficient in the DNA mismatch repair protein MutS. Two patient isolates harbored duplications that concomitantly increased expression of the {beta}-lactamase gene penA, and a 35kb deletion in another abolished expression of 29 genes. Convergent expression profiles in the chronically-adapted isolates identified two significantly downregulated and 17 significantly upregulated loci, including the antibiotic resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump BpeEF-OprC, the quorum-sensing hhqABCDE operon, and a cyanide- and pyocyanin-insensitive cytochrome bd quinol oxidase. These convergent pathoadaptations lead to increased expression of pathways that may suppress competing bacterial and fungal pathogens and that enhance survival in oxygen-restricted environments, the latter of which may render conventional antibiotics less effective in vivo. Treating chronically-adapted B. pseudomallei infections with antibiotics designed to target anaerobic infections, such as the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics, may significantly improve pathogen eradication attempts by exploiting this Achilles heel.",

    "abstract": "The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than non-overlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.",

Gene expression was examined for 63 women with uncomplicated, term deliveries. We evaluated the association between weeks gestation at sample collection and expression of each transcript. Of the 16,311 transcripts evaluated, 439 changed over pregnancy after a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. Genes whose expression changed over pregnancy were associated with oxygen transport, the immune system, and host response to bacteria.

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms enable organisms to synchronise the processes underpinning survival and reproduction to anticipate daily changes in the external environment. Recent work shows that daily (circadian) rhythms also enable parasites to maximise fitness in the context of ecological interactions with their hosts. Because parasite rhythms matter for their fitness, understanding how they are regulated could lead to innovative ways to reduce the severity and spread of diseases. Here, we examine how host circadian rhythms influence rhythms in the asexual replication of malaria parasites. Asexual replication is responsible for the severity of malaria and fuels transmission of the disease, yet, how parasite rhythms are driven remains a mystery. We perturbed feeding rhythms of hosts by 12 hours (i.e. diurnal feeding in nocturnal mice) to desynchronise the hosts peripheral oscillators from the central, light-entrained oscillator in the brain and their rhythmic outputs. We demonstrate that the rhythms of rodent malaria parasites in day-fed hosts become inverted relative to the rhythms of parasites in night-fed hosts. Our results reveal that the hosts peripheral rhythms (associated with the timing of feeding and metabolism), but not rhythms driven by the central, light-entrained circadian oscillator in the brain, determine the timing (phase) of parasite rhythms. Further investigation reveals that parasite rhythms correlate closely with blood glucose rhythms. In addition, we show that parasite rhythms resynchronise to the altered host feeding rhythms when food availability is shifted, which is not mediated through rhythms in the host immune system. Our observations suggest that parasites actively control their developmental rhythms. Finally, counter to expectation, the severity of disease symptoms expressed by hosts was not affected by desynchronisation of their central and peripheral rhythms. Our study at the intersection of disease ecology and chronobiology opens up a new arena for studying host-parasite-vector coevolution and has broad implications for applied bioscience.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHow cycles of asexual replication by malaria parasites are coordinated to occur in synchrony with the circadian rhythms of the host is a long-standing mystery. We reveal that rhythms associated with the time-of-day that hosts feed are responsible for the timing of rhythms in parasite development. Specifically, we altered host feeding time to phase-shift peripheral rhythms, whilst leaving rhythms driven by the central circadian oscillator in the brain unchanged. We found that parasite developmental rhythms remained synchronous but changed their phase, by 12 hours, to follow the timing of host feeding. Furthermore, our results suggest that parasites themselves schedule rhythms in their replication to coordinate with rhythms in glucose in the hosts blood, rather than have rhythms imposed upon them by, for example, host immune responses. Our findings reveal a novel relationship between hosts and parasites that if disrupted, could reduce both the severity and transmission of malaria infection.",

    "abstract": "Supplementation with the synthetic oxidised folate, folic acid is used to prevent neural tube defects and other symptoms of folate deficiency. However, several unanswered questions remain over folic acid efficacy, safety and interactions with gut microbes. Prevention of a development defect caused by folate deficiency in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans requires > 10 fold higher concentrations of folic acid compared to folinic acid, a reduced folate. Here we show that the major route for folic acid to restore normal development is indirect via the Escherichia coli used to feed C. elegans. This route occurs mainly via the E. coli transporter AbgT, which takes up the folic acid breakdown product para-aminobenzoate-glutamate (PABA-glu). We found that folic acid preparations, including a commercial supplement, contain 0.3- 4.0 % of this breakdown product. Previously, we have shown that inhibiting bacterial folate synthesis increases C. elegans lifespan by removing a life-shortening bacterial activity. Here, we show that folic acid restores bacterial folate synthesis and reverses this lifespan increase. It is still to be determined whether this bacterial route increases host folate levels in humans and if there are situations where increased bacterial folate synthesis has negative health complications.",

    "abstract": "While tuberculosis represents a significant disease burden worldwide, low-incidence countries strive to reach the WHO target of elimination by 2025. Screening for TB in immigrants is an important component of the strategy to reduce the TB burden in low-incidence settings. An important option is the screening and preventive treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Whether this policy is worthwhile depends on the extent of transmission within the country, and introduction of new cases through import. Mathematical transmission models of tuberculosis have been used to identify key parameters in the epidemiology of TB and estimate transmission rates. An important application has also been to investigate the consequences of policy scenarios.\\n\\nHere, we formulate a mathematical model for TB transmission within the Netherlands to estimate the size of the pool of latent infections, and to determine the share of importation -either through immigration or travel- versus transmission within the Netherlands. We take into account importation of infections due to immigration, and travel to the country of origin, focusing on the three ethnicities most represented among TB cases, excluding those overrepresented in asylum seekers: Moroccans, Turkish and Indonesians. We fit a system of ordinary differential equations to the data from the Netherlands Tuberculosis Registry on (extra-)pulmonary TB cases from 1995-2013.\\n\\nWe find that for all three foreign-born communities, immigration is the most important source of LTBI, but the extent of within-country transmission is much lower (about half) for the Turkish and Indonesian communities than for the Moroccan. This would imply that contact investigation would have a greater yield in the latter community than in the former. Travel remains a minor factor contributing LTBI, suggesting that targeting returning travelers might be less effective at preventing LTBI than immigrants upon entry in the country.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMethods for analyzing microbiome data generally fall into one of two groups: tests of the global hypothesis of any microbiome effect, which do not provide any information on the contribution of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs); and tests for individual OTUs, which do not typically provide a global test of microbiome effect. Without a unified approach, the findings of a global test may be hard to resolve with the findings at the individual OTU level. Further, many tests of individual OTU effects do not preserve the false discovery rate (FDR).\n\nResultsWe introduce the linear decomposition model (LDM), that provides a single analysis path that includes global tests of any effect of the microbiome, tests of the effects of individual OTUs while accounting for multiple testing by controlling the FDR, and a connection to distance-based ordination. The LDM accommodates both continuous and discrete variables (e.g., clinical outcomes, environmental factors) as well as interaction terms to be tested either singly or in combination, allows for adjustment of confounding covariates, and uses permutation-based p-values that can control for correlation. The LDM can also be applied to transformed data, and an \"omnibus\" test can easily combine results from analyses conducted on different transformation scales. We also provide a new implementation of PERMANOVA based on our approach. For global testing, our simulations indicate the LDM provided correct type I error and can have comparable power to existing distance-based methods. For testing individual OTUs, our simulations indicate the LDM controlled the FDR well. In contrast, DESeq2 often had inflated FDR; MetagenomeSeq generally had the lowest sensitivity. The flexibility of the LDM for a variety of microbiome studies is illustrated by the analysis of data from two microbiome studies. We also show that our implementation of PERMANOVA can outperform existing implementations.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALENeurological molecular analyses such as transcriptomics, epigenetics, and genome-wide association studies must be assessed in the context of the human brain in order to generate biologically meaningful inferences. It is often difficult to access primary human brain tissue; therefore, approximations are made using in vitro modeling or by identifying disease-associated genes from DNA extracted from blood. Gene sets from these studies are then compared to the post-mortem human brain to provide an assessment of the brain region and the developmental time point that a gene set is most closely associated with. However, most analyses of postmortem datasets are achieved by building new computational tools each time in-house, which can cause discrepancies from study to study, indicating that the field is in need of a user-friendly suite of tools to examine spatiotemporal expression with respect to the postmortem brain. Such a tool will be of use to the molecular interrogation of neurological and psychiatric disorders, with direct advantages for the disease-modeling and human genetics communities.\\n\\nRESULTSWe have developed brainImageR, an R package that calculates both the spatial and temporal association of a dataset with post-mortem gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas. BrainImageR performs a robust analysis of gene set enrichment to identify enriched anatomical regions, provides a global high-resolution visualization of these enrichments across the human brain, and predicts when in developmental time the sample is most closely matched to, a task that has become increasingly important in the field of in vitro neuronal modeling. These functionalities of brainImageR enable a quick and efficient characterization of a given dataset across normal human brain development.\\n\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATIONBrainImageR is released under the Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 license and the source code can be downloaded through github at https://github.com/saralinker/brainImageR.\\n\\nCONTACTgage@salk.edu",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant amount of effort in developing space-efficient and succinct data structures for storing and building the traditional de Bruijn graph and its variants, including the colored de Bruijn graph. However, a problem not yet considered is developing a means to merge succinct representations of the de Bruijn graph--a challenge is necessary for constructing the de Bruijn graph on very-large datasets. We create VO_SCPLOWARIC_SCPLOWMO_SCPLOWERGEC_SCPLOW, for building the colored de Bruijn graph on a very-large dataset through partitioning the data into smaller subsets, building the colored de Bruijn graph using a FM-index based representation, and merging these representations in an iterative format. This last step is an algorithmic challenge for which we present an algorithm in this paper. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of VO_SCPLOWARIC_SCPLOWMO_SCPLOWERGEC_SCPLOW by demonstrating: a four-fold reduction in working space when constructing an 8,000 color dataset, and the construction of population graph two orders of magnitude larger than previous reported methods.",

    "abstract": "k-mer profiling has been one of the trending approaches to analyze read data generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The tasks of k-mer profiling include, but are not limited to, counting the frequencies and determining the occurrences of short sequences in a dataset. The notion of k-mer has been extensively used to build de Bruijn graphs in genome or transcriptome assembly, which requires examining all possible k-mers presented in the dataset. Recently, an alternative way of profiling has been proposed, which constructs a set of representative k-mers as genomic markers and profiles their occurrences in the sequencing data. This technique has been applied in both transcript quantification through RNA-Seq and taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads. Most of these applications use a set of fixed-size k-mers since the majority of existing k-mer counters are inadequate to process genomic sequences with variable-length k-mers. However, choosing the appropriate k is challenging, as it varies for different applications. As a pioneer work to profile a set of variable-length k-mers, we propose TahcoRoll in order to enhance the Aho-Corasick algorithm. More specifically, we use one bit to represent each nucleotide, and integrate the rolling hash technique to construct an efficient in-memory data structure for this task. Using both synthetic and real datasets, results show that TahcoRoll outperforms existing approaches in either or both time and memory efficiency without using any disk space. In addition, compared to the most efficient state-of-the-art k-mer counters, such as KMC and MSBWT, TahcoRoll is the only approach that can process long read data from both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore on a commodity desktop computer. The source code of TahcoRoll is implemented in C++14, and available at https://github.com/chelseaju/TahcoRoll.git.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling has revealed remarkable variation in transcription, suggesting that expression of many genes at the single-cell level are intrinsically stochastic and noisy. Yet, on cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how their expression stability can be assessed? We have developed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells. Here we evaluate the proposed framework and characterize SEGs derived from two scRNA-seq datasets that profile early human and mouse development.\\n\\nResultsHere, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets are highly reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across 10 diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells.\\n\\nConclusionsSEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation/stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications including scRNA-seq data normalization, the proposed framework can be applied to identify genes with stable expression in other scRNA-seq datasets.",

    "abstract": "Selective autophagy comprises cytoplasm-to-lysosome trafficking routes that transport cargos using double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes). Cargos are detected by receptor proteins, which typically also bind to lipid-conjugated LC3 proteins on autophagosome membranes. We dissected lysosomal delivery of four SQSTM1-like receptors by genome-wide CRISPR screening looking for novel autophagy-related (ATG) factors and trafficking routes. We uncovered new mammalian ATG factors including TMEM41B, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein required for autophagosome membrane expansion and/or closure. Furthermore, we found that certain receptors remain robustly targeted to the lysosome even in the absence of ATG7 or other LC3 conjugation factors. Lastly, we identified a unique genetic fingerprint behind receptor flux in ATG7KO cells, which includes factors implicated in nucleating autophagosome formation and vesicle trafficking factors. Our work uncovers new ATG factors, reveals a malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions, and provides a valuable resource (http://crispr.deniclab.com) for further mining of novel autophagy mechanisms.",

Whether this alteration in the microbial community is the cause or effect of the disease is not well understood, especially in adult onset of disease. The first-degree relatives (FDRs) of CeD patients may provide an opportunity to study gut microbiome in pre-disease state as FDRs are genetically susceptible to CeD. By using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed between the disease condition (CeD), pre-disease (FDR) and control subjects. However, differences were observed at the level of amplicon sequence variant (ASV), suggesting alterations in specific taxa between pre-diseases and diseased condition. Duodenal biopsies showed higher differences in ASVs compared to faecal samples indicating larger disruption of microbiota at disease site. Increased abundance of specific Helicobacter ASVs were observed in duodenum of CeD when compared to FDR (p < 0.01). In case of fecal samples CeD microbiome and Actinomyces. In addition, predicted functional metagenome showed reduced ability of gluten that ecosystem level diversity measures (except in the duodenum) were not significantly different is characterized by reduced abundance of beneficial taxa such as Akkermansia, Ruminococcus degradation by CeD faecal microbiota in comparison to FDRs and controls.",
