    "abstract": "Draining 31 states and roughly 3 million km2, the Mississippi River (MSR) and its tributaries constitute an essential resource to millions of people for clean drinking water, transportation, agriculture, and industry. Since the turn of the 20th century, MSR water quality has continually rated poorly due to human activity. Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, OTUs, and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL. Within MSR microbial assemblages we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate. This study offers the most comprehensive view of MSR microbiota to date, provides important groundwork for higher resolution microbial studies of river perturbation, and identifies potential microbial indicators of river health related to eutrophication.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STR) expansions have been identified as the causal DNA mutation in dozens of Mendelian diseases. Historically, pathogenic STR expansions could only be detected by single locus techniques, such as PCR and electrophoresis. The ability to use short read sequencing data to screen for STR expansions has the potential to reduce both the time and cost to reaching diagnosis and enable the discovery of new causal STR loci. Most existing tools detect STR variation within the read length, and so are unable to detect the majority of pathogenic expansions. Those tools that can detect large expansions are limited to a set of known disease loci and as yet no new disease causing STR expansions have been identified with high-throughput sequencing technologies.\\n\\nHere we address this by presenting STRetch, a new genome-wide method to detect STR expansions at all loci across the human genome. We demonstrate the use of STRetch for detecting pathogenic STR expansions in short-read whole genome sequencing data with a very low false discovery rate. We further demonstrate the application of STRetch to solve cases of patients with undiagnosed disease and apply STRetch to the analysis of 97 whole genomes to reveal variation at STR loci. STRetch assesses expansions at all STR loci in the genome and allows screening for novel disease-causing STRs.\\n\\nSTRetch is open source software, available from github.com/Oshlack/STRetch.",

    "abstract": "Statin is one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. Besides reduction of cardiovascular risks, statins have been proposed for the prevention or treatment of other disorders, but results from clinical studies are mixed. There are also controversies concerning the adverse effects caused by statins.\\n\\nIn this study we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach across a wide range of complex traits to explore repositioning opportunities and side-effects of statins. MR is analogous to a \\\"naturalistic\\\" randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is much less susceptible to confounding and reverse causation as compared to observational studies.\\n\\nWe employed two genetic instruments (rs12916 and rs17238484) in the HMGCR gene which have been shown to provide reliable estimates of the risk of statins on type 2 diabetes and weight gain. We observed in the single- and joint-SNP analysis that low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition results in increased depressive symptoms. This finding appeared to be supported by nominally significant results of raised major depression risk in single-SNP MR analysis of rs17238484, and analyses using LDL-C as the exposure. Several other outcomes also reached nominal significance (p < 0.05) in single- or joint-SNP analyses; for example, we observed causal associations of LDL-C lowering from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition with reduced risks of schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, as well as increased forearm bone mineral density, sleep duration and extreme longevity (highest q-value = 0.289). We also found evidence of casual relationships of LDL-C levels with schizophrenia, anorexia, sleep duration and longevity, following the same association directions as in analyses of HMGCR variants. These findings were at least partially supported by previous clinical studies. We did not observe associations with cognitive test profiles, renal outcomes, autoimmune diseases or cancers. While MR has its limitations and our findings remain to be confirmed in further studies, this work demonstrates the potential of a phenome-wide approach to reveal novel therapeutic indications and unknown drug side-effects.",

    "abstract": "The advance of personalized cancer medicine requires the accurate identification of the mutations driving each patients tumor. However, to date, we have only been able to obtain partial insights into the contribution of genomic events to tumor development. Here, we design a comprehensive approach to identify the driver mutations in each patients tumor and obtain a whole-genome panorama of driver events across more than 2,500 tumors from 37 types of cancer. This panorama includes coding and non-coding point mutations, copy number alterations and other genomic rearrangements of somatic origin, and potentially predisposing germline variants. We demonstrate that genomic events are at the root of virtually all tumors, with each carrying on average 4.6 driver events. Most individual tumors harbor a unique combination of drivers, and we uncover the most frequent co-occurring driver events. Half of all cancer genes are affected by several types of driver mutations. In summary, the panorama described here provides answers to fundamental questions in cancer genomics and bridges the gap between cancer genomics and personalized cancer medicine.",

We measured how participants modulated grip force when interacting with soft and rigid virtual springs when stiffness varied nearly continuously between trials. We identified a sudden phase transition between two forms of feedforward control that differed in the timing of the synchronization between the anticipated load force and the applied grip force. The switch occurred several trials after a threshold stiffness level. These results suggest that in the control of grip force, the brain acts as a switching control system.

    "abstract": "There is substantial interest in uncovering the genetic basis of the traits underlying adaptive responses in tree species, as this information will ultimately aid conservation and industrial endeavors across populations, generations, and environments. Fundamentally, the characterization of such genetic bases is within the context of a genetic architecture, which describes the mutlidimensional relationship between genotype and phenotype through the identification of causative variants, their relative location within a genome, expression, pleiotropic effect, environmental influence, and degree of dominance, epistasis, and additivity. Here, we review theory related to polygenic local adaptation and contextualize these expectations with methods often used to uncover the genetic basis of traits important to tree conservation and industry. A broad literature survey suggests that most tree traits generally exhibit considerable heritability, that underlying quantitative genetic variation (QST) is structured more so across populations than neutral expectations (FST) in 69% of comparisons across the literature, and that single-locus associations often exhibit small estimated per-locus effects. Together, these results suggest differential selection across populations often acts on tree phenotypes underlain by polygenic architectures consisting of numerous small to moderate effect loci. Using this synthesis, we highlight the limits of using solely single-locus approaches to describe underlying genetic architectures and close by addressing hurdles and promising alternatives towards such goals, remark upon the current state of tree genomics, and identify future directions for this field. Importantly, we argue, the success of future endeavors should not be predicated on the shortcomings of past studies and will instead be dependent upon the application of theory to empiricism, standardized reporting, centralized open-access databases, and continual input and review of the communitys research.",

Bright irides in diurnal fish species have recently been proposed as a potential analogue. Here, we contribute to this discussion by testing whether iris radiance is actively modulated. The focus is on behaviourally controlled iris reflections, called \\\"ocular sparks\\\". The triplefin Tripterygion delaisi can alternate between red and blue ocular sparks, allowing us to test the prediction that spark frequency and hue depend on background hue and prey presence. In a first experiment, we found that blue ocular sparks were significantly more often \\\"on\\\" against red backgrounds, and red ocular sparks against blue backgrounds, particularly when copepods were present. A second experiment tested whether hungry fish showed more ocular sparks, which was not the case. Again, background hue resulted in differential use of ocular spark types. We conclude that iris radiance through ocular sparks in T. delaisi is not a side effect of eye movement, but adaptively modulated in response to the context under which prey are detected. We discuss the possible alternative functions of ocular sparks, including an as yet speculative role in active photolocation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in designing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is decoding behavior from time-varying neural oscillations. in typical applications, decoders are constructed for individual subjects and with limited data leading to restrictions on the types of models that can be utilized. currently, the best performing decoders are typically linear models capable of utilizing rigid timing constraints with limited training data. Here we demonstrate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to take advantage of the temporal information present in sequential neural data collected from subjects implanted with electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode arrays performing a finger flexion task. our constructed models are capable of achieving accuracies that are comparable to existing techniques while also being robust to variation in sample data size. Moreover, we utilize the LSTM networks and an affine transformation layer to construct a novel architecture for transfer learning. We demonstrate that in scenarios where only the affine transform is learned for a new subject, it is possible to achieve results comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The notable advantage is the increased stability of the model during training on novel subjects. Relaxing the constraint of only training the affine transformation, we establish our model as capable of exceeding performance of current models across all training data sizes. Overall, this work demonstrates that LSTMS are a versatile model that can accurately capture temporal patterns in neural data and can provide a foundation for transfer learning in neural decoding.",

Furthermore, the latency of the N1 increased insignificantly with WM load. The P1 latency, however, mostly did not depend on either WM load or direction of interpretation. Larger negativity under lower WM loads suggests deeper processing of the auditory stimuli, providing tentative electrophysiological evidence in support of the Efforts Model of SI.

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens evolve during the course of infection as they adapt to the selective pressures that confront them inside the host. Identification of adaptive mutations and their contributions to pathogen fitness remain a central challenge. Although mutations can either target intergenic or coding regions in the pathogen genome, studies of host adaptation have focused predominantly on molecular evolution within coding regions whereas the role of intergenic mutations remains unclear. Here, we address this issue and investigate the extent to which intergenic mutations contribute to the evolutionary response of pathogens to host environments, and if intergenic mutations have distinct roles in host adaptation. We characterize intergenic evolution in 44 lineages of a clinically important bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as they adapt to their hosts. We identify 88 intergenic regions in which parallel evolution occur. At the genetic level, we find that mutations in these regions under selection are located primarily within regulatory elements upstream of transcriptional start sites. At the functional level, we show that these mutations both create or destroy regulatory interactions in connection to transcriptional processes, and are directly responsible for evolution of important pathogenic phenotypes including antibiotic sensitivity. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations are more likely to be selected than coding region mutations, and that intergenic mutations enable essential genes to become targets of evolution. In summary, our results highlight the evolutionary significance of intergenic mutations in creating host-adapted variants, and that intergenic and coding regions have different qualitative and quantitative contributions to this process.\\n\\nSignificancePathogens adapt to their host during infection, but the contribution and function of non-coding intergenic sequences to adaptation is poorly understood. Here, genome-wide identification of adaptive mutations within intergenic regions demonstrates that these sequences constitute an important part of the genetic basis for host adaptation. We find that intergenic mutations are abundant relative to adaptive mutations within coding sequences, and can contribute directly to evolution of pathogen relevant traits. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations modify expression of essential genes and thus make contributions that are functionally distinct from coding mutations. These results improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes in vivo, and can potentially assist in refining predictions of pathogen evolution, disease outcome, and antibiotic resistance development.",

To identify the transcriptional regulatory networks that control these transitions, we conducted epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling of early and late-stage RPCs and observed a developmentally dynamic landscape of chromatin accessibility. Open chromatin regions that showed stage-specificity, as well as those shared by early and late-stage RPCs, were selectively targeted by the homeodomain factor Lhx2, which is expressed throughout retinal neurogenesis but also regulates many stage-specific processes in RPCs. Stage-specific Lhx2 binding sites were frequently associated with target sites for transcription factors that are preferentially expressed in either early or late-stage RPCs, and which were predicted to possess pioneer activity. Lhx2 loss of function in RPCs led to a loss of chromatin accessibility at both direct Lhx2 target sites and more broadly across the genome, as well as a loss of binding by transcription factors associated with stage-specific Lhx2 target sites. These findings demonstrate a central role for Lhx2 in control of chromatin accessibility in RPCs, and identify transcription factors that may guide stage-specific target site selection by Lhx2.\\n\\nSummaryLhx2 is a central regulator of chromatin accessibility in retinal progenitor cells, and interacts with stage-specific transcription factors to regulate genes that are dynamically expressed during retinal neurogenesis.",

Some strains of Wolbachia are parasitic, manipulating host reproduction to benefit themselves, while other strains of Wolbachia exhibit obligate or facultative mutualisms with their host. The effects of Wolbachia on its host are many, though primarily relate to host immune and reproductive function. Here we test the hypothesis that Wolbachia infection alters the frequency of homologous recombination during meiosis. We use D. melanogaster as a model system, and survey recombination in eight Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-uninfected strains, controlling for genotype. We measure recombination in two intervals of the genome. Our results indicate that Wolbachia infection is associated with increased recombination in one genomic interval and not the other. The effect of Wolbachia infection on recombination is thus heterogenous across the genome. Our data also indicate a reproductive benefit of Wolbachia infection; infected females show higher fecundity than their uninfected genotypic controls. Given the prevalence of Wolbachia infection in natural populations, our findings suggest that Wolbachia infection is likely to contribute to recombination rate and fecundity variation among individuals in nature.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear human genome harbors sequences of mitochondrial origin, indicating an ancestral transfer of DNA from the mitogenome. Several Nuclear Mitochondrial Segments (NUMTs) have been detected by alignment-based sequence similarity search, as implemented in the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Identifying NUMTs is important for the comprehensive annotation and understanding of the human genome. Here we explore the possibility of detecting NUMTs in the human genome by alignment-free sequence similarity search, such as k-mers (k-tuples, k-grams, oligos of length k) distributions. We find that when k=6 or larger, the k-mer approach and BLAST search produce almost identical results, e.g., detect the same set of NUMTs longer than 3kb. However, when k=5 or k=4, certain signals are only detected by the alignment-free approach, and these may indicate yet unrecognized, and potentially more ancestral NUMTs. We introduce a \\\"Manhattan plot\\\" style representation of NUMT predictions across the genome, which are calculated based on the reciprocal of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the nuclear and mitochondrial k-mer frequencies. The further inspection of the k-mer-based NUMT predictions however shows that most of them contain long-terminal-repeat (LTR) annotations, whereas BLAST-based NUMT predictions do not. Thus, similarity of the mitogenome to LTR sequences is recognized, which we validate by finding the mitochondrial k-mer distribution closer to those for transposable sequences and specifically, close to some types of LTR.",

Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve clinical management of LD based on a more precise understanding of disease and patient stratification.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a precision medicine machine-learning approach based on high-dimensional electronic medical records (EMRs) to characterize the heterogeneous comorbidities in a LD population and develop systematic predictive models for identifying medications that influence the risk of subsequent comorbidities.\\n\\nFindingsWe identified 3, 16, and 17 comorbidities at broad disease categories associated with LD within 2, 5, and 10 years of diagnosis, respectively. At higher resolution of ICD-9 levels, we pinpointed specific co-morbid diseases on a timescale that matched the symptoms associated with PTLDS. We identified 7, 30, and 35 medications that influenced the risks of the reported comorbidities within 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. These medications included six previously associated with the identified comorbidities and 29 new findings. For instance, the first-line antibiotic doxycycline exhibited a consistently protective effect for typical symptoms of LD, including  backache Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) and  chronic rhinitis, but consistently increased the risk of  cataract NOS,  tear film insufficiency NOS, and  nocturia.\\n\\nInterpretationOur approach and findings suggest new hypotheses for precision medicine treatments regimens and drug repurposing opportunities tailored to the phenotypic profiles of LD patients.\\n\\nFundingThe Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation",

    "abstract": "Discovery of cancer drivers has traditionally focused on the identification of protein-coding genes. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of putative cancer driver mutations in both protein-coding and non-coding genomic regions across >2,500 whole cancer genomes from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium. We developed a statistically rigorous strategy for combining significance levels from multiple driver discovery methods and demonstrate that the integrated results overcome limitations of individual methods. We combined this strategy with careful filtering and applied it to protein-coding genes, promoters, untranslated regions (UTRs), distal enhancers and non-coding RNAs. These analyses redefine the landscape of non-coding driver mutations in cancer genomes, confirming a few previously reported elements and raising doubts about others, while identifying novel candidate elements across 27 cancer types. Novel recurrent events were found in the promoters or 5UTRs of TP53, RFTN1, RNF34, and MTG2, in the 3UTRs of NFKBIZ and TOB1, and in the non-coding RNA RMRP. We provide evidence that the previously reported non-coding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 may be subject to a localized mutational process. Perhaps the most striking finding is the relative paucity of point mutations driving cancer in non-coding genes and regulatory elements. Though we have limited power to discover infrequent non-coding drivers in individual cohorts, combined analysis of promoters of known cancer genes show little excess of mutations beyond TERT.",

    "abstract": "Frequency-dependent brightness enhancement, where a flickering light can appear twice as bright as an equiluminant constant light, has been reported to exist within the alpha (8 - 12 Hz) band. Could oscillatory neural activity be driving this perceptual effect? Here, in two experiments, human subjects reported which of two flickering stimuli were brighter. Strikingly, 4 Hz stimuli were reported as brighter more than 80% of the time when compared to all other tested frequencies, even though all stimuli were equiluminant and of equal temporal length. Electroencephalography recordings showed that inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) of theta (4 Hz) was: 1) Significantly greater than alpha, contralateral to the flickering stimulus; 2) Enhanced by the presence of a second ipsilateral 4 Hz flickering stimulus; and 3) Uniquely lateralized, unlike the alpha band. Importantly, on trials with two identical stimuli (i.e. 4 Hz vs 4 Hz), the brightness discrimination judgment could be predicted by the hemispheric balance in the amount of 4 Hz ITC. We speculate that the theta rhythm plays a distinct information transfer role, where its ability to share information between hemispheres via entrainment promotes a better processing of visual information to inform a discrimination decision.",

    "abstract": "Saccadic eye movements are an inherent component of natural reading, yet their contribution to information processing at subsequent fixation remains elusive. Here we use anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine cortical activity following saccades as healthy human subjects engaged in a one-back word recognition task. This activity was compared with activity following external visual stimulation that mimicked saccades. A combination of procedures were employed to eliminate saccadic ocular artifacts from the MEG signal. Both saccades and saccade-like external visual stimulation produced early-latency responses beginning ~70 ms after onset in occipital cortex and spreading through the ventral and dorsal visual streams to temporal, parietal and frontal cortices. Robust differential activity following the onset of saccades versus similar external visual stimulation emerged during 150-350 ms in a left-lateralized cortical network. This network included (i) left lateral occipitotemporal and nearby inferotemporal cortex, (ii) left posterior Sylvian fissure and nearby multimodal cortex, and (iii) medial parietooccipital, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Moreover, this left-lateralized network colocalized with word repetition priming effects. Together, results suggest that central saccadic mechanisms influence a left-lateralized language network in occipitotemporal and temporal cortex above and beyond saccadic influences at preceding stages of information processing during visual word recognition.",

    "abstract": "Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) is an important vegetable crop for human nutrition. We characterized 192 cauliflower accessions from the USDA and IPK genebanks with genotyping by sequencing (GBS). They originated from 26 different countries and represent about 44% of all cauliflower accessions in both genebanks. The analysis of genetic diversity revealed that accessions formed two major groups that represented the two genebanks and were not related to the country of origin. This differentiation was robust with respect to the analysis methods that included principal component analysis, ADMIXTURE and neighbor-joining trees. Genetic diversity was higher in the USDA collection and significant phenotypic differences between the two genebanks were found in three out of six traits investigated. GBS data have a high proportion of missing data, but we observed that the exclusion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with missing data or the imputation of missing SNP alleles produced very similar results. The results indicate that the composition and type of accessions have a strong effect on the structure of genetic diversity of ex situ collections, although regeneration procedures and local adaptation to regeneration conditions may also contribute to a divergence. Fst-based outlier tests of genetic differentiation identified only a small proportion (<1%) of SNPs that are highly differentiated between the two genebanks, which indicates that selection during seed regeneration is not a major cause of differentiation between genebanks. Seed regeneration procedures of both genebanks do not result in different levels of genetic drift and loss of genetic variation. We therefore conclude that the composition and type of accessions mainly influence the level of genetic diversity and explain the strong genetic differentiation between the two ex situ collections. In summary, GBS is a useful method for characterizing genetic diversity in cauliflower genebank material and our results suggest that it may be useful to incorporate routine genotyping into accession management and seed regeneration to monitor the diversity present in ex situ collections and to reduce the loss of genetic diversity during seed regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The considerable difficulty encountered in reproducing the results of published dynamical models limits validation, exploration and reuse of this increasingly large biomedical research resource. To address this problem, we have developed Tellurium Notebook, a software system that facilitates building reproducible dynamical models and reusing models by 1) supporting the COMBINE archive format during model development for capturing model information in an exchangeable format and 2) enabling users to easily simulate and edit public COMBINE-compliant models from public repositories to facilitate studying model dynamics, variants and test cases. Tellurium Notebook, a Python-based Jupyter-like environment, is designed to seamlessly inter-operate with these community standards by automating conversion between COMBINE standards formulations and corresponding in-line, human-readable representations. Thus, Tellurium brings to systems biology the strategy used by other literate notebook systems such as Mathematica. These capabilities allow users to edit every aspect of the standards-compliant models and simulations, run the simulations in-line, and re-export to standard formats. We provide several use cases illustrating the advantages of our approach and how it allows development and reuse of models without requiring technical knowledge of standards. Adoption of Tellurium should accelerate model development, reproducibility and reuse.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThere is considerable value to systems and synthetic biology in creating reproducible models. An essential element of reproducibility is the use of community standards, an often challenging undertaking for modelers. This article describes Tellurium Notebook, a tool for developing dynamical models that provides an intuitive approach to building and reusing models built with community standards. Tellurium automates embedding human-readable representations of COMBINE archives in literate coding notebooks, bringing to systems biology this strategy central to other literate notebook systems such as Mathematica. We show that the ability to easily edit this human-readable representation enables users to test models under a variety of conditions, thereby providing a way to create, reuse, and modify standard-encoded models and simulations, regardless of the users level of technical knowledge of said standards.",

    "abstract": "Sea turtles are a keystone species and are highly sensitive to changes in their environment, making them excellent environmental indicators. In light of environmental and climate changes, species are increasingly threatened by pollution, changes in ocean health, habitat alteration, and plastic ingestion. There may be additional health related threats and understanding these threats is key in directing future management and conservation efforts, particularly for severely reduced sea turtle populations. Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) are critically endangered, with those in the eastern Pacific Ocean (Mexico-Peru) considered one of the most threatened sea turtle populations in the world. This study establishes baseline health parameters in hematology and blood biochemistry as well as tested for heavy metals and persitent organic pollutants in eastern Pacific hawksbills at a primary nesting colony located in a mangrove estuary. Whereas hematology and biochemistry results are consistent with healthy populations of other species of sea turtles, we identified differences in packed cell volume, heterophils and lympohcyte counts, and glucose when comparing our data to other adult hawksbill analysis (1), (2), (3). Our analysis of heavy metal contamination revealed a mean blood level of 0.245 ppm of arsenic, 0.045 ppm of lead, and 0.008 ppm of mercury. Blood levels of persistent organic pollutants were below the laboratory detection limit for all turtles. Our results suggest that differences in the feeding ecology of eastern Pacific hawksbills in mangrove estuaries may make them less likely to accumulate persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals in their blood. These baseline data on blood values in hawksbills nesting within a mangrove estuary in the eastern Pacific offer important guidance for health assessments of the species in the wild and in clinical rehabilitation facilities, and underscore the importance of preventing contamination from point and non-point sources in mangrove estuaries, which represent primary habitat to hawksbills and myriad other marine species in the eastern Pacific Ocean.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effect of targeted kinase inhibitors can be significantly reduced by intrinsic or acquired resistance mutations that modulate the affinity of the drug for the kinase. In cancer, the majority of missense mutations are rare, making it difficult to predict their impact on inhibitor affinity. This complicates the practice of precision medicine, pairing of patients with clinical trials, and development of next-generation inhibitors. Here, we examine the potential for alchemical free-energy calculations to predict how kinase mutations modulate inhibitor affinities to Abl, a major target in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We find these calculations can achieve useful accuracy in predicting resistance for a set of eight FDA-approved kinase inhibitors across 144 clinically-identified point mutations, achieving a root mean square error in binding free energy changes of [Formula] kcal/mol (95% confidence interval) and correctly classifying mutations as resistant or susceptible with [Formula] accuracy. Since these calculations are fast on modern GPUs, this benchmark establishes the potential for physical modeling to collaboratively support the rapid assessment and anticipation of the potential for patient mutations to affect drug potency in clinical applications.",

Here we identified two H. oligactis strains that respond differently to interstitial stem cell loss. Cold-resistant (Ho_CR) animals adapt and remain healthy while cold-sensitive (Ho_CS) ones die within three months, after their epithelial stem cells lose their selfrenewal potential. In Ho_CS but not in Ho_CR animals, the autophagy flux is deficient, characterized by a low induction upon starvation, proteasome inhibition or Rapamycin treatment, and a constitutively repressed Ulk activity. In the non-aging Hydra vulgaris, WIPI2 silencing suffices to induce aging. Rapamycin can delay aging by sustaining epithelial self-renewal and regeneration, although without enhancing the autophagy flux. Instead Rapamycin promotes engulfment in epithelial cells where p62/SQSTM1-positive phagocytic vacuoles accumulate. This study uncovers the importance of autophagy in the longevity of early-branched eumetazoans by maintaining stem cell renewal, and a novel anti-aging effect of Rapamycin via phagocytosis.",

We demonstrate this method on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all cases we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input-output relationships. This method opens up the possibility of exhaustively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a wide range of other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Catch-up growth after insults to growing organs is paramount to achieving robust body proportions. In fly larvae, local injury is followed by local and systemic compensatory mechanisms that allow damaged tissues to regain proportions with other tissues. In vertebrates, local catch-up growth has been described after transient reduction of bone growth, but the underlying cellular responses are controversial. We developed an approach to study catch-up growth in foetal mice by inducing mosaic expression of the cell cycle suppressor p21 in the cartilage cells (chondrocytes) that drive long bone elongation. By specifically targeting the left hindlimb, the right limb served as an internal control. Strikingly, left-right limb symmetry was not altered, revealing deployment of compensatory mechanisms. Above a certain threshold of insult, an orchestrated response was triggered involving local enhancement of bone growth and systemic growth reduction that ensured body proportions were maintained. The local response entailed hyper-proliferation of spared left-limb chondrocytes that was associated with reduced chondrocyte density. The systemic effect involved impaired placental IGF signalling and function, revealing bone-placenta communication. Thus, vertebrates, much like invertebrates, can mount coordinated local and systemic responses to developmental insults to ensure normal body proportions are maintained.",

    "abstract": "Chemosensory systems are highly organized signaling pathways that allow bacteria to adapt to environmental changes. The Frz chemosensory system from M. xanthus possesses two CheW-like proteins, FrzA (the core CheW) and FrzB. We found that FrzB does not interact with FrzE (the cognate CheA) as it lacks the amino acid region responsible for this interaction. FrzB, instead, acts upstream of FrzCD in the regulation of M. xanthus chemotaxis behaviors and activates the Frz pathway by allowing the formation and distribution of multiple chemosensory clusters on the nucleoid. These results, together, show that the lack of the CheA-interacting region in FrzB confers new functions to this small protein.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYChemosensory systems are signaling complexes that are widespread in bacteria and allow the modulation of different cellular functions, such as taxis and development, in response to the environment. We show that the Myxococcus xanthus FrzB is a divergent CheW lacking the region involved in the interaction with the histidine kinase FrzE. Instead, it acts upstream of FrzCD to allow the formation of multiple distributed Frz chemosensory arrays at the nucleoid. The loss of the CheA-interacting region in FrzB might have been selected to confer plasticity to nucleoid-associated chemosensory systems. By unraveling a new accessory protein and its function, this work opens new insights into the knowledge of the regulatory potentials of bacterial chemosensory systems.",
