    "abstract": "Powerful approaches to inferring recent or current population structure based on nearest neighbour haplotype  coancestry have so far been inaccessible to users without high quality genome-wide haplotype data. With a boom in non-model organism genomics, there is a pressing need to bring these methods to communities without access to such data. Here we present RADpainter, a new program designed to infer the coancestry matrix from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) data. We combine this program together with a previously published MCMC clustering algorithm into fineRADstructure - a complete, easy to use, and fast population inference package for RADseq data (https://github.com/millanek/fineRADstructure). Finally, with two example datasets, we illustrate its use, benefits, and robustness to missing RAD alleles in double digest RAD sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Geographic isolation that drives speciation is often assumed to slowly increase over time, for instance through the formation of rivers, the formation of mountains or the movement of tectonic plates. Cyclic changes in connectivity between areas may occur with the advancement and retraction of glaciers, with water level fluctuations in seas between islands or in lakes that have an uneven bathymetry. These habitat dynamics may act as a driver of allopatric speciation and propel local diversity. Here we present a parsimonious model of the interaction between cyclical (but not necessarily periodic) changes in the environment and speciation, and provide an ABC-SMC method to infer the rates of allopatric and sympatric speciation from a phylogenetic tree. We apply our approach to the posterior sample of an updated phylogeny of the Lamprologini, a tribe of cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika where such cyclic changes in water level have occurred. We find that water level changes play a crucial role in driving diversity in Lake Tanganyika. We note that if we apply our analysis to the Most Credible Consensus (MCC) tree, we do not find evidence for water level changes influencing diversity in the Lamprologini, suggesting that the MCC tree is a misleading representation of the true species tree. Furthermore, we note that the signature of habitat dynamics is found in the posterior sample despite the fact that this sample was constructed using a species tree prior that ignores habitat dynamics. However, in other cases this species tree prior might erase this signature. Hence we argue that in order to improve inference of the effect of habitat dynamics on biodiversity, phylogenetic reconstruction methods should include tree priors that explicitly take into account such dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide molecular gene expression studies generally compare expression values for each gene across multiple conditions followed by cluster and gene set enrichment analysis to determine whether differentially expressed genes are enriched in specific biochemical pathways, cellular components, biological processes, and/or molecular functions, etc. This approach to analyzing differences in gene expression enables discovery of gene function, but is not useful to determine whether pre-defined groups of genes share or diverge in their expression patterns in response to treatments nor to assess the correctness of pre-defined gene set groupings. Here we present a simple method that changes the dimension of comparison by treating genes as variable traits to directly assess significance of differences in expression levels among pre-defined gene groups. Because expression distributions are typically skewed (thus unfit for direct assessment using Gaussian statistical methods) our method involves transforming expression data to approximate a normal distribution followed by dividing the genes into groups, then applying Gaussian parametric methods to assess significance of observed differences. This method enables the assessment of differences in gene expression distributions within and across samples, enabling hypothesis-based comparison among groups of genes. We demonstrate this method by assessing the significance of specific gene groups differential response to heat stress conditions in maize.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Here we report an experimental system that allows for stable patch-clamp recording in the presence of US at 43 MHz, a frequency known to stimulate neural activity. We describe the effects of US on two ion channels proposed to be involved in the response of excitable cells to US: the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel and the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2. Our patch-clamp recordings, together with finite-element simulations of acoustic field parameters indicate that Piezo1 channels are activated by continuous wave US at 43 MHz and 50 or 90 W/cm2 through cell membrane stress caused by acoustic streaming. NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism at these intensities, but their kinetics could be accelerated by US-induced heating.",

Twenty-seven retrograde tracer injections were made in 19 areas of a 41 area (plus 7 sub-area) parcellation of the mouse neo-, parahippocampal and perirhinal cortex. Flat mounts of the cortex and multiple histological markers enabled detailed counts of labeled neurons in individual areas. A weight index was determined for each area-to-area pathway based on the Fraction of Extrinsically Labeled Neurons (FLNe). Data analysis allowed cross species comparison with the macaque. Estimation of FLNe statistical variability based on repeat injections revealed high consistency across individuals and justifies using a single injection per area to characterize connectivity. The observed lognormal distribution of connections to each cortical area spanned 5 orders of magnitude and revealed a distinct connectivity profile for each area, analogous to that observed in macaque. The resulting graph has a density of 97% (i.e. 97% of connections that can exist do exist), considerably higher than the 66% density reported for the macaque. Our results provide more sharply defined connectivity profiles and a markedly higher graph density than shown in a recent probabilistic mouse connectome.",

It showed excellent performance in estimating divergence times for both simulated and empirical molecular sequence datasets in which evolutionary rates varied extensively throughout the tree. RelTime is computationally efficient and scales well with increasing size of datasets. Until now, however, RelTime has not had a formal mathematical foundation. Here, we show that the basis of the RelTime approach is a relative rate framework (RRF) that combines comparisons of evolutionary rates in sister lineages with the principle of minimum rate change between an evolutionary lineage and its descendants. We present analytical solutions for estimating relative lineage rates and divergence times under RRF. We also discuss the relationship of RRF with other approaches, including the Bayesian framework. We conclude that RelTime will be also useful for phylogenies with branch lengths derived not only from molecular data, but also morphological and biochemical traits.",

    "abstract": "In many diploid species the sex chromosomes play a special role in mediating reproductive isolation. In haplodiploids, where females are diploid and males haploid, the whole genome behaves similarly to the X/Z chromosomes of diploids. Therefore, haplodiploid systems can serve as a model for the role of sex chromosomes in speciation and hybridization. A previously described population of Finnish Formica wood ants displays genome-wide signs of ploidally and sexually antagonistic selection resulting from hybridization. Here, hybrid females have increased survivorship but hybrid males are inviable. To understand how the unusual hybrid population may be maintained, we developed a mathematical model with hybrid incompatibility, female heterozygote advantage, recombination, and assortative mating. The rugged fitness landscape resulting from the co-occurrence of heterozygote advantage and hybrid incompatibility results in a sexual conflict in haplodiploids, which is caused by the ploidy difference. Thus, whereas heterozygote advantage always promotes long-term polymorphism in diploids, we find various outcomes in haplodiploids in which the population stabilizes either in favor of males, females, or via maximizing the number of introgressed individuals. We discuss these outcomes with respect to the potential long-term fate of the Finnish wood ant population, and provide approximations for the extension of the model to multiple incompatibilities. Moreover, we highlight the general implications of our results for speciation and hybridization in haplodiploids versus diploids, and how the described fitness relationships could contribute to the outstanding role of sex chromosomes as hotspots of sexual antagonism and genes involved in speciation.",

    "abstract": "InvadopodiInvadopodia are membrane protrusions dynamically assembled by invasive cancer cells in contact with extracellular matrix (ECM). Invadopodia are enriched for the structural proteins actin and cortactin, as well as metalloproteases such as MT1-MMP, whose function is to degrade the surrounding ECM. During metastasis, invadopodia are necessary for cancer cell intravasation and extravasation. While signaling pathways involved in the assembly and function of invadopodia are well studied, few studies address invadopodia dynamics and how the cell-ECM interactions contribute to cell invasion. Using iterative analysis based on time-lapse microscopy and mathematical modeling of invasive cancer cells, we found that cells oscillate between invadopodia presence and cell stasis, termed Invadopodia state and invadopodia absence during cell translocation, termed Migration state. Our data suggests that {beta}1-integrin-ECM binding and ECM cross-linking control the duration of each of the two states. By changing the concentration of cross-linkers in 2D and 3D cultures, we generate ECM where 0-0.92 of total lysine residues are cross-linked. Using ECM with a range of cross-linking degrees we demonstrate that the dynamics of invadopodia-related functions have a biphasic relationship to ECM cross-linking. At intermediate levels of ECM cross-linking (0.39), cells exhibit rapid invadopodia protrusion-retraction cycles and rapid calcium spikes, which lead to more frequent MT1-MMP delivery, causing maximal invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation. In contrast, both extremely high or low levels of cross-linking lead to slower invadopodia-related dynamics and lower ECM degradation. Additionally, {beta}1-integrin inhibition modifies dynamics of invadopodia-related functions, as well as the length of time cells spend in either of the states. Collectively, these data suggest that {beta}1-integrin-ECM binding non-linearly translates small physical differences in extracellular environment to differences in the dynamics of cancer cell behaviors. Understanding conditions under which invadopodia can be reduced by subtle environment-targeting treatments may lead to combination therapies for preventing metastatic spread.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) drive extensive horizontal transfer in the gut microbiome. This transfer could benefit human health by conferring new metabolic capabilities to commensal microbes, or it could threaten human health by spreading antibiotic resistance genes to pathogens. Despite their biological importance and medical relevance, MGEs from the gut microbiome have not been systematically characterized. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of chromosomal MGEs in the gut microbiome using a method called Split Read Insertion Detection (SRID) that enables the identification of the exact mobilizable unit of MGEs. Leveraging the SRID method, we curated a database of 5600 putative MGEs encompassing seven MGE classes called ImmeDB (Intestinal microbiome mobile element database) (https://immedb.mit.edu/). We observed that many MGEs carry genes that confer an adaptive advantage to the gut environment including gene families involved in antibiotic resistance, bile salt detoxification, mucus degradation, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis, polysaccharide utilization, and sporulation. We find that antibiotic resistance genes are more likely to be spread by conjugation via integrative conjugative elements or integrative mobilizable elements than transduction via prophages. Additionally, we observed that horizontal transfer of MGEs is extensive within phyla but rare across phyla. Taken together, our findings support a phylum level niche-adaptive gene pools in the gut microbiome. ImmeDB will be a valuable resource for future fundamental and translational studies on the gut microbiome and MGE communities.",

Across species, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is associated with the motivational aspects of phasic pain, but whether it mediates motivational functions in persistent pain is less clear. Using burrowing behavior as an marker of non-specific motivated behavior in rodents, we studied the suppression of burrowing following painful CFA or control injection into the right knee-joint of 37 rats (18 with pain), and examined associated neural connectivity with ultra-high-field resting state functional MRI. We found that connectivity between ACC and the subcortex correlated with the reduction in burrowing behavior observed following the pain manipulation. In a full replication study we confirmed these findings in a group of 44 rats (23 with pain). Across both datasets, reduced burrowing was assosciated with increased connectivity between ACC and subcortical structures including hypothalamic/preoptic nuclei and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Together, the findings implicate ACC connectivity as a robust correlate of the motivational aspect of persistent pain in rodents.",

The results could however not be replicated in a subsequent PET study at an independent centre. In this study, we performed a replication of our original study in a larger sample using Bayesian hypothesis testing to evaluate relative evidence both for and against this hypothesis.\\n\\nMethodsRegional 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BPND) was examined in 50 healthy male subjects using PET with the radioligand [11C]WAY100635. 5-HT1A availability was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) yielding regional BPND. ST and SA were measured using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) questionnaire. Correlations between ST/SA scores and 5-HT1A BPND in frontal cortex, hippocampus and raphe nuclei were examined by calculation of default correlation Bayes factors (BFs) and replication BFs.\\n\\nResultsThere were no significant correlations between 5-HT1A receptor binding and ST/SA scores. Rather, five of six replication BFs provided moderate to strong evidence for no association between 5-HT1A availability and ST/SA, while the remaining BF provided only weak evidence.\\n\\nConclusionWe could not replicate our previous findings of an association between 5-HT1A availability and the personality trait ST/SA. Rather, the Bayesian analysis provided evidence for a lack of correlation. Further research should focus on whether other components of the serotonin system may be related to ST or SA. This study also illustrates how Bayesian hypothesis testing allows for greater flexibility and more informative conclusions than traditional p-values, suggesting that this approach may be advantageous for analysis of molecular imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is central to evoke a potent immune response. Dendritic cell (DC) migration to lymph nodes is dependent on the interaction of C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) expressed by DCs, with podoplanin expressed by lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which CLEC-2 influences DC migration remain elusive. Here, we show that CLEC-2-dependent DC migration is tightly controlled by tetraspanin CD37, a membrane-organizing protein. Our findings demonstrate a specific molecular interaction between CLEC-2 and CD37. Myeloid cells lacking CD37 (Cd37-/-) expressed less CLEC-2 on their surface compared to wild-type cells, indicating that CD37 is required to stabilize membrane expression of CLEC-2. In addition, CLEC-2-expressing DCs lacking CD37 showed impaired adhesion, migration velocity and displacement on LNSCs. Moreover, Cd37-/- DCs failed to form actin protrusions in a 3D collagen matrix upon podoplanin-induced CLEC-2 stimulation, phenocopying CLEC-2-deficient DCs (CD11c{Delta}CLEC-2). Microcontact printing experiments revealed that CD37 is required for CLEC-2 recruitment in the membrane to its ligand podoplanin. This study demonstrates that tetraspanin CD37 controls CLEC-2 membrane organization and provides new molecular insights underlying CLEC-2-dependent DC migration.",

Therapeutic disruption of this riskily balanced homeostasis might change the outcome of many human cancers, particularly those for which no effective therapy is available. Here, we report the use of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) to demonstrate that further mitogenic activation disrupts cellular homeostasis and strongly sensitizes cancer cells to stress-targeted therapeutic inhibitors. We show that FGF2 enhanced replication and proteotoxic stresses in a K-Ras-driven murine cancer cell model, and combinations of FGF2 and proteasome or DNA damage response-checkpoint inhibitors triggered cell death. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated K-Ras depletion suppressed the malignant phenotype and prevented these synergic toxicities in these murine cells. Moreover, in a panel of human Ewings sarcoma family tumor cells, sub-lethal concentrations of bortezomib (proteasome-inhibitor) or VE-821 (ATR-inhibitor) induced cell death when combined with FGF2. Sustained MAPK-ERK1/2 overactivation induced by FGF2 underlies these synthetic lethalities, once late pharmacological inhibition of this pathway restored cell homeostasis and prevented these described synergies. Our results highlight how mitotic signaling pathways frequently overridden in malignant transformation might be exploited to disrupt the risky robustness of cancer cells, ultimately sensitizing them to stress-targeted therapies. This approach provides a new therapeutic rationale for human cancers, with important implications for tumors still lacking effective treatment, and for those that frequently relapse after available therapies.",

    "abstract": "Selective autophagy comprises cytoplasm-to-lysosome trafficking routes that transport cargos using double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes). Cargos are detected by receptor proteins, which typically also bind to lipid-conjugated LC3 proteins on autophagosome membranes. We dissected lysosomal delivery of four SQSTM1-like receptors by genome-wide CRISPR screening looking for novel autophagy-related (ATG) factors and trafficking routes. We uncovered new mammalian ATG factors including TMEM41B, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein required for autophagosome membrane expansion and/or closure. Furthermore, we found that certain receptors remain robustly targeted to the lysosome even in the absence of ATG7 or other LC3 conjugation factors. Lastly, we identified a unique genetic fingerprint behind receptor flux in ATG7KO cells, which includes factors implicated in nucleating autophagosome formation and vesicle trafficking factors. Our work uncovers new ATG factors, reveals a malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions, and provides a valuable resource (http://crispr.deniclab.com) for further mining of novel autophagy mechanisms.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the left DLPFC in both language comprehension and production. In a double-blind, sham-controlled crossover experiment, thirty-two participants received cathodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left DLPFC while performing a language comprehension and a language production task. Results showed that cathodal tDCS increases reaction times in the language comprehension task, but decreases naming latencies in the language production task. However, additional analyses revealed that the polarity of tDCS effects was highly correlated across tasks, implying differential individual susceptibility to the effect of tDCS within participants. Overall, our findings demonstrate that left DLPFC is part of the complex cortical network associated with language processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious research shows that men often receive more research funding than women, but does not provide empirical evidence as to why this occurs. In 2014, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) created a natural experiment by dividing all investigator-initiated funding into two new grant programs: one with and one without an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed application success among 23,918 grant applications from 7,093 unique principal investigators in a 5-year natural experiment across all investigator-initiated CIHR grant programs in 2011-2016. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to account for multiple applications by the same applicant and an interaction term between each principal investigators self-reported sex and grant programs to compare success rates between male and female applicants under different review criteria.\\n\\nResultsThe overall grant success rate across all competitions was 15.8%. After adjusting for age and research domain, the predicted probability of funding success in traditional programs was 0.9 percentage points higher for male than for female principal investigators (OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.854-1.022). In the new program focused on the proposed science, the gap was 0.9 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.794-1.229). In the new program with an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator, the gap was 4.0 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.705, 95% CI 0.519- 0.960).\\n\\nInterpretationThis study suggests gender gaps in grant funding are attributable to less favourable assessments of women as principal investigators, not differences in assessments of the quality of science led by women. We propose ways for funders to avoid allowing gender bias to influence research funding.\\n\\nFundingThis study was unfunded.",

Here, we apply transcranial US and perform brain mapping studies in guinea pigs using extracellular electrophysiology. We find that US elicits extensive activation across cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, transection of the auditory nerves or removal of cochlear fluids eliminates the US-induced activity, revealing an indirect auditory mechanism for US neural activation. US likely vibrates the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, which is continuous with the fluid in the cochlea via cochlear aqueducts; thus, US can activate the ascending auditory pathways and other non-auditory regions through cross-modal projections. This finding of a cochlear fluid-induced vibration mechanism challenges the idea that US can directly activate neurons in the intact brain, suggesting that future US stimulation studies will need to control for this effect to reach reliable conclusions.",

Analyses of differentially expressed genes identified transcriptional signatures of two distinct cell types that challenge the current morphology-based classification of these cells.

Such protocols have relied upon our current understanding of the molecular basis of mammalian kidney morphogenesis. To date this has depended upon population based-profiling of non-homogenous cellular compartments. In order to improve our resolution of individual cell transcriptional profiles during kidney morphogenesis, we have performed 10x Chromium single cell RNA-seq on over 6000 cells from the E18.5 developing mouse kidney, as well as more than 7000 cells from human iPSC-derived kidney organoids. We identified 16 clusters of cells representing all major cell lineages in the E18.5 mouse kidney. The differentially expressed genes from individual murine clusters were then used to guide the classification of 16 cell clusters within human kidney organoids, revealing the presence of distinguishable stromal, endothelial, nephron, podocyte and nephron progenitor populations. Despite the congruence between developing mouse and human organoid, our analysis suggested limited nephron maturation and the presence of  off target populations in human kidney organoids, including unidentified stromal populations and evidence of neural clusters. This may reflect unique human kidney populations, mixed cultures or aberrant differentiation in vitro. Analysis of clusters within the mouse data revealed novel insights into progenitor maintenance and cellular maturation in the major renal lineages and will serve as a roadmap to refine directed differentiation approaches in human iPSC-derived kidney organoids.",

Apart from changes in cell shape, the requirements for this tissue spreading are not well understood. Here we analyze spreading of the extraembryonic serosa in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita. The serosa forms from a columnar blastoderm anlage, becomes a squamous epithelium, and eventually spreads over the embryo proper. We describe the dynamics of this process in long-term, whole-embryo time-lapse recordings, demonstrating that free serosa spreading is preceded by a prolonged pause in tissue expansion. Closer examination of this pause reveals mechanical coupling to the underlying yolk sac, which is later released. We find mechanical coupling prolonged and serosa spreading impaired after knockdown of M. abdita Matrix metalloprotease 1. We conclude that tissue-tissue interactions provide a critical functional element to constrain spreading epithelia.\\n\\nImpact StatementExtraembryonic tissue spreading in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita requires mechanical decoupling from the underlying yolk sac.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens evolve during the course of infection as they adapt to the selective pressures that confront them inside the host. Identification of adaptive mutations and their contributions to pathogen fitness remain a central challenge. Although mutations can either target intergenic or coding regions in the pathogen genome, studies of host adaptation have focused predominantly on molecular evolution within coding regions whereas the role of intergenic mutations remains unclear. Here, we address this issue and investigate the extent to which intergenic mutations contribute to the evolutionary response of pathogens to host environments, and if intergenic mutations have distinct roles in host adaptation. We characterize intergenic evolution in 44 lineages of a clinically important bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as they adapt to their hosts. We identify 88 intergenic regions in which parallel evolution occur. At the genetic level, we find that mutations in these regions under selection are located primarily within regulatory elements upstream of transcriptional start sites. At the functional level, we show that these mutations both create or destroy regulatory interactions in connection to transcriptional processes, and are directly responsible for evolution of important pathogenic phenotypes including antibiotic sensitivity. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations are more likely to be selected than coding region mutations, and that intergenic mutations enable essential genes to become targets of evolution. In summary, our results highlight the evolutionary significance of intergenic mutations in creating host-adapted variants, and that intergenic and coding regions have different qualitative and quantitative contributions to this process.\\n\\nSignificancePathogens adapt to their host during infection, but the contribution and function of non-coding intergenic sequences to adaptation is poorly understood. Here, genome-wide identification of adaptive mutations within intergenic regions demonstrates that these sequences constitute an important part of the genetic basis for host adaptation. We find that intergenic mutations are abundant relative to adaptive mutations within coding sequences, and can contribute directly to evolution of pathogen relevant traits. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations modify expression of essential genes and thus make contributions that are functionally distinct from coding mutations. These results improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes in vivo, and can potentially assist in refining predictions of pathogen evolution, disease outcome, and antibiotic resistance development.",

We report here that a commonly studied DUB mutation, in which the catalytic cysteine is replaced with alanine, can dramatically increase the affinity of some DUBs for ubiquitin. Overexpression of these tight-binding mutants thus has the potential to sequester cellular pools of monoubiquitin and ubiquitin chains. As a result, cells expressing these mutants may display unpredictable dominant negative physiological effects that are not related to loss of DUB activity. The structure of the SAGA DUB module bound to free ubiquitin reveals the structural basis for the 30-fold higher affinity of Ubp8C146A for ubiquitin. We show that an alternative option, substituting the active site cysteine with arginine, can inactivate DUBs while also decreasing the affinity for ubiquitin.",

It was revealed that mobile genetic elements (MGE) seems to play major role in gibbon evolution. Here we report that most of the gibbon genome is occupied by the MGEs such as ALUs, MIRs, LINE1, LINE 2, LINE 3, ERVL, ERV-class1, ERV-class II and other DNA elements which include hAT Charlie and TcMar tigger. We provide detailed description and genome wide distribution of all the MGEs present in gibbon genome. Previously, it was reported that gibbon-specific retrotransposon (LAVA) tend to insert into chromosome segregation genes and alter transcription by providing a premature termination site, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism for the genome plasticity of the gibbon lineage. We show that insertion sites of LAVA elements present atypical signals/patterns which are different from typical signals present at insertion sites of Alu elements. This suggests possibility of distinct insertion mechanism used by LAVA elements for their insertions. We also find similarity in signals of LAVA elements insertion sites with atypical signals present at Alus /L1s insertion sites disrupting the genes leading to diseases such as cancer and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

    "abstract": "One type of biological data that needs more quantitative analytical tools is particulate trajectories. This type of data appears in many different contexts and across scales in biology: from the trajectory of bacteria performing chemotaxis to the mobility of ms2 spots within nuclei. Presently, most analyses performed on data of this nature has been limited to mean square displacement (MSD) analyses. While simple, MSD analysis has several pitfalls, including difficulty in selecting between competing models, handling systems with multiple distinct sub-populations, and parameter extraction from limited time-series data. Here, we provide an alternative to MSD analysis using the jump distance distribution (JDD). The JDD resolves several issues: one can select between competing models of motion, have composite models that allow for multiple populations, and have improved error bounds on parameter estimates when data is limited. A major consequence is that you can perform analyses using a fraction of the data required to get similar results using MSD analyses, thereby giving access to a larger range of temporal dynamics when the underlying stochastic process is not stationary. In this paper, we construct and validate a derivation of the JDD for different transport models, explore the dependence on dimensionality of the process, and implement a parameter estimation and model selection scheme. We demonstrate the power of this scheme through an analysis of bacterial chemotaxis data, highlighting the interpretation of results and improvements upon MSD analysis. We expect that our proposed scheme provides quantitative insights into a broad spectrum of biological phenomena requiring analysis of particulate trajectories.",

Ab initio calculations of ATP(H2O)19 and ATP(H2O)19(HCl) exhibit the same propensity inversion as in ADP: in the pure-water case the PP conformation is favored while the addition of the HCl molecule results in the {beta}{beta} conformation being of lower energy. A comparison, following an intermediate insertion and departure of an HCl molecule, shows that the energy of a hydrogen-bonded (H2O)19{beta}ATP::{beta}ATP(H2O)19 structure is lower than that of the sum of two separate PP systems, i.e., that the aggregated state of the peptide is favored. This arises from the basic physical response to their total environmental influences. Questions about quantitative results from molecular dynamics simulations, obviously needed to analyze longer chains and other side chains, are addressed via rigid-water calculations. The desirability of basing studies of amyloid formation on our proposed alternative milieufolding paradigm is discussed.",

By bioinformatic analysis of a PCSC-enriched gene signature, we identified the transcription factor HNF1A as a putative central regulator of PCSC function. Levels of HNF1A and its target genes were found to be elevated in PCSCs and tumorspheres, and depletion of HNF1A resulted in growth inhibition, apoptosis, impaired tumorsphere formation, PCSC depletion, and downregulation of OCT4 expression. Conversely, HNF1A overexpression increased PCSC numbers and tumorsphere formation in pancreatic cancer cells and drove PDA cell growth. Importantly, depletion of HNF1A in primary tumor xenografts impaired tumor growth and depleted PCSCs in vivo. Finally, we established an HNF1A-dependent gene signature in PDA cells that significantly correlated with reduced survivability in patients. These findings identify HNF1A as a central transcriptional regulator of the PCSC state and novel oncogene in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Hippo signaling is regulated by biochemical and biomechanical cues that influence the cytoskeleton, but the mechanisms that mediate this have remained unclear. We show that all three mammalian Ajuba family proteins - AJUBA, LIMD1, and WTIP - exhibit tension-dependent localization to adherens junctions, and that both Lats family proteins, LATS1 and LATS2, exhibit an overlapping tension-dependent junctional localization. This localization of Ajuba and Lats family proteins is also influenced by cell density, and by Rho activation. We establish that junctional localization of Lats kinases requires LIMD1, and that LIMD1 is also specifically required for the regulation of Lats kinases and YAP by Rho. Our results identify a biomechanical pathway that contributes to regulation of mammalian Hippo signaling, establish that this occurs through tension-dependent LIMD1-mediated recruitment and inhibition of Lats kinases in junctional complexes, and identify roles for this pathway in both Rho-mediated and density-dependent regulation of Hippo signaling.",

    "abstract": "The human kidney is a complex organ composed of specialized cell types. To better define this cellular complexity, we profiled the individual transcriptomes of 22,469 normal human kidney cells, identifying 27 cell types. We describe three distinct endothelial cell populations, a novel subset of intercalated cells, interstitial macrophage and dendritic cells, and identify numerous novel cell-type-specific markers, many validated using imaging mass cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed previously unknown intercalated-endothelial and intercalated-distal nephron interactions, suggesting a role in maintenance of vascular integrity and intercalated cell survival. Notably, kidney disease-associated genes were largely expressed in proximal tubules, podocytes, endothelial and myeloid cells, highlighting an underappreciated role for endothelial cells in kidney pathologies. Our analysis also provides a resource of cell type enriched markers, solute carriers, channels and lncRNAs. In summary, this cell-type-specific transcriptome resource provides the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of kidney function and dysfunction at single cell resolution.",

The aim of this study was to investigate post-photosynthetic fractionation in both above and below ground tissues and to evaluate potential hypotheses explaining differences in carbon isotope composition ({delta}13C) among different plant organs, which can provide valuable insights into plant physiology. The results revealed that there is no significant day-night difference in{delta} 13C of twig phloem water soluble organic materials (WSOM), which could be explained by the unrestricted exchange of triose-phosphates between the chloroplast and cytoplasm and a time lag for carbohydrate exportation.

    "abstract": "Though epidemiology dates back to the 1700s, most mathematical representations of epidemics still use transmission rates averaged at the population scale, especially for wildlife diseases. In simplifying the contact process, we ignore the heterogeneities in host movements that complicate the real world, and overlook their impact on spatiotemporal patterns of disease burden. Movement ecology offers a set of tools that help unpack the transmission process, letting researchers more accurately model how animals within a population interact and spread pathogens. Analytical techniques from this growing field can also help expose the reverse process: how infection impacts movement behaviors, and therefore other ecological processes like feeding, reproduction, and dispersal. Here, we synthesize the contributions of movement ecology in disease research, with a particular focus on studies that have successfully used movement-based methods to quantify individual heterogeneity in exposure and transmission risk. Throughout, we highlight the rapid growth of both disease and movement ecology, and comment on promising but unexplored avenues for research at their overlap. Ultimately, we suggest, including movement empowers ecologists to pose new questions expanding our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics, and improving our predictive capacity for wildlife and even human diseases.",

    "abstract": "PhyloNet was released in 2008 as a software package for representing and analyzing phylogenetic networks. At the time of its release, the main functionalities in PhyloNet consisted of measures for comparing network topologies and a single heuristic for reconciling gene trees with a species tree. Since then, PhyloNet has grown significantly. The software package now includes a wide array of methods for inferring phylogenetic networks from data sets of unlinked loci while accounting for both reticulation (e.g., hybridization) and incomplete lineage sorting. In particular, PhyloNet now allows for maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from gene tree estimates. Furthermore, Bayesian inference directly from sequence data (sequence alignments or bi-allelic markers) is implemented. Maximum parsimony is based on an extension of the \\\"minimizing deep coalescences\\\" criterion to phylogenetic networks, whereas maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference are based on the multispecies network coalescent. All methods allow for multiple individuals per species. As computing the likelihood of a phylogenetic network is computationally hard, PhyloNet allows for evaluation and inference of networks using a pseudo-likelihood measure. PhyloNet summarizes the results of the various analyses, and generates phylogenetic networks in the extended Newick format that is readily viewable by existing visualization software, [phylogenetic networks; reticulation; incomplete lineage sorting; multispecies network coalescent; Bayesian inference; maximum likelihood; maximum parsimony.]",

    "abstract": "Budding yeasts inhabit a range of environments by exploiting various metabolic traits. The genetic bases for these traits are mostly unknown, preventing their addition or removal in a chassis organism for metabolic engineering. To help understand the molecular evolution of these traits in yeasts, we created Analyzing Yeasts by Reconstructing Ancestry of Homologs (AYbRAH), an open-source database of predicted and manually curated ortholog groups for 33 diverse fungi and yeasts in Dikarya, spanning 600 million years of evolution. OrthoMCL and OrthoDB were used to cluster protein sequence into ortholog and homolog groups, respectively; MAFFT and PhyML were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of all homolog groups. Ortholog assignments for enzymes and small metabolite transporters were compared to their phylogenetic reconstruction, and curated to resolve any discrepancies. Information on homolog and ortholog groups can be viewed in the AYbRAH web portal (https://kcorreia.github.io/aybrah/) to review ortholog groups, predictions for mitochondrial localization and transmembrane domains, literature references, and phylogenetic reconstructions. Ortholog groups in AYbRAH were compared to HOGENOM, KEGG Orthology, OMA, eggNOG, and PANTHER. PANTHER and OMA had the most congruent ortholog groups with AYbRAH, while the other phylogenomic databases had greater amounts of under-clustering, over-clustering, or no ortholog annotations for proteins. Future plans are discussed for AYbRAH, and recommendations are made for other research communities seeking to create curated ortholog databases.",

Here we determine the importance of COMPASS in maintaining gene expression across lifespan in budding yeast. We find that COMPASS mutations dramatically reduce replicative lifespan and cause widespread gene expression defects. Known repressive functions of H3K4me2 are progressively lost with age, while hundreds of genes become dependent on H3K4me3 for full expression. Induction of these H3K4me3 dependent genes is also impacted in young cells lacking COMPASS components including the H3K4me3-specific factor Spp1. Remarkably, the genome-wide occurrence of H3K4me3 is progressively reduced with age despite widespread transcriptional induction, minimising the normal positive correlation between promoter H3K4me3 and gene expression. Our results provide clear evidence that H3K4me3 is required to attain normal expression levels of many genes across organismal lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Homology recognition and DNA-strand invasion ensure faithful homolog pairing and segregation during the first meiotic division1. RAD51 and DMC1 recombinases catalyze these steps2, with BRCA2 promoting their assembly into nuclear foci3. The recently identified human SWS1-SWSAP1 complex, related to the Shu complex in yeast, promotes RAD51 focus formation in cell lines4,5. We show here that mouse SWS1-SWSAP1 is critical for meiotic homologous recombination (HR) by promoting the assembly of RAD51 and DMC1 on early recombination intermediates. Absence of the complex perturbs meiotic progression in males and females and both sexes are sterile, although a fraction of meiocytes form crossovers. Remarkably, loss of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase CHK2 rescues fertility specifically in females without rescuing crossover numbers. Unlike the Shu complex, the BRCA2 C terminus (known to be required for RAD51 stabilization6,7) is dispensible for RAD51 and DMC1 focus formation. However, concomitant loss of the BRCA2 C terminus aggravates the meiotic defects in Shu mutant spermatocytes. These results point to a complex interplay of factors that ensure recombinase function and hence meiotic progression in the mouse.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between evolutionary genome remodeling and the three-dimensional structure of the genome remain largely unexplored. Here we use the heavily rearranged gibbon genome to examine how evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements impact genome-wide chromatin interactions, topologically associating domains (TADs), and their epigenetic landscape. We use high-resolution maps of gibbon-human breaks of synteny (BOS), apply Hi-C in gibbon, measure an array of epigenetic features, and perform cross-species comparisons. We find that gibbon rearrangements occur at TAD boundaries, independent of the parameters used to identify TADs. This overlap is supported by a remarkable genetic and epigenetic similarity between BOS and TAD boundaries, namely presence of CpG islands and SINE elements, and enrichment in CTCF and H3K4me3 binding. Cross-species comparisons reveal that regions orthologous to BOS also correspond with boundaries of large (400-600kb) TADs in human and other mammalian species. The co-localization of rearrangement breakpoints and TAD boundaries may be due to higher chromatin fragility at these locations and/or increased selective pressure against rearrangements that disrupt TAD integrity. We also examine the small portion of BOS that did not overlap with TAD boundaries and gave rise to novel TADs in the gibbon genome. We postulate that these new TADs generally lack deleterious consequences. Lastly, we show that limited epigenetic homogenization occurs across breakpoints, irrespective of their time of occurrence in the gibbon lineage. Overall, our findings demonstrate remarkable conservation of chromatin interactions and epigenetic landscape in gibbons, in spite of extensive genomic shuffling.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils and monocytes provide a first line of defense against infections as part of the innate immune system. Here we report the integrated analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes for circulating monocytes and neutrophils with the aim to enable downstream interpretation and functional validation of key regulatory elements in health and disease. We collected RNA-seq data, ChIP-seq of six histone modifications and of DNA methylation by bisulfite sequencing at base pair resolution from up to 6 individuals per cell type. Chromatin segmentation analyses suggested that monocytes have a higher number of cell-specific enhancer regions (4-fold) compared to neutrophils. This highly plastic epigenome is likely indicative of the greater differentiation potential of monocytes into macrophages, dendritic cells and osteoclasts. In contrast, most of the neutrophil-specific features tend to be characterized by repressed chromatin, reflective of their status as terminally differentiated cells. Enhancers were the regions where most of differences in DNA methylation between cells were observed, with monocyte-specific enhancers being generally hypomethylated. Monocytes show a substantially higher gene expression levels than neutrophils, in line with epigenomic analysis revealing that gene more active elements in monocytes. Our analyses suggest that the overexpression of c-Myc in monocytes and its binding to monocyte-specific enhancers could be an important contributor to these differences. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive epigenetic chart of chromatin states in primary human neutrophils and monocytes, thus providing a valuable resource for studying the regulation of the human innate immune system.",

In this study we explored this association by characterizing the genomic (~4.3 million SNPs) and epigenomic (~480 thousand CpG loci) variability between populations of ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. We found significant associations of methylation states in T-lymphocytes at several CpG loci and regions with ME/CFS phenotype. These methylation anomalies are in close proximity to genes involved with immune function and cellular metabolism. Finally, we found significant correlations of genotypes with methylation phenotypes associated with ME/CFS.

Epsilonproteobacteria, inhabiting ecologically, clinically or biotechnologically relevant environments, are currently considered to be hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria exclusively. Here, we report hydrogen production for a genus of free-living Epsilonproteobacteria, Sulfurospirillum spp. inhabiting sediments, wastewater plants, bioelectrodes, oil reservoirs, contaminated areas, or marine habitats. The amount of hydrogen production was largely different in two subgroups of Sulfurospirillum spp., represented by S. cavolei and S. multivorans. The former is shown to be the more potent hydrogen producer and excretes acetate as sole organic acid, while the latter exhibited a more flexible fermentation, producing additionally lactate and succinate. The observed hydrogen production could be assigned to a group 4 hydrogenase similar to Hydrogenase 4 (Hyf) in E. coli. We propose that Sulfurospirillum spp. produce molecular hydrogen with electrons derived from pyruvate oxidation by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and reduced ferredoxin. This hypothesis is supported by comparative proteome data, in which both PFOR and ferredoxin as well as hydrogenase 4 are up-regulated. A co-culture experiment with S. multivorans and Methanococcus voltae cultivated with lactate as sole substrate shows a syntrophic interaction between both organisms, since the former cannot grow fermentatively on lactate alone and the latter relies on hydrogen as electron donor. This opens up new perspectives on microbial communities, since Epsilonproteobacteria could play a yet unrecognized role as hydrogen producers in anoxic microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "The neocortex is a six-layered laminated structure with a precise anatomical and functional organization ensuring proper function. Laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as determined by termination of neuronal migration, is a key determinant of their ability to assemble into functional circuits. However, the exact contribution of laminar placement to dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation remains unclear. Here we manipulated the laminar position of cortical neurons by knocking down Dcx, a crucial effector of migration, and show that misplaced neurons fail to properly form dendrites, spines and functional glutamatergic synapses. We further show that knocking down Dcx in properly positioned neurons induces similar but milder defects, suggesting that the laminar misplacement is the primary cause of altered neuronal development. Thus, the specific laminar environment of their fated layers is crucial for the maturation of cortical neurons, and influences their functional integration into developing cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile many have emphasized impaired reward prediction error (RPE) signaling in schizophrenia, multiple studies suggest that some decision-making deficits may arise from overreliance on RPE systems together with a compromised ability to represent expected value. Guided by computational frameworks, we formulated and tested two scenarios in which maladaptive representation of expected value should be most evident, thereby delineating conditions that may evoke decision-making impairments in schizophrenia.\\n\\nMethodsIn a modified reinforcement learning paradigm, 42 medicated people with schizophrenia (PSZ) and 36 healthy volunteers learned to select the most frequently rewarded option in a 75-25 pair: once when presented with more deterministic (90-10) and once when presented with more probabilistic (60-40) pairs. Novel and old combinations of choice options were presented in a subsequent transfer phase. Computational modeling was employed to elucidate contributions from RPE systems (\\\"actor-critic\\\") and expected value (\\\"Q-leaming\\\").\\n\\nResultsPSZ showed robust performance impairments with increasing value difference between two competing options, which strongly correlated with decreased contributions from expected value-based (\\\"Q-leaming\\\") learning. Moreover, a subtle yet consistent contextual choice bias for the \\\"probabilistic\\\" 75 option was present in PSZ, which could be accounted for by a context-dependent RPE in the \\\"actor-critic\\\".\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide evidence that decision-making impairments in schizophrenia increase monotonically with demands placed on expected value computations. A contextual choice bias is consistent with overreliance on RPE-based learning, which may signify a deficit secondary to the maladaptive representation of expected value. These results shed new light on conditions under which decisionmaking impairments may arise.",

The utility of this protocol for applications such as disease modelling will rely implicitly on the developmental accuracy of the model, technical robustness of the protocol and transferability between iPSC lines. Here we report extensive transcriptional analyses of the sources of variation across the timecourse of differentiation from pluripotency to complete kidney organoid, focussing on repeated differentiations to day 18 organoid. Individual organoids generated within the same differentiation experiment show Spearmans correlation coefficients of >0.99. The greatest source of variation was seen between experimental batch, with the enrichment for genes that also varied temporally between day 10 and day 25 organoids implicating nephron maturation as contributing to transcriptional variance between individual differentiation experiments. A morphological analysis revealed a transition from renal vesicle to capillary loop stage nephrons across the same time period. Distinct iPSC clones were also shown to display congruent transcriptional programs with inter-experimental and inter-clonal variation most strongly associated with nephron patterning. Even epithelial cells isolated from organoids showed transcriptional alignment with total organoids of the same day of differentiation. This data provides a framework for managing experimental variation, thereby increasing the utility of this approach for personalised medicine and functional genomics.",

Herein, we have identified NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK) as an unrecognized suppressor of hepatocyte replication. Hepatic NIK was aberrantly activated in chronic liver disease. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of NIK or its downstream mediator IKK substantially accelerated hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Mechanistically, NIK and IKK suppressed the mitogenic JAK2/STAT3 pathway, thereby inhibiting hepatocyte cell cycle progression. Remarkably, inactivation of hepatic NIK largely reversed suppression of the hepatic JAK2/STAT3 pathway, hepatocyte replication, and liver regeneration induced by either chronic liver injury or metabolic stress. Our data suggest that hepatic NIK acts as a rheostat for liver regeneration to restrain liver overgrowth. Pathologic activation of hepatic NIK blocks hepatocyte replication, likely contributing to liver disease progression.",

Epicutaneous exposure to S. aureus induces Th17 responses through skin Langerhans cells (LCs), which paradoxically contribute to host defense but also to AD pathogenesis. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the association between S. aureus and skin inflammation are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that human LCs directly interact with S. aureus through the pattern-recognition receptor langerin (CD207). Human, but not mouse, langerin interacts with S. aureus through the conserved {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications on wall teichoic acid (WTA), thereby discriminating S. aureus from other staphylococcal species. Importantly, the specific S. aureus WTA glycoprofile strongly influences the level of Th1-and Th17-polarizing cytokines that are produced by in vitro generated LCs. Finally, in a murine epicutaneous infection model, S. aureus induced a more pronounced influx of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts in skin of human langerin transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice. Our findings provide molecular insight into the unique pro-inflammatory capacities of S. aureus in relation to inflammatory skin disease.",

    "abstract": "Test-negative designs have become commonplace in assessments of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness. Vaccine effectiveness is measured from the exposure odds ratio (OR) of vaccination among individuals seeking treatment for acute respiratory illness and receiving a laboratory test for influenza infection. This approach is widely believed to correct for differential healthcare-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. However, the relation of the measured OR to true vaccine effectiveness is poorly understood. We derive the OR under circumstances of real-world test-negative studies. The OR recovers the true vaccine direct effect when two conditions are met: (1) that individuals vaccination decisions are uncorrelated with exposure or susceptibility to infection, and (2) that vaccination confers \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" protection (whereby certain individuals have no protection while others are perfectly protected). Biased effect size estimates arise if either condition is unmet. Such bias may suggest misleading associations of the OR with time since vaccination or the force of infection of influenza. The test-negative design may also fail to correct for differential healthcare-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons without stringent criteria for enrollment and testing. Our findings demonstrate a need to reassess how data from test-negative studies are interpreted for policy decisions conventionally based on causal inferences.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConcerns that antimicrobial treatment may foster selection and transmission of resistant bacterial lineages have led to conflicting guidelines for clinical management of common non-severe infections. However, the impact of antimicrobial treatment on colonization dynamics is poorly understood. We used data from a previously-conducted trial of amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) to understand how antimicrobial treatment impacts the acquisition and clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae lineages with varying susceptibility to penicillin.\\n\\nMethods and findingsWe measured impacts of antimicrobial treatment on nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP) lineages at end-of-treatment and 15d, 30d, and 60d after treatment in a previously-conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Analyses were not specified in the original protocol. Among children 6-35 months of age with stringently-defined AOM, 162 were assigned amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 160 were assigned placebo. Children who did not show clinical improvement received open-label antimicrobial rescue treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate irrespective of the randomized treatment assignment, to which both patients and physicians were blinded. The intention-to-treat populations of the intervention and placebo arms thus received care resembling immediate antimicrobial therapy and watchful waiting, respectively. Immediate amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced PSSP carriage prevalence by 88% (95%CI: 76-96%) at end-of-treatment and by 27% (-3-49%) after 60d, but did not measurably alter PNSP carriage prevalence throughout follow-up. By end-of-treatment, 7% of children who carried PSSP at enrollment remained colonized in the amoxicillin-clavulanate arm, compared to 61% of PSSP carriers who received placebo; differences in carriage prevalence persisted at least 60d after treatment among children who carried PSSP at enrollment. Among children not carrying pneumococci at enrollment, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced PSSP acquisition by >80% over 15d. Among children who carried PNSP at enrollment, no differences in carriage prevalence of S. pneumoniae, PSSP, or PNSP were detected at follow-up visits.\\n\\nConclusionsIn a setting with low PNSP prevalence, antimicrobial therapy for AOM conferred a selective impact on colonizing S. pneumoniae by accelerating clearance, and delaying acquisition, of penicillin-susceptible lineages. Absolute risk of carrying PNSP was unaffected by treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00299455; Funding: NIH/NIGMS).",

In 2005 Partners In Health and the Rwandan Ministry of Health began a health system strengthening intervention in this region.\\n\\nMethodsCombining results from the 2005 and 2010 Demographic and Health Surveys with those from a supplemental 2010 survey, we compared changes in health system output indicators and population health outcomes between 2005 and 2010 as reported by 21,338 women living in the intervention area and similar rural areas, controlling for potential confounding by economic and demographic variables.\\n\\nResultsOverall health system coverage improved similarly in both regions between 2005 and 2010, with an indicator of composite coverage of child health interventions increasing from 57.9% to 75.0% in the intervention area and from 58.7% to 73.8% in other rural areas. Despite experiencing poorer health outcomes in 2005, the intervention area caught up to or exceeded other rural areas on 23 of 25 indicators. Most notably, under-five mortality declined by an annual rate of 12.8% in the intervention area, from 229.8 to 83.2 deaths per 1000 live births, and by 8.9% in other rural areas, from 157.7 to 75.8 deaths per 1000 live births. Improvements were most dramatic among the poorest households.\\n\\nConclusionWe observed dramatic improvements in population health outcomes including under-five mortality between 2005 and 2010 in rural Rwanda generally, and in the intervention area specifically.\\n\\nSUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this topic?C_ST_ABSO_LIMuch of the evidence that health system strengthening in rural Africa has improved health outcomes comes from studies of targeted regional interventions such as performance based financing or community health worker programs, rather than integrated interventions that encompass multiple components including infrastructure and supply chain investments, health management information system, workforce training and incentives at all levels, community health workers, and free services for poor patients.\\nC_LIO_LIIn addition to these experimental or quasi-experimental studies, a series of case studies have documented individual nations, pathways to achieving millennium development goal 4 target, the reduction of under-five mortality by two thirds between 1990 and 2015.\\nC_LIO_LIThese reports suggest that improvements in coverage of reproductive, maternal and child health indicators explain some, but not all, of the decline in child mortality and that these successes occurred in the context of national gains in health, nutrition and food security, sanitation, poverty reduction, and access to clean water.\\nC_LI\\n\\nWhat are the new findings?O_LICoverage of most maternal and child health care interventions improved at a similar pace in our rural intervention area and other rural areas.\\nC_LIO_LIDespite experiencing poorer health outcomes in 2005, our rural intervention area caught up to or exceeded other rural areas on 23 of 25 population health indicators by 2010.\\nC_LIO_LIInfant and under-5 mortality declined in our rural intervention area even more precipitously than in other rural areas of Rwanda between 2005 and 2010.\\nC_LI\\n\\nHow might this influence practice?O_LIThe process of strengthening national health systems often involves trade-offs between a focus on first testing individual programs that distributed widely, as is often practiced by pilot programs with multilateral institutions, or implementing multiple simultaneous programs locally. Our results show that integrated health system strengthening interventions can be locally adapted to enable the rapid expansion of health care coverage as well as dramatic improvements in population health outcomes.\\nC_LIO_LIIntegrated multi-level interventions can also help narrow the health care coverage and outcome gap between richer and poorer members of a society.\\nC_LIO_LINational governments can leverage nongovernmental partners to achieve the health related sustainable development goals through joint implementation of national health policy.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroudPyrethroids are the most common class of insecticide used worldwide for indoor residual spraying (IRS) against malaria vectors. Water-dispersible granules (WG) are a pyrethroid formulation to be applied after disintegration and dispersion in water with less risks of inhalation than using the usual wettable powder (WP) formulation. The objective of this small-scale field study was to evaluate efficacy and duration of insecticidal action of a new alpha-cypermethrin WG (250g a.i./Kg) against susceptible Anopheles gambiae in comparison with the WHO reference product (alpha-cypermethrin WP, 50g a.i./Kg) on the most common indoor surfaces in Benin.\\n\\nMethodsBoth formulations were applied at two target-dose concentrations in houses made of mud and cement in the Tokoli village in southern Benin. We measured the applied dose of insecticide by chemical analysis of filter paper samples collected from the sprayed inner walls. We recorded An. gambiae mortality and knock-down rates every 15 days during 6 months using standard WHO bioassays.\\n\\nResultsThe alpha-cypermethrin WG formulation did not last as long as the WP formulation on both surfaces. The difference is higher with the 30mg/m2 concentration for which the WP formulation reached the 80% mortality threshold during 2 months on the mud-plastered walls (3 months on cement) whereas the WG formulation last only one month (2 months on cement).\\n\\nConclusionsThe new WG formulation has a shorter efficacy than the WHO recommended WP formulation. In this trial, both the WG and WP formulations had low durations of efficacy that would need at least two rounds of spray to cover the entire transmission season.",

We aim to describe time trends, variation and factors associated with prescribing gluten-free foods in England.\\n\\nMethodsWe described long-term national trends in gluten-free prescribing, and practice and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level monthly variation in the rate of gluten-free prescribing (per 1000 patients) over time.

There was substantial variation in prescribing rates among practices (range 0 to 148 prescriptions per 1000 patients, interquartile range 7.3 to 31.8), driven in part by substantial variation at the CCG level, likely due to differences in prescribing policy. Practices in the most deprived quintile of deprivation score had a lower prescribing rate than those in the highest quintile (incidence rate ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.91).

    "abstract": "The discrepancy between the protective effect of early surgery of breast cancer and the poor benefits of mammography screening programs in the long term can be explained if mammography induces breast cancer at a much higher rate than anticipated. Mammography screening is associated in most countries with a higher incidence of breast cancer, attributed to overdiagnosis. X-ray-induced cancers can be distinguished from overdiagnosed cancers by the fact that their incidence depends on the number of previous mammograms, whereas overdiagnosis solely depends on the last screening mammogram, leading to diagnosis. The unbiased relationship between the number of mammograms and breast cancer incidence was evaluated from the data of the NHS Breast Cancer screening programme in women aged from 50 to 64 years in the United Kingdom. The delay between mammography and increased breast cancer incidence was confirmed from the data of the \\\"Age\\\" trial, a randomized trial of annual screening starting at age 40 in the UK. In women aged 50-64 attending screening at the NHS Breast Cancer programme, in situ breast cancer incidence increased linearly from 1993 to 2005 as a function of the number of mammograms. Incidence did not increase anymore after 2005 when the number of mammograms and the delay after screening was stable. Invasive breast cancer incidence increased more specifically in the 60-69 age group. The risk of breast cancer almost doubled after 15 years of screening. Additional cancers began to occur less than 6 years after mammography. These results are evidence that X-ray-induced carcinogenesis, rather than overdiagnosis, is the cause of the increase in breast cancer incidence.",

    "abstract": "When an animal is infected, its innate immune response needs to be tightly regulated across tissues and coordinated with other aspects of organismal physiology. Previous studies with Caenorhabditis elegans have demonstrated that insulin-like peptide genes are differentially expressed in response to different pathogens. They represent prime candidates for conveying signals between tissues upon infection. Here, we focused on one such gene, ins-11 and its potential role in mediating cross-tissue regulation of innate immune genes. While diverse bacterial intestinal infections can trigger the up-regulation of ins-11 in the intestine, we show that epidermal infection with the fungus Drechmeria coniospora triggers an upregulation of ins-11 in the epidermis. Using the Shigella virulence factor OpsF, a MAP kinase inhibitor, we found that in both cases, ins-11 expression is controlled cell autonomously by p38 MAPK, but via distinct transcription factors, STA-2/STAT in the epidermis and HLH-30/TFEB in the intestine. We established that ins-11, and the insulin signaling pathway more generally, are not involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the epidermis. The up-regulation of ins-11 in the epidermis does, however, affect intestinal gene expression in a complex manner, and has a deleterious effect on longevity. These results support a model in which insulin signaling, via ins-11, contributes to the coordination of the organismal response to infection, influencing the allocation of resources in an infected animal.",

    "abstract": "GATA transcription factors are highly conserved among eukaryotes and play roles in transcription of genes implicated in cancer progression and hematopoiesis. However, although their consensus binding sites have been well defined in vitro, the in vivo selectivity for recognition by GATA factors remains poorly characterized. Using ChIP-Seq, we identified the Dal80 GATA factor targets in yeast. Our data reveal Dal80 binding to a large set of promoters, sometimes independently of GATA sites. Strikingly, Dal80 was also detected across the body of promoter-bound genes, correlating with high, Dal80-sensitive expression. Mechanistic single-gene experiments showed that Dal80 spreading across gene bodies is independent of intragenic GATA sites but requires transcription elongation. Consistently, Dal80 co-purified with the post-initiation form of RNA Polymerase II. Our work suggests that GATA factors could play dual, synergistic roles during transcription initiation and post-initiation steps, promoting efficient remodeling of the gene expression program in response to environmental changes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGATA transcription factors are highly conserved among eukaryotes and play key roles in cancer progression and hematopoiesis. In budding yeast, four GATA transcription factors are involved in the response to the quality of nitrogen supply. We have determined the whole genome binding profile of one of them, Dal80, and revealed that it also binds across the body or promoter-bound genes. Our observation that ORF binding correlated with elevated transcription levels and exquisite Dal80 sensitivity suggests that GATA factors could play other, unexpected roles at post-initiation stages in eukaryotes.",

How this neural selectivity is achieved even at negative signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) remains unclear. We show that, under such conditions, a late cortical representation (i.e., neural tracking) of the ignored acoustic signal is key to successful separation of attended and distracting talkers (i.e., neural selectivity). We recorded and modelled the electroencephalographic response of 18 participants who attended to one of two simultaneously presented stories, while the SNR between the two talkers varied dynamically. The neural tracking showed an increasing early-to-late attention-biased selectivity. Importantly, acoustically dominant ignored talkers were tracked neurally by late involvement of fronto-parietal regions, which contributed to enhanced neural selectivity. This neural selectivity by way of representing the ignored talker poses a mechanistic neural account of attention under real-life acoustic conditions.",

One of the major challenges in systems biology is to develop computational methods for proper integration of multi-omics datasets. We propose OmicsNet that uses a multilayer network for the integration and analysis of multi-omics data of heterogeneous types. Each layer of the multilayer network represents a certain data type: input layers correspond to genotype features and nodes in the output layer correspond to phenotypes, while intermediate layers may represent genesets or biological concepts to facilitate functional interpretation of the data. OmicsNet then calculates the highest coefficient paths in multilayer network from each genomic feature to the phenotype by computing an integrated score along the paths. These paths may indicate the most plausible signalling cascade caused by perturbed genotype features leading to a particular phenotype response. With example applications, we illustrate the potential power of OmicsNet in the functional analysis, biomarker discovery and drug response prediction in personalized medicine using multi-omics data.",

    "abstract": "MotivationOxford Nanopore sequencing is a rapidly developed sequencing technology in recent years. To keep pace with the explosion of the downstream data analytical tools, a versatile Nanopore sequencing simulator is needed to complement the experimental data as well as to benchmark those newly developed tools. However, all the currently available simulators are based on simple statistics of the produced reads, which have difficulty in capturing the complex nature of the Nanopore sequencing procedure, the main task of which is the generation of raw electrical current signals.\\n\\nResultsHere we propose a deep learning based simulator, DeepSimulator, to mimic the entire pipeline of Nanopore sequencing. Starting from a given reference genome or assembled contigs, we simulate the electrical current signals by a context-dependent deep learning model, followed by a base-calling procedure to yield simulated reads. This workflow mimics the sequencing procedure more naturally. The thorough experiments performed across four species show that the signals generated by our context-dependent model are more similar to the experimentally obtained signals than the ones generated by the official context-independent pore model. In terms of the simulated reads, we provide a parameter interface to users so that they can obtain the reads with different accuracies ranging from 83% to 97%. The reads generated by the default parameter have almost the same properties as the real data. Two case studies demonstrate the application of DeepSimulator to benefit the development of tools in de novo assembly and in low coverage SNP detection.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software can be accessed freely at: https://github.com/lykaust15/deep_simulator.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella presents a global public health concern. Central to Salmonella pathogenicity is an ability to subvert host defence mechanisms through bacterial effectors that target key host proteins implicated in restricting infection. Thus, to gain insight into host-pathogen interactions governing Salmonella infection, a thorough understanding of host defence mechanisms is needed. To tackle this, we performed an in vivo genome-wide ENU mutagenesis screen to uncover novel host defence proteins. Through this screen we identified an uncharacterised protein, which we name CYRI1 (CYFIP-related RAC1 Interacting protein 1) that serves as a Salmonella resistance factor. We show that CYRI1 binds to the small GTPase RAC1 through a conserved domain present in CYFIP proteins, which are known RAC1 effectors that stimulate actin polymerisation. However, unlike CYFIP proteins, CYRI1 negatively regulates RAC1-driven actin cytoskeleton remodelling, thereby attenuating processes such as phagocytosis and cell migration. This, in turn, enables CYRI1 to counteract Salmonella at various stages of infection, including bacterial entry into epithelial cells, internalisation into myeloid-derived phagocytes as well as phagocyte-mediated bacterial dissemination. Together, this outlines a novel host defence mechanism that is crucial for determining bacterial fate.",

In reef-associated fish species, which live in fragmented habitats and adopt a wide range of dispersal strategies, we may expect species with greater dispersal ability to spread over larger ranges. However, empirical evidence for such a positive relationship between dispersal and range size in reef fishes remains scarce. Here, we unveil the more nuanced role of dispersal on the range size distribution of reef associated fishes using empirical data and a novel spatially explicit model.\\n\\nLocationTropical Eastern Pacific\\n\\nMajor taxa studiedReef-associated fishes\\n\\nMethodsWe estimated range size distributions for six different guilds of all reef-associated fishes with different dispersal abilities. We used a one-dimensional spatially explicit neutral model, which simulates the distribution of species along a linear coastline to explored the effect of dispersal, speciation and sampling on the distribution of range sizes. Our model adopts a more realistic gradual speciation process (protracted speciation) and incorporates important long distance dispersal events with a fat-tail dispersal kernel. We simulated our model using a highly efficient coalescence approach, which guarantees the metacommunity, is sampled at dynamic equilibrium. We fitted the model to the empirical data using an approximate Bayesian computation approach, with a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm.\\n\\nResultsStochastic birth, death, speciation and dispersal events alone can accurately explain empirical range size distributions for six different guilds of tropical, reef-associated fishes. Variation in range size distributions among guilds are explained purely by differences in dispersal ability with the best dispersers covering larger ranges.\\n\\nMain conclusionsA simple combination of neutral processes with guild-specific dispersal ability provides a general explanation for both within- and across-guild range size variation.

    "abstract": "The similarity between two DNA sequences is one of the most important measures in bioinformatics, but errors introduced during sequencing make values of similarity lower than they should be. Here we develop a method to correct raw sequence similarity for sequencing errors and estimate the original sequence similarity. Our method is simple and consists of a single equation with terms for 1) raw sequence similarity and 2) error rates (e.g., from Phred quality scores). We show the importance of this correction for 16S ribosomal DNA sequences from bacterial communities, where 97% similarity is a frequent threshold for clustering sequences for analysis. At that threshold and typical error rate of 0.2%, correcting for error increases similarity by 0.36 percentage points. This result shows that, if uncorrected, sequencing error would increase similarity thresholds and generate false clusters for analysis. Our method could be used to adjust thresholds for cluster-based analyses. Alternatively, because it requires no clustering to correct sequence similarity, it could usher in a new age of analyzing ribosomal DNA sequences without clustering.",

We first show that limb loss in snakes is associated with widespread divergence of limb regulatory elements. We next show that eye degeneration in subterranean mammals is associated with widespread divergence of eye regulatory elements. In both cases, sequence divergence results in an extensive loss of relevant transcription factor binding sites. Importantly, diverged regulatory elements are associated with key genes required for normal limb patterning or normal eye development and function, suggesting that regulatory divergence contributed to the loss of these phenotypes. Together, our results provide the first evidence that genome-wide decay of the phenotype-specific cis-regulatory landscape is a hallmark of lost morphological traits.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the development of algorithms to detect neuronal spiking activity from two-photon calcium imaging data has received much attention. Meanwhile, few researchers have examined the metrics used to assess the similarity of detected spike trains with the ground truth. We highlight the limitations of the two most commonly used metrics, the spike train correlation and success rate, and propose an alternative, which we refer to as CosMIC. Rather than operating on the true and estimated spike trains directly, the proposed metric assesses the similarity of the pulse trains obtained from convolution of the spike trains with a smoothing pulse. The pulse width, which is derived from the statistics of the imaging data, reflects the temporal tolerance of the metric. The final metric score is the size of the commonalities of the pulse trains as a fraction of their average size. Viewed through the lens of set theory, CosMIC resembles a continuous Sorensen-Dice coefficient -- an index commonly used to assess the similarity of discrete, presence/absence data. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed metric to discriminate the precision and recall of spike train estimates. Unlike the spike train correlation, which appears to reward overestimation, the proposed metric score is maximised when the correct number of spikes have been detected. Furthermore, we show that CosMIC is more sensitive to the temporal precision of estimates than the success rate.",

    "abstract": "Spike count correlations (SCCs) are ubiquitous in sensory cortices, are characterized by rich structure and arise from structured internal interactions. Yet, most theories of visual perception focus exclusively on the mean responses of individual neurons. Here, we argue that feedback interactions in primary visual cortex (V1) establish the context in which individual neurons process complex stimuli and that changes in visual context give rise to stimulus-dependent SCCs. Measuring V1 population responses to natural scenes in behaving macaques, we show that the fine structure of SCCs is stimulus-specific and variations in response correlations across-stimuli are independent of variations in response means. Moreover, we demonstrate that stimulus-specificity of SCCs in V1 can be directly manipulated by controlling the high-order structure of synthetic stimuli. We propose that stimulus-specificity of SCCs is a natural consequence of hierarchical inference where inferences on the presence of high-level image features modulate inferences on the presence of low-level features.",

    "abstract": "Past neuroimaging studies have reported that aberrant functional connectivity (FC) underlying auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenia is highly distributed over multiple functional networks. There is thus a need for exploratory approaches without limiting analysis to particular seed regions or functional networks, to identify FC alterations underlying AVH. We applied a multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of FC together with a series of post-hoc FC analyses to resting-state fMRI data acquired from 25 patients with schizophrenia and 25 matched healthy controls. First, the MVPA revealed multiple clusters exhibiting altered FC patterns in schizophrenia. Subsequent multiple linear regression analysis using scores of these clusters identified that FC alteration in the right cerebellum crus I was significantly associated with the severity of AVH. Furthermore, post-hoc FC analysis with the right crus I as a seed revealed significant FC alterations with regions distributed across multiple functional networks, including speech, default-mode, thalamus, and cerebellum. Subsequent linear regression analyses further demonstrated that, among these regions, only reduced FC in the left precuneus was significantly associated with the severity of AVH. Our unbiased exploratory analysis of FC data revealed a novel evidence for the crucial role of FC between cerebellar and default-mode networks in AVH. (198 words)",

    "abstract": "Brain decoding with multivariate classification and regression has provided a powerful framework for characterizing information encoded in population neural activity. Classification and regression models are respectively used to predict discrete and continuous variables of interest. However, cognitive and behavioral parameters that we wish to decode are often ordinal variables whose values are discrete but ordered, such as subjective ratings. To date, there is no established method of predicting ordinal variables in brain decoding. In this study, we present a new algorithm, sparse ordinal logistic regression (SOLR), that combines ordinal logistic regression with Bayesian sparse weight estimation. We found that, in both simulation and analyses using real functional magnetic resonance imaging data, SOLR outperformed ordinal logistic regression with non-sparse regularization, indicating that sparseness leads to better decoding performance. SOLR also outperformed classification and linear regression models with the same type of sparseness, indicating the advantage of the modeling tailored to ordinal outputs. Our results suggest that SOLR provides a principled and effective method of decoding ordinal variables.",

    "abstract": "The central extended amygdala (EAc) is a forebrain macrosystem which has been widely implicated in fear, anxiety and pain. Its two key structures, the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (STL) and the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA), share similar mesoscale connectivity. However, it is not known whether they also share similar cell-specific neuronal circuits. We addressed this question using tract-tracing and immunofluorescence to reveal the connectivity of two neuronal populations expressing either protein kinase C delta (PKC{delta}) or somatostatin (SOM). PKC{delta} and SOM are expressed predominantly in the dorsal part of STL (STLD) and in the lateral/capsular parts of CeA (CeL/C). We found that, in both STLD and CeL/C, PKC{delta}+ cells are the main recipient of extra-EAc inputs from the external lateral part of the parabrachial nucleus (LPBE), while SOM+ cells are the sources of long-range projections to extra-EAc targets, including LPBE and periaqueductal gray. PKC{delta}+ cells can also integrate inputs from posterior basolateral nucleus of amygdala or insular cortex. Within EAc, PKC{delta}+, but not SOM+ neurons, serve as the major source of projections to the ventral part of STL and to the medial part of CeA. However, both cell types mediate interconnections between STLD and CeL/C. These results unveil the pivotal positions of PKC{delta} and SOM neurons in organizing parallel cell-specific neuronal circuits of CeA and STL, which further support the idea of EAc as a structural and functional macrostructure.",

    "abstract": "Plant small RNAs regulate key physiological mechanisms through post-transcriptional and transcriptional silencing of gene expression. sRNAs fall into two major categories: those that are reliant on RNA Dependent RNA Polymerases (RDRs) for biogenesis and those that arent. Known RDR-dependent sRNAs include phased and repeat-associated short interfering RNAs, while known RDR-independent sRNAs are primarily microRNAs and other hairpin-derived sRNAs. In this study, we produced and analyzed small RNA-seq libraries from rdr1/rdr2/rdr6 triple mutant plants. Only a small fraction of all sRNA loci were RDR1/RDR2/RDR6-independent; most of these were microRNA loci or associated with predicted hairpin precursors. We found 58 previously annotated microRNA loci that were reliant on RDR1, -2, or -6 function, casting doubt on their classification. We also found 38 RDR1/2/6-independent small RNA loci that are not MIRNAs or otherwise hairpin-derived, and did not fit into other known paradigms for small RNA biogenesis. These 38 small RNA-producing loci have novel biogenesis mechanisms, and are frequently located in the vicinity of protein-coding genes. Altogether, our analysis suggest that these 38 loci represent one or more new types of small RNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSmall RNAs regulate gene expression in plants and are produced through a variety of previously-described mechanisms.

Given the complexity of high-dimensional temporal datasets, an analytical framework guided by a robust theory is needed to interpret time-sequential changes and to predict system dynamics. Herein, we use acute myeloid leukemia as a proof-of-principle to model gene expression dynamics in a transcriptome state-space constructed based on time-sequential RNA-sequencing data. We describe the construction of a state-transition model to identify state-transition critical points which accurately predicts leukemia development. We show an analytical approach based on state-transition critical points identified step-wise transcriptomic perturbations driving leukemia progression. Furthermore, the gene(s) trajectory and geometry of the transcriptome state-space provides biologically-relevant gene expression signals that are not synchronized in time, and allows quantification of gene(s) contribution to leukemia development.

PTPRT normally functions as a tumor suppressor and is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers including colorectal cancer2,3. We demonstrate that some of the tumor-derived mutations located in the pseudophosphatase domain impair the denitrase activity.

    "abstract": "As an image-based single-cell transcriptomics approach, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) allows hundreds to thousands of RNA species to be identified, counted and localized in individual cells while preserving the native spatial context of RNAs. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule FISH (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. The accuracy of RNA identification relies on spatially separated signals from individual RNA molecules, which limits the density of RNAs that can be measured and makes the multiplexed imaging of a large number of high-abundance RNAs challenging. Here we report an approach that combines MERFISH and expansion microscopy to substantially increase the total density of RNAs that can be measured. Using this approach, we demonstrate accurate identification and counting of RNAs, with a near 100% detection efficiency, in a ~130-RNA library composed of many high-abundance RNAs, the total density of which is more than 10 fold higher than previously reported. In parallel, we demonstrate the combination of MERFISH with immunofluorescence. These advances increase the versatility of MERFISH and will facilitate its application of a wide range of biological problems.",

Some strains of Wolbachia are parasitic, manipulating host reproduction to benefit themselves, while other strains of Wolbachia exhibit obligate or facultative mutualisms with their host. The effects of Wolbachia on its host are many, though primarily relate to host immune and reproductive function. Here we test the hypothesis that Wolbachia infection alters the frequency of homologous recombination during meiosis. We use D. melanogaster as a model system, and survey recombination in eight Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-uninfected strains, controlling for genotype. We measure recombination in two intervals of the genome. Our results indicate that Wolbachia infection is associated with increased recombination in one genomic interval and not the other. The effect of Wolbachia infection on recombination is thus heterogenous across the genome. Our data also indicate a reproductive benefit of Wolbachia infection; infected females show higher fecundity than their uninfected genotypic controls. Given the prevalence of Wolbachia infection in natural populations, our findings suggest that Wolbachia infection is likely to contribute to recombination rate and fecundity variation among individuals in nature.",

    "abstract": "During development, neurons form synapses with their fate-determined targets. While we begin to elucidate the mechanisms by which extracellular ligand-receptor interactions enhance synapse specificity by inhibiting synaptogenesis, our knowledge about their intracellular mechanisms remains limited. Here we show that Rap2 GTPase (rap-2) and its effector, TNIK (mig-15), act downstream of Plexin (plx-1) to restrict presynaptic assembly and to form tiled synaptic innervation in C. elegans. Both constitutively GTP- and GDP-forms of rap-2 mutants exhibit synaptic tiling defects as plx-1 mutants, suggesting that cycling of the RAP-2 nucleotide state is critical for synapse inhibition. Consistently, RAP-2 activity is locally suppressed by PLX-1. Excessive ectopic synapse formation in mig-15 mutants causes a severe synaptic tiling defect. Conversely, overexpression of mig-15 strongly inhibited synapse formation, suggesting that mig-15 is a negative regulator of synapse formation. These results reveal that subcellular regulation of small GTPase activity by Plexin shapes proper synapse patterning in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Here we address the current issues of inefficiency and over-penalization in the massively univariate approach followed by the correction for multiple testing, and propose a more efficient model that pools and shares information among brain regions. Using Bayesian multilevel (BML) modeling, we control two types of error that are more relevant than the conventional false positive rate (FPR): incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M). BML also aims to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency by having one integrative model and thereby dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) on FPR into quality control by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency The performance and validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BML may simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency, and promote results reporting in totality and transparency. The benefits of BML are illustrated in performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. The methodology also avoids the current practice of sharp and arbitrary thresholding in the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The BML approach with its auxiliary tools is available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.",

However, these long reads are very noisy, reaching an error rate of around 10 to 15% for Pacific Biosciences, and up to 30% for Oxford Nanopore. The error correction problem has been tackled by either self-correcting the long reads, or using complementary short reads in a hybrid approach, but most methods only focus on Pacific Biosciences data, and do not apply to Oxford Nanopore reads. Moreover, even though recent chemistries from Oxford Nanopore promise to lower the error rate below 15%, it is still higher in practice, and correcting such noisy long reads remains an issue.\\n\\nResultsWe present HG-CoLoR, a hybrid error correction method that focuses on a seed-and-extend approach based on the alignment of the short reads to the long reads, followed by the traversal of a variable-order de Bruijn graph, built from the short reads. Our experiments show that HG-CoLoR manages to efficiently correct Oxford Nanopore long reads that display an error rate as high as 44%. When compared to other state-of-the-art long read error correction methods able to deal with Oxford Nanopore data, our experiments also show that HG-CoLoR provides the best trade-off between runtime and quality of the results, and is the only method able to efficiently scale to eukaryotic genomes.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationHG-CoLoR is implemented is C++, supported on Linux platforms and freely available at https://github.com/morispi/HG-CoLoR\\n\\nContact: pierre.morisse2@univ-rouen.fr\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Here were use a panel of replicated experimental evolution populations of D. melanogaster to test whether variable environments favor enhanced plasticity in recombination rate and/or increased recombination rate in response to temperature. In contrast to expectation, we find no evidence for either enhanced plasticity in recombination or increased rates of recombination in the variable environment lines. Our data confirm a role of temperature in mediating recombination fraction in D. melanogaster, and indicate that recombination is genetically and plastically depressed under lower temperatures.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is pivotal in orchestrating gene expression patterns in various mammalian biological processes. Perturbation of the bovine alveolar macrophage (bAM) transcriptome, due to Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection, has been well documented; however, the impact of this intracellular pathogen on the bAM epigenome has not been determined. Here, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was used to assess the effect of M. bovis infection on the bAM DNA methylome. The methylomes of bAM infected with M. bovis were compared to those of non-infected bAM 24 hours post-infection (hpi). No differences in DNA methylation (CpG or non-CpG) were observed. Analysis of DNA methylation at proximal promoter regions uncovered >250 genes harbouring intermediately methylated (IM) promoters (average methylation of 33-66%). Gene ontology analysis, focusing on genes with low, intermediate or highly methylated promoters, revealed that genes with IM promoters were enriched for immune-related GO categories; this enrichment was not observed for genes in the high or low methylation groups. Targeted analysis of genes in the IM category confirmed the WGBS observation. This study is the first in cattle examining genome-wide DNA methylation at single nucleotide resolution in an important bovine cellular host-pathogen interaction model, providing evidence for IM promoter methylation in bAM.",

    "abstract": "Host susceptibility to tuberculosis and several other intracellular bacteria is controlled by a mouse genetic locus, sst1. Necrotic inflammatory lesions, similar to human TB granulomas, are a hallmark of the sst1 susceptible phenotype. Our previous work established that increased disease severity in sst1 susceptible mice reflects dysfunctional macrophage effector or tolerance mechanisms, but the molecular mechanisms have been unclear.\\n\\nWe demonstrate that sst1-deficient macrophages develop aberrant, biphasic responses to TNF, characterized by super-induction of stress and type I interferon pathways after prolonged TNF stimulation. This late stage response was initiated by oxidative stress and Myc. It was driven via a JNK - IFN{beta} - PKR feed-forward circuit locking the susceptible macrophages in a state of escalating stress. Consequently, prolonged TNF stimulation of the susceptible macrophages reduced their resilience to subsequent infection with intracellular bacteria.\\n\\nThe data support a generalizable paradigm in host - pathogen interactions, where susceptibility emerges gradually within inflammatory tissue due to imbalanced macrophage responses to growth, differentiation, activation and stress stimuli prior to encountering pathogens. This explains how successful pathogens may locally bypass mechanisms of resistance in otherwise immunocompetent hosts and suggests novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Coherent control of purposive actions emerges from the coordination of multiple brain circuits during learning. Dissociable brain circuits and cell-types are thought to preferentially participate in distinct learning mechanisms. For example, the activity of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons is proposed to primarily, or even exclusively, reflect reward prediction error signals in well-trained animals. To study the specific contribution of individual circuits requires observing changes before tight functional coordination is achieved. However, little is known about the detailed timing of the emergence of reward-related representations in dopaminergic neurons. Here we recorded activity of identified dopaminergic neurons as naive mice learned a novel stimulus-reward association. We found that at early stages of learning mDA neuron activity reflected both external (sensory) and internal (action initiation) causes of reward expectation. The increasingly precise correlation of action initiation with sensory stimuli rather than an evaluation of outcomes governed mDA neuron activity. Thus, our data demonstrate that mDA neuron activity early in learning does not reflect errors, but is more akin to a Hebbian learning signal - providing new insight into a critical computation in a highly conserved, essential learning circuit.",
