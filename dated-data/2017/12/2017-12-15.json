    "abstract": "Multiple approaches have been proposed to study differential splicing from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data1, including the analysis of transcript isoforms2,3, clusters of splice-junctions4,5, alternative splicing events6-8 and exonic regions9. However, many challenges remain unsolved, including the limitation in speed, the computing capacity and storage requirements, the constraints in the number of reads needed to achieve sufficient accuracy, and the lack of robust methods to account for variability between replicates and for analyses across multiple conditions. We present here a significant extension of SUPPA8 to enable streamlined analysis of differential splicing across multiple conditions, taking into account biological variability. We show that SUPPA differential splicing analysis achieves high accuracy using extensive experimental and simulated data compared to other methods; and shows higher accuracy at low sequencing depth, with short read lengths, and using replicas with unbalanced depth, which has important implications for the cost-effective use of RNA-seq data for splicing analysis. We also validate the analysis of multiple conditions with SUPPA by studying differential splicing during iPS-cell to neuron differentiation and during erythroblast differentiation, providing support for the applicability of SUPPA for the robust analysis of differential splicing beyond binary comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression data, such as those generated by next generation sequencing technologies (RNA-seq), are of an inherently relative nature: the total number of sequenced reads has no biological meaning. This issue is most often addressed with various normalization techniques which all face the same problem: once information about the total mRNA content of the origin cells is lost, it cannot be recovered by mere technical means. Additional knowledge, in the form of an unchanged reference, is necessary; however, this reference can usually only be estimated. Here we propose a novel method where sample normalization is unnecessary, but important insights can be obtained nevertheless. Instead of trying to recover absolute abundances, our method is entirely based on ratios, so normalization factors cancel by default. Although the differential expression of individual genes cannot be recovered this way, the ratios themselves can be differentially expressed (even when their constituents are not). Yet, most current analyses are blind to these cases, while our approach reveals them directly. Specifically, we show how the differential expression of gene ratios can be formalized by decomposing log-ratio variance (LRV) and deriving intuitive statistics from it. Although small LRVs have been used to detect proportional genes in gene expression data before, we focus here on the change in proportionality factors between groups of samples (e.g. tissue-specific proportionality). For this, we propose a statistic that is equivalent to the squared t-statistic of one-way ANOVA, but for gene ratios. In doing so, we show how precision weights can be incorporated to account for the peculiarities of count data, and, moreover, how a moderated statistic can be derived in the same way as the one following from a hierarchical model for individual genes. We also discuss approaches to deal with zero counts, deriving an expression of our statistic that is able to incorporate them. In providing a detailed analysis of the connections between the differential expression of genes and the differential proportionality of pairs, we facilitate a clear interpretation of new concepts. The proposed framework is applied to a data set from GTEx consisting of 98 samples from the cerebellum and cortex, with selected examples shown. A computationally efficient implementation of the approach in R has been released as an addendum to the propr package.1",

    "abstract": "Many components of host-parasite interactions have been shown to affect the way virulence (i.e., parasite-induced harm to the host) evolves. However, coevolution of multiple parasite traits is often neglected. We explore how an immunosuppressive mechanism of parasites affects and co-evolves with virulence through multiple infections. Applying the adaptive dynamics framework to epidemiological models with coinfection, we show that immunosuppression is a double-edged-sword for the evolution of virulence. On one hand, it amplifies the adaptive benefit of virulence by increasing the abundance of coinfections through epidemiological feedbacks. On the other hand, immunosuppression hinders host recovery, prolonging the duration of infection and elevating the cost of killing the host. The balance between the cost and benefit of immunosuppression varies across different background mortality rates of hosts. In addition, we find that immunosuppression evolution is influenced considerably by the precise trade-off shape determining the effect of immunosuppression on host recovery and susceptibility to further infection. These results demonstrate that the evolution of virulence is shaped by immunosuppression while highlighting that the evolution of immune evasion mechanisms deserves further research attention.",

    "abstract": "While studies increasingly document long-term change in community composition, whether long-term change occurs gradually or via rapid reorganization events remains unclear. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and a change-point model to examine the long-term dynamics of a desert rodent community undergoing compositional change over a 38-year span. Our approach detected three rapid reorganization events, where changes in the relative abundances of dominant and rare species occurred, and a separate period of increased variance in the structure of the community. These events coincided with time periods--possibly related to climate events--where the total abundance of rodents was extremely low. There are a variety of processes that could link low abundance events with a higher probability of rapid ecological transitions, including higher importance of stochastic processes (i.e., competitive interactions or priority effects) and the removal of structuring effects of competitive dominants or incumbent species. Continued study of the dynamics of community change will provide important information not only on the processes structuring communities, but will also provide guidance for forecasting how communities will undergo change in the future.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian inactive X chromosome (Xi) condenses into a bipartite structure with two superdomains of frequent long-range contacts separated by a boundary or hinge region. Using in situ DNase Hi-C in mouse cells with deletions or inversions within the hinge we show that the conserved repeat locus Dxz4 alone is sufficient to maintain the bipartite structure and that Dxz4 orientation controls the distribution of long-range contacts on the Xi. Frequent long-range contacts between Dxz4 and the telomeric superdomain are either lost after its deletion or shifted to the centromeric superdomain after its inversion. This massive reversal in contact distribution is consistent with the reversal of CTCF motif orientation at Dxz4. De-condensation of the Xi after Dxz4 deletion is associated with partial restoration of TADs normally attenuated on the Xi. There is also an increase in chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding on the Xi after Dxz4 deletion or inversion, but few changes in gene expression, in accordance with multiple epigenetic mechanisms ensuring X silencing. We propose that Dxz4 represents a structural platform for frequent long-range contacts with multiple loci in a direction dictated by the orientation of a bank of CTCF motifs at Dxz4, which may work as a ratchet to form the distinctive bipartite structure of the condensed Xi.",

    "abstract": "There is an overwhelming archeological and genetic evidence that modern speech apparatus was acquired by hominins by 600,000 years ago1. On the other hand, artifacts signifying modern imagination, such as (1) composite figurative arts, (2) bone needles with an eye, (3) construction of dwellings, and (4) elaborate burials arose not earlier than 70,000 years ago2. It remains unclear (1) why there was a long gap between acquisition of modern speech apparatus and modern imagination, (2) what triggered the acquisition of modern imagination 70,000 years ago, and (3) what role language might have played in this process. Our research into evolutionary origin of modern imagination has been driven by the observation of a temporal limit for the development of a particular component of imagination. Modern children not exposed to recursive language in early childhood never acquire the type of active constructive imagination called Prefrontal Synthesis (PFS). Unlike vocabulary and grammar acquisition, which can be learned throughout ones lifetime, there is a strong critical period for the development of PFS and individuals not exposed to recursive language in early childhood can never acquire PFS as adults. Their language will always lack understanding of spatial prepositions and recursion that depend on the PFS ability. In a similar manner, early hominins would not have been able to learn recursive language as adults and, therefore, would not be able to teach recursive language to their children. Thus, the existence of a strong critical period for PFS acquisition creates an evolutionary barrier for behavioral modernity. An evolutionary mathematical model suggests that a synergistic confluence of three events (1) a genetic mutation that extended the critical period by slowing down the prefrontal cortex development simultaneously in two or more children, (2) invention of recursive elements of language, such as spatial prepositions, by these children and (3) their dialogic communications using these recursive elements, resulted in concurrent conversion of a non-recursive communication system of their parents to recursive language and acquisition of PFS around 70,000 years ago.",

ProTINA uses a dynamic model of the cell-type specific protein-gene transcriptional regulation to infer network perturbations from steady state and time-series differential gene expression profiles. A candidate protein target is scored based on the gene networks dysregulation, including enhancement and attenuation of transcriptional regulatory activity of the protein on its downstream genes, caused by drug treatments. For benchmark datasets from three drug treatment studies, ProTINA was able to provide highly accurate protein target predictions and to reveal the mechanism of action of compounds with high sensitivity and specificity.

    "abstract": "The progressive maturation of cells down differentiation lineages is controlled by collaborative interactions between networks of extracellular signals and intracellular transcription factors. In the vertebrate spinal cord, FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid signaling pathways regulate the progressive caudal-to-rostral maturation of neural progenitors by regulating a poorly understood gene regulatory network of transcription factors. We have mapped out this gene regulatory network in the chicken pre-neural tube, identifying CDX4 as a dual-function core component that simultaneously regulates gradual loss of cell potency and acquisition of differentiation states: in a caudal-to-rostral direction, CDX4 represses the early neural differentiation marker Nkx1.2 and promotes the late neural differentiation marker Pax6. Significantly, CDX4 prevents premature PAX6-dependent neural differentiation by blocking Ngn2 activation. This regulation of CDX4 over Pax6 is restricted to the rostral pre-neural tube by Retinoic Acid signaling. Together, our results show that in the spinal cord, CDX4 is part of the gene regulatory network controlling the sequential and progressive transition of states from high to low potency during neural progenitor maturation. Given CDX well-known involvement in Hox gene regulation, we propose that CDX factors coordinate the maturation and axial specification of neural progenitor cells during spinal cord development.",

    "abstract": "By tethering their circular genomes (episomes) to host chromatin, DNA tumor viruses ensure retention and segregation of their genetic material during cell divisions. Despite functional genetic and crystallographic studies, there is little information addressing the three-dimensional structure of these tethers in cells, issues critical for understanding persistent infection by these viruses. Here, we have applied direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to establish the nanoarchitecture of tethers within cells latently infected with the oncogenic human pathogen, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Each KSHV tether comprises a series of homodimers of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) that bind with their C-termini to the tandem array of episomal terminal repeats (TRs) and with their N-termini to host chromatin. Super-resolution imaging revealed that individual KSHV tethers possess similar overall dimensions and, in aggregate, fold to occupy the volume of a prolate ellipsoid. Using plasmids with increasing numbers of TRs, we found that tethers display polymer power-law scaling behavior with a scaling exponent characteristic of active chromatin. For plasmids containing a two-TR tether, we determined the size, separation, and relative orientation of two distinct clusters of bound LANA, each corresponding to a single TR. From these data, we have generated a three-dimensional model of the episomal half of the tether that integrates and extends previously established findings from epi-fluorescent, crystallographic, and epigenetic approaches. Our findings also validate the use of dSTORM in establishing novel structural insights into the physical basis of molecular connections linking host and pathogen genomes.",

While Mendelian diseases are predominantly caused by rare alleles, their cumulative contribution to complex phenotypes remains largely unknown. We develop and rigorously validate an approach to jointly estimate the contribution of all alleles, including singletons, to phenotypic variation. We apply our approach to transcriptional regulation, an intermediate between genetic variation and complex disease. Using whole genome DNA and lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data from 360 European individuals, we conservatively estimate that singletons contribute ~25% of cis-heritability across genes (dwarfing the contributions of other frequencies). Strikingly, the majority (~76%) of singleton heritability derives from ultra-rare variants absent from thousands of additional samples. We develop a novel inference procedure to demonstrate that our results are consistent with rampant purifying selection shaping the regulatory architecture of most human genes.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental property of the nervous systems across the animal kingdom is the ability to select appropriate actions and sequences of actions in response to sensory cues. Many behaviors are physically mutually exclusive so commitment to one requires complete suppression of others. Further, because many behaviors are serially organized into sequences of actions, mechanisms must also exist that control transitions from one action to the next. The circuit mechanisms by which nervous systems achieve behavioral choice, stability and transitions are still incompletely understood. A key step in understanding these functions is to identify neurons and brain areas involved in controlling behavioral choice, stability and transitions. To do this, we developed an approach where we combined a large-scale neuronal inactivation screen with an automated action detection of sensorimotor decisions and sequences in response to a sensory cue. We characterized the response of wild-type larvae to a mechanosensory stimulus and found they can respond to the stimulus with a probabilistic sequence of 4 possible actions (head-cast, head-retraction, back-up and stop). We analyzed behaviors from around three hundred thousand larvae (N=2.9x105) where we selectively silenced small numbers of neuron types and individual neuron types systematically across the nervous system using a library of Drosophila GAL4 lines and determined the effect of these manipulations on larval mechanosensory responses. We identified neurons and brain-regions that when inactivated affected Drosophila larval sensorimotor decisions and sequence transitions between the different actions. Specifically, we identified 51 candidate lines for sensory processing and 24 candidate lines for competitive interactions. We also detected phenotype categories for sequence transitions consistent with a model of sequence generation where transitions and reversals are independently controlled. These findings provide the basis for understanding how sensorimotor decisions and sequence transition are controlled by the nervous system.",

They are composed of a unified promoter architecture of divergent transcripton initiation and gene promoters may exhibit enhancer function. However, it is currently unclear how expression strength of a regulatory element relates to its enhancer strength and if the unifying architecture is conserved across Metazoa. Here we investigate the transcription initiation landscape and its associated RNA decay in D. melanogaster. Surprisingly, we find that the majority of active gene-distal enhancers and a considerable fraction of gene promoters are divergently transcribed. We observe quantitative relationships between enhancer potential, expression level and core promoter strength, providing an explanation for indirectly related histone modifications that are reflecting expression levels. Lowly abundant unstable RNAs initiated from weak core promoters are key characteristics of gene-distal developmental enhancers, while the housekeeping enhancer strengths of gene promoters reflect their expression strengths. The different layers of regulation mediated by gene-distal enhancers and gene promoters are also reflected in chromatin interaction data. Our results suggest a unified promoter architecture of many D. melanogaster regulatory elements, that is universal across Metazoa, whose regulatory functions seem to be related to their core promoter elements.",

    "abstract": "Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is an enzyme responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters from cholesterol (CHOL) and phospholipid (PL) molecules in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that play a crucial role in the reverse cholesterol transport and the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, it is poorly understood how LCAT interacts with lipoprotein surfaces and how apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) activates it. Thus, here we have studied the interactions between LCAT and lipids through extensive atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reveal mechanistic details behind the cholesterol esterification process catalyzed by LCAT. In addition, we studied the binding of LCAT to apoA-I derived peptides, and their effect on LCAT lipid association utilizing experimental surface sensitive biophysical methods. Our simulations show that LCAT anchors itself to lipoprotein surfaces by utilizing non-polar amino acids located in the membrane-binding domain and the active site tunnel opening. Meanwhile, the membrane anchoring hydrophobic amino acids attract cholesterol molecules next to them. The results also highlight the role of the lid-loop in the lipid binding and conformation of LCAT with respect to the lipid surface. The apoA-I derived peptides from the LCAT activating region bind to LCAT and promote its lipid surface interactions, although some of these peptides do not bind lipids individually. By means of free-energy calculations we provided a hypothetical explanation for this mechanism. We also found that the transfer free-energy of PL to the active site is consistent with the activation energy of LCAT. Furthermore, the entry of CHOL molecules into the active site becomes highly favorable by the acylation of SER181. The results provide substantial mechanistic insights concerning the activity of LCAT that may lead to the development of novel pharmacological agents preventing CHD in the future.",

The model is easy to setup and infection and virulence can be monitored for up to 10 days. In a first test of the model, we found that mung bean seedlings infected with PAO1 showed poor development of roots and high mortality rates compared to un-infected controls. We also found that a quorum sensing (QS) mutant was significantly less virulent when compared with the PAO1 wild type. Our work introduces a new tool for studying virulence in P. aeruginosa, that will allow for high throughput virulence studies of mutants, and for testing the in vivo efficacy of new therapies at a time when new antimicrobial drugs are desperately needed.",

Mechanistic understanding has been largely constrained by the lack of a model system with advanced tools for molecular manipulation. We recently discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae infecting wild Drosophila, and established methods to infect D. melanogaster in the lab. Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection: hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides and affix in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the fly nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. Given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster, we believe this new system will enable rapid progress in understanding the mechanistic basis of E. muscaes behavioral manipulation in the fly.",

    "abstract": "A variety of self-interacting domains, defined at different levels of resolution, have been described in mammalian genomes. These include Chromatin Compartments (A and B)1, Topologically Associated Domains (TADs)2,3, contact domains4,5, sub-TADs6, insulated neighbourhoods7 and frequently interacting regions (FIREs)8. Whereas many studies have found the organisation of self-interacting domains to be conserved across cell types389, some do form in a lineage-specific manner6710. However, it is not clear to what degree such tissue-specific structures result from processes related to gene activity such as enhancer-promoter interactions or whether they form earlier during lineage commitment and are therefore likely to be prerequisite for promoting gene expression. To examine these models of genome organisation in detail, we used a combination of high-resolution chromosome conformation capture, a newly-developed form of quantitative fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and super-resolution imaging to study a 70 kb self-interacting domain containing the mouse -globin locus. To understand how this self-interacting domain is established, we studied the region when the genes are inactive and during erythroid differentiation when the genes are progressively switched on. In contrast to many current models of long-range gene regulation, we show that an erythroid-specific, decompacted self-interacting domain, delimited by convergent CTCF/cohesin binding sites, forms prior to the onset of robust gene expression. Using previously established mouse models we show that formation of the self-interacting domain does not rely on interactions between the -globin genes and their enhancers. As there are also no tissue-specific changes in CTCF binding, then formation of the domain may simply depend on the presence of activated lineage-specific cis-elements driving a transcription-independent mechanism for opening chromatin throughout the 70 kb region to create a permissive environment for gene expression. These findings are consistent with a model of loop-extrusion in which all segments of chromatin, within a region delimited by CTCF boundary elements, can contact each other. Our findings suggest that activation of tissue-specific element(s)within such a self-interacting region is sufficient to influence all chromatin within the domain.",

This switch in euchromatin activity is accompanied by changes in its spatial distribution. How euchromatin rearrangements are established is unknown. Here we use super-resolution and live-cell microscopy to show that transcriptionally inactive euchromatin moves away from transcriptionally active euchromatin. This movement is driven by the formation of RNA-enriched microenvironments that exclude inactive euchromatin. Using theory, we show that the segregation into RNA-enriched microenvironments and euchromatin domains can be considered an active microemulsion. The tethering of transcripts to chromatin via RNA polymerase II forms effective amphiphiles that intersperse the two segregated phases. Taken together with previous experiments, our data suggest that chromatin is organized in the following way: heterochromatin segregates from euchromatin by phase separation, while transcription organizes euchromatin similar to an active microemulsion.",

    "abstract": "Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is the predominant method to quantify microbial compositions of environmental samples and to discover previously unknown lineages. Its unique structure of interspersed conserved and variable regions is an excellent target for PCR and allows for classification of reads at all taxonomic levels. However, the relatively few phylogenetically informative sites prevent confident phylogenetic placements of novel lineages that are deep branching relative to reference taxa. This problem is exacerbated when only short 16S rRNA gene fragments are sequenced. To resolve their placement, it is common practice to gather more informative sites by combining multiple conserved genes into concatenated datasets. This however requires genomic data which may be obtained through relatively expensive metagenome sequencing and computationally demanding analyses. Here we develop a protocol that amplifies a large part of 16S and 23S rRNA genes within the rRNA operon, including the ITS region, and sequences the amplicons with PacBio long-read technology. We tested our method with a synthetic mock community and developed a read curation pipeline that reduces the overall error rate to 0.18%. Applying our method on four diverse environmental samples, we were able to capture near full-length rRNA operon amplicons from a large diversity of prokaryotes. Phylogenetic trees constructed with these sequences showed an increase in statistical support compared to trees inferred with shorter, Illumina-like sequences using only the 16S rRNA gene (250 bp). Our method is a cost-effective solution to generate high quality, near full-length 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences from environmental prokaryotes.",

While cuticle rigidity and pigmentation depend to a large extent on the end products of a branched biochemical pathway - the melanin pathway - little is known whether genes in this pathway also play a role in the development of specific scale morphologies that might aid in the development of structural colors. Here we first show that male and female Bicyclus anynana butterflies display differences in scale size and scale morphology but no differences in scale color. Then we use CRISPR/Cas9 to show that knockout mutations in five genes that function in the melanin pathway, TH, DDC, yellow, ebony, and aaNAT, affect both the fine structure and the coloration of the wing scales. Most dramatically, mutations in yellow led to extra horizontal cuticular laminae on the surface of scales, whereas mutations in DDC led to taller and sheet-like vertical cuticular laminae throughout each scale. We identify some of the first genes affecting the development of scale morphology, and whose regulation and pleiotropic effects may be important in creating, as well as limiting, the diversity of structural as well as pigmentary colors observed in butterflies.",

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy type 1 (Na-1) and 2 (Na-2) are characterized by an inability to sustain wakefulness and are likely caused by degeneration of orexin neurons. Near complete orexin neurodegeneration depletes orexin-A from the cerebrospinal fluid and produces Na-1. The pathophysiology of Na-2 is less understood, but has been hypothesized to be due to less extensive loss of orexin neurotransmission. The orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A mouse allows conditional control over the extent and timing of orexin neurodegeneration. To evaluate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, orexin-A positive cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes (determined by piezoelectric monitoring) were correlated within individual mice after different protocols of diet-controlled neurodegeneration. Partial ablations that began during the first 8 days of study were 14% larger than partial ablations induced during the last 8 days of study, six weeks later and prior to sacrifice of all mice, suggesting orexin-A positive cell death continued despite the resumption of conditions intended to keep orexin neurons intact. Sleep/wake of mice with 71.0% orexin-A positive cell loss, initiated at the beginning of study, resembled that of orexin-intact controls more than mice with near complete neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with 56.6% orexin-A positive cell loss, created at the end of study, had sleep/wake phenotypes that were similar to those of mice with near complete orexin-A positive cell loss. Collectively, these results suggest that compensatory wake-promotion develops in mice that have some critical portion of their orexinergic system remaining after partial ablation.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2 is poorly understood but has been hypothesized to be due, at least in part, to degeneration of a smaller proportion of the orexin neuronal field than occurs in narcolepsy type 1. To evaluate a transgenic mouse model of narcolepsy type 2, we correlated the sleep/wake phenotypes of individual, male and female adult mice that received diet-induced conditional ablations of orexin neurons with their orexin cell counts. Using a translatable measure of narcolepsy sleepiness severity, we demonstrated that compensatory wake-promoting responses developed in mice concurrent with progressive orexin neurodegeneration. These results provide important details necessary for preclinical drug discovery for therapeutic areas characterized by orexin insufficiency, such as narcolepsy, Parkinsons disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Moreover, when grafted into chick embryos, WNT and ACTIVIN treated human cells induce and contribute autonomously to a secondary axis while inducing neural fate in the host.

    "abstract": "Plant growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by the genetic control of both plant morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvements of WUE using traditional methods have proven difficult due to low throughput and environmental heterogeneity encountered in field settings. To overcome these limitations the study presented here utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and water use of an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and water use in this system are strongly correlated; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, water use and WUE were all heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions of the model C4 species Setaria can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation is regarded as one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications and plays a key role in regulating cellular processes. In this work we carried out a comparative bioinformatics analysis of phosphoproteomics data, to profile two model species representing the largest subclasses in flowering plants the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana and the monocot Oryza sativa, to understand the extent to which phosphorylation signaling and function is conserved across evolutionary divergent plants. Using pre-existing mass spectrometry phosphoproteomics datasets and bioinformatic tools and resources, we identified 6,537 phosphopeptides from 3,189 phosphoproteins in Arabidopsis and 2,307 phosphopeptides from 1,613 phosphoproteins in rice. The relative abundance ratio of serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in rice and Arabidopsis were highly similar: 88.3: 11.4: 0.4 and 86.7: 12.8: 0.5, respectively. Tyrosine phosphorylation shows features different from serine and threonine phosphorylation and was found to be more frequent in doubly-phosphorylated peptides in Arabidopsis. We identified phosphorylation sequence motifs in the two species to explore the similarities, finding nineteen pS motifs and two pT motifs that are shared in rice and Arabidopsis; among them are five novel motifs that have not previously been described in both species. The majority of shared motif-containing proteins were mapped to the same biological processes with similar patterns of fold enrichment, indicating high functional conservation. We also identified shared patterns of crosstalk between phosphoserines with motifs pSXpS, pSXXpS and pSXXXpS, where X is any amino acid, in both species indicating this is an evolutionary conserved signaling mechanism in flowering plants. However, our results are suggestive that there is greater co-occurrence of crosstalk between phosphorylation sites in Arabidopsis, and we were able to identify several pairs of motifs that are statistically significantly enriched to co-occur in Arabidopsis proteins, but not in rice.",

    "abstract": "SNP-based information is used in several existing clustering methods to detect shared genetic ancestry or to identify population substructure. Here, we present a methodology for unsupervised clustering using iterative pruning to capture fine-scale structure called IPCAPS. Our method supports ordinal data which can be applied directly to SNP data to identify fine-scale population structure. We compare our method to existing tools for detecting fine-scale structure via simulations. The simulated data do not take into account haplotype information, therefore all markers are independent. Although haplotypes may be more informative than SNPs, especially in fine-scale detection analyses, the haplotype inference process often remains too computationally intensive. Therefore, our strategy has been to restrict attention to SNPs and to investigate the scale of the structure we are able to detect with them. We show that the experimental results in simulated data can be highly accurate and an improvement to existing tools. We are convinced that our method has a potential to detect fine-scale structure.",

Furthermore, the exponential increase of these archives is likely to be further spurred by automated diagnostics. To unlock their use for scientific research and real-time surveillance we have combined knowledge about bacterial genetic variation with ideas used in web-search, to build a DNA search engine for microbial data that can grow incrementally. We indexed the complete global corpus of bacterial and viral whole genome sequence data (447,833 genomes), using four orders of magnitude less storage than previous methods. The method allows future scaling to millions of genomes. This renders the global archive accessible to sequence search, which we demonstrate with three applications: ultra-fast search for resistance genes MCR1-3, analysis of host-range for 2827 plasmids, and quantification of the rise of antibiotic resistance prevalence in the sequence archives.",

Due to its broad tumor suppressive activity, it is not surprising that miR34a expression is altered in a wide variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. However, the mechanisms by which miR34a is regulated in these cancers is largely unknown. In this study, we find that a long non-coding RNA transcribed antisense to the miR34a host gene, is critical for miR34a expression and mediation of its cellular functions in multiple types of human cancer. We name this long non-coding RNA lncTAM34a, and characterize its ability to facilitate miR34a expression under different types of cellular stress in both TP53 deficient and wild type settings.",

    "abstract": "The ability of disseminated cancer cells to evade the immune response is a critical step for efficient metastatic progression. Protection against an immune attack is often provided by the tumour microenvironment that suppresses and/or excludes cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive metastatic disease with unmet needs, yet the immuno-protective role of the metastatic tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer is not completely understood. In this study we find that macrophage-derived granulin contributes to cytotoxic CD8+ T cell exclusion in metastatic livers. Mechanistically, we find that granulin expression by macrophages is induced in response to colony stimulating factor-1. Genetic depletion of granulin reduces the formation a fibrotic stroma, thereby allowing T cell entry at the metastatic site. While metastatic PDAC tumours are largely resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy, blockade of PD-1 in granulin depleted tumours restored the anti-tumour immune defence and dramatically decreased metastatic tumour burden. These findings suggest that targeting granulin may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to restore CD8+ T cell infiltration in metastatic PDAC, thereby converting PDAC metastatic tumours, which are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors, into tumours that respond to immune checkpoint inhibition therapies.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric traits related to categorically-defined psychiatric disorders are heritable and present to varying degrees in the general population. In this study, we test the hypothesis that genetic risk factors associated with psychiatric disorders are also associated with continuous variation in milder population traits. We combine a contemporary twin analytic approach with polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses in a large population-based twin sample. Questionnaires assessing traits of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning difficulties, tic disorders (TD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, major depressive disorder (MDD), mania and psychotic experiences were administered to a large, Swedish twin sample. Individuals with clinical psychiatric diagnoses were identified using the Swedish National Patient Register. Joint categorical/continuous twin modeling was used to estimate genetic correlations between psychiatric diagnoses and continuous traits. PRS for psychiatric disorders were calculated based on independent discovery genetic data. The association between PRS for each disorder and related continuous traits was tested. We found mild to strong genetic correlations between psychiatric diagnoses and corresponding traits (ranging from .31-.69) in the twin analyses. There was also evidence of association between PRS for ASD, ADHD, TD, OCD, anxiety, MDD and schizophrenia with related population traits. These results indicate that genetic factors which predispose to psychiatric disorders are also associated with milder variation in characteristic traits throughout the general population, for many psychiatric phenotypes. This finding supports the conceptualization of psychiatric disorders as the extreme ends of continuous traits.",

    "abstract": "Reaction norms or tolerance curves have often been used to predict how organisms deal with fluctuating environments. A potential drawback is that reaction norms measured in different constant environments may not capture all aspects of organismal responses to fluctuating environments. We examined growth of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa in fluctuating temperatures and tested if growth in fluctuating temperatures can be explained simply by growth in different constant temperatures or if more complex models are needed. In addition, as previous studies on fluctuating environments have revealed that past temperatures that organisms have experienced can affect their response to current temperature, we tested the roles of different epigenetic mechanisms in response to fluctuating environments using different mutants. We found that growth of Neurospora can be predicted in fluctuating temperatures to some extent if acclimation times are taken into account in the model. Interestingly, while fluctuating environments have been linked with epigenetic responses we found only some evidence of involvement of epigenetic mechanisms on tolerating fluctuating temperatures. Mutants which lacked H3K4 or H3K36 methylation had slightly impaired response to temperature fluctuations, in addition the H3K4 methylation mutant and a mutant in the RNA interference pathway had altered acclimation times.",

We reconstruct three TADs obtained from the mammalian X chromosome for three stages of differentiation. We compute the radius of gyration of TADs and the encounter probability between genomic segments. We found 1) a synchronous compaction and decompaction of TADs throughout differentiation and 2) secondary structures such as meta-TADs in 5C data resulting from weak inter-TAD interactions. Finally, the present method links steady-state to dynamic properties of the chromatin revealed by the distribution of anomalous exponents of single loci trajectories, reconstructed from HiC data.",

When coupled with transcriptomic analyses, LOF methods allow researchers to dissect networks of transcriptional regulation. However, a major concern is nonspecific targeting, which involves depletion of transcripts other than those intended. The off-target effects of each of these common LOF methods have yet to be compared at the whole-transcriptome level. Here, we systematically and experimentally compared non-specific activity of RNAi, antisense oligonucleotides and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). All three methods yielded non-negligible offtarget effects in gene expression, with CRISPRi exhibiting clonal variation in the transcriptional profile. As an illustrative example, we evaluated the performance of each method for deciphering the role of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) with unknown function. Although all LOF methods reduced expression of the candidate lncRNA, each method yielded different sets of differentially expressed genes upon knockdown as well as a different cellular phenotype. Therefore, to definitively confirm the functional role of a transcriptional regulator, we recommend the simultaneous use of at least two different LOF methods and the inclusion of multiple, specifically designed negative controls.",

Although molecular data indicate the presence of phylogenetically diverse AOA from the Nitrosocaldus clade, group 1.1b and group 1.1a Thaumarchaea in terrestrial high-temperature habitats, only one enrichment culture of an AOA thriving above 50 {degrees}C has been reported and functionally analyzed. In this study, we physiologically and genomically characterized a novel Thaumarchaeon from the deep-branching Nitrosocaldaceae family of which we have obtained a high ([~]85 %) enrichment from biofilm of an Icelandic hot spring (73 {degrees}C). This AOA, which we provisionally refer to as \\\"Candidatus Nitrosocaldus islandicus\\\", is an obligately thermophilic, aerobic chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizer, which stoichiometrically converts ammonia to nitrite at temperatures between 50 {degrees}C and 70 {degrees}C. Ca. N. islandicus encodes the expected repertoire of enzymes proposed to be required for archaeal ammonia oxidation, but unexpectedly lacks a nirK gene and also possesses no identifiable other enzyme for nitric oxide (NO) generation. Nevertheless, ammonia oxidation by this AOA appears to be NO-dependent as Ca. N. islandicus is, like all other tested AOA, inhibited by the addition of an NO scavenger. Furthermore, comparative genomics revealed that Ca. N. islandicus has the potential for aromatic amino acid fermentation as its genome encodes an indolepyruvate oxidoreductase (iorAB) as well as a type 3b hydrogenase, which are not present in any other sequenced AOA. A further surprising genomic feature of this thermophilic ammonia oxidizer is the absence of DNA polymerase D genes - one of the predominant replicative DNA polymerases in all other ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaea. Collectively, our findings suggest that metabolic versatility and DNA replication might differ substantially between obligately thermophilic and other AOA.",

Increased activity in prefrontal regions at month 1 correlated with weight loss at months 1 and 3. Weight loss was also correlated with increased plasma ghrelin and decreased leptin at month 1, and these changes were associated with greater food cue reactivity in reward-related brain regions. However, the reduction in leptin did not counteract weight loss; indeed, it was correlated with further weight loss at month 3. Activation in a network of prefrontal regions associated with self-control could contribute to individual differences in weight loss and maintenance, whereas we failed to find that the hormonal adaptations play a major role.",

    "abstract": "Learning to make rewarding choices in response to stimuli depends on a slow but steady process, reinforcement learning, and a fast and flexible, but capacity limited process, working memory. Using both systems in parallel, with their contributions weighted based on performance, should allow us to leverage the best of each system: rapid early learning, supplemented by long term robust acquisition. However, this assumes that using one process does not interfere with the other. We use computational modeling to investigate the interactions between the two processes in a behavioral experiment, and show that working memory interferes with reinforcement learning. Previous research showed that neural representations of reward prediction errors, a key marker of reinforcement learning, were blunted when working memory was used for learning. We thus predicted that arbitrating in favor of working memory to learn faster in simple problems would weaken the reinforcement learning process. We tested this by measuring performance in a delayed testing phase where the use of working memory was impossible, and thus subject choices depended on reinforcement learning. Counter-intuitively, but confirming our predictions, we observed that associations learned most easily were retained worse than associations learned slower: using working memory to learn quickly came at the cost of long-term retention. Computational modeling confirmed that this could only be accounted for by working memory interference in reinforcement learning computations. These results further our understanding of how multiple systems contribute in parallel to human learning, and may have important applications for education and computational psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Choice alternatives often consist of multiple attributes that vary in how successfully they predict reward. Some standard theoretical models assert that decision makers evaluate choices either by weighting those attribute optimally in light of previous experience (so-called rational models), or adopting heuristics that use attributes suboptimally but in a manner that yields reasonable performance at minimal cost (e.g., the take-the-best heuristic). However, these models ignore both the possibility that decision makers might learn to associate reward with whole stimuli (a particular combination of attributes) rather than individual attributes and the common finding that decisions can be overly influenced by recent experiences and exhibit cue competition effects. Participants completed a two-alternative choice task where each stimulus consisted of three binary attributes that were predictive of reward, albeit with different degrees of reliability. Their choices revealed that, rather than using only the \\\"best\\\" attribute, they made use of all attributes but in manner that reflected the classic cue competition effect known as overshadowing. The time needed to make decisions increased as the number of relevant attributes increased, suggesting that reward was associated with attributes rather than whole stimuli. Fitting a family of computational models formed by crossing attribute use (optimal vs. only the best), representation (attribute vs. whole stimuli), and recency (biased or not), revealed that models that performed better when they made use of all information, represented attributes, and incorporated recency effects and cue competition. We also discuss the need to incorporate selective attention and hypothesis-testing like processes to account for results with multiple-attribute stimuli.",

Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster exposed to looming stimuli in a confined arena either froze or fled. The probability of freezing versus fleeing was modulated by the flys walking speed at the time of threat, demonstrating that freeze/flee decisions were context dependent. We describe a pair of descending neurons crucially implicated in freezing. Genetic silencing of P9 descending neurons disrupted freezing yet did not prevent fleeing. Optogenetic activation of both P9 neurons induced running and freezing in a state-dependent manner. Our findings establish walking speed as a key factor in defensive response choices and reveal a pair of descending neurons as a critical component in the circuitry mediating selection and execution of freezing or fleeing behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Aging (senescence) is characterized by the development of numerous pathologies, some of which limit lifespan. Key to understanding aging is discovery of the mechanisms (etiologies) that cause senescent pathology. In Caenorhabditis elegans a major senescent pathology of unknown etiology is atrophy of its principal metabolic organ, the intestine. Here we identify a cause of not only this pathology, but also of yolky lipid accumulation and redistribution (a form of senescent obesity): autophagy-mediated conversion of intestinal biomass into yolk. Inhibiting intestinal autophagy or vitellogenesis rescues both visceral pathologies, and can also extend lifespan. This defines a disease syndrome leading to polymorbidity and contributing to late-life mortality. Activation of gut-to-yolk biomass conversion by insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) promotes reproduction and senescence. This illustrates how major, IIS-promoted senescent pathologies in C. elegans can originate not from damage accumulation, but from continued action of a wild-type function (vitellogenesis), consistent with the recently proposed hyperfunction theory of aging.",

UE morphology data was retrospectively analysed in 23 consecutive patients undergoing PVI under general anaesthesia. PVI without spontaneous / dormant recovery was achieved in all, employing 16.3[3.2] minutes (mean [SD]) of temperature-controlled RF at 30W. All first-ablated LAPW sites demonstrated RS UE morphology pre-ablation, with RF-induced pure R UE morphology change in 98%.

Importantly, neither the first-site RF duration (14.9 versus 15.0s) nor the maximum ablation catheter tip distance moved (during RF) were significantly different, yet the mean CF was significantly higher at right-sided sites (16.5g versus 11.2g; p=0.002).

The knowledge on these mechanisms is expanding and should be converted into guidelines for tackling the disease. We discuss here formalization of biological knowledge into a comprehensive resource Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN) and Google Maps-based tool NaviCell that supports map navigation. The application of maps for omics data visualisation in the context of signalling maps is possible using NaviCell Web Service module and NaviCom tool for generation of network-based molecular portraits of cancer using multi-level omics data. We review how these resources and tools are applied for cancer pre-clinical studies among others for rationalizing synergistic effect of drugs and designing complex disease stage-specific druggable interventions following structural analysis of the maps together with omics data. Modules and maps of ACSN as signatures of biological functions, can help in cancer data analysis and interpretation. In addition, they can also be used to find association between perturbations in particular molecular mechanisms to the risk of a specific cancer type development. These approaches and beyond help to study interplay between molecular mechanisms of cancer, deciphering how gene interactions govern hallmarks of cancer in specific context. We discuss a perspective to develop a flexible methodology and a pipeline to enable systematic omics data analysis in the context of signalling network maps, for stratifying patients and suggesting interventions points and drug repositioning in cancer and other human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolutionary history and subclonal composition of a tumour represents one of the key challenges in overcoming treatment failure due to resistant cell populations. Most of the current data on tumour genetics stems from short read bulk sequencing data. While this type of data is characterised by low sequencing noise and cost, it consists of aggregate measurements across a large number of cells. It is therefore of limited use for the accurate detection of the distinct cellular populations present in a tumour and the unambiguous inference of their evolutionary relationships. Single-cell DNA sequencing instead provides data of the highest resolution for studying intra-tumour heterogeneity and evolution, but is characterised by higher sequencing costs and elevated noise rates. In this work, we develop the first computational approach that infers trees of tumour evolution from combined single-cell and bulk sequencing data. Using a comprehensive set of simulated data, we show that our approach systematically outperforms existing methods with respect to tree reconstruction accuracy and subclone identification. High fidelity reconstructions are obtained even with a modest number of single cells. We also show that combining single-cell and bulk sequencing data provides more realistic mutation histories for real tumours.",

    "abstract": "How do migration and acculturation (i.e. psychological or behavioral change resulting from migration) affect within- and between-group cultural variation? Here I answer this question by drawing analogies between genetic and cultural evolution. Population genetic models show that migration rapidly breaks down between-group genetic structure. In cultural evolution, however, migrants or their descendants can acculturate to local behaviors via social learning processes such as conformity, potentially preventing migration from eliminating between-group cultural variation. An analysis of the empirical literature on migration suggests that acculturation is common, with second and subsequent migrant generations shifting, sometimes substantially, towards the cultural values of the adopted society. Yet there is little understanding of the individual-level dynamics that underlie these population-level shifts. To explore this formally, I present models quantifying the effect of migration and acculturation on between-group cultural variation, for both neutral and costly cooperative traits. In the models, between-group cultural variation, measured using F statistics, is eliminated by migration and maintained by conformist acculturation. The extent of acculturation is determined by the strength of conformist bias and the number of demonstrators from whom individuals learn. Acculturation is countered by assortation, the tendency for individuals to preferentially interact with culturally-similar others. Unlike neutral traits, cooperative traits can additionally be maintained by payoff-biased social learning, but only in the presence of strong sanctioning institutions. Overall, the models show that surprisingly little conformist acculturation is required to maintain realistic amounts of between-group cultural diversity. While these models provide insight into the potential dynamics of acculturation and migration in cultural evolution, they also highlight the need for more empirical research into the individual-level learning biases that underlie migrant acculturation.",

    "abstract": "Shifts of attention within mental representations based on retroactive cues (retro-cues) facilitate performance in working memory tasks. It was suggested that this retro-cue benefit is related to the concentration of working memory resources on a subset of representations, thereby improving storage and retrieval at the cost of non-cued items. However, the attentional mechanisms underlying this updating of working memory representations remain unknown. Here, we present EEG data for distinguishing between target enhancement and distractor suppression processes in the context of retroactive attentional orienting. Therefore, we used a working memory paradigm with retro-cues indicating a shift of attention to either a lateralized or non-lateralized item. There was an increase of posterior alpha power contralateral compared to ipsilateral to the irrelevant item when a non-lateralized mental representation was cued and a contralateral suppression of posterior alpha power when a lateralized item had to be selected. This suggests that both inhibition of the non-cued information and enhancement of the target representation are important features of attentional orienting within working memory. By further presenting cues to either remember or to forget a working memory representation, we give a first impression of these retroactive attentional sub-processes as two separable cognitive mechanisms.",

One specific application area of interest is the surveillance of infectious diseases.

Prior work in this area has provided some proof of this principle but has not analytically treated the effect of imperfect observation on the behavior of indicators. This work provides expected values for several moments of the number of reported cases, where reported cases follow a binomial or negative binomial distribution with a mean based on the number of deaths in a birth-death-immigration process over some reporting interval. The normalized second factorial moment and the decay time of the number of case reports are two indicators that are insensitive to the reporting probability. Simulation is used to show how this insensitivity could be used to distinguish a trend of increased reporting from a trend of increased transmission. The simulation study also illustrates both the high variance of estimates and the possibility of reducing the variance by avE. ODea eraging over an ensemble of estimates from multiple time series.",

We use simulations to compare the effectiveness of intervention strategies based on randomly screening people for infection, treating the partners of infected people, and rescreening for infection after treatment. We compare the difference between treating the partners of an infected person both with, and without, testing them first for infection. The highest prevalence is among young sexually active individuals. We calibrate the model parameters to agree with recent survey data showing chlamydia prevalence of 14% of the women and 9% of the men in the 15 - 25 year-old African American residents of New Orleans, Louisiana. We observed that although increased chlamydia screening and treating most of the partners of infected people will reduce the incidence, these mitigations alone are not sufficient to control the epidemic. The model predicts that the current epidemic can brought under control once over half of the partners of infected people are tested and treated.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic factors contribute to anorexia nervosa (AN); and the first genome-wide significant locus has been identified. We describe methods and procedures for the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI), an international collaboration designed to rapidly recruit 13000 individuals with AN as well as ancestrally matched controls. We present sample characteristics and the utility of an online eating disorder diagnostic questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population research.\\n\\nMethodsANGI recruited from the United States (US), Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK). Recruitment was via national registers (SE, DK); treatment centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and social and traditional media (US, ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN diagnosis based on DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea). Recruited controls had no lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors. To assess the positive and negative predictive validity of the online eating disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H.\\n\\nResultsBlood samples and clinical information were collected from 13,364 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls. Online diagnostic phenotyping was effective and efficient; the validity of the questionnaire was acceptable.\\n\\nConclusionsOur multipronged recruitment approach was highly effective for rapid recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other groups. High online presence of individuals with AN rendered the Internet/social media a remarkably effective recruitment tool in some countries. ANGI has substantially augmented Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN sample collection. ANGI is a registered clinical trial: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01916538; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01916538?cond=Anorexia+Nervosa&draw=1&rank=3.",

    "abstract": "Radiation tolerant Deinococcus radiodurans R1 is reported to be a potential bacterium for the treatment of low level active wastes. So far there are no reports on the biofilm producing capability of D. radiodurans and heavy metal biosorption. In this study, it was observed that a recombinant D. radiodurans strain with a plasmid harbouring gfp and kanR has formed significant biofilm (~10 m thick). Analysis of biofilm matrix components produced by D. radiodurans showed that the matrix consisted primarily of proteins and carbohydrates with a little amount of extracellular DNA (eDNA). Further, studies showed that D. radiodurans biofilm formation was enhanced at higher concentrations (up to 25 mM) of Ca2+. Further studies on D. radiodurans biofilm showed that Ca2+ enhanced significant biosorption of the heavy metals (Co, Ni). In the presence of 25 mM Ca2+, the D. radiodurans (Kanr) biofilm showed 35% and 25% removal of Co2+ and Ni2+ respectively. While in the absence of Ca2+, D. radiodurans biofilm showed relatively low biosorption of Co (7%) and Ni (3%). Ca2+ also significantly enhanced exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in the biofilm matrix. This infers that EPS could have mediated the heavy metal biosorption. This study signifies the potential use of D. radiodurans biofilm in the remediation of radioactive waste components.\\n\\nSignificance and Impact of this StudyThis is the first ever recorded study on the Deinococcus radiodurans R1 biofilm. This organism, being the most radioresistant micro-organism ever known, has always been speculated as a potential bacterium to develop a bioremediation process for radioactive heavy metal contaminants. However, the lack of biofilm forming capability proved to be a bottleneck in developing such technology. This study records the first incidence of biofilm formation in a recombinant D. radiodurans, serendipitously, and also discusses its implications in removal of heavy-metals, such as Co and Ni.",

    "abstract": "Emotion effects in event-related potentials (ERPs) during reading have been observed at very short latencies of around 100 to 200 ms after word onset. The nature of these effects remains a matter of debate: First, it is possible that they reflect semantic access, which might thus occur much faster than proposed by most reading models. Second, it is possible that associative learning of a words shape might contribute to the emergence of emotion effects during visual processing. The present study addressed this question by employing an associative learning paradigm on pronounceable letter strings (pseudowords). In a learning session, letter strings were associated with positive, neutral or negative valence by means of monetary gain, loss or zero-outcome. Crucially, half of the stimuli were learned in the visual modality, while the other half was presented acoustically, allowing for experimental separation of associated valence and physical percept. In a test session one or two days later, acquired letter string were presented in an old/new decision task while we recorded event-related potentials. Behavioural data showed an advantage for gain-associated stimuli both during learning and in the delayed old/new task. Early emotion effects in ERPs were limited to visually acquired letter strings, but absent for acoustically acquired letter strings. These results imply that associative learning of a words visual features might play an important role in the emergence of emotion effects at the stage of perceptual processing.",

    "abstract": "Placebo response is universally observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), yet these effects are commonly dismissed as consequences of uncontrollable confounds. In this prospective neuroimaging-based RCT performed in chronic back pain patients, we demonstrate that the intensity, but not quality, of pain is diminished with placebo pill ingestion. The response to placebo pills depended on brain: subcortical limbic volume asymmetry, sensorimotor cortical thickness, and functional coupling of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with the periaqueductal grey (PAG), the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and the precentral gyrus (PreCG); and psychological factors. All features were present before exposure to the pill; most remained stable across treatment and washout periods, although specific functional coupling between DLPFC and PAG dissipated with repeated exposure. These brain properties and specific psychological factors, such as interoceptive awareness and openness, were also predictive of the magnitude of response (continuous variable). We used machine learning in a fully cross-validated procedure and demonstrated that psychological factors were sufficient for classifying and predicting response magnitude; and response magnitude could also be predicted from a functional network (nodes mainly located in the limbic community, the DLPFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the temporo-parietal junction); the combined model explained 36% of the variance. Together, our results demonstrate that placebo pill analgesia observed in clinical trials depends on a combination of brain properties and specific psychological factors.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a remarkably high capacity and long duration memory for complex scenes. Previous research documents the neural substrates that allow for efficient categorization of scenes from other complex stimuli like objects and faces, but the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying scene memory are less well understood. In the present study, we used high density EEG during a visual continuous recognition task in which new, old, and scrambled scenes consisting of color outdoor photographs were presented at an average rate 0.26 Hz. Old scenes were single repeated presentations occurring within either a short-term ([&le;] 20 seconds) or longer-term intervals of between 30 sec and 3 minutes or 4 and 10 minutes. Overall recognition was far above chance, with better performance at short- than longer-term intervals. A group ANOVA found parietal and frontal ERPs discriminated the three scene types as early as 59 ms after stimulus onset. Parietal ERPs were greater for old compared to new scenes by 189 ms, while fronto-temporal ERPs were greater for new compared to old scenes by 194 ms. For old scenes presented within longer-term intervals, parieto-temporal and centro-frontal ERPs were greater by 228 and 355 ms respectively compared to old scenes presented within a short-term interval. Supervised machine learning exhibited above-chance decoding of scene type by 275 ms. Single-subject BOLD-fMRI showed greater activity for old scenes across frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex. These converging findings show that a widespread network including parietal, frontal, and temporal regions supports short- and long-term scene memory.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe ability to recognize a scene as novel or familiar is critical for basic cognition. Scene recognition plays an important role in episodic memory because it helps us quickly establish place, a first step in recalling where previous events occurred. Short-term recognition supports our ability to detect changes in the immediate environment, an ability critical to survival. Scene recognition after a longer-term interval is often the essential cue for retrieving autobiographical memories. Previous behavioral studies demonstrate high capacity and long duration scene memory. Neural studies have identified the brain regions that support scene-specific processing. The present study extends this research by filling a gap in understanding how distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity support short- and long-term scene memory.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal glycine transporter GlyT2 is an essential regulator of glycinergic neurotransmission that recaptures glycine in presynaptic terminals to facilitate quantal transmitter packaging in synaptic vesicles. Alterations in GlyT2 expression or activity result in lower cytosolic glycine levels, emptying glycinergic synaptic vesicles and impairing neurotransmission. Lack of glycinergic neurotransmission caused by GlyT2 loss-of-function mutations results in Hyperekplexia, a rare neurological disease characterized by generalized stiffness and motor alterations that may result in sudden infant death. Although the importance of GlyT2 in pathology is known, how this transporter is regulated at the molecular level is poorly understood, limiting current therapeutic strategies. Guided by an unbiased screening, we discovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ligand of Numb protein X1 (LNX1) modulates the ubiquitination status of GlyT2. LNX1 ubiquitinates a cytoplasmic C-terminal lysine cluster in GlyT2 (K751, K773, K787 and K791) through its N-terminal RING-finger domain, and this process regulates the expression levels and transport activity of GlyT2 in neurons. These experiments reveal for the first time the identity of an E3 ubiquitin-ligase acting on GlyT2 and identify a novel regulatory mechanism by which neurons regulate GlyT2 expression and activity.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) generates gamma (40 - 100 Hz) and beta (15 - 30 Hz) oscillations of the local field potential (LFP). Gamma oscillations arise at the peak of inhalation supported by dendrodendritic interactions between glutamatergic mitral cells (MCs) and GABAergic granule cells (GCs). Beta oscillations occur in response to odorants in learning or odor sensitization paradigms, but their generation mechanism and function are still poorly understood. When centrifugal inputs to the OB are blocked, beta oscillations disappear, but gamma oscillations persist. Centrifugal input targets primarily GABAergic interneurons in the GC layer (GCL) and regulates GC excitability, which suggests a causal link between beta oscillations and GC excitability. Previous modeling work from our laboratory predicted that convergence of excitatory/inhibitory inputs onto MCs and centrifugal inputs onto GCs can increase GC excitability sufficiently to drive beta oscillations primarily through voltage dependent calcium channel (VDCC) mediated GABA release, independently of NMDA channels. We test this model by examining the influence of NMDA and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on GC excitability and beta oscillations. Intrabulbar scopolamine (muscarinic antagonist) infusion decreased or completely suppressed odor-evoked beta in response to a strong stimulus, but increased beta power in response to a weak stimulus, as predicted by our model. Piriform cortex (PC) beta power was unchanged. Oxotremorine (muscarinic agonist) tended to suppress all oscillations, probably from over-inhibition. APV, an NMDA receptor antagonist, suppressed gamma oscillations selectively (in OB and PC), lending support to the models prediction that beta oscillations can be supported by VDCC mediated currents.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyO_LIOlfactory bulb beta oscillations rely on granule cell excitability.\\nC_LIO_LIReducing granule cell excitability with scopolamine reduces high volatilityinduced beta power but increases low volatility-induced beta power.\\nC_LIO_LIPiriform cortex beta oscillations maintain power when olfactory bulb beta power is low, and the system maintains beta band coherence.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Working memory, the ability to keep recently encountered information available for immediate processing, has been proposed to rely on two mechanisms that appear difficult to reconcile: selfsustained neural firing, or the opposite--activity-silent synaptic traces. Here we show that both phenomena can co-exist within a unified system in which neurons hold information in both activity and synapses. Rapid plasticity in flexibly-coding neurons allows features to be bound together into objects, with an important emergent property being the focus of attention. One memory item is held by persistent activity in an attended or \\\"focused\\\" state, and is thus remembered better than other items. Other, previously attended items can remain in memory but in the background, encoded in activity-silent synaptic traces. This dual functional architecture provides a unified common mechanism accounting for a diverse range of perplexing attention and memory effects that have been hitherto difficult to explain in a single theoretical framework.",

Using genome-wide approaches, integrating ChIPmentation and mRNA-sequencing data, we have elucidated the regulatory circuitry governed by the IRE1a-XBP1 pathway in type-2 T helper cells (Th2). We show that the XBP1 transcription factor is activated by splicing in vivo in T helper cell lineages. We report a comprehensive repertoire of XBP1 target genes in Th2 lymphocytes. We found that the pathway is conserved across cell types in terms of resolving secretory stress, and has T helper cell-specific functions in controlling activation-dependent Th2 cell proliferation and regulating cytokine expression in addition to secretion.

Using immunohistochemistry, CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, and overexpression of specific mRNAs, we describe the functional association between Par-proteins, {beta}-catenin, and snail transcription factor genes in N. vectensis embryos. We demonstrate that the aPKC/Par complex regulates the localization of {beta}-catenin in the ectoderm by stabilizing its role in cell-adhesion, and that endomesodermal epithelial cells are organized by a different cell-adhesion system than that of overlying ectoderm. We also show that ectopic expression of snail genes, which are expressed in mesodermal derivatives in bilaterians, are sufficient to downregulate Par-proteins and translocate {beta}-catenin from the junctions to the cytoplasm in ectodermal cells. These data provide molecular insight into the evolution of epithelial structure and distinct mesodermal tissue in metazoan embryos.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is a major impediment to the success of cancer treatment. Resistance is typically thought to arise through random genetic mutations, after which mutated cells expand via Darwinian selection. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that the progression to drug resistance need not occur randomly, but instead may be induced by the treatment itself, through either genetic changes or epigenetic alterations. This relatively novel notion of resistance complicates the already challenging task of designing effective treatment protocols. To better understand resistance, we have developed a mathematical modeling framework that incorporates both spontaneous and drug-induced resistance. Our model demonstrates that the ability of a drug to induce resistance can result in qualitatively different responses to the same drug dose and delivery schedule. We have also proven that the induction parameter in our model is theoretically identifiable, and proposed an in vitro protocol which could be used to determine a treatments propensity to induce resistance.",

    "abstract": "How widespread ecological communities assemble remains a key question in ecology. Trophic interactions between widespread species may reflect a shared population history, or ecological sorting of local pools of species with very different population histories. Which scenario applies is central to the stability of trophic associations, and the potential for coevolution between species. Here we show how alternative community assembly hypotheses can be discriminated using whole genome data for component species, and provide a novel likelihood framework that overcomes current limitations in formal comparison of multispecies histories. We illustrate our approach by inferring the assembly history of a Western Palaearctic community of insect herbivores and parasitoid natural enemies, trophic groups that together comprise 50% of terrestrial species. We reject models of co-dispersal from a shared origin, and of delayed enemy pursuit of their herbivore hosts, arguing against herbivore attainment of  enemy-free space. The community-wide distribution of species expansion times is also incompatible with a random, neutral model of assembly. Instead, we reveal a complex assembly history of single- and multi-species range expansions through the Pleistocene from different directions and over a range of timescales. Our results suggest substantial turnover in species associations, and argue against tight coevolution in this system. The approach we illustrate is widely applicable to natural communities of non-model species, and makes it possible to reveal the historical backdrop against which selection acts.",

    "abstract": "Memory performance exhibits a high level of variability from moment to moment. Much of this variability may reflect inadequately controlled experimental variables, such as word memorability, past practice and subject fatigue. Alternatively, stochastic variability in performance may largely reflect the efficiency of endogenous neural processes that govern memory function. To help adjudicate between these competing views, we conducted a multisession study in which subjects completed 552 trials of a delayed free-recall task. Applying a statistical model to predict variability in each subjects recall performance uncovered modest effects of word memorability, proactive interference, and other variables. In contrast to the limited explanatory power of these experimental variables, performance on the prior list strongly predicted current list recall. These findings suggest that endogenous factors underlying successful encoding and retrieval drive variability in performance.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression post-transcriptionally, implicated in virtually all biological processes. Although the effect of individual microRNAs is generally studied, the genome-wide role of multiple microRNAs is less investigated. We assessed paired genome-wide expression of microRNAs with total (cytoplasmic) and translational (polyribosome-bound) mRNA levels employing Frac-seq in human primary bronchoepithelium from healthy controls and severe asthmatics. Severe asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by poor response to therapy. We found genes (=all isoforms of a gene) and mRNA isoforms differentially expressed in asthma, with novel inflammatory and structural mechanisms disclosed solely by polyribosome-bound mRNAs. Gene expression (=all isoforms of a gene) and mRNA expression analysis revealed different molecular candidates and biological pathways, with differentially expressed polyribosome-bound and total mRNAs also showing little overlap. We reveal a hub of six dysregulated microRNAs accounting for [~]90% of all microRNA targeting, displaying preference for polyribosome-bound mRNAs. Transfection of this hub in healthy cells mimicked asthma characteristics. Our work demonstrates extensive post-transcriptional gene dysregulation in asthma, where microRNAs play a central role, illustrating the feasibility and importance of assessing post-transcriptional gene expression when investigating human disease.",

The test is based on the assumption that the sample, consisting of points on a time axis, is a realization of a Poisson point process (PPP). There are no restrictions on the shapes of the rate functions that are regulating the PPP, type 2 errors can be calculated and the test is optimal in the sense that it is a uniform most powerful (UMP) test. So for every significance level a, the presented test has a lower type 2 error than every other test having the same significance level a. The test is applicable to all models based on PPPs, including models in spatial dimensions. It can be generalized and expanded in different ways, such as testing larger hypotheses, incorporating prior knowledge, and constructing confidence regions that can be used to obtain upper or lower bounds on rate functions.",

However, it is not known whether they are also involved in the maintenance of genome integrity in meiosis. By analyzing chromosome dynamics in H2afx-/- spermatocytes, we found that synapsis of the autosomes and X-Y chromosomes were impaired in a relevant fraction of cells. Such defect correlated with an abnormal recombination profile. Conversely, Mdc1 was dispensable for the synapsis of the autosomes, and only played a minor role in X-Y synapsis, relatively to H2afx. This suggested that those genes have non-overlapping functions in chromosome synapsis. However, we observed that both genes play a similar role in the assembly of MLH3 onto chromosomes, a key step in crossover formation. Moreover, we showed that H2afx and Mdc1 cooperate in promoting the activation of the recombination-dependent checkpoint, a mechanism that restrains the differentiation of cells with unrepaired DSBs. This occurs by a mechanism that involves P53. Overall, our data showed that, in male germ cells, H2afx and Mdc1 promote the maintenance of genome integrity.",

However nerve function recovery dynamics after a block is highly understudied. This study aims to characterise the recovery dynamics of neural function after an HFAC block.\\n\\nApproachExperiments were carried out in-vivo to determine blocking efficacy as a function of blocking signal amplitude and frequency, and recovery times as well as recovery completeness was measured within a 0.7 s time scale from the end of block. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at 100 Hz during recovery to reduce error to within {+/-}10 ms for measurements of recovery dynamics. The electromyogram (EMG) signals were measured from gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior during trials as an indicator for nerve function.\\n\\nMain ResultsThe HFAC block was most reliable around 20 kHz, with block thresholds approximately 5 or 6 mA depending on the animal and muscle. Recovery times ranged from 20 to 430 milliseconds and final values spanned relative outputs from approximately 1 to 0.2. Higher blocking signal frequencies and amplitudes increased recovery time and decreased recovery completeness.\\n\\nSignificanceThese results confirm that recovery dynamics from block depend on blocking signal frequency and amplitude, which is of particular importance for neuromodulation therapies and for comparing results across studies using different blocking signal parameters.",

    "abstract": "Jumping to conclusions during probabilistic reasoning is a cognitive bias reliably observed in psychosis, and linked to delusion formation. Although the reasons for this cognitive bias are unknown, one suggestion is that psychosis patients may view sampling information as more costly. However, previous computational modelling has provided evidence that patients with chronic schizophrenia jump to conclusion because of noisy decision making. We developed a novel version of the classical beads-task, systematically manipulating the cost of information gathering in four blocks. For 31 individuals with early symptoms of psychosis and 31 healthy volunteers, we examined the numbers of  draws to decision when information sampling had no, a fixed, or an escalating cost. Computational modelling involved estimating a cost of information sampling parameter and a cognitive noise parameter. Overall patients sampled less information than controls. However, group differences in numbers of draws became less prominent at higher cost trials, where less information was sampled. The attenuation of group difference was not due to floor effects, as in the most costly block participants sampled more information than an ideal Bayesian agent. Computational modelling showed that, in the condition with no objective cost to information sampling, patients attributed higher costs to information sampling than controls (Mann-Whiney U=289, p=0.007), with marginal evidence of differences in noise parameter estimates (t=1.86 df=60, p=0.07). In patients, individual differences in severity of psychotic symptoms were statistically significantly associated with higher cost of information sampling (rho=0.6, p=0.001) but not with more cognitive noise (rho=0.27, p=0.14); in controls cognitive noise predicted aspects of schizotypy (preoccupation and distress associated with delusion-like ideation on the Peters Delusion Inventory). Using a psychological manipulation and computational modelling, we provide evidence that early psychosis patients jump to conclusions because of attributing higher costs to sampling information, not because of being primarily noisy decision makers.",
