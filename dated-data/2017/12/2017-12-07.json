    "abstract": "The variable responses of sensory neurons tend to be weakly correlated (spike-count correlation, rsc). This is widely thought to reflect noise in shared afferents, in which case rsc can limit the reliability of sensory coding. However, it could also be due to feedback from higher-order brain regions. Currently, the relative contribution of these sources is unknown. We addressed this by recording from populations of V1 neurons in macaques performing different discrimination tasks involving the same visual input. We found that the structure of rsc(the way rsc varied with neuronal stimulus preference) changed systematically with task instruction. Therefore, even at the earliest stage in the cortical visual hierarchy, rsc structure during task performance primarily reflects feedback dynamics. Consequently, previous proposals for how rsc constrains sensory processing need not apply. Furthermore, we show that correlations between the activity of single neurons and choice depend on feedback engaged by the task.",

    "abstract": "Effective ecosystem conservation and resource management require quantitative monitoring of biodiversity, including accurate descriptions of species composition and temporal variations of species abundance. Therefore, quantitative monitoring of biodiversity has been performed for many ecosystems, but it is often time- and effort-consuming and costly. Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA), which is released to the environment from macro-organisms living in a habitat, contains information about species identity and abundance. Thus, analyzing eDNA would be a promising approach for more efficient biodiversity monitoring. In the present study, we added internal standard DNAs (i.e., known amounts of short DNA fragments from fish species that have never been observed in a sampling area) to eDNA samples, which were collected weekly from a coastal marine ecosystem in Maizuru-Bay, Kyoto, Japan (from April 2015 to March 2016), and performed metabarcoding analysis using Illumina MiSeq to simultaneously identify fish species and quantify fish eDNA copy numbers. A correction equation was obtained for each sample using the relationship between the number of sequence reads and the added amount of the standard DNAs, and this equation was used to estimate the copy numbers from the sequence reads of non-standard fish eDNA. The calculated copy numbers showed significant positive correlation with those determined by quantitative PCR, suggesting that eDNA metabarcoding with standard DNA enabled useful quantification of eDNA. Furthermore, for samples that show a high level of PCR inhibition, our method might allow more accurate quantification than qPCR because the correction equations generated using internal standard DNAs would include the effect of PCR inhibition. A single run of Illumina MiSeq produced > 70 quantitative fish eDNA time series in our study, showing that our method could contribute to more efficient and quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Many components of host-parasite interactions have been shown to affect the way virulence (i.e., parasite-induced harm to the host) evolves. However, coevolution of multiple parasite traits is often neglected. We explore how an immunosuppressive mechanism of parasites affects and co-evolves with virulence through multiple infections. Applying the adaptive dynamics framework to epidemiological models with coinfection, we show that immunosuppression is a double-edged-sword for the evolution of virulence. On one hand, it amplifies the adaptive benefit of virulence by increasing the abundance of coinfections through epidemiological feedbacks. On the other hand, immunosuppression hinders host recovery, prolonging the duration of infection and elevating the cost of killing the host. The balance between the cost and benefit of immunosuppression varies across different background mortality rates of hosts. In addition, we find that immunosuppression evolution is influenced considerably by the precise trade-off shape determining the effect of immunosuppression on host recovery and susceptibility to further infection. These results demonstrate that the evolution of virulence is shaped by immunosuppression while highlighting that the evolution of immune evasion mechanisms deserves further research attention.",

    "abstract": "Human T cells are central to physiological immune homeostasis, which protects us from pathogens without collateral autoimmune inflammation. They are also the main effectors in most current cancer immunotherapy strategies1. Several decades of work have aimed to genetically reprogram T cells for therapeutic purposes2-5, but as human T cells are resistant to most standard methods of large DNA insertion these approaches have relied on recombinant viral vectors, which do not target transgenes to specific genomic sites6, 7. In addition, the need for viral vectors has slowed down research and clinical use as their manufacturing and testing is lengthy and expensive. Genome editing brought the promise of specific and efficient insertion of large transgenes into target cells through homology-directed repair (HDR), but to date in human T cells this still requires viral transduction8, 9. Here, we developed a non-viral, CRISPR-Cas9 genome targeting system that permits the rapid and efficient insertion of individual or multiplexed large (>1 kilobase) DNA sequences at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells while preserving cell viability and function. We successfully tested the potential therapeutic use of this approach in two settings. First, we corrected a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in primary T cells from multiple family members with monogenic autoimmune disease and demonstrated enhanced signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR redirecting T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCR-engineered T cells specifically recognized the tumour antigen, with concomitant cytokine release and tumour cell killing. Taken together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that non-viral genome targeting will enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing biological question is how evolution has shaped the genomic architecture of dikaryotic fungi. To answer this, high quality genomic resources that enable haplotype comparisons are essential. Short-read genome assemblies for dikaryotic fungi are highly fragmented and lack haplotype-specific information due to the high heterozygosity and repeat content of these genomes. Here we present a diploidaware assembly of the wheat stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici based on long-reads using the FALCON-Unzip assembler. RNA-seq datasets were used to infer high quality gene models and identify virulence genes involved in plant infection referred to as effectors. This represents the most complete Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici genome assembly to date (83 Mb, 156 contigs, N50 1.5 Mb) and provides phased haplotype information for over 92% of the genome. Comparisons of the phase blocks revealed high inter-haplotype diversity of over 6%. More than 25% of all genes lack a clear allelic counterpart. When investigating genome features that potentially promote the rapid evolution of virulence, we found that candidate effector genes are spatially associated with conserved genes commonly found in basidiomycetes. Yet candidate effectors that lack an allelic counterpart are more distant from conserved genes than allelic candidate effectors, and are less likely to be evolutionarily conserved within the P. striiformis species complex and Pucciniales. In summary, this haplotype-phased assembly enabled us to discover novel genome features of a dikaryotic plant pathogenic fungus previously hidden in collapsed and fragmented genome assemblies.\\n\\nImportanceCurrent representations of eukaryotic microbial genomes are haploid, hiding the genomic diversity intrinsic to diploid and polyploid life forms. This hidden diversity contributes to the organisms evolutionary potential and ability to adapt to stress conditions. Yet it is challenging to provide haplotype-specific information at a whole-genome level. Here, we take advantage of long-read DNA sequencing technology and a tailored-assembly algorithm to disentangle the two haploid genomes of a dikaryotic pathogenic wheat rust fungus. The two genomes display high levels of nucleotide and structural variations, which leads to allelic variation and the presence of genes lacking allelic counterparts. Non-allelic candidate effector genes, which likely encode important pathogenicity factors, display distinct genome localization patterns and are less likely to be evolutionary conserved than those which are present as allelic pairs. This genomic diversity may promote rapid host adaptation and/or be related to the age of the sequenced isolate since last meiosis.",

Comparative transcriptome analysis of ten organs from breeders and non-breeders of the eusocial long-lived NMR and the polygynous shorter-lived guinea pig provide comprehensive and unbiased molecular evidence that sexual maturation in NMR is socially suppressed. After transition into breeders, transcriptomes are markedly sex-specific, show pronounced feedback signaling via gonadal steroids and have similarities to reproductive phenotypes in African cichlid fish. Further, NMRs show functional enrichment of status-related expression differences associated with aging. Lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation - molecular networks known to be linked to aging - were identified among most affected gene sets. Further, a transcriptome pattern associated with longevity is reinforced in NMR breeders contradicting the disposable soma theory of aging and potentially contributing to their exceptional long life- and healthspan.",

As the tools available for these tasks improve, it is useful to return to data produced with earlier instances to assess their credibility and correctness. The entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is widely used to control insect pests in horticulture. The genome sequence for this species was reported to encode an unusually high proportion of unique proteins and a paucity of secreted proteins compared to other related nematodes. We revisited the H. bacteriophora genome assembly and gene predictions to ask whether these unusual characteristics were biological or methodological in origin. We mapped an independent resequencing dataset to the genome and used the blobtools pipeline to identify potential contaminants. While present (0.2% of the genome span, 0.4% of predicted proteins), assembly contamination was not significant. Re-prediction of the gene set using BRAKER1 and published transcriptome data generated a predicted proteome that was very different from the published one. The new gene set had a much reduced complement of unique proteins, better completeness values that were in line with other related species genomes, and an increased number of proteins predicted to be secreted. It is thus likely that methodological issues drove the apparent uniqueness of the initial H. bacteriophora genome annotation and that similar contamination and misannotation issues affect other published genome assemblies.",

The key question is how long before the diagnosis of AD the neurodegenerative process started leading to these structural alterations. To answer this question, we proposed an innovative way by inferring brain structure volume trajectories across the entire lifespan using massive number of MRI (N=4714). Our study provides evidences of early divergence of the AD model from the control model for the hippocampus before 40 years, followed by the lateral ventricles and the amygdala around 40 years for the AD model. Moreover, our lifespan investigation reveals the dynamic of the evolution of these biomarkers and suggest close abnormality trajectories for the hippocampus and the amygdala. Finally, our results highlight that the temporal lobe atrophy, a key biomarker in AD, is a very early pathophysiological event potentially associated to early life exposures to risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Decision bias is traditionally conceptualized as an internal reference against which sensory evidence is compared. Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation towards a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation towards target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2-6 Hz (theta) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8--12 Hz (alpha) power in posterior cortex. The alpha suppression in turn mediated the output activity of visual cortex, as expressed in 59--100 Hz (gamma) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation towards the decision bound that maximizes their reward.",

    "abstract": "Head movements are a major source of MRI artefacts that hamper radiological assessment and computer-based morphological and functional measures of the human brain. Prospective motion correction techniques continuously update the MRI scanner based on head position information provided by an external tracking system. While prospective motion correction significantly improves data quality, strong motion artefacts may remain with large head motions or when motion takes place at sensitive times of the acquisition. Here we present a framework that allows the suspension of data acquisition when head motion is predicted to have a strong negative impact on data quality. The predictor, calculated in real-time during the acquisition, accounts for the amplitude of the signal acquired at the time of the motion, thereby offering a re-acquisition strategy more efficient than relying on head speed alone. The suspension of data acquisition is governed by the trade-off between image degradation due to motion and prolonging the scan time. This trade-off can be tuned by the user according to the desired level of image quality and the participant s tolerability. We test the framework using two motion experiments and two head coils. Significant improvements in data quality are obtained with stringent threshold values for the suspension of acquisition. Substantial reductions in motion artefact levels are also achieved with minimal prolongation of scan time. However, high levels of motion artefacts occasionally remain despite stringent thresholds with the 64-channel head coil, an effect that might be attributed to head movement in the sharp sensitivity profile of this coil.",

We present a new approach using deep neural network (DNN) representation to reveal the effects of such integration on degraded visual inputs. We transformed measured human brain activity resulting from viewing blurred images to the hierarchical representation space derived from a feedforward DNN. Transformed representations were found to veer towards the original non-blurred image and away from the blurred stimulus image.

    "abstract": "The oculomotor system is the most thoroughly understood sensorimotor system in the brain, due in large part to electrophysiological studies carried out in macaque monkeys trained to perform ocuolomotor tasks. A disadvantage of the macaque model is that many cortical oculomotor areas of interest lie within sulci, making high-density array and laminar recordings impractical. Further, many techniques of molecular biology developed in rodents, such as transgenic animals and optogenetic manipulation of neuronal subtypes, are limited in this species. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) may potentially bridge the gap between systems neuroscience in macaques and molecular techniques, and additionally possesses a smooth cortex allowing easy access to frontoparietal oculomotor areas. To date, techniques for restraint and training of these animals to perform oculomotor tasks remain in an early stage of development. Here we provide details of a custom-designed chair for restraint of marmosets, a combination head restraint/recording chamber providing stability suitable for eye movement and neural recordings, and a training protocol for oculomotor tasks. As proof-of-principle, we report the results of a psychophysical study in marmosets trained to perform a saccade task using these methods, showing that, as in rhesus and humans, marmosets exhibit a \\\"gap effect\\\" - a decrease in reaction time when the fixation stimulus is removed prior to the onset of a visual saccade target. These results provide evidence that the common marmoset is a suitable model for neurophysiogical investigations of oculomotor control.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYThe ability to carry out neuronal recordings in behaving primates has provided a wealth of information regarding the neural circuits underlying the control of eye movements. Such studies require restraint of the animal within a primate chair, head fixation, methods of acclimating the animals to this restraint, and the use of operant conditioning methods for training on oculomotor tasks. In contrast to the macaque model, relatively few studies have reported in detail methods for use in the common marmoset. Here we detail custom-designed equipment and methods by which we have used to successfully train head-restrained marmosets to perform basic oculomotor tasks.",

    "abstract": "A common challenge arising from the observation of an evolutionary system over time is to infer the magnitude of selection acting upon a specific genetic variant, or variants, within the population. The inference of selection may be confounded by the effects of genetic drift in a system, leading to the development of inference procedures to account for these effects. However, recent work has suggested that deterministic models of evolution may be effective in capturing the effects of selection even under complex models of demography, suggesting the more general application of deterministic approaches to inference. Responding to this literature, we here note a case in which a deterministic model of evolution may give highly misleading inferences, resulting from the non-deterministic properties of mutation in a finite population. We propose an alternative approach which corrects for this error, which we denote the delay-deterministic model. Applying our model to a simple evolutionary system we demonstrate its performance in quantifying the extent of selection acting within that system. We further consider the application of our model to sequence data from an evolutionary experiment. We outline scenarios in which our model may produce improved results for the inference of selection, noting that such situations can be easily identified via the use of a regular deterministic model.",

    "abstract": "Whether speciation can happen in the absence of geographical barriers and if so, under which conditions, is a fundamental question in our understanding of the evolution of new species. Among candidates for sympatric speciation, Cameroon crater lake cichlid radiations have been considered the most compelling. However, it was recently shown that a more complex scenario than a single colonization followed by isolation underlies these radiations. Here, we perform a detailed investigation of the speciation history of a radiation of Coptodon cichlids from Lake Ejagham using whole-genome sequencing data. The existence of the Lake Ejagham Coptodon radiation is remarkable since this 0.5 km2 lake offers limited scope for divergence across a shallow depth gradient, disruptive selection is weak, the species are sexually monochromatic, yet assortative mating is strong. We infer that Lake Ejagham was colonized by Coptodon cichlids almost as soon as it came into existence 9,000 years ago, yet speciation events occurred only in the last 1,000-2,000 years. We show that secondary gene flow from a nearby riverine species has been ongoing, into ancestral as well as extant Lake Ejagham lineages, and we identify and date river-to-lake admixture blocks. One of these contains a cluster of olfactory receptor genes that introgressed close to the time of the first speciation event and coincides with a higher overall rate of admixture into the recipient lineages. Olfactory signaling is a key component of mate choice and species recognition in cichlids. A functional role for this introgression event is consistent with previous findings that assortative mating appears much stronger than ecological divergence in Ejagham Coptodon. We conclude that speciation in this radiation took place in sympatry, yet may have benefited from ongoing riverine gene flow.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDespite an active search for empirical examples and much theoretical work, sympatric speciation remains one of the most controversial ideas in evolutionary biology. While a host of examples have been described in the last few decades, more recent results have shown that several of the most convincing systems have not evolved in complete isolation from allopatric populations after all. By itself, documenting the occurrence of secondary gene flow is not sufficient to reject the hypothesis of sympatric speciation, since speciation can still be considered sympatric if gene flow did not contribute significantly to the build-up of reproductive isolation. One way forward is to use genomic data to infer where, when and into which lineages gene flow occurred, and identify the regions of the genome that experienced admixture. In this study, we use whole-genome sequencing to examine one of the cichlid radiations from a small isolated Cameroon lake, which have long been the flagship example of sympatric speciation. We show that gene flow from a riverine species into the lake has been ongoing during the history of the radiation. In line with this, we infer that the lake was colonized very soon after it was formed, and argue that Lake Ejagham is not as isolated as previously assumed. The magnitude of secondary gene flow was relatively even across Lake Ejagham lineages, yet with some evidence for differential admixture, most notably before the first speciation event into the C. deckerti and C. ejagham lineage. Among the sequences that were introgressed into this lineage is a cluster of olfactory receptor genes, which may have facilitated speciation by promoting sexual isolation between incipient species, consistent with previous findings that sexual isolation appears to be stronger than ecological isolation in Ejagham Coptodon. We conclude that speciation in this radiation took place in sympatry, yet may have benefited from ongoing riverine gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Gamete size dimorphism between sexes (anisogamy) is predicted to have evolved from an isogamous system in which sexes have equal-sized, monomorphic gametes. Although adaptive explanations for the evolution of anisogamy abound, we lack comparable insights into molecular changes that bring about the transition from monomorphism to dimorphism. The basal fungal clade Allomyces provides unique opportunities to investigate genomic changes that are associated with this transition in closely related species that show either isogamous or anisogamous mating systems. The anisogamous species show sexual dimorphism in gamete size, number, pigmentation and motility. We sequenced transcriptomes of five Allomyces isolates representing the two mating systems, including both male and female phenotypes in the anisogamous species. Maximum likelihood ancestral character state reconstruction performed in MESQUITE using the de-novo assembled transcriptomes indicated that anisogamy likely evolved once in Allomyces, and is a derived character as predicted in theory. We found that sexual stages of Allomyces express homologs of several genes known to be involved in sex determination in model organisms including Drosophila and humans. Furthermore, expression of CatSper homologs in male- and female-biased samples in our analysis support the hypothesis that gamete interaction in the anisogamous species of Allomyces may involve similar molecular events as the egg-sperm interaction in animals, including humans. Although the strains representing either mating system shared much of the transcriptome, supporting recent common ancestry, the analysis of rate of evolution using individual gene trees indicates high substitution rates and divergence between the strains. In summary, we find that anisogamy likely evolved once in Allomyces, using convergent mechanisms to those in other taxa.",

    "abstract": "Due to its highly repetitive nature, the human male-specific Y chromosome remains understudied. It is important to investigate variation on the Y chromosome to understand its evolution and contribution to phenotypic variation, including infertility. Approximately 20% of the human Y chromosome consists of ampliconic regions which include nine multi-copy gene families. These gene families are expressed exclusively in testes and usually implicated in spermatogenesis. Here, to gain a better understanding of the role of the Y chromosome in human evolution and in determining sexually dimorphic traits, we studied ampliconic gene copy number variation in 100 males representing ten major Y haplogroups world-wide. Copy number was estimated with droplet digital PCR. In contrast to low nucleotide diversity observed on the Y in previous studies, here we show that ampliconic gene copy number diversity is very high. A total of 98 copy-number-based haplotypes were observed among 100 individuals, and haplotypes were sometimes shared by males from very different haplogroups, suggesting homoplasies. The resulting haplotypes did not cluster according to major Y haplogroups. Overall, only three gene families (DATZ, RBMY, TSPY) showed significant differences in copy number among major Y haplogroups, and the haplogroup of an individual could not be predicted based on his ampliconic gene copy numbers. Finally, we found a significant correlation between copy number variation and individuals height (for three gene families), but not between the former and facial masculinity/femininity. Our results suggest rapid evolution of ampliconic gene copy numbers on the human Y, and we discuss its causes.",

The implications of this observation are wide-ranging, with potential ramifications regarding protein denaturation, conformational change, and preferred orientation. We also show that fiducial-less cryo-electron tomography on single particle grids may be used to determine ice thickness, optimal single particle collection areas and strategies, particle heterogeneity, and de novo models for template picking and single particle alignment.",

Here, we show regulation of 53BP1 beyond repair foci. 53BP1 movements are constrained in the nucleoplasm and increase in response to DNA damage. 53BP1 interacts with the structural protein NuMA, which controls 53BP1 diffusion. This interaction, and colocalization between the two proteins in vitro and in breast tissues, is reduced after DNA damage. In cell lines and breast carcinoma, NuMA prevents 53BP1 accumulation at DNA breaks and high NuMA expression predicts better patient outcomes. Manipulating NuMA expression alters PARP inhibitor sensitivity of BRCA1-null cells, end-joining activity, and immunoglobulin class switching that rely on 53BP1. We propose a new mechanism that involves the sequestration of 53BP1 by NuMA in the absence of DNA damage. Such mechanism may have evolved to disable repair functions and may be a decisive factor for tumor responses to genotoxic treatments.",

Unsupervised clustering and lineage prediction algorithms were used to map fate choices and transcriptional networks underlying cardiac differentiation.

HOPX, a non-DNA binding homeodomain protein essential for heart development in vivo was identified as dys-regulated in in vitro derived cardiomyocytes.

However, the position and migration of late-differentiating progenitors during heart formation remains unclear. Here, we tracked zebrafish heart development using transgenics based on the cardiopharyngeal transcription factor gene tbx1. Live-imaging uncovered a tbx1 reporter-expressing cell sheath that from anterior lateral plate mesoderm continuously disseminates towards the forming heart tube. High-speed imaging and optogenetic lineage tracing corroborated that the zebrafish ventricle forms through continuous addition from the undifferentiated progenitor sheath followed by late-phase accrual of the bulbus arteriosus (BA). FGF inhibition during sheath migration reduced ventricle size and abolished BA formation, refining the window of FGF action during OFT formation. Our findings consolidate previous end-point analyses and establish zebrafish ventricle formation as a continuous process.",

Deletion of lprEMtb resulted in induction of cathelicidin and decreased survival in the host. Interestingly, LprEMtb was also found to inhibit autophagy mechanism to dampen host immune response. Episomal expression of LprEMtb in non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis(Msm) increased bacillary persistence by down-regulating the expression of cathelicidin and autophagy, while deletion of LprEMtb orthologue in Msm, had no effect on cathelicidin and autophagy expression. Moreover, LprEMtb blocked phago-lysosome fusion by suppressing the expression of EEA1, Rab7 and LAMP-1 endosomal markers by down-regulating IL-12 and IL-22 cytokines.

Through a single CLICK array test, we obtained a series of regulators for H3K4me3 which covers most of the known regulators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also noted that several group of proteins that are linked to negatively regulation of H3K4me3. Further, we discovered that Cab4p and Cab5p, two key enzymes of CoA biosynthesis, play central roles in histone acylation. Because of its general applicability, CLICK array could be easily adopted to rapid and global identification of upstream protein/enzyme(s) that regulate/modify the level of a protein or the posttranslational modification of a non-histone protein.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is impacting ecosystem structure and function, with potentially drastic downstream effects on human and animal health. Emerging zoonotic diseases are expected to be particularly vulnerable to climate and biodiversity disturbance. Anthrax is an archetypal zoonosis that manifests its most significant burden on vulnerable pastoralist communities. The current study sought to investigate the influence of temperature increases on the landscape suitability of anthrax in the temperate, boreal, and arctic North, where observed climate impact has been rapid. This study also explored the influence of climate relative to more traditional factors, such as livestock distribution, ungulate biodiversity, and soil-water balance, in demarcating high risk landscapes. Machine learning was used to model landscape suitability as the ecological niche of anthrax in northern latitudes. The model identified climate, livestock density and wild ungulate species richness as the most influential landscape features in predicting suitability. These findings highlight the significance of warming temperatures for anthrax ecology in northern latitudes, and suggest potential mitigating effects of interventions targeting megafauna biodiversity conservation in grassland ecosystems, and animal health promotion among small to midsize livestock herds.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe present evidence that a warming climate may be associated with the current distribution of anthrax risk in the temperate, boreal, and arctic North. Moreover, projected warming over the coming decades was associated with substantive expansion of this risk. In addition, livestock distribution, ungulate biodiversity, and soil-water balance were also influential to anthrax risk. While these results are sobering for the future health of livestock and pastoralist communities in the northern latitudes, the coincident modulating effect of ungulate biodiversity may suggest targeted ecosystem conservation as a possible buffer against a growing anthrax niche.",

    "abstract": "School closure is often considered as an option to mitigate influenza epidemics because of its potential to reduce transmission in children and then in the community. The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Moreover, the specific mechanisms leading to mitigation are not clearly identified.\\n\\nWe introduced a stochastic spatial age-specific metapopulation model to assess the role of holiday-associated behavioral changes and how they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms.\\n\\nStochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic.\\n\\nChanges in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact.",

    "abstract": "Throughout their evolutionary history, humans have faced risks including drought, disease, natural disasters and other unexpected negative events. To deal with these risks, humans use a variety of risk management strategies, some of which involve relying on others in times of need in order to pool risk. However, the effectiveness of risk pooling strategies can be limited when there is high synchronicity of need. Here we investigate the limits of two resource transfer systems for pooling risk (need-based transfers, NBT, and debt-based transfers, DBT) in simulated ecologies with different degrees of correlated disasters using an agent-based model of the need-based transfer system of the Maasai. Overall, we find that survival is higher when shocks are less correlated among partners, when groups are larger, and when network structure is characterized by preferential attachment networks, which have a more modular structure than regular or small world networks. We also find that NBT strategies consistently outperform DBT strategies across a wide variety of parameter values and that the advantage of NBT over DBT is greatest when shocks are less correlated and group size is small. Our results also suggest that systems of sharing that are based on recipient need are less vulnerable than systems that are based on debt and credit, especially in small world and regular networks.",

The Cricket Paralysis virus employs an Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES) to express its structural genes in the late stage of infection. Ribosome hijacking is achieved by a sophisticated use of molecular mimicry to tRNA and mRNA, employed to manipulate intrinsically dynamic components of the ribosome. Binding and translocation through the ribosome is required for this IRES to initiate translation. We report two structures, solved by single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), of a double translocated CrPV IRES with aminoacyl-tRNA in the peptidyl site (P site) of the ribosome. CrPV IRES adopts a previously unseen conformation, mimicking the acceptor stem of a canonical E site tRNA.

Many applications require complete gene sequences, which can be impossible to reconstruct from short reads. HIV-1 env, the protein of interest for HIV vaccine studies, is exceptionally challenging for long-read sequencing and analysis due to its length, high substitution rate, and extensive indel variation. While long-read sequencing is attractive in this setting, the analysis of such data is not well handled by existing methods. To address this, we introduce FLEA (Full-Length Envelope Analyzer), which performs end-to-end analysis and visualization of long-read sequencing data.\\n\\nFLEA consists of both a pipeline (optionally run on a high-performance cluster), and a client-side web application that provides interactive results. The pipeline transforms FASTQ reads into high-quality consensus sequences (HQCSs) and uses them to build a codon-aware multiple sequence alignment. The resulting alignment is then used to infer phylogenies, selection pressure, and evolutionary dynamics. The web application provides publication-quality plots and interactive visualizations, including an annotated viral alignment browser, time series plots of evolutionary dynamics, visualizations of gene-wide selective pressures (such as dN /dS) across time and across protein structure, and a phylogenetic tree browser.\\n\\nWe demonstrate how FLEA may be used to process Pacific Biosciences HIV-1 env data and describe recent examples of its use.

How chromatin mobility responds to genomic processes and whether this response relies on coordinated movement is still unclear. Here, we introduce an approach called Dense Flow reConstruction and Correlation (DFCC) to quantify correlation of chromatin motion with sub-pixel sensitivity at the level of the whole nucleus. DFCC is based on reconstructing dense global flow fields of fluorescent images acquired in real-time. By simulating variations in microscopic and dynamic parameters, we demonstrate that our approach is robust and more accurate than other methods to estimate flow fields and spatial correlations of dense structures such as chromatin. We applied our approach to analyze stochastic movements of DNA and histones based on direction and magnitude at different time lags in human cells. We observe long-range correlations extending over several m between coherently moving regions over the entire nucleus. Spatial correlation of global chromatin dynamics was reduced by inhibiting elongation by RNA polymerase II and abolished in quiescent cells. Furthermore, quantification of spatial smoothness over time intervals up to 30 seconds points to clear-cut boundaries between distinct regions, while smooth transitions in small (<1 m) neighborhoods dominate for short time intervals. Clear transitions between regions of coherent motion indicate directed squeezing or stretching of chromatin boundaries suggestive of changes in local concentrations of actors regulating gene expression. The DFCC approach hence allows characterizing stochastically forming domains of specific nuclear activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementControl of gene expression relies on modifications of chromatin structure and activity of the transcription machinery.

    "abstract": "De novo prediction of protein folding is an open scientific challenge. Many folding models and force fields have been developed, yet all face difficulties converging to native conformations. Hydrophobicity scales (HSs) play a crucial role in such simulations as they define the energetic interactions between protein residues, thus determining the energetically favorable conformation. While many HSs have been developed over the years using various methods, it is surprising that the scales show very weak consensus in their assignment of hydrophobicity indexes to the various residues. In this work, several HSs are systematically assessed via atomistic Monte Carlo simulation of folding of small proteins, by converting the HSs of interest into residue-residue contact energy matrices. HSs that poorly preserve native structures of proteins were tuned by applying a linear transformation. Subsequently, folding simulations were used to examine the ability of the HSs to correctly fold the proteins from a random initial conformation. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) and energy of the proteins during folding were sampled and used to define an ER-score, as the correlation between the 2-dimensional energy-RMSD (ER) histogram with 50% lowest energy conformations and the ER histogram with 50% lowest RMSD conformations. Thus, we were able to compare the ability of the different HSs to predict de novo protein folding quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "Forward genetics determines the function of genes underlying trait variation by identifying the change in DNA responsible for changes in phenotype. Detecting phenotypically-relevant variation outside protein coding sequences and distinguishing this from neutral variants is not trivial; partly because the mechanisms by which DNA polymorphisms in the intergenic regions affect gene regulation are poorly understood. Here we utilized a dominant genetic marker with a convenient phenotype to investigate the effect of cis and trans-acting regulatory variation. We performed a forward genetic screen for natural variation that suppress or enhance the semi-dominant mutant allele Oy1-N1989, encoding the magnesium chelatase subunit I of maize. This mutant permits rapid phenotyping of leaf color as a reporter for chlorophyll accumulation, and mapping of natural variation in maize affecting chlorophyll metabolism. We identified a single modifier locus segregating between B73 and Mo17 that was linked to the reporter gene itself, which we call very oil yellow1. Based on the variation in OY1 transcript abundance and genome-wide association data, vey1 is predicted to consist of multiple cis-acting regulatory sequence polymorphisms encoded at the wild-type oy1 alleles. The vey1 allele appears to be a common polymorphism in the maize germplasm that alters the expression level of a key gene in chlorophyll biosynthesis. These vey1 alleles have no discernable impact on leaf chlorophyll in the absence of the Oy1-N1989 reporter. Thus, use of a mutant as a simple and efficient reporter for magnesium chelatase activity resulted in the detection of expression-level polymorphisms not readily visible in the laboratory.",

[4] identified 14 novel substitutions in M. tuberculosis-KatG (the enzyme associated with resistance to isoniazid--an important first-line anti-TB drug) and demonstrated that 12 of the 14 can cause INH-resistance in M. smegmatis. This study presents an in silico structure-based analysis of these 14 amino acid substitutions using homology models and x-ray crystal structures (when available) in M. tuberculosis. Our models demonstrate that several of these mutations cluster around three openings in the KatG tertiary structure which appear to initiate channels to the heme group at the catalytic center of the enzyme. We studied the effects of these mutations on the tertiary structure of KatG, focusing on conformational changes in the three channels in the protein structure. Our results suggest that the 14 novel mutations sufficiently restrict one or more of these access channels, thus potentially preventing INH from reaching the catalytic heme. These observations provide valuable insights into the structure-based origins of INH resistance and provide testable hypotheses for future experimental studies.",

Occipital (but not frontal) TACS phasically suppressed stimulus-induced gamma oscillations in the visual cortex and impaired target detection, with stronger phase-to-amplitude coupling predicting behavioral impairments. Frontal control TACS ruled out retino-thalamo-cortical entrainment resulting from (subthreshold) retinal stimulation. All TACS frequencies tested were effective, suggesting that visual gamma-band responses can be modulated by a range of low frequency oscillations. We propose that TACS-induced cortical excitability fluctuations mimic the mechanism of pulsed inhibition, which mediates the function of alpha oscillations in gating sensory processing.",

Further sub-analyses investigated potential influences of stimulation type, control, target site, task, online vs. offline application, and current density of the target electrode.

    "abstract": "Light-sheet microscopy (LSM) has proven a useful tool in neuroscience to image whole brains with high frame rates at cellular resolution. LSM is employed either in combination with tissue clearing to reconstruct the cyto-architecture over the entire mouse brain or with intrinsically transparent samples like zebrafish larvae for functional imaging. Inherently to LSM, however, residual opaque objects cause stripe artifacts, which obscure features of interest and, during functional imaging, modulate fluorescence variations related to neuronal activity. Here, we report how Bessel beams reduce streaking artifacts and produce high-fidelity structural data. Furthermore, using Bessel beams, we demonstrate a fivefold increase in sensitivity to calcium transients and a 20 fold increase in accuracy in the detection of activity correlations in functional imaging. Our results demonstrate the contamination of data by systematic and random errors through Gaussian illumination and furthermore quantify the increase in fidelity of such data when using Bessel beams.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an active inference formulation of planning and navigation. It illustrates how the exploitation-exploration dilemma is dissolved by acting to minimise uncertainty (i.e., expected surprise or free energy). We use simulations of a maze problem to illustrate how agents can solve quite complicated problems using context sensitive prior preferences to form subgoals. Our focus is on how epistemic behaviour - driven by novelty and the imperative to reduce uncertainty about the world - contextualises pragmatic or goal-directed behaviour. Using simulations, we illustrate the underlying process theory with synthetic behavioural and electrophysiological responses during exploration of a maze and subsequent navigation to a target location. An interesting phenomenon that emerged from the simulations was a putative distinction between  place cells - that fire when a subgoal is reached - and  path cells - that fire until a subgoal is reached.",

    "abstract": "Humans are highly skilled in social reasoning, e.g., inferring thoughts of others. This mentalizing ability systematically recruits brain regions such as Temporo-Parietal Junction (TPJ), Precuneus (PC) and medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Further, posterior mPFC is associated with allocentric mentalizing and conflict monitoring while anterior mPFC is associated with self-related mentalizing. Here we extend this work to how we reason not just about what one person thinks but about the abstract shared social norm. We apply functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural representations while participants judge the social congruency between emotional auditory in relation to visual scenes according to how  most people would perceive it. Behaviorally, judging according to a social norm increased the similarity of response patterns among participants. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that social congruency information was not represented in visual and auditory areas, but was clear in most parts of the mentalizing network: TPJ, PC and posterior (but not anterior) mPFC. Furthermore, interindividual variability in anterior mPFC representations was inversely related to the behavioral ability to adjust to the social norm. Our results suggest that social norm inferencing is associated with a distributed and partially individually specific representation of social congruency in the mentalizing network.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils are stable aggregates of misfolded proteins and polypeptides that are insoluble and resistant to protease activity. Abnormal formation of amyloid fibrils in vivo may lead to neurodegenerative disorders and other systemic amyloidosis such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and atherosclerosis. Because of their clinical importance amyloids are found under intense scientific research. Amyloidogenic sequences of short polypeptide segments within proteins are responsible for the transformation of correctly folded proteins into parts of larger amyloid fibrils. The -helical secondary structure is believed to host many amyloidogenic sequences and be a key player in different stages of the amyloidogenesis process. Most of the studies on amyloids focus on the role of amyloidogenic sequences. The focus of this study is the relation between amyloidogenicity and the structure of the amyloidogenic -helical sequence. We have previously shown that the -helical conformation may be expressed by two parameters ({theta} and{rho} ) that form orthogonal coordinates based on the Ramachandran dihedrals ({varphi} and{psi} ) and provide an illuminating interpretation of the -helical conformation. By performing statistical analysis on -helical conformations found in the protein data bank, an apparent relation between -helical conformation, as expressed by{theta} and{rho} , and amyloidogenicity is revealed. Remarkably, random amino acid sequences, whose helical structure was obtained from the most probably dihedral angles as obtained from PDB data, revealed the same dependency of amyloidogenicity, suggesting the importance of -helical structure as opposed to sequence.",

    "abstract": "Listening to self-chosen, pleasant and relaxing music reduces pain in fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic central pain condition. However, the neural correlates of this effect are fairly unknown and could be regarded as a more direct measure of analgesia. In our study, we wished to investigate the neural correlates of music-induced analgesia (MIA) in fibromyalgia patients. To do this, we studied 20 FM patients and 20 matched healthy controls (HC) acquiring rs-fMRI with a 3T MRI scanner, and pain data before and after two 5-min auditory conditions: music and noise. We performed resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) seed-based correlation analyses (SCA) using pain and analgesia-related ROIs to determine the effects before and after the music intervention in FM and HC, and its correlation with pain reports. We found significant differences in baseline rs-FC between FM and HC. Both groups showed changes in rs-FC in several ROIs after the music condition between different areas, that were left lateralized in FM and right lateralized in HC. FM patients reported MIA that was significantly correlated with rs-FC decrease between the angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and rs-FC increase between amygdala and middle frontal gyrus. These areas are related to autobiographical and limbic processes, and auditory attention, suggesting MIA may arise as a consequence of top-down modulation, probably originated by distraction, relaxation, positive emotion, or a combination of these mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is characterized by both maturation of brain structure and increased risk of negative outcomes from behaviors associated with impulsive decision-making. One important index of impulsive choice is delay discounting (DD), which measures the tendency to prefer smaller rewards available soon over larger rewards delivered after a delay. However, it remains largely unknown how individual differences in structural brain development may be associated with impulsive choice during adolescence. Leveraging a unique large sample of 427 human youths (208 males and 219 females) imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examined associations between delay discounting and cortical thickness within structural covariance networks. These structural networks were derived using non-negative matrix factorization, an advanced multivariate technique for dimensionality reduction, and analyzed using generalized additive models with penalized splines to capture both linear and nonlinear developmental effects. We found that impulsive choice, as measured by greater discounting, was most strongly associated with diminished cortical thickness in structural brain networks that encompassed the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, and temporoparietal junction. Furthermore, structural brain networks predicted DD above and beyond cognitive performance. Taken together, these results suggest that reduced cortical thickness in regions known to be involved in value-based decision-making is a marker of impulsive choice during the critical period of adolescence.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCERisky behaviors during adolescence, such as initiation of substance use or reckless driving, are a major source of morbidity and mortality. In this study, we present evidence from a large sample of youths that diminished cortical thickness in specific structural brain networks is associated with impulsive choice. Notably, the strongest association between impulsive choice and brain structure was seen in regions implicated in value-based decision-making; namely, the ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Moving forward, such neuroanatomical markers of impulsivity may aid in the development of personalized interventions targeted to reduce risk of negative outcomes resulting from impulsivity during adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Alu elements are a highly successful family of primate-specific retrotransposons that have fundamentally shaped primate evolution, including the evolution of our own species. Alus play critical roles in the formation of neurological networks and the epigenetic regulation of biochemical processes throughout the central nervous system (CNS), and thus are hypothesized to have contributed to the origin of human cognition. Despite the positive aspects of Alus, deleterious Alu activity is associated with a number of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, neurological networks are potentially vulnerable to the epigenetic dysregulation of Alu elements operating across the suite of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes that are critical for both mitochondrial and CNS function. Here, we highlight the beneficial neurological aspects of Alu elements as well as their potential to cause disease by disrupting key cellular processes across the CNS. We identify at least 37 neurological and neurodegenerative disorders wherein deleterious Alu activity has been implicated as a contributing factor for the manifestation of disease and, for many of these disorders, this activity is operating on genes that are essential for proper mitochondrial function. We conclude that the epigenetic dysregulation of Alu elements can ultimately disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis within the CNS. This mechanism is a plausible source for the incipient neuronal stress that is consistently observed across a spectrum of sporadic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Tumour recurrence post chemotherapy is an established clinical problem and many cancer types are often observed to be increasingly drug resistant subsequent to chemotherapy treatments. Drug resistance in cancer is a multipart phenomenon which can be derived from several origins and in many cases it has been observed that cancer cells have the ability to possess, acquire and communicate drug resistant traits.\\n\\nHere, an in silico framework is developed in order to study drug resistance and drug response in cancer cell populations exhibiting various drug resistant features. The framework is based on an on-lattice hybrid multiscale mathematical model and is equipped to simulate multiple mechanisms on different scales that contribute towards chemotherapeutic drug resistance in cancer. This study demonstrates how drug resistant tumour features may depend on the interplay amongst intracellular, extracelluar and intercellular factors. On a cellular level, drug resistant cell phenotypes are here derived from inheritance or mutations that are spontaneous, drug-induced or communicated via exosomes. Furthermore intratumoural heterogeneity and spatio-temporal drug dynamics heavily influences drug delivery and the development of drug resistant cancer cell subpopulations. Chemotherapy treatment strategies are here optimised for various in silico tumour scenarios and treatment objectives. We demonstrate that optimal chemotherapy treatment strategies drastically depend on which drug resistant mechanisms are activated, and that furthermore suboptimal chemotherapy administration may promote drug resistance.",

We profiled the metabolome of 18 obese patients (nine euglycemic and nine diabetics) that underwent RYGB surgery and seven lean subjects. Plasma samples from the obese patients were collected before the surgery and one week and three months after the surgery. We analyzed the metabolome in association to five hormones (Adiponectin, Insulin, Ghrelin, Leptin, and Resistin), four peptide hormones (GIP, Glucagon, GLP1, and PYY), and two cytokines (IL-6 and TNF). PCA showed samples cluster by surgery time and many microbially driven metabolites (indoles in particular) correlated with the three months after the surgery. Network analysis of metabolites revealed a connection between carbohydrate (mannosamine and glucosamine) and glyoxylate and confirms glyoxylate association to diabetes. Only leptin and IL-6 had a significant association with the measured metabolites. Leptin decreased immediately after RYGB (before significant weight loss), whereas IL-6 showed no consistent response to RYGB. Moreover, leptin associated with tryptophan in support of the possible role of leptin in the regulation of serotonin synthesis pathways in the gut.

We have recently shown that the age distribution of incidence for 20 most prevalent cancers of old age is best approximated by the Erlang probability distribution. The Erlang distribution describes the probability of several successive random events occurring by the given time according to the Poisson process, which allows to predict the number of critical driver events.\n\nResultsHere we show that the Erlang distribution is the only classical probability distribution that can adequately model the age distribution of incidence for all studied childhood and young adulthood cancers, in addition to cancers of old age.\n\nConclusionsThis validates the Poisson process as the universal law describing cancer development at any age and the Erlang distribution as a useful tool to predict the number of driver events for any cancer type. The Poisson process signifies the fundamentally random timing of driver events and their constant average rate. As waiting times for the occurrence of the required number of driver events are counted in decades, it suggests that driver mutations accumulate silently in the longest-living dividing cells in the body - the stem cells.",

The activation of hair follicle stem cell niches and subsequent entry into the growing phase is mainly regulated by Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling, while regression and resting phases are mainly regulated by Tgf-{beta}/Bmp/Smad activity. A major question still unresolved is the nature of the molecular switch that dictates the coordinated transition between both signalling pathways. Here we have focused on the role of Endoglin (Eng), a key coreceptor for members of the Tgf-{beta}/Bmp family of growth factors.\\n\\nUsing an Eng haploinsufficient mouse model we report that Eng is required to maintain a correct follicle cycling pattern and for an adequate stimulation of hair follicle stem cell niches. We further report that {beta}-catenin binds to the Eng promoter depending on Bmp signalling. Moreover, we show that {beta}-catenin interacts with Smad4 in a Bmp/Eng dependent context and both proteins act synergistically to activate Eng promoter transcription. These observations point to the existence of a growth/rest switching mechanism in the hair follicle that is based on an Eng-dependent feedback crosstalk between Wnt/{beta}-catenin and Bmp/Smad signals.",

Therefore, we benchmark how well the ALDEx2 package, a transformation-based DA tool, detects differential expression in high-throughput RNA-sequencing data (RNA-Seq), compared to conventional RNA-Seq differential expression methods.\\n\\nResultsTo evaluate the performance of log-ratio transformation-based tools, we apply the ALDEx2 package to two simulated, and one real, RNA-Seq data sets. The latter was previously used to benchmark dozens of conventional RNA-Seq differential expression methods, enabling us to directly compare transformation-based approaches. We show that ALDEx2, widely used in meta-genomics research, identifies differentially expressed genes (and transcripts) from RNA-Seq data with high precision and, given sufficient sample sizes, high recall too (regardless of the alignment and quantification procedure used). Although we show that the choice in log-ratio transformation can affect performance, ALDEx2 has high precision (i.e., few false positives) across all transformations. Finally, we present a novel, iterative log-ratio transformation (now implemented in ALDEx2) that further improves performance in simulations.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that log-ratio transformation-based methods can work to measure differential expression from RNA-Seq data, provided that certain assumptions are met. Moreover, these methods have high precision (i.e., few false positives) in simulations and perform as good as, or better than, than conventional methods on real data. With previously demonstrated applicability to 16S rRNA data, ALDEx2 can work as a single tool for data from multiple sequencing modalities.",

    "abstract": "Since the mid-1980s there have been increasing reports of severe community-acquired pyogenic liver abscess, meningitis and bloodstream infections caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, predominantly encompassing clonal group (CG) 23 serotype K1 strains. Common features of CG23 include a virulence plasmid associated with iron scavenging and hypermucoidy, and a chromosomal integrative and conjugative element (ICE) encoding the siderophore yersiniabactin and the genotoxin colibactin. Here we investigate the evolutionary history and genomic diversity of CG23 based on comparative analysis of 98 genomes. Contrary to previous reports with more limited samples, we show that CG23 comprises several deep branching sublineages dating back to the 1870s, many of which are associated with distinct chromosomal insertions of ICEs encoding yersiniabactin. We find that most liver abscess isolates (>80%) belong to a dominant sublineage, CG23-I, which emerged in the 1920s following acquisition of ICEKp10 (encoding colibactin in addition to yersiniabactin) and has undergone clonal expansion and global dissemination within the human population. The unique genomic feature of CG23-I is the production of colibactin, which has been reported previously as a promoter of gut colonisation and dissemination to the liver and brain in a mouse model of CG23 K. pneumoniae infection, and has been linked to colorectal cancer. We also identify an antibiotic-resistant subclade of CG23-I associated with sexually-transmitted infections in horses dating back to the 1980s. These data show that hypervirulent CG23 K. pneumoniae was circulating in humans for decades before the liver abscess epidemic was first recognised, and has the capacity to acquire and maintain AMR plasmids. These data provide a framework for future epidemiological and experimental studies of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae. To further support such studies we present an open access and completely sequenced human liver abscess isolate, SGH10, which is typical of the globally disseminated CG23-I sublineage.",

    "abstract": "Animal eyes evolve to process behaviourally important visual information, but how retinas deal with statistical asymmetries in visual space remains poorly understood. Using hyperspectral imaging in the field, in-vivo 2-photon imaging of retinal neurons and anatomy, here we show that larval zebrafish use a highly anisotropic retina to asymmetrically survey their natural visual world. First, different neurons dominate different parts of the eye, and are linked to a systematic shift in inner retinal function: Above the animal, there is little colour in nature and retinal circuits are largely achromatic. Conversely, the lower visual field and horizon are colour-rich, and are predominately surveyed by chromatic and colour-opponent circuits that are spectrally matched to the dominant chromatic axes in nature. Second, above the frontal horizon, a high-gain ultraviolet-system piggy-backs onto retinal circuits, likely to support prey-capture. Our results demonstrate high functional diversity among single genetically and morphologically defined types of neurons.",

    "abstract": "Kinase inhibition in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a standard therapy for cancer patients with activating BRAF mutations. However, the anti-tumorigenic effect and clinical benefit are only transient, and tumors are prone to treatment resistance and relapse. To elucidate mechanistic insights into drug resistance, we have established an in vitro cellular model of MAPK inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma. The cellular model evolved in response to clinical dosage of BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, PLX4032. We profiled transcriptomic changes using RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR arrays. Pathways of melanogenesis, MAPK signaling, cell cycle, and metabolism were significantly enriched among the set of differentially expressed genes of vemurafenib-resistant cells vs control. The transcriptomic changes were validated in two distinct melanoma models, SK-MEL-28 and A375. Both cell lines have activating BRAF mutations and display metastatic potential. Downregulation of tumor suppressors and negative MAPK regulators, dual specific phosphatases, reengages mitogenic signaling. Upregulation of growth factors or cytokine receptors triggers signaling pathways circumventing BRAF blockage. Changes in amino acid and one-carbon metabolism support cellular proliferation despite MAPK inhibitor treatment. In addition, an upregulation of pigmentation in inhibitor resistant melanoma cells was observed. Cellular pathways utilized during inhibitor resistance promoted melanogenesis, a pathway which partially overlaps with MAPK signaling. Upstream regulator analysis suggested gene expression changes of forkhead box and hypoxia inducible factor family transcription factors. The established cellular models offer mechanistic insight into cellular changes and therapeutic targets under inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma. At a systems biology level, the MAPK pathway undergoes major rewiring while acquiring inhibitor resistance. The outcome of this transcriptional plasticity is selection for a set of transcriptional master regulators, which circumvent upstream targeted kinases and provide alternative routes of mitogenic activation. A fine-woven network of redundant signals maintains similar effector genes allowing for tumor cell survival and malignant progression in therapy resistant cancer.",
