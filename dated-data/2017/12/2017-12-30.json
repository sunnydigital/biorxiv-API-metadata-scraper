    "abstract": "Selective sweeps reduce neutral genetic diversity. In sexual populations, this \\\"hitchhiking\\\" effect is thought to be limited to the local genomic region of the sweeping allele. While this is true in panmictic populations, we find that in spatially-extended populations the combined effects of many unlinked sweeps can affect patterns of ancestry (and therefore neutral genetic diversity) across the whole genome. Even low rates of sweeps can be enough to skew the spatial locations of ancestors such that neutral mutations that occur in an individual living outside a small region in the center of the range have virtually no chance of fixing in the population. The fact that nearly all ancestry rapidly traces back to a small spatial region also means that relatedness between individuals falls off very slowly as a function of the spatial distance between them.",

    "abstract": "Although driver genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been investigated in various previous genetic studies, prevalence of key driver genes among heterogeneous populations is unknown. Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients overall survival. Some driver genes are significantly linked to HCC gender (CTNNB1, ALB, TP53 and AXIN1), race (TP53 and CDKN2A), and age (RB1) disparities. This study prioritizes a group of consensus drivers in HCC, which collectively show vast impacts on the phenotypes. These driver genes may warrant as valuable therapeutic targets of HCC.",

    "abstract": "In order to infer that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) either affects a phenotype or is linkage disequilibrium with a causal site, we must have some assurance that any SNP-phenotype correlation is not the result of confounding with environmental variables that also affect the trait. In this work we study the properties of LD Score regression, a recently developed method for using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to ensure that confounding does not inflate the number of false positives. We do not treat the effects of genetic variation as a random variable and thus are able to obtain results about the unbiasedness of this method. We demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce estimates of confounding at null SNPs that are unbiased or conservative under fairly general conditions. This robustness holds in the case of the parent genotype affecting the offspring phenotype through some environmental mechanism, despite the resulting correlation over SNPs between LD Scores and the degree of confounding. Additionally, we demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce reasonably robust estimates of the genetic correlation, even when its estimates of the genetic covariance and the two univariate heritabilities are substantially biased.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning-based analysis of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns has enabled the visualization of perceptual content. However, it has been limited to the reconstruction with low-level image bases (Miyawaki et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016) or to the matching to exemplars (Naselaris et al., 2009; Nishimoto et al., 2011). Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features (Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017). Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed  reconstructs or  generates images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images. Furthermore, human judgment of reconstructions suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance visual quality of generated images. The results suggest that hierarchical visual information in the brain can be effectively combined to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe epitranscriptome, also known as chemical modifications of RNA (CMRs), is a newly discovered layer of gene regulation, the biological importance of which emerged through analysis of only a small fraction of CMRs detected by high-throughput sequencing technologies. Understanding of the epitranscriptome is hampered by the absence of computational tools for the systematic analysis of epitranscriptome sequencing data. In addition, no tools have yet been designed for accurate prediction of CMRs in plants, or to extend epitranscriptome analysis from a fraction of the transcriptome to its entirety.\\n\\nResultsHere, we introduce PEA, an integrated R toolkit to facilitate the analysis of plant epitranscriptome data. The PEA toolkit contains a comprehensive collection of functions required for read mapping, CMR calling, motif scanning and discovery, and gene functional enrichment analysis. PEA also takes advantage of machine learning technologies for transcriptome-scale CMR prediction, with high prediction accuracy, using the Positive Samples Only Learning algorithm, which addresses the two-class classification problem by using only positive samples (CMRs), in the absence of negative samples (non-CMRs). Hence PEA is a versatile epitranscriptome analysis pipeline covering CMR calling, prediction, and annotation, and we describe its application to predict N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in Arabidopsis thaliana. Experimental results demonstrate that the toolkit achieved 71.6% sensitivity and 73.7% specificity, which is superior to existing m6A predictors. PEA is potentially broadly applicable to the in-depth study of epitranscriptomics.\\n\\nAvailabilityPEA is implemented using R and available at https://github.com/cma2015/PEA.",

    "abstract": "As microtubule-organizing centers of animal cells, centrosomes guide the formation of the bipolar spindle that segregates chromosomes during mitosis. At mitosis onset, centrosomes maximize microtubule-organizing activity by rapidly expanding the pericentriolar material (PCM). This process is in part driven by the large PCM protein pericentrin (PCNT), as its level increases at the PCM and helps recruit additional PCM components. However, the mechanism underlying the timely centrosomal enrichment of PCNT remains unclear. Here we show that PCNT is delivered co-translationally to centrosomes during early mitosis by cytoplasmic dynein, as evidenced by centrosomal enrichment of PCNT mRNA, its translation near the centrosome, and requirement of intact polysomes for PCNT mRNA localization. Additionally, the microtubule minus-end regulator, ASPM, is also targeted co-translationally to mitotic spindle poles. Together, these findings suggest that co-translational targeting of cytoplasmic proteins to specific subcellular destinations may be a generalized protein targeting mechanism.",

However, systematic understanding on the cellular and molecular basis of this process is still limited, mainly impeded by the asynchrony in development and the lack of stage-specific markers. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on Oct4-GFP+/KIT- cells isolated from PND5.5 mice, we dissected the cellular heterogeneity and established molecular regulations. We demonstrated that gonocyte-spermatogonial transition was characterized by gene expression change related to apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and regulation of migration processes. Pseudotime analysis reconstructed developmental dynamics of the spermatogonial populations and unraveled sequential cellular and molecular transitions. We also identified CD87 as a neonatal stem cell marker which are potentially involved in the intial establishment of SSC pool. Lastly, we uncovered an unexpected subpopulation of spermatogonia primed to differentiation within the undifferentiated compartment, which is characterized by the lack of self-renewal genes and enhanced Oct4 expression and retinoic acid signaling response. Our study thus provides a novel understanding of cellular and molecular changes during spermatogonial establishment.",

The functional diversity of topsoil microbial groups was estimated from degradation of 31 substrates on Bencho EcoPlates. Using Factor Analysis (FA) we found width size had a significant influence on average column colorimetric disseminator analysis (AVGCLR) and on the Rao indices of topsoil microbial diversity. Compared with large widths, small widths had higher AVGCLR. The ten widths were divided into three groups by cluster analysis and FA: group 1 reflected large widths, while groups 2 and 3 reflected small widths. Thirty-one sole carbon sources were divided into three groups by FA. Using an eigenvector greater than 0.5 as a standard for checking carbon (C) sources, nineteen kinds of C sources included in principal components 1 and 2 had a relatively high influence on the topsoil microbial community, including carbohydrates, amino acids and carboxylic acids. This indicates that the use by topsoil microorganisms of carboxylic acids, sugars and amino acids was greater than other C sources. These findings suggest that width size played a key role in the topsoil microbial diversity after a natural disturbance.",

    "abstract": "Evolved resistance to one antibiotic may be associated with \\\"collateral\\\" sensitivity to other drugs. Here we provide an extensive quantitative characterization of collateral effects in Enterococcus faecalis, a gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. By combining parallel experimental evolution with high-throughput dose-response measurements, we measure phenotypic profiles of collateral sensitivity and resistance for a total of 900 mutant-drug combinations. We find that collateral effects are pervasive but difficult to predict, as independent populations selected by the same drug can exhibit qualitatively different profiles of collateral sensitivity as well as markedly different fitness costs. Using whole-genome sequencing of evolved populations, we identified mutations in a number of known resistance determinants, including mutations in several genes previously linked with collateral sensitivity in other species. While phenotypic drug sensitivity profiles show significant diversity, they cluster into statistically similar groups characterized by selecting drugs with similar mechanisms. To exploit the statistical structure in these resistance profiles, we develop a simple mathematical model based on a stochastic control process and use it to design optimal drug policies that assign a unique drug to every possible resistance profile. Stochastic simulations reveal that these optimal drug policies outperform intuitive cycling protocols by maintaining long-term sensitivity at the expense of short-term periods of high resistance. The approach reveals a new conceptual strategy for mitigating resistance by balancing short-term inhibition of pathogen growth with infrequent use of drugs intended to steer pathogen populations to a more vulnerable future state. Experiments in laboratory populations confirm that model-inspired sequences of four drugs reduce growth and slow adaptation relative to naive protocols involving the drugs alone, in pairwise cycles, or in four-drug uniform cycles.",

    "abstract": "The false discovery rate measures the proportion of false discoveries among a set of hypothesis tests called significant. This quantity is typically estimated based on p-values or test statistics. In some scenarios, there is additional information available that may be used to more accurately estimate the false discovery rate. We develop a new framework for formulating and estimating false discovery rates and q-values when an additional piece of information, which we call an \\\"informative variable\\\", is available. For a given test, the informative variable provides information about the prior probability a null hypothesis is true or the power of that particular test. The false discovery rate is then treated as a function of this informative variable. We consider two applications in genomics. Our first is a genetics of gene expression (eQTL) experiment in yeast where every genetic marker and gene expression trait pair are tested for associations. The informative variable in this case is the distance between each genetic marker and gene. Our second application is to detect differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq study carried out in mice. The informative variable in this study is the per-gene read depth. The framework we develop is quite general, and it should be useful in a broad range of scientific applications.",

It is not well known how cortical areas are interconnected in small-brained mammals like rodents. In this study, we systematically analyzed the data of Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to answer this question and found that the ipsilateral cortical connections in mice are almost exclusively contained within the grey matter with the exception of the retrosplenial area. We analyzed the layer-specific distribution of axonal projections within the grey matter using Cortical Box method and obtained the following results. First, widespread axonal projections were observed in both upper and lower layers in the vicinity of injections, whereas highly specific \\\"point-to-point\\\" projections were observed toward remote areas. Second, such long-range projections were predominantly aligned in the anteromedial-posterolateral direction. Third, in majority of these projections, the connecting axons traveled through layer 6. Finally, the projections from the primary and higher order areas to distant targets preferentially terminated in the middle and superficial layers, respectively, suggesting hierarchical connections similar to those of primates. Overall, our study suggests the conserved nature of neocortical organization across species despite conspicuous differences in wiring strategy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide. Both are partly caused by early life adversity (ELA) and ELA reduces both BDNF protein and gene expression. This study examines the association of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and brain BDNF levels with depression and suicide. We hypothesized that both major depression and ELA would be associated with the Met allele and lower brain BDNF levels. Such an association would be consistent with low BDNF mediating the effect of ELA on adulthood suicide and MDD. METHODS: BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was genotyped in postmortem brains of 37 suicide decedents and 53 non-suicides. Additionally, BDNF protein levels were determined by Western blot in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9; BA9), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA24), caudal brainstem and rostral brainstem. The relationships between these measures and major depression, death by suicide and reported childhood adversity were examined. RESULTS: Depressed subjects had an excess of the Met allele and lower BDNF levels in ACC and caudal brainstem compared with non-depressed subjects. No effect of history of suicide death or early life adversity was observed with genotype, but lower BDNF levels in ACC were found in subjects who had been exposed to early life adversity and/or died by suicide compared to nonsuicide decedents and no reported childhood adversity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence for low BDNF in major depression related to the BDNF met risk allele. Future studies should seek to determine how altered BDNF expression contributes to MDD and suicide.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) has been linked to disrupted structural and functional connectivity between prefrontal networks and limbic brain regions. Studies of patients with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) can help elucidate the developmental origins of altered structural connectivity underlying BD and provide novel insights into the aetiology of BD. Here we compare the network properties of whole-brain structural connectomes of PBD patients with psychosis and euthymic matched healthy controls. Our results show widespread changes in the structural connectivity of PBD patients in both cortical and subcortical networks, notably affecting the orbitofrontal cortex, frontal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus and basal ganglia. Graph theoretical analysis revealed that PBD connectomes have fewer hubs, weaker rich club organization, different modular fingerprint and inter-modular communication, compared to healthy participants. The relationship between network features and neurocognitive and psychotic scores was also assessed. Patients IQ and psychotic symptoms significantly correlated with the local efficiency of the orbitofrontal cortex. Our findings reveal that PBD is associated with significant widespread changes in structural network topology, thus strengthening the hypothesis of a reduced capacity for integrative processing of information across brain regions. Localised network changes involve core regions for emotional processing and regulation, as well as memory and executive function, some of which correlate with neurocognitive faculties and symptoms. Together, our findings provide the first comprehensive characterisation of the alterations in local and global structural brain connectivity and network topology, which may contribute to the deficits in cognition and emotion processing and regulation found in PBD.",

    "abstract": "A high concentration of a sole ammonium (NH4+) source in growth media is often toxic to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in plant NH4+ toxicity; however, its mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (Col-0) and NRT1.1 mutants (chl1-1 and chl1-5) were grown hydroponically in NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4 media to evaluate NRT1.1 function in NH4+ stress responses. All plants grew normally in mixed N sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis, and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the NRT1.1 mutants in the (NH4)2SO4 condition. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and chl1-5 further confirmed that NH4+ toxicity is NRT1.1-dependent. In (NH4)2SO4 medium, NRT1.1 facilitated the higher expression of NH4+ transporters, increasing NH4+ uptake. Additionally, glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthetase (GOGAT) in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase (PK)-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH4+ accumulation. In contrast, the NRT1.1 mutants reduced NH4+ accumulation and enhanced NH4+ assimilation through glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glutamate-oxaloacetate transamination (GOT) activity. In addition, the upregulation of genes involved in senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH4)2SO4 suggests that ethylene could be involved in NH4+ toxicity responses. Our results indicate that NH4+ toxicity is dependent on NRT1.1 in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH4+ accumulation and by perturbed NH4+ metabolism, which stimulated ethylene-induced plant senescence.\\n\\nHighlight: Nitrate transporter NRT1.1 enhances NH4+ accumulation, disturbs the NH4+ metabolism, and aggravates NH4+ toxicity in Arabidopsis when grown under sole NH4+ condition.",

Consisting of only eight strands, our DNA nanostructure spontaneously inserts into biological membranes by forming a toroidal pore that connects the membranes inner and outer leaflets. The membrane insertion catalyzes spontaneous transport of lipid molecules between the bilayer leaflets, rapidly equilibrating the lipid composition. Through a combination of microscopic simulations and single-molecule experiments we find the lipid transport rate catalyzed by the DNA nanostructure to exceed 107 molecules per second, which is three orders of magnitude higher than the rate of lipid transport catalyzed by biological enzymes. Furthermore, we show that our DNA-based enzyme can control the composition of human cell membranes, which opens new avenues for applications of membrane-interacting DNA systems in medicine.",

    "abstract": "Traditional unbiased genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci associated with various complex diseases but there is evidence to suggest that many variants were missed at stringent genome-wide thresholds. Fortunately, there is a rapidly increasing amount of prior knowledge in publicly available genomic datasets and biological databases that can be harnessed to enhance the power of discovering SNPs/Genes from existing or new GWAS datasets. For most diseases, many of the identified loci tend to cluster into a few specific biological pathways/networks. From the point of view of disease etiology, such clustering is generally to be expected. This phenomenon can be exploited to conduct a more powerful genome-wide scan that is tailored to identify loci that are interconnected in pathways. We propose a scalable regression-based analytical framework to enable such a pathway-guided GWAS and demonstrate that it provides significant gains in power to detect disease associated SNPs. Our method requires two inputs, namely a) genome-wide summary level data (e.g., SNP p-values) and b) a grouping of genes into biologically meaningful categories (e.g., a database of pathways). It automatically adjusts the input p-values by incorporating the knowledge derived adaptively from the data and the pathways specified. The method involves a regularized logistic regression analysis to derive priors of each SNP and then re-weights the p-values of SNPs so as to maximize overall power of making discoveries. It increases the power to discover SNPs co-clustering into some of these pathways, while maintaining the global type-1 error (FWER) at the desired level. We used whole-genome simulations and summary data from real GWA studies of psoriasis, SLE, coronary artery disease and type-2 diabetes to illustrate the power improvement achieved by pathway-guided search. Our pipeline implemented as an R package can flexibly handle large number of prior annotations possibly derived from multiple databases.",

    "abstract": "Cellulosic plant biomass is a promising sustainable resource for generating alternative biofuels and biochemicals with microbial factories. But a remaining bottleneck is engineering microbes that are tolerant of toxins generated during biomass processing, because mechanisms of toxin defense are only beginning to emerge. Here, we exploited natural diversity in 165 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from diverse geographical and ecological niches, to identify mechanisms of hydrolysate-toxin tolerance. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to identify genetic variants underlying toxin tolerance, and gene knockouts and allele-swap experiments to validate the involvement of implicated genes. In the process of this work, we uncovered a surprising difference in genetic architecture depending on strain background: in all but one case, knockout of implicated genes had a significant effect on toxin tolerance in one strain, but no significant effect in another strain. In fact, whether or not the gene was involved in tolerance in each strain background had a bigger contribution to strain-specific variation than allelic differences. Our results suggest a major difference in the underlying network of causal genes in different strains, suggesting that mechanisms of hydrolysate tolerance are very dependent on the genetic background. These results could have significant implications for interpreting GWA results and raise important considerations for engineering strategies for industrial strain improvement.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the genetic architecture of complex traits is important for elucidating the genotype-phenotype relationship. Many studies have sought genetic variants that underlie phenotypic variation across individuals, both to implicate causal variants and to inform on architecture. Here we used genome-wide association analysis to identify genes and processes involved in tolerance of toxins found in plant-biomass hydrolysate, an important substrate for sustainable biofuel production. We found substantial variation in whether or not individual genes were important for tolerance across genetic backgrounds. Whether or not a gene was important in a given strain background explained more variation than the alleleic differences in the gene. These results suggest substantial variation in gene contributions, and perhaps underlying mechanisms, of toxin tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment \\\"input\\\" to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This \\\"myopic\\\" controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this controls utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic controls utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.",

This work presented a successful route to prepare ultrathin fibers from hybrid solutions containing a commercial polyester, poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and a conductive polymer, polypyrrole (PPy). The final material (PBAT/PPy) showed an enhanced potential for neuronal differentiation when compared to neat PBAT. The PPy loading improved branching and neurite extension of Neuro2a cells, which opens a wide range of perspectives where these materials may be applied in regenerative medicine.\\n\\nABSTRACTWe present a methodology for production and application of electrospun hybrid materials containing commercial polyester (poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate; PBAT), and a conductive polymer (polypirrole; PPy) as scaffold for neuronal growth and differentiation. The physical-chemical properties of the scaffolds and optimization of the electrospinning parameters are presented. The electrospun scaffolds are biocompatible and allow proper adhesion and spread of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Fibers produced with PBAT with or without PPy were used as scaffold for Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cells adhesion and differentiation. Neuro2a adhered to PBAT and PBAT/PPy2% scaffolds without laminin coating. However, Neuro2a failed to differentiate in PBAT when stimulated by treatment with retinoic acid (RA), but differentiated in PBAT/PPy2% fibers. We hypothesize that PBAT hydrophobicity inhibited proper spreading and further differentiation, and inhibition was overcome by coating the PBAT fibers with laminin. We conclude that fibers produced with the combination of PBAT and PPy can support neuronal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomes are essential for a number of cellular functions, including reactive oxygen species metabolism, fatty acid {beta}-oxidation and lipid biosynthesis. To ensure optimal functionality of peroxisome-dependent processes throughout the cell they must be trafficked; however, peroxisomal transport remains poorly characterised. Here we show that Miro1 and Miro2, outer mitochondrial membrane proteins essential for mitochondrial trafficking, are also localised to peroxisomes. Peroxisomal localisation of Miro1 is negatively regulated by its first GTPase domain and is mediated by an interaction through its transmembrane domain with the peroxisomal-membrane protein chaperone, Pex19. By using Miro1/2 double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) we find that the loss of Miro1/2 leads to a significant reduction in short-range microtubule-independent peroxisomal motility. Additionally, Miro regulates peroxisomal size and morphology. Our results contribute to the fundamental understanding of peroxisomal trafficking and morphology, supporting a complex crosstalk between peroxisomal and mitochondrial biology.",

    "abstract": "Specific class I members of the TRIM family of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single invertebrate class I TRIM and mammalian TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the axon guidance cue netrin-1, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Optiz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often mild intellectual disability. TRIM67 is the most evolutionarily conserved vertebrate class I TRIM, yet is the least studied. Here we show that TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC, and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions at specific developmental points. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine Trim67. While viable, mice lacking Trim67 display severe impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function and sensorimotor gating. Additionally, they exhibit abnormal anatomy of several brain regions, including the hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, as well as the corpus callosum. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and function.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAs a family, class I TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in neuronal development and function, potentially cooperatively. TRIM67 is the most evolutionarily conserved class I TRIM and is developmentally regulated and brain-enriched. Deletion of murine Trim67 results in malformations of a subset subcortical brain regions and of cortical and subcortical myelinated fiber tracts, as well as deficits in spatial memory, motor function, sociability and sensorimotor gating. We conclude that TRIM67 is critical for appropriate brain development and behavior, potentially downstream of the axon guidance cue netrin, and in cooperation with class I TRIM9.",
