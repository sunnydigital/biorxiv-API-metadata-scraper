    "abstract": "To aid understanding of retinal structure and function, we present as an online resource the dendritic arbors and visual responses of ganglion cells in a single patch of mouse retina. We divide the inner plexiform layer, which contains the dendritic arbors of ganglion cells, into four sublaminae defined by a purely anatomical principle of arbor segregation. The sublaminae serve as the starting point for a hierarchical clustering of our ganglion cells. We propose and apply a quantitative criterion for validating a cluster as a ganglion cell type: the aggregate neurite density of a type should be approximately uniform (\\\"density conservation\\\"). Finally, we find that ganglion cells arborizing in the inner marginal sublamina of the inner plexi-form layer exhibit significantly more sustained visual responses on average.",

    "abstract": "The caste system of termites is an example of phenotypic plasticity. The castes differ not only in morphology and physiology, but also in behavior. As most of their behaviors within colonies involve nestmates, it is difficult to extract innate differences among castes. In this study, we focused on movement patterns of isolated individuals of Hodotermopsis sjostedti. We observed distinct clusters in movement patterns over 30 min, which indicates that termites have multiple innate modes of movement. The use of these modes is biased among castes, among which neotenics had a caste-specific mode and soldiers moved more actively than workers or neotenics. These caste biases may reflect different adaptive responses to social isolation. Our study provides a basis for a deeper understanding of the roles of individual movements in social behaviors.\\n\\nSummary StatementMovement patterns of termites in isolation were described for different castes. We proposed movements as a novel caste-specific characteristics in social insects.",

    "abstract": "One key question is whether people rely on frugal heuristics or full-information strategies when making preference decisions. We propose a novel method, model-based active learning, to answer whether people conform more to a rank-based heuristic (Take-The-Best) or a weight-based full-information strategy (logistic regression). Our method eclipses traditional model comparison techniques by using information theory to characterize model predictions for how decision makers should actively sample information. These analyses capture how sampling affects learning and how learning affects decisions on subsequent trials. We develop and test model-based active learning algorithms for both Take-The-Best and logistic regression. Our findings reveal that people largely follow a weight-based learning strategy rather than a rank-based strategy, even in cases where their preference decisions are better predicted by the Take-The-Best heuristic. This finding suggests that people may have more refined knowledge than is revealed by their preference decisions, but which can be revealed by their information sampling behavior. We argue that model-based active learning is an effective and sensitive method for model selection that expands the basis for model comparison.",

We present here the Kibbutzim Family Study (KFS), initiated for investigating environmental and genetic determinants of cardiometabolic traits in extended Israeli families living in communes characterized by long-term social stability and homogeneous environment. Extensive information on cardiometabolic traits, as well as genome-wide genetic data, was collected on 901 individuals, making this study, to the best of our knowledge, the largest of its kind in Israel. We have thoroughly characterized the KFS genetic structure, observing that most participants were of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) origin, and confirming a recent severe bottleneck in their recent history (point estimates: effective size {approx}450 individuals, 23 generations ago). Focusing on genetic variants enriched in KFS compared with non-Finnish Europeans, we demonstrated that AJ-specific variants are largely involved in cancer-related pathways. Using linear mixed models, we conducted an association study of these enriched variants with 16 cardiometabolic traits. We found 24 variants to be significantly associated with cardiometabolic traits. The strongest association, which we also replicated, was between a variant upstream of the MSRA gene, {approx}200-fold enriched in KFS, and weight (P=3.6{middle dot}10-8). In summary, the KFS is a valuable resource for the study of the population genetics of Israel as well as the genetics of cardiometabolic traits in a homogeneous environment.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies suggest dental caries traits in children and adolescents are partially heritable, but there has been no large-scale consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date. We therefore performed GWAS for caries in participants aged 2.5-18.0 years from 9 contributing centers. Phenotype definitions were created for the presence or absence of treated or untreated caries, stratified by primary and permanent dentition. All studies tested for association between caries and genotype dosage (imputed to Haplotype Reference Consortium or 1000 Genomes phase 1 version 3 panels) accounting for population stratification. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed weighted by inverse standard error. Analysis included up to 19,003 individuals (7,530 affected) for primary teeth and 13,353 individuals (5,875 affected) for permanent teeth. Evidence for association with caries status was observed at rs1594318-C for primary teeth (intronic within ALLC, Odds Ratio (OR) 0.85, Effect Allele Frequency (EAF) 0.60, p 4.13e-8) and rs7738851-A (intronic within NEDD9, OR 1.28, EAF 0.85, p 1.63e-8) for permanent teeth. Consortium-wide estimated heritability of caries was low (h2 of 1% [95% CI: 0%:7%] and 6% [95% CI 0%:13%] for primary and permanent dentitions, respectively) compared to corresponding within-study estimates (h2 of 28%, [95% CI: 9%:48%] and 17% [95% CI:2%:31%]) or previously published estimates. This study was designed to identify common genetic variants with modest effects which are consistent across different populations. We found few single variants associated with caries status under these assumptions. Phenotypic heterogeneity between cohorts and limited statistical power will have contributed; these findings could also reflect complexity not captured by our study design, such as genetic effects which are conditional on environmental exposure.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDental caries (tooth decay) is a common disease in children. Previous studies suggest genetic factors alter caries risk, but to date there is a gap of knowledge in identifying which specific genetic variants are responsible. We undertook analysis in a consortium including around 19,000 children and investigated whether any of 8 million common genetic variants were associated with risk of caries in primary (milk) or permanent teeth. If identified, these variants are used as  tags to highlight genes which may be involved in a disease. We identified variants in two loci associated with caries status; in the primary (rs1594318) and permanent dentition (rs7738851). The former is intronic in ALLC, a gene with poorly understood function. The latter is an intronic variant within NEDD9, a gene which has several known functions including a role in development of craniofacial structures. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of genetic effects which influence caries larger studies and a better understanding of environmental modifiers or interactions with genetic effects are required.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin is associated with transcriptional repression. In contrast, several genes in the pericentromeric regions of Drosophila melanogaster are dependent on this heterochromatic environment for their expression. Heterochromatic genes encode proteins involved in various developmental processes. Several studies have shown that a variety of epigenetic modifications is associated with these genes. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic landscape of heterochromatic genes across all the developmental stages of Drosophila using the available histone modification and expression data from modENCODE. We find that heterochromatic genes exhibit combinations of active and inactive histone marks that correspond to their level of expression during development. Thus, we classified these genes into three groups based on the combinations of histone modifications present. We also looked for potential regulatory DNA sequence elements in the genomic neighborhood of these genes. Our results show that Nuclear Matrix Associated Regions (MARs) are prominently present in the intergenic regions of heterochromatic genes during embryonic stages suggesting their plausible role in pericentromeric genome organization. We also find that the intergenic sequences in the heterochromatic regions have binding sites for transcription factors known to modulate epigenetic status. Taken together, our meta-analysis of the various genomic datasets suggest that the epigenomic and genomic landscape of the heterochromatic genes are distinct from that of euchromatic genes. These features could be contributing to the unusual regulatory status of the heterochromatic genes as opposed to the surrounding heterochromatin, which is repressive in nature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlyoxalase 1 (GLO1) is an enzyme that metabolizes methylglyoxal (MG), which is a competitive partial agonist at GABAA receptors. Inhibition of GLO1 increases concentrations of MG in the brain and decreases binge-like ethanol drinking. The present study assessed whether inhibition of GLO1, or genetic over expression of Glo1, would also alter the locomotor effects of ethanol, which might explain reduced ethanol consumption following GLO1 inhibition. We used the prototypical GABAA receptor agonist muscimol as a positive control.\\n\\nMethodsMale C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with aeither the GLO1 inhibitor S-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG; 7.5 mg/kg; Experiment 1) or muscimol (0.75 mg/kg; Experiment 2), or their corresponding vehicle. We then determined whether locomotor response to a range of ethanol doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5) was altered by either pBBG or muscimol pretreatment. We also examined the locomotor response to a range of ethanol doses in FVB/NJ wild type and transgenic Glo1 over expressing mice (Experiment 3). Anxiety-like behavior (time spent in the center of the open field) was assessed in all three experiments.\\n\\nResultsThe ethanol dose-response curve was not altered by pretreatment with pBBG or by transgenic overexpression of Glo1. In contrast, muscimol blunted locomotor stimulation at low ethanol doses, and potentiated locomotor sedation at higher ethanol doses. No drug or genotype differences were seen in anxiety-like behavior after ethanol treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsThe dose of pBBG used in this study is within the effective range shown previously to reduce ethanol drinking. Glo1 overexpression has been previously shown to increase ethanol drinking. However, neither manipulation altered the dose response curve for ethanols locomotor effects, whereas muscimol appeared to enhance the locomotor sedative effects of ethanol. The present data demonstrate that reduced ethanol drinking caused by GLO1 inhibition is not due to potentiation of ethanols stimulant or depressant effects.",

    "abstract": "From natural ecology 1-4 to clinical therapy 5-8, cells are often exposed to mixtures of multiple drugs. Two competing null models are used to predict the combined effect of drugs: response additivity (Bliss) and dosage additivity (Loewe) 9-11. Here, noting that these models diverge with increased number of drugs, we contrast their predictions with measurements of Escherichia coli growth under combinations of up to 10 different antibiotics. As the number of drugs increases, Bliss maintains accuracy while Loewe systematically loses its predictive power. The total dosage required for growth inhibition, which Loewe predicts should be fixed, steadily increases with the number of drugs, following a square root scaling. This scaling is explained by an approximation to Bliss where, inspired by RA Fishers classical geometric model 12, dosages of independent drugs adds up as orthogonal vectors rather than linearly. This dose-orthogonality approximation provides results similar to Bliss, yet uses the dosage language as Loewe and is hence easier to implement and intuit. The rejection of dosage additivity in favor of effect additivity and dosage orthogonality provides a framework for understanding how multiple drugs and stressors add up in nature and the clinic.",

Differentiated mESCs exhibited distinct replication profiles, which were conserved from cell to cell. Haplotype-resolved scRepli-seq revealed similar replication timing profiles of homologous autosomes, while the inactive X chromosome was clearly replicated later than its active counterpart. However, a small degree of cell-to-cell replication timing heterogeneity was present, and we discovered that developmentally regulated domains are a source of such variability, suggesting a link between cell-to-cell heterogeneity and developmental plasticity. Together, our results form a foundation for single-cell-level understanding of DNA replication regulation and provide insights into 3D genome organization.",

Through a large-scale mensurative study, we investigated possible benthic-pelagic coupling along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, a western ocean boundary coast. We studied the high intertidal zone of nine wave-exposed bedrock locations spanning 415 km of coastline from north to south. At each location in the spring, we measured the recruitment of barnacles and mussels, the two main filter-feeding invertebrates. Recruitment varied irregularly along the coast. Satellite data on coastal phytoplankton and particulate organic carbon (food for intertidal filter-feeders and their pelagic larvae) and in-situ data on seawater temperature explained, to varying degrees, the geographic structure of recruitment. In turn, the summer abundance of both filter-feeders was positively related to their spring recruitment. Ultimately, predator (dogwhelk) abundance was positively related to the recruitment and/or abundance of barnacles and mussels (the main prey of dogwhelks). These results are consistent with bottom-up forcing influencing intertidal community structure on this coast. Sea ice may also influence this predator-prey interaction. Drift ice leaving the Gulf of St. Lawrence in late winter disturbed the northern locations surveyed on the Atlantic coast, making barnacles (owing to their high spring recruitment) the only food source for dogwhelks at such places. Investigating the oceanographic drivers of pelagic food supply and seawater temperature should help to further understand how this large metacommunity is organized.",

    "abstract": "The study of maize domestication has overlooked the genetic structure within maizes wild relative teosinte. Prior to investigating the domestication history of maize (Zea mays subspecies mays), one should first understand the population history of teosintes and how they relate to maize. To achieve this, we used 32,739 SNPs obtained from a broad sampling of teosinte populations and 46 maize landraces and a) inferred current and past gene flow among teosinte populations and maize, b) analyzed the degree of introgression among Zea mays subspecies, and c) explored the putative domestication location of maize. We found geographic structure and introgression between Zea mays taxa. Teosinte subspecies have diverged significantly from maize, which indicates that current teosinte populations have evolved mainly independently from maize since the domestication. Our results further suggest that the likely ancestor of maize may maybe have come from Jalisco or the Pacific coast.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryShared polymorphism in teosinte suggests a Jalisco origin of maize domestication.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons are commonly thought to report a reward prediction error, as hypothesized by reinforcement learning theory. While this theory has been highly successful, several lines of evidence suggest that dopamine activity also encodes sensory prediction errors unrelated to reward. Here we develop a new theory of dopamine function that embraces a broader conceptualization of prediction errors. By signaling errors in both sensory and reward predictions, dopamine supports a form of reinforcement learning that lies between model-based and model-free algorithms. This account remains consistent with current canon regarding the correspondence between dopamine transients and reward prediction errors, while also accounting for new data suggesting a role for these signals in phenomena such as sensory preconditioning and identity unblocking, which ostensibly draw upon knowledge beyond reward predictions.",

    "abstract": "Plant aquaporins (AQPs) play vital roles in several physiological processes. Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) belong to the subfamily of plant AQPs and they are further divided into two closely related subgroups PIP1s and PIP2s. Members of the two subgroups have been shown to have different transport properties. While PIP2 members are efficient water channels, PIP1s from some plant species have been shown to be functionally inactive. Aquaporins form tetramers under physiological conditions. PIP2s can enhance the water transport of PIP1s when they form hetero-tetramers. However, the role of monomer-monomer interface and the significance of specific residues in enhancing the water permeation of PIP1s have not been investigated at atomic level. We have performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of homo-tetramers of ZmPIP1;2 and ZmPIP2;5 from Zea mays and hetero-tetramers containing ZmPIP1;2 and ZmPIP2;5 with different stoichiometries and configurations. ZmPIP1;2 in a tetramer assembly will have two interfaces, one formed by transmembrane segments TM4 and TM5 and the other formed by TM1 and TM2. We have analyzed channel radius profiles, water transport and potential of mean force profiles of ZmPIP1;2 monomers with different types of interfaces. Results of MD simulations clearly revealed that TM4-TM5 interface and not the TM1-TM2 interface is important in modulating the water transport of ZmPIP1;2. We generated in silico mutants of specific residues that are involved in contacts with adjacent monomers. MD simulations of mutant tetramers highlighted the importance of I93 residue from the TM2 segment of ZmPIP2;5 for the increased water transport in ZmPIP1;2.",

    "abstract": "Clustering enzymes in the same metabolism pathway is a natural strategy to enhance the productivity. Several systems have been designed to artificially cluster desired enzymes in the cell, such as synthetic protein scaffold and nucleic acid scaffold. However, these scaffolds require complicated construction process and have limited slots for target enzymes. Following this direction, we designed a scaffold system based on natural cell membrane. Target enzymes (FabZ, FabG, FabI and TesA in fatty acid synthesis II pathway) are anchored on the E.coli inner membrane, showing the enhanced metabolism flux without the requirement of the further artificial interactions to force the clustering. Furthermore, anchoring the enzymes on the membrane enhances the products exportation, which further increases the productivity. Together, the proposed system has potential applications in producing valuable biomaterials.",
