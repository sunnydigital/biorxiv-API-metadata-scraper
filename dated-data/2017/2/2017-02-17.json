    "abstract": "Infection of more than one virus in a host, coinfection, is common across taxa and environments. Viral coinfection can enable genetic exchange, alter the dynamics of infections, and change the course of viral evolution. Yet, a systematic test of the factors explaining variation in viral coinfection across different taxa and environments awaits completion. Here I employ three microbial data sets of virus-host interactions covering cross-infectivity, culture coinfection, and single-cell coinfection (total: 6,564 microbial hosts, 13,103 viruses) to provide a broad, comprehensive picture of the ecological and biological factors shaping viral coinfection. I found evidence that ecology and virus-virus interactions are recurrent factors shaping coinfection patterns. Host ecology was a consistent and strong predictor of coinfection across all three datasets: cross-infectivity, culture coinfection, and single-cell coinfection. Host phylogeny or taxonomy was a less consistent predictor, being weak or absent in the cross-infectivity and single-cell coinfection models, yet it was the strongest predictor in the culture coinfection model. Virus-virus interactions strongly affected coinfection. In the largest test of superinfection exclusion to date, prophage sequences reduced culture coinfection by other prophages, with a weaker effect on extrachromosomal virus coinfection. At the single-cell level, prophage sequences eliminated coinfection. Virus-virus interactions also increased culture coinfection with ssDNA-dsDNA coinfections >2x more likely than ssDNA-only coinfections. The presence of CRISPR spacers was associated with a ~50% reduction in single-cell coinfection in a marine bacteria, despite the absence of exact spacer matches in any active infection. Collectively, these results suggest the environment bacteria inhabit and the interactions among surrounding viruses are two factors consistently shaping viral coinfection patterns. These findings highlight the role of virus-virus interactions in coinfection with implications for phage therapy, microbiome dynamics, and viral infection treatments.",

In this study, we associate polypharmacological drugs with CATH functional families, a type of protein domain and we use the network properties of these druggable protein families to analyse their relationships with drug side effects. We found druggable CATH functional families enriched in drug targets, whose relatives are structurally coherent, gather together in the protein functional network occupying central positions, and tend to be free of proteins associated with drug side effects. Our results demonstrate that CATH functional families can be used to identify drug-target interactions, opening a new research direction in target identification.",

Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations were tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The human brain continuously processes massive amounts of rich sensory information. To better understand such highly complex brain processes, modern neuroimaging studies are increasingly utilizing experimental setups that better mimic daily-life situations. We propose a new exploratory data-analysis approach, functional segmentation intersubject correlation analysis (FuSeISC), to facilitate the analysis of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data sets collected in these experiments. The method provides a new type of functional segmentation of brain areas, not only characterizing areas that display similar processing across subjects but also areas in which processing across subjects is highly variable.\\n\\nWe tested FuSeISC using fMRI data sets collected during traditional block-design stimuli (37 subjects) as well as naturalistic auditory narratives (19 subjects). The method identified spatially local and/or bilaterally symmetric clusters in several cortical areas, many of which are known to be processing the types of stimuli used in the experiments. The method is not only prominent for spatial exploration of large fMRI data sets obtained using naturalistic stimuli, but has other potential applications such as generation of a functional brain atlases including both lower-and higher-order processing areas.\\n\\nFinally, as a part of FuSeISC, we propose a criterion-based sparsification of the shared nearest-neighbor graph for detecting clusters in noisy data. In our tests with synthetic data, this technique was superior to well-known clustering methods, such as Ward's method, affinity propagation and K-means++.",

This is important as heterogenous cell populations are ubiquitous during the embryonic development of many species. We have previously shown that the long term behaviour of an agent population depends on the way in which domain growth is implemented. We extend this work to show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different species dominate in multispecies simulations. Continuum approximations of the lattice-based model that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture this behaviour, while those that explicitly account for spatial correlations can. The results presented here show that the precise mechanism of domain growth can determine the long term behaviour of multispecies populations, and in certain circumstances, establish spatially varying species densities.",

    "abstract": "Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the bubonic plague, a disease responsible for several dramatic historical pandemics. Progress in ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing rendered possible the sequencing of whole genomes of important human pathogens, including the ancient Yersinia pestis strains responsible for outbreaks of the bubonic plague in London in the 14th century and in Marseille in the 18th century among others. However, aDNA sequencing data are still characterized by short reads and non-uniform coverage, so assembling ancient pathogen genomes remains challenging and prevents in many cases a detailed study of genome rearrangements. It has recently been shown that comparative scaffolding approaches can improve the assembly of ancient Yersinia pestis genomes at a chromosome level. In the present work, we address the last step of genome assembly, the gap-filling stage. We describe an optimization-based method AGapEs (Ancestral Gap Estimation) to fill in inter-contig gaps using a combination of a template obtained from related extant genomes and aDNA reads. We show how this approach can be used to refine comparative scaffolding by selecting contig adjacencies supported by a mix of unassembled aDNA reads and comparative signal. We apply our method to two data sets from the London and Marseilles outbreaks of the bubonic plague. We obtain highly improved genome assemblies for both the London strain and Marseille strain genomes, comprised of respectively five and six scaffolds, with 95% of the assemblies supported by ancient reads. We analyze the genome evolution between both ancient genomes in terms of genome rearrangements, and observe a high level of synteny conservation between these two strains.",

    "abstract": "Plant specialized metabolites are chemically highly diverse, play key roles in host-microbe interactions, have important nutritional value in crops and are frequently applied as medicines. It has recently become clear that plant biosynthetic pathway-encoding genes are sometimes densely clustered in specific genomic loci: biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Here, we introduce plantiSMASH, a versatile online analysis platform that automates the identification of candidate plant BGCs. Moreover, it allows integration of transcriptomic data to prioritize candidate BGCs based on the coexpression patterns of predicted biosynthetic enzyme-coding genes, and facilitates comparative genomic analysis to study the evolutionary conservation of each cluster. Applied on 48 high-quality plant genomes, plantiSMASH identifies a rich diversity of candidate plant BGCs. These results will guide further experimental exploration of the nature and dynamics of gene clustering in plant metabolism. Moreover, spurred by the continuing decrease in costs of plant genome sequencing, they will allow genome mining technologies to be applied to plant natural product discovery.\\n\\nThe plantiSMASH web server, precalculated results and source code are freely available from http://plantismash.secondarymetabolites.org.",

    "abstract": "The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacks a diverse toolkit of inducible promoters for experimental manipulation. Available inducible promoters suffer from slow induction kinetics, limited control of expression levels and/or a requirement for defined growth medium. In particular, no S. pombe inducible promoter systems exhibit a linear dose response, which would allow expression to be tuned to specific levels. We have adapted a fast, orthogonal promoter system with a large dynamic range and a linear dose response, based on {beta}-estradiol-regulated function of the human estrogen receptor, for use in S. pombe. We show that this promoter system, termed Z3EV, turns on quickly, can reach a maximal induction of 20 fold, and exhibits a linear dose response over its entire induction range, with few off target effects. We demonstrate the utility of this system by regulating the mitotic inhibitor Wee1 to create a strain in which cell size is regulated by {beta}-estradiol concentration. This promoter system will be of great utility for experimentally regulating gene expression in fission yeast.",

    "abstract": "We outline what we believe could be an improvement in future discussions of the brain acting as a Bayesian-Laplacian system. We do so by distinguishing between two broad classes of priors on which the brains inferential systems operate: in one category are biological priors ({beta} priors) and in the other artifactual ones ( priors). We argue that {beta} priors, of which colour categories and faces are good examples, are inherited or acquired very rapidly after birth, are highly or relatively resistant to change through experience, and are common to all humans. The consequence is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal assent and agreement is high. By contrast,  priors, of which man-made objects are examples, are acquired post-natally and modified at various stages throughout post-natal life; they are much more accommodating of, and hospitable to, new experiences. Consequently, posteriors generated from them are less likely to find universal assent. Taken together, in addition to the more limited capacity of experiment and experience to alter the {beta} priors compared to  priors, another cardinal distinction between the two is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal agreement is greater than that for  priors. The two categories are not, however, always totally distinct and can merge into one another to varying extents, resulting in posteriors that draw upon both categories.",

The motion artifacts in two-photon microscopy recordings can be non-rigid, arising from the finite time of raster scanning and non-uniform deformations of the brain medium.\\n\\nNew methodWe introduce an algorithm for fast Non-Rigid Motion Correction (NoRMCorre) based on template matching. NoRMCorre operates by splitting the field of view into overlapping spatial patches that are registered at a sub-pixel resolution for rigid translation against a continuously updated template. The estimated alignments are subsequently up-sampled to create a smooth motion field for each frame that can efficiently approximate non-rigid motion in a piecewise-rigid manner.\\n\\nExisting methodsExisting approaches either do not scale well in terms of computational performance or are targeted to motion artifacts arising from low speed scanning, whereas modern datasets with large field of view are more prone to non-rigid brain deformation issues.\\n\\nResultsNoRMCorre can be run in an online mode resulting in comparable to or even faster than real time motion registration on streaming data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method with simple yet intuitive metrics and compare against other non-rigid registration methods on two-photon calcium imaging datasets. Open source Matlab and Python code is also made available.\\n\\nConclusionsThe proposed method and code provide valuable support to the community for solving large scale image registration problems in calcium imaging, especially when non-rigid deformations are present in the acquired data.",

    "abstract": "Defects in the enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis result in a group of human metabolic genetic disorders known as porphyrias. Using a zebrafish model for human hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), caused by defective uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Urod), the fifth enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway, we recently have found a novel aspect of porphyria pathogenesis. However, no hereditable zebrafish models with genetic mutations of alad and cpox, encoding the second enzyme delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (Alad) and the sixth enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase (Cpox), have been established to date. Here we employed site-specific genome-editing tools transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) to generate zebrafish mutants for alad and cpox. These zebrafish mutants display phenotypes of heme deficiency, hypochromia, abnormal erythrocytic maturation and accumulation of heme precursor intermediates, reminiscent of human ALA-dehydratase-deficient porphyria (ADP) and hereditary coproporphyrian (HCP), respectively. Further, we observed altered expression of genes involved in heme biosynthesis and degradation and particularly down-regulation of exocrine pancreatic zymogens in ADP (alad-/-) and HCP (cpox-/-) fishes. These two zebrafish porphyria models can survive at least 7 days and thus provide invaluable resources for elucidating novel pathological aspects of porphyrias, evaluating mutated forms of human ALAD and CPOX, discovering new therapeutic targets and developing effective drugs for these complex genetic diseases. Our studies also highlight generation of zebrafish models for human diseases with two versatile genome-editing tools.",

    "abstract": "Sanborn and Chater [1] propose an interesting theory of cognitive and brain function based on Bayesian sampling instead of asymptotic Bayesian inference. Their proposal unifies many current observations and models and, in spite of focusing primarily on cognitive phenomena, their work provides a springboard for unifying several proposed theories of brain function. It has the potential to serve as a bridge between three influential overarching current theories of cognitive and brain function: Bayesian models, Fristons [2-4] theory of cortical responses based on the free-energy principle, and attractor-basin dynamics [5,6]. Specifically, their proposal suggests a high-level perspective on Fristons theory, which in turn proposes a sampling procedure including appropriate handling of autocorrelation as well as a plausible neurobiological implementation. In turn, these two theories together link into attractor-basin dynamics at the level of networks (via Friston) as well at the level of behavior (via the relationship between the modes of prior and posterior distributions, as discussed by Sanborn and Chater). We will argue here that, by linking Sanborn and Chaters approach to neurobiological models based on the free-energy principle on the one hand and attractor-basin dynamics on the other, the scope of their proposal can be broadened considerably. Moreover, a unified perspective along these lines provides an elegant solution to several of Sanborn and Chaters Outstanding Questions relating to the neural implementation of sampling.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito vectors lay their eggs in the aquatic milieu. During early embryogenesis water passes freely through the transparent eggshell, composed of exochorion and endochorion. Within two hours the endochorion darkens via melanization but even so eggs shrink and perish if removed from moisture. However, during mid-embryogenesis, cells of the extraembryonic serosa secretes the serosal cuticle, localized right below the endochorion, which greatly reduces water flow and allows the egg to survive outside the water. The degree of egg resistance to desiccation (ERD) at late embryogenesis varies among different species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles aquasalis and Culex quinquefasciatus eggs can survive in a dry environment for [&ge;] 72, 24 and 5 hours, respectively. In some adult insects, darker-body individuals show greater resistance to desiccation than lighter ones. We asked if melanization enhances serosal cuticle-dependent ERD. Species with higher ERD at late embryogenesis exhibit more melanized eggshells. The melanization-ERD hypothesis was confirmed employing two Anopheles quadrimaculatus strains, the wild type and the mutant GORO, with a dark-brown and a golden eggshell, respectively. In all cases, serosal cuticle formation is fundamental for the establishment of an efficient ERD but egg viability outside the water is much higher in mosquitoes with darker eggshells than in those with lighter ones. The finding that pigmentation influences egg water balance is relevant to understand the evolutionary history of insect coloration. Since eggshell and adult cuticle pigmentation ensure insect survivorship in some cases, they should be considered regarding species fitness and novel approaches for vector or pest insects control.",

These changes can be detected in spatial and temporal features of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. Independent vector analysis (IVA) is a whole-brain multivariate approach that can be used to comprehensively assess these changes in spatial and temporal features. We present a multi-dimensional approach to assessing age-related changes in spatial and temporal features of statistically independent components identified by IVA in a cross-sectional lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years). We show that while large-scale brain network configurations remain consistent throughout the lifespan, changes continue to occur in both local organization and in the spectral composition of these functional networks. We show that the spatial extent of functional networks decreases with age, but with no significant change in the peak functional loci of these networks. Additionally, we show differential age-related patterns across the frequency spectrum; lower frequency correlations decrease across the lifespan whereas higher-frequency correlations increase. These changes indicate an increasing stability of networks with age. In addition to replicating results from previous studies, the current results uncover new aspects of functional brain network changes across the lifespan that are frequency band-dependent.",

    "abstract": "The antisaccade task is a classic paradigm used to study the voluntary control of eye movements. It requires participants to suppress a reactive eye movement to a visual target and to concurrently initiate a saccade in the opposite direction. Although several models have been proposed to explain error rates and reaction times in this task, no formal model comparison has yet been performed. Here, we describe a Bayesian modeling approach to the antisaccade task that allows us to formally compare different models on the basis of their evidence. First, we provide a formal likelihood function of actions (pro- and antisaccades) and reaction times based on previously published models. Second, we introduce the Stochastic Early Reaction, Inhibition, and late Action model (SERIA), a novel model postulating two different mechanisms that interact in the antisaccade task: an early GO/NO-GO race decision process and a late GO/GO decision process. Third, we apply these models to a data set from an experiment with three mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials. Bayesian model comparison demonstrates that the SERIA model explains the data better than competing models that do not incorporate a late decision process. Moreover, we show that the race decision processes postulated by the SERIA model are, to a large extent, insensitive to the cue presented on a single trial. Finally, we use parameter estimates to demonstrate that changes in reaction time and error rate due to the probability of a trial type (prosaccade or antisaccade) are best explained by faster or slower inhibition and the probability of generating late voluntary prosaccades.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOne widely replicated finding in schizophrenia research is that patients tend to make more errors in the antisaccade task, a psychometric paradigm in which participants are required to look in the opposite direction of a visual cue. This deficit has been suggested to be an endophenotype of schizophrenia, as first order relatives of patients tend to show similar but milder deficits. Currently, most models applied to experimental findings in this task are limited to fit average reaction times and error rates. Here, we propose a novel statistical model that fits experimental data from the antisaccade task, beyond summary statistics. The model is inspired by the hypothesis that antisaccades are the result of several competing decision processes that interact nonlinearly with each other. In applying this model to a relatively large experimental data set, we show that mean reaction times and error rates do not fully reflect the complexity of the processes that are likely to underlie experimental findings. In the future, our model could help to understand the nature of the deficits observed in schizophrenia by providing a statistical tool to study their biological underpinnings.",

    "abstract": "The repeat region of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a major vaccine antigen because it can be targeted by parasite neutralizing antibodies; however, little is known about this interaction. We used isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis-validated modeling to analyze the binding of a murine neutralizing antibody to Plasmodium falciparum CSP. Strikingly, we found that the repeat region of CSP is bound by multiple antibodies. This repeating pattern allows multiple weak interactions of single FAB domains to accumulate and yield a complex with a dissociation constant in the low nM range. Because the CSP protein can potentially cross-link multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) we hypothesized that the B cell response might be T cell independent. However, while there was a modest response in mice deficient in T cell help, the bulk of the response was T cell dependent. By sequencing the BCRs of CSP-repeat specific B cells in inbred mice we found that these cells underwent somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation indicative of a T-dependent response. Last, we found that the BCR repertoire of responding B cells was limited suggesting that the structural simplicity of the repeat may limit the breadth of the immune response.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryVaccines aim to protect by inducing the immune system to make molecules called antibodies that can recognize molecules on the surface of invading pathogens. In the case of malaria, our most advanced vaccine candidates aim to promote the production of antibodies that recognize the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) molecule on the surface of the invasive parasite stage called the sporozoite. In this report we use X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of CSP-binding antibodies at the atomic level. We use other techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry and structural modeling to examine how this antibody interacts with the CSP molecule. Strikingly, we found that each CSP molecule could bind 6 antibodies. This finding has implications for the immune response and may explain why high titers of antibody are needed for protection. Moreover, because the structure of the CSP repeat is quite simple we determined that the number of different kinds of antibodies that could bind this molecule are quite small. However a high avidity interaction between those antibodies and CSP can result from a process called affinity maturation that allows the body to learn how to make improved antibodies specific for pathogen molecules. These data show that while it is challenging for the immune system to recognize and neutralize CSP, it should be possible to generate viable vaccines targeting this molecule.",

    "abstract": "Predicting whether individuals will colonize a novel habitat is of fundamental ecological interest and is crucial to both conservation efforts and invasive species management. A consistently supported predictor of colonization success is the number of individuals introduced, also called propagule pressure. Propagule pressure increases with the number of introductions and the number of individuals per introduction (the size of the introduction), but it is unresolved which process is a stronger driver of colonization success. Furthermore their relative importance may depend upon the environment, with multiple introductions potentially enhancing colonization of fluctuating environments. To evaluate the relative importance of the number and size of introductions and its dependence upon environmental variability, we paired demographic simulations with a microcosm experiment. Using Tribolium flour beetles as a model system, we introduced a fixed number of individuals into replicated novel habitats of stable or fluctuating quality, varying the number of introductions through time and size of each introduction. We evaluated establishment probability and the size of extant populations after 7 generations. In the simulations and microcosms, we found that establishment probability increased with more, smaller introductions, but was not affected by biologically realistic fluctuations in environmental quality. Population size was not significantly affected by environmental variability in the simulations, but populations in the microcosms grew larger in a stable environment, especially with more introduction events. In general, the microcosm experiment yielded higher establishment probability and larger populations than the demographic simulations. We suggest that genetic mechanisms likely underlie these differences and thus deserve more attention in efforts to parse propagule pressure. Our results highlight the importance of preventing further introductions of undesirable species to invaded sites, and suggest conservation efforts should focus on increasing the number of introductions or re-introductions of desirable species rather than increasing the size of those introduction events.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the laboratory cultivation of ARMAN (Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms). After 2.5 years of successive transfers in an anoxic medium containing ferric sulfate as an electron acceptor, a consortium was attained that is comprised of two members of the order Thermoplasmatales, a member of a proposed ARMAN group, as well as a fungus. The 16S rRNA of one archaeon is only 91.6% identical to Thermogymnomonas acidicola as most closely related isolate. Hence, this organism is the first member of a new genus. The enrichment culture is dominated by this microorganism and the ARMAN. The third archaeon in the community seems to be present in minor quantities and has a 100% 16S rRNA identity to the recently isolated Cuniculiplasma divulgatum. The enriched ARMAN species is most probably incapable of sugar metabolism because the key genes for sugar catabolism and anabolism could not be identified in the metagenome. Metatranscriptomic analysis suggests that the TCA cycle funneled with amino acids is the main metabolic pathway used by the archaea of the community. Microscopic analysis revealed that growth of the ARMAN is supported by the formation of cell aggregates. These might enable cross feeding by other community members to the ARMAN.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the hippocampus and adjacent brain areas show a large diversity in their tuning to location and head direction. The underlying circuit mechanisms are not fully resolved. In particular, it is unclear why certain cell types are selective to one spatial variable, but invariant to another. For example, a place cell is highly selective to location, but typically invariant to head direction. Here, we propose that all observed spatial tuning patterns - in both their selectivity and their invariance - are a consequence of the same mechanism: Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity that is driven by the spatial tuning statistics of synaptic inputs. Using simulations and a mathematical analysis, we show that combined excitatory and inhibitory plasticity can lead to localized, grid-like or invariant activity. Combinations of different input statistics along different spatial dimensions reproduce all major spatial tuning patterns observed in rodents. The model is robust to changes in parameters, develops patterns on behavioral time scales and makes distinctive experimental predictions. Our results suggest that the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory plasticity is a general principle for the formation of neural representations.",

When unleashed from cellular confines, we find that MinD and MinE form a wide spectrum of patterns on artificial bilayers - static amoebas, traveling waves, traveling mushrooms, and bursts with standing-wave dynamics. We recently focused our cell-free studies on bursts because their dynamics closely resemble those found in vivo. The data unveiled a patterning mechanism largely governed by MinE regulation of MinD interaction with membrane. We proposed that the MinD to MinE ratio on the membrane acts as a toggle switch between MinE-stimulated recruitment or release of MinD from the membrane. Here we provide data that further refines and extends our model that explains the remarkable spectrum of patterns supported by these two  simple proteins.",

    "abstract": "The mechanics of the actin cytoskeleton regulates cell morphogenesis during essential physiological processes. While cellular contractility is known to be largely RhoA-dependent, the process by which localized biochemical signals are translated into cell-level responses is not well understood. Here we combine optogenetic control of RhoA in space and time, live cell imaging and traction force microscopy to investigate the dynamics of actomyosin-based force generation in adherent fibroblasts. Local activation of RhoA not only stimulates local recruitment of actin and myosin, but also leads to increased traction forces outside the activation region that rapidly propagate across the cell via stress fibers and drive actin flow towards the region of heightened RhoA. Surprisingly, the flow reverses direction when local RhoA activation stops. We identify zyxin as a regulator of stress fiber mechanics, as stress fibers are fluid-like without flow reversal in its absence. These experimental data are used to constrain a physical model, which demonstrates that stress fibers are elastic-like, even at time scales exceeding turnover of constituent proteins. Such molecular control of actin mechanics likely plays critical roles in regulation of morphogenic events.",

    "abstract": "In the statistical learning language, samples are snapshots of random vectors drawn from some unknown distribution. Such vectors usually reside in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and thus, the \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\" often undermines the power of learning methods, including community detection and clustering algorithms, that rely on Euclidean geometry. This paper presents the idea of effective dissimilarity transformation (EDT) on empirical dissimilarity hyperspheres and studies its effects using synthetic and gene expression data sets. Iterating the EDT turns a static data distribution into a dynamical process purely driven by the empirical data set geometry and adaptively ameliorates the curse of dimensionality, partly through changing the topology of a Euclidean feature space [R]n into a compact hypersphere Sn. The EDT often improves the performance of hierarchical clustering via the automatic grouping information emerging from global interactions of data points. The EDT is not restricted to hierarchical clustering, and other learning methods based on pairwise dissimilarity should also benefit from the many desirable properties of EDT.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 89.20.Ff, 87.85.mg",

As artificial habitats (e.g., agricultural fields) become increasingly abundant in many landscapes, species will be affected differently, depending on their habitat preferences. We investigated the diversity, richness, abundance, and biomass of mammals and birds with remote camera traps that optimized the capture of both large and small animals. Camera traps allowed us to capture natural rates of mammals and birds, which is difficult to obtain using human observers who can affect the behavior of animals and are limited in their spatio-temporal scope and ability to assess nocturnal communities. Our camera trap arrays were established along two transects in a local conservation reserve; one transect ran from an agricultural field to an upland forest and another from a wetland to an upland forest. Over the 6-week study our cameras recorded 2,245 images, within which we observed 483 individuals comprising 16 species of mammals and birds. Our data showed that species composition and abundances were only marginally different between the two transects, with species common to both transects not exhibiting any statistical difference in abundances. Coyotes and armadillos were unique to the riparian transect, and many more bird species were present along the riparian transect than the agricultural transect. Diversity, richness, and total community biomass did not differ significantly between the two transects nor along each transect but there were non-significant trends in predicted directions. Our results revealed that fewer species use the forest immediately adjacent to the agricultural field, but more species use the wetland and the forest immediately adjacent to the wetland. Our results corroborate other studies revealing that certain species are more common in forested areas but also that some species thought to prefer forested areas may actually be more habitat generalists than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "1. Habitat destruction and degradation represent serious threats to biodiversity, and quantification of land-use change over time is important for understanding the consequences of these changes to organisms and ecosystem service provision.\\n\\n2. Comparing land use between maps from different time periods allows estimation of the magnitude of habitat change in an area. However, digitizing historical maps manually is time-consuming and analyses of change are usually carried out at small spatial extents or at low resolutions.\\n\\n3. We developed a method to semi-automatically digitize historical land-use maps using the R environment. We created a number of functions that use the existing raster package to classify land use according to a maps colours, as defined by the RGB channels of the raster image. The method was tested on three different types of historical land-use map and results were compared to manual digitisations.\\n\\n4. Our method is fast, and agreement with manually-digitised maps of around 80-92% meets common targets for image classification. We hope that the ability to quickly classify large areas of historical land-use will promote the inclusion of land-use change into analyses of biodiversity, species distributions and ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "The nanotechnology revolution has allowed us to speculate on the possibilities of hybridising nanoscale materials with live substrates, yet significant doubt still remains pertaining to the effects of nanomaterials on biological matter. In this investigation we cultivate the ciliated protistic pond-dwelling microorganism Paramecium caudatum in the presence of excessive quantities of magnetite nanoparticles in order to assess both potential beneficial applications for this technique as well as any deleterious effects on the organisms health. Our findings indicate that these nanoparticles are well-tolerated by paramecia, who were observed to consume in quantities exceeding 10% of their body volume: cultivation in the presence of magnetite nanoparticles does not alter P. caudatum cell volume, swim speed, growth rate or peak colony density and cultures may persist in nanoparticle-contaminated medium for many weeks. We demonstrate that P. caudatum cells ingest starch coated magnetite nanoparticles which facilitates their being magnetically immobilised whilst maintaining apparently normal ciliary dynamics, thus demonstrating that nanoparticle biohybridisation is a viable alternative to conventional forms of ciliate quieting. Ingested magnetite nanoparticle deposits appear to aggregate, suggesting that (a) the process of being internalised concentrates and therefore detoxifies nanomaterial suspensions in aquatic environments and (b) P. caudatum is a candidate organism for programmable nanomaterial manipulation and delivery.",

    "abstract": "Motile cilia are cell-surface organelles whose purposes, in ciliated protists and certain ciliated vertebrate epithelia, include generating fluid flow, chemosensation, mechanosensation and substance uptake. Certain properties of cilia arrays, such as beating synchronisation and manipulation of external proximate particulate matter, are considered emergent, but remain incompletely characterised despite these phenomena having being the subject of extensive modelling. This study constitutes a laboratory experimental characterisation of one of the emergent properties of motile cilia; microparticle manipulation. The work demonstrates through automated videomicrographic particle tracking that interactions between microparticles and somatic cilia arrays of the ciliated model organism Paramecium caudatum constitute a form of rudimentary  sorting. Small particles are drawn into the organisms proximity by cilia-induced fluid currents at all times, whereas larger particles may be held immobile at a distance from the cell margin when the cell generates characteristic feeding currents in the surrounding media. These findings can contribute to the design and fabrication of biomimetic cilia, with potential applications to the study of ciliopathies.",

Water oxidation is the distinctive photochemical reaction that permitted the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the eventual rise of Eukaryotes. At what point during the history of life an ancestral photosystem evolved the capacity to oxidize water still remains unknown. Here we study the evolution of the core reaction center proteins of Photosystem II using sequence and structural comparisons in combination with Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks. Our results indicate that a homodimeric photosystem with sufficient oxidizing power to split water had already appeared in the early Archean about a billion years before the most recent common ancestor of all described Cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, and well before the diversification of some of the known groups of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Based on a structural and functional rationale we hypothesize that this early Archean photosystem was capable of water oxidation and had already evolved some level of protection against the formation of reactive oxygen species, which would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.",

The outcomes can be acute, as seen in stroke, or more chronic as observed in age-related diseases such as Parkinsons disease. Here we investigate the antioxidant ability of a novel synthetic flavonoid, Proxison (7-decyl-3-hydroxy-2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-4-chromenone), using a range of in vitro and in vivo approaches. We show that, while it has radical scavenging ability on par with other flavonoids in a cell-free system, Proxison is orders of magnitude more potent than natural flavonoids at protecting neural cells against oxidative stress and is capable of rescuing damaged cells. The unique combination of a lipophilic hydrocarbon tail with a modified polyphenolic head group promotes efficient cellular uptake and mitochondrial localisation of Proxison. Importantly, in vivo administration of Proxison demonstrated effective and well tolerated neuroprotection against oxidative stress in a zebrafish model of dopaminergic neuronal loss.",

We use open-source software, ISETBIO1 to quantify the stimulus and encoding stages in the front-end of the human visual system, starting with a description of the stimulus spectral radiance and a computational model that includes the physiological optics, inert ocular pigments, eye movements, photoreceptor sampling and absorptions. The simulations suggest that the visual system extracts the information available within the spatiotemporal pattern of photoreceptor absorptions within a small spatial (0.12 deg) and temporal (200 ms) regime. At typical display luminance levels, the variance arising from the Poisson absorptions and small eye movements (tremors and microsaccades) both appear to be critical limiting factors for Vernier acuity.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids interactions within protein families are so optimized that the sole analysis of evolutionary co-mutations can identify pairs of contacting residues. It is also known that evolution conserves functional dynamics, i.e., the concerted motion or displacement of large protein regions or domains. Is it, therefore, possible to use a pure sequence-based analysis to identify these dynamical domains? To address this question, we introduce here a general co-evolutionary coupling analysis strategy and apply it to a curated sequence database of hundreds of protein families. For most families, the sequence-based method partitions amino acids into few clusters. When viewed in the context of the native structure, these clusters have the signature characteristics of viable protein domains: they are spatially separated but individually compact. They have a direct functional bearings too, as shown for various reference cases. We conclude that even large-scale structural and functionally-related properties can be recovered from inference methods applied to evolutionary-related sequences. The method introduced here is available as a software package and web server (http://spectrus.sissa.it/spectrus-evo_webserver).",

Relying on estimations of false discovery rates, we explore the effect of different spectrum-spectrum match criteria on the number and the nature of the molecules annotated. We show that the spectral matching settings needs to be adjusted for each project. By adjusting the scoring parameters and thresholds, the number of annotations rose, on average, by +139% (ranging from -92% up to +5705%) when compared to a default parameter set available at GNPS. The FDR estimation methods presented will enable a user to define the scoring criteria for large scale analysis of untargeted small molecule data that has been essential in the advancement of large scale proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics science.",

    "abstract": "Scans for positive selection in human populations have identified hundreds of sites across the genome with evidence of recent adaptation. These signatures often overlap across populations, but the question of how often these overlaps represent a single ancestral event remains unresolved. If a single positive selection event spread across many populations, the same sweeping haplotype should appear in each population and the selective pressure could be common across diverse populations and environments. Identifying such shared selective events would be of fundamental interest, pointing to genomic loci and human traits important in recent history across the globe. Additionally, genomic annotations that recently became available could help attach these signatures to a potential gene and molecular phenotype that may have been selected across multiple populations. We performed a scan for positive selection using the integrated haplotype score on 20 populations, and compared sweeping haplotypes using the haplotype-clustering capability of fastPHASE to create a catalog of shared and unshared overlapping selective sweeps in these populations. Using additional genomic annotations, we connect these multi-population sweep overlaps with potential biological mechanisms at several loci, including potential new sites of adaptive introgression, the glycophorin locus associated with malarial resistance, and the alcohol dehydrogenase cluster associated with alcohol dependency.",

    "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has led to the discovery of unprecedentedly immense transcriptomes encoded by eukaryotic genomes. However, the transcriptome maps are still incomplete partly because they were mostly reconstructed based on RNA-seq reads that lack their orientations (known as unstranded reads) and certain boundary information. Methods to expand the usability of unstranded RNA-seq data by predetermining the orientation of the reads and precisely determining the boundaries of assembled transcripts could significantly benefit the quality of the resulting transcriptome maps. Here, we present a high-performing transcriptome assembly pipeline, called CAFE, that significantly improves the original assemblies, respectively assembled with stranded and/or unstranded RNA-seq data, by orienting unstranded reads using the maximum likelihood estimation and by integrating information about transcription start sites and cleavage and polyadenylation sites. Applying large-scale transcriptomic data comprising ninety-nine billion RNAs-seq reads from the ENCODE, human BodyMap projects, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and GTEx, CAFE enabled us to predict the directions of about eighty-nine billion unstranded reads, which led to the construction of more accurate transcriptome maps, comparable to the manually curated map, and a comprehensive lncRNA catalogue that includes thousands of novel lncRNAs. Our pipeline should not only help to build comprehensive, precise transcriptome maps from complex genomes but also to expand the universe of non-coding genomes.",

Overall, most soil metabolites displayed the expected relationship (positive or negative correlation) with four dominant bacteria following a wetting event and across biocrust developmental stages. For metabolites that were previously found to be consumed by an isolate, 78% were negatively correlated with the abundance of in situ isolate phylotypes whereas for released metabolites, 73% were positively correlated.

    "abstract": "RNA-RNA assembly governs key biological processes and is a powerful tool for engineering synthetic genetic circuits. Characterizing RNA assembly in living cells often involves monitoring fluorescent reporter proteins, which are at best indirect measures of underlying RNA-RNA hybridization events and are subject to additional temporal and load constraints associated with translation and activation of reporter proteins. In contrast, RNA aptamers that sequester small molecule dyes and activate their fluorescence are increasingly utilized in genetically-encoded strategies to report on RNA-level events. Split-aptamer systems have been rationally designed to generate signal upon hybridization of two or more discrete RNA transcripts, but none directly function when expressed in vivo. We reasoned that the improved physiological properties of the Broccoli aptamer enable construction of a split-aptamer system that could function in living cells. Here we present the Split-Broccoli system, in which self-assembly is nucleated by a thermostable, three-way junction RNA architecture and fluorescence activation requires both strands. Functional assembly of the system approximately follows second order kinetics in vitro and improves when cotranscribed, rather than when assembled from purified components. Split-Broccoli fluorescence is digital in vivo and retains functional modularity when fused to RNAs that regulate circuit function through RNA-RNA hybridization, as demonstrated with an RNA Toehold switch. Split-Broccoli represents the first functional split-aptamer system to operate in vivo. It offers a genetically-encoded and nondestructive platform to monitor and exploit RNA-RNA hybridization, whether as an all-RNA, stand-alone AND gate or as a tool for monitoring assembly of RNA-RNA hybrids.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/109306_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (18K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d07d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c6a41org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3e6a6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eba2cd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Humans generally prefer social over nonsocial stimuli from an early age. Reduced preference for social rewards has been observed in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). This preference has typically been noted in separate tasks that measure orienting toward and engaging with social stimuli. In this experiment, we used two eye-tracking tasks to index both of these aspects of social preference in in 77 typical adults. We used two measures, global effect and preferential looking time. The global effect task measures saccadic deviation toward a social stimulus (related to  orienting), while the preferential looking task records gaze duration bias toward social stimuli (relating to  engaging). Social rewards were found to elicit greater saccadic deviation and greater gaze duration bias, suggesting that they have both greater salience and higher value compared to nonsocial rewards. Trait empathy was positively correlated with the measure of relative value of social rewards, but not with their salience. This study thus elucidates the relationship of empathy with social reward processing.",

    "abstract": "Structure determination utilizing X-ray crystallography involves collection of diffraction data, determination of initial phases followed by iterative rounds of model building and crystallographic refinement to improve the phases and minimize the differences between calculated and observed structure factors. At each of these stages, a variety of statistical filters exist to ensure appropriate validation. Biologically important observations often come from interpretations of signals that need to be carefully deciphered from noise and therefore human intervention is as important as the automated filters. Currently, all structural data are deposited in the Protein Data Bank and this repository is continuously evolving to incorporate possible new improvements in macromolecular crystallography. The journals that publish data arising from structural studies modulate their policies to take cognizance of new improved methodologies. The PDB and journals have evolved an accepted protocol to ensure the integrity of crystallographic results. As a result, the quality of available data and interpretations are becoming better over the years. However, there have been periodic efforts by some individuals who misuse validation mechanisms to selectively target published research through spurious challenges. These actions do more harm to the field of structural biology and runs counter to their claim to cleanse the system. The scientific systems in structural biology are robust and capable of self-correction and unwarranted vigilantism is counterproductive.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of animal mating systems has changed dramatically with the advent of molecular methods to determine individuals reproductive success. But why are older behavioral descriptions and newer genetic descriptions of mating systems often seemingly inconsistent? We argue that a potentially important reason for such inconsistencies is a research trajectory rooted in early studies that were equivocal and overreaching, followed by studies that accepted earlier conclusions at face value and assumed, rather than tested, key ideas about animal mating systems. We illustrate our argument using Anolis lizards, whose social behavior has been studied for nearly a century. A dominant view emerging from this behavioral research was that anoles display strict territorial polygyny, where females mate with just the one male in whose territory they reside. However, all genetic evidence suggests that females frequently mate with multiple males. We trace this mismatch to early studies that concluded that anoles are territorial based on limited data. Subsequent research assumed territoriality implicitly or explicitly, resulting in studies that were unlikely to uncover or consider important any evidence of anoles departures from strict territorial polygyny. Thus, descriptions of anole behavior were largely led away from predicting a pattern of female multiple mating. We end by considering the broader implications of such erratic trajectories for the study of animal mating systems, and posit that precise definitions, renewed attention to natural history, and explicitly questioning assumptions made while collecting behavioral observations will allow us to move towards a fuller understanding of animal mating systems.",

    "abstract": "Vocalizations are the production of sounds by the coordinated activity of up to eighty respiratory and laryngeal muscles. Whilst voiced acts, modified by the upper vocal tract (tongue, jaw, lip and palate) are central to the production of human speech, they are also central to the production of emotional vocalizations such as sounds of disgust, anger, laughter and crying. Evidence suggests that the speech and emotional vocalizations may comprise distinct classes of vocal movements: patients with speech production deficits are often able to produce emotional vocalizations. In addition to this, the ontogeny of the two articulations is largely distinct, with some culturally universal emotional vocalizations emerging soon after birth and human speech being a culture specific, highly learnt motor act, which must develop to some degree before a critical period in development. Here we investigate the motor pathways underlying these two classes of vocal movements for the first time by directly comparing BOLD responses during production of speech and non-speech vocal movements. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we report distinct patterns of activity in both subcortical and cortical regions (putamen and bilateral inferior frontal and parietal cortices) during the production of emotional vocalizations compared to speech production. In contrast we show that responses in primary sensorimotor regions do not differ during the production of speech and emotional vocalizations, suggesting partially overlapping, and partially non-overlapping neural structures for the motor control of these two classes of movement. In addition to this we report that responses in auditory cortices are distinct during the production of speech and non-speech vocalizations, suggesting that feedback control of speech and emotional vocalizations are distinct. These data provide novel evidence for the presence of dual pathways for the neural control of complex articulatory movements in humans. These findings are discussed in relation to the clinical and primate literature of vocal motor control.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis work marks the first evidence in healthy humans for dual routes to vocal behaviors. Clinical evidence suggests that patients unable to produce speech may still be able to produce other vocal behaviors that employ the same set of effectors. Here we demonstrate that the production of different classes of vocal behavior is associated with overlapping and distinct networks of activity. Moreover, we show that auditory processing that occurs during the production of these movements may be distinct, suggesting that feedback may be used differently for these distinct classes of vocal movement.",

    "abstract": "In shotgun proteomics identified mass spectra that are deemed irrelevant to the scientific hypothesis are often discarded. Noble (2015) 1 therefore urged researchers to remove irrelevant peptides from the database prior to searching to improve statistical power. We here however, argue that both the classical as well as Nobles revised method produce suboptimal peptide identifications and have problems in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Instead, we show that searching for all expected peptides, and removing irrelevant peptides prior to FDR calculation results in more reliable identifications at controlled FDR level than the classical strategy that discards irrelevant peptides post FDR calculation, or than Nobles strategy that discards irrelevant peptides prior to searching.",

    "abstract": "The visual system plays a major role in food/prey recognition in diurnal animals, and food intake is regulated by the hypothalamus. However, whether and how visual information about prey is conveyed to the hypothalamic feeding centre is largely unknown. Here we perform real-time imaging of neuronal activity in freely behaving or constrained zebrafish larvae and demonstrate that prey or prey-like visual stimuli activate the hypothalamic feeding centre. Furthermore, we identify prey detector neurons in the pretectal area that project to the hypothalamic feeding centre. Ablation of the pretectum completely abolishes prey capture behaviour and neurotoxin expression in the hypothalamic area also reduces feeding. Taken together, these results suggest that the pretecto-hypothalamic pathway plays a crucial role in conveying visual information to the feeding centre. Thus, this pathway possibly converts visual food detection into feeding motivation in zebrafish.",
