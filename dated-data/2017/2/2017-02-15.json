    "abstract": "How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL); however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here, we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of RL. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice, and as such has broad implications for the study of decisions.",

    "abstract": "We provide evidence that decisions are made by consulting memories for individual past experiences, and that this process can be biased in favor of past choices using incidental reminders. First, in a standard rewarded choice task, we show that a model that estimates value at decision-time using individual samples of past outcomes fits choices and decision-related neural activity better than a canonical incremental learning model. In a second experiment, we bias this sampling process by incidentally reminding participants of individual past decisions. The next decision after a reminder shows a strong influence of the action taken and value received on the reminded trial. These results provide new empirical support for a decision architecture that relies on samples of individual past choice episodes rather than incrementally averaged rewards in evaluating options, and has suggestive implications for the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation in collective action dilemmas usually breaks down in the absence of additional incentive mechanisms. This tragedy can be escaped if cooperators have the possibility to invest in reward funds that are shared exclusively among cooperators(prosocial rewarding). Yet, the presence of defectors who do not contribute to the public good but do reward themselves(antisocial rewarding) deters cooperation in the absence of additional countermeasures. A recent simulation study suggests that spatial structure is sufficient to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation. Here we reinvestigate this issue assuming mixed strategies and weak selection on a game-theoretic model of social interactions, which we also validate using individual-based simulations. We show that increasing reward funds facilitates the maintenance of prosocial rewarding but prevents its evolution from rare, and that spatial structure can sometimes select against the evolution of prosocial rewarding. Our results suggest that, even in spatially structured populations, additional mechanisms are required to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation in public goods dilemmas.",

    "abstract": "SummaryRegulatory changes are broadly accepted as key drivers of phenotypic divergence. However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

Despite ubiquitous human exposure to BPA, and the wide-spread clinical use of EE as oral contraceptive adjuvant, the impact of these estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on the immune system is unclear. Here we report results of in vivo dose response studies that analyzed the histology and microstructural changes in the spleen of adult male and female CD-1 mice exposed to 4 to 40,000 g/kg/day BPA or 0.02 to 2 g/kg/day EE from conception until 12-14 weeks of age. Results of that analysis indicate that both BPA and EE have dose- and sex-specific impacts on the cellular and microanatomical structures of the spleens that reveal minor alterations in immunomodulatory and hematopoietic functions. These findings support previous studies demonstrating the murine immune system as a sensitive target for estrogens, and that oral exposures to BPA and EE have important estrogen-like immunomodulatory affects in both sexes of the CD-1 mouse.",

    "abstract": "Currently, non-invasive methods for studying the human brain do not reliably measure spike-rate-dependent signals, independent of other responses such as hemodynamic coupling (fMRI) and subthreshold neuronal synchrony (oscillations and event-related potentials). In contrast, invasive methods - animal microelectrode recordings and human electrocorticography (ECoG) - have recently measured broadband power elevation in field potentials (~50-200Hz) as a proxy for the locally averaged spike rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in individual subjects. Because extracranial measurements like MEG have multiple global noise sources and a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, we developed an automated denoising technique, adapted from (Kay et al., 2013), that helps reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were separated into an evoked component (12-Hz amplitude) and a broadband component (60-150Hz, excluding stimulus harmonics). In all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over occipital cortex. The spatial pattern of the broadband measure depended on the stimulus, with greater broadband power in sensors contralateral to the stimulus. Because we obtain reliable broadband estimates with relatively short experiments (~20 minutes), with a sufficient signal-to-noise-ratio to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for a wide range of scientific questions about human brain function.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNeuronal activity causes perturbations in nearby electrical fields. These perturbations can be measured non-invasively in the living human brain using EEG and MEG. These techniques have emphasized two kinds of measurements: oscillations and event-related responses. A third type of signal, a stimulus-related increase in power spanning a wide range of frequencies ( broadband), is routinely measured in invasive recordings, but not with MEG and EEG. This broadband response is of great interest because unlike oscillations and event-related responses, it is correlated with neuronal spike rates. Here we report quantitative, spatially specific measurements of broadband fields in individual human subjects using MEG. These results demonstrate that a spike-rate-dependent measure of brain activity can be obtained non-invasively from the living human brain.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTHow is temporal information processed in human visual cortex? Visual input is relayed to V1 through segregated transient and sustained channels in the retina and LGN. However, there is intense debate as to how transient and sustained channels contribute to visual processing beyond V1. Using a 2 temporal-channel encoding model we can predict fMRI responses to time-varying stimuli ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The transient channel dominates responses in the periphery of early visual cortex and lateral occipito-temporal regions. However, both sustained and transient channels drive responses in central early visual cortex and ventral occipito-temporal regions. Together these finding resolve an outstanding debate and lay the foundation for a complete temporal model of neural processing in visual cortex. Importantly, this encoding approach can be applied with fMRI to decipher neural computations in millisecond resolution in any part of the brain, which has vast implications for understanding neural processing.",

    "abstract": "Recent 60Fe results have suggested that the estimated distances of supernovae in the last few million years should be reduced from [~]100 pc to [~]50 pc. Two events or series of events are suggested, one about 2.7 million years to 1.7 million years ago, and another may at 6.5 to 8.7 million years ago. We ask what effects such supernovae are expected to have on the terrestrial atmosphere and biota. Assuming that the Local Bubble was formed before the event being considered, and that the supernova and the Earth were both inside a weak, disordered magnetic field at that time, TeV-PeV cosmic rays at Earth will increase by a factor of a few hundred. Tropospheric ionization will increase proportionately, and the overall muon radiation load on terrestrial organisms will increase by a factor of [~]150. All return to pre-burst levels within 10kyr. In the case of an ordered magnetic field, effects depend strongly on the field orientation. The upper bound in this case is with a largely coherent field aligned along the line of sight to the supernova, in which case TeV-PeV cosmic ray flux increases are [~]104; in the case of a transverse field they are below current levels. We suggest a substantial increase in the extended effects of supernovae on Earth and in the \\\"lethal distance\\\" estimate; more work is needed. This paper is an explicit followup to Thomas et al. (2016). We also here provide more detail on the computational procedures used in both works.",

    "abstract": "Genetic distance is a standard measure of variation in populations. When sequencing genomes individually, genetic distances are computed over all pairs of multilocus haplotypes in a sample. However, when next-generation sequencing methods obtain reads from heterogeneous assemblages of genomes (e.g. for microbial samples in a biofilm or cells from a tumor), individual reads are often drawn from different genomes. This means that pairwise genetic distances are calculated across independently sampled sites rather than across haplotype pairs. In this paper, we show that while the expected pairwise distance under whole haplotype sampling (WHS) is the same as with independent locus sampling (ILS), the sample variances of pairwise distance differ and depend on the direction and magnitude of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among polymorphic sites. We derive a weighted LD value that, when positive, predicts higher sample variance in estimated genetic distance for WHS. Weighted LD is positive when on average, the most common alleles at two loci are in positive LD. Using individual-based simulations of an infinite sites model under Fisher-Wright genetic drift, variances of estimated genetic distance are found to be almost always higher under WHS than under ILS, suggesting a reduction in estimation error when sites are sampled independently. We apply these results to haplotype frequencies from a lung cancer tumor to compute weighted LD and the variances in estimated genetic distance under ILS vs. WHS, and find that the the relative magnitudes of variances under WHS vs. ILS are sensitive to sampled allele frequencies.",

Derived from secondary endosymbiosis, the apicoplast depends on novel, but largely cryptic, mechanisms for protein/lipid import and organelle inheritance during parasite replication. These critical biogenesis pathways present untapped opportunities to discover new parasite-specific drug targets. We used an innovative screen to identify actinonin as having a novel mechanism-of-action inhibiting apicoplast biogenesis. Resistant mutation, chemical-genetic interaction, and biochemical inhibition demonstrate that the unexpected target of actinonin in P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii is FtsH1, a homolog of a bacterial membrane AAA+ metalloprotease. Pf FtsH1 is the first novel factor required for apicoplast biogenesis identified in a phenotypic screen. Our findings demonstrate that FtsH1 is a novel and, importantly, druggable antimalarial target. Development of FtsH1 inhibitors will have significant advantages with improved drug kinetics and multistage efficacy against multiple human parasites.",

Their functions are best understood in the context of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), a process in which Pol IV-dependent 24 nt siRNAs direct the de novo cytosine methylation of regions transcribed by Pol V. Pol V has additional functions, independent of Pol IV and 24 nt siRNA biogenesis, in maintaining the repression of transposons and genomic repeats whose silencing depends on maintenance cytosine methylation. Here we report that Pol IV and Pol V play unexpected roles in defining the 3 boundaries of Pol II transcription units. Nuclear run-on assays reveal that in the absence of Pol IV or Pol V, Pol II occupancy downstream of poly A sites increases for approximately 12% of protein-coding genes. This effect is most pronounced for convergently transcribed gene pairs. Although Pols IV and V are detected near transcript ends of the affected Pol II - transcribed genes, their role in limiting Pol II read-through is independent of siRNA biogenesis or cytosine methylation. We speculate that Pols IV and V (and/or their associated factors) play roles in Pol II transcription termination by influencing polymerase bypass or release at collision sites for convergent genes.",

    "abstract": "When infants and adults communicate, they exchange social signals of availability and communicative intention such as eye gaze. Previous research indicates that when communication is successful, close temporal dependencies arise between adult speakers and listeners neural activity. However, it is not known whether similar neural contingencies exist within adult-infant dyads. Here, we used dual-electroencephalography to assess whether direct gaze increases neural coupling between adults and infants during screen-based and live interactions. In Experiment 1 (N=17), infants viewed videos of an adult who was singing nursery rhymes with (a) Direct gaze (looking forward); (b) Indirect gaze (head and eyes averted by 20{degrees}); or (c) Direct-Oblique gaze (head averted but eyes orientated forward). In Experiment 2 (N=19), infants viewed the same adult in a live context, singing with Direct or Indirect gaze. Gaze-related changes in adult-infant neural network connectivity were measured using Partial Directed Coherence. Across both experiments, the adult had a significant (Granger)-causal influence on infants neural activity, which was stronger during Direct and Direct-Oblique gaze relative to Indirect gaze. During live interactions, infants also influenced the adult more during Direct than Indirect gaze. Further, infants vocalised more frequently during live Direct gaze, and individual infants who vocalized longer also elicited stronger synchronisation from the adult. These results demonstrate that direct gaze strengthens bi-directional adult-infant neural connectivity during communication. Thus, ostensive social signals could act to bring brains into mutual temporal alignment, creating a joint-networked state that is structured to facilitate information transfer during early communication and learning.",

In adults, neural oscillatory entrainment to the speech amplitude envelope has been proposed to be a mechanism for multi-time resolution analysis of adult-directed speech, with a focus on Theta (syllable) and low Gamma (phoneme) rates. However, it is not known whether developing infants perform multi-time oscillatory analysis of infant-directed speech with the same temporal focus. Here, we examined infants processing of the temporal structure of sung nursery rhymes, and compared their neural entrainment across multiple timescales with that of well-matched adults (their mothers). Typical infants and their mothers (N=58, median age 8.3 months) viewed videos of sung nursery rhymes while their neural activity at C3 and C4 was concurrently monitored using dual-electroencephalography (dual-EEG). The accuracy of infants and adults neural oscillatory entrainment to speech was compared by calculating their phase-locking values (PLVs) across the EEG-speech frequency spectrum. Infants showed better phase-locking than adults at Theta (~4.5 Hz)and Alpha (~9.3 Hz) rates, corresponding to rhyme and phoneme patterns in our stimuli. Infant entrainment levels matched adults for syllables and prosodic stress patterns (Delta,~1-2 Hz). By contrast, infants were less accurate than adults at tracking slow (~0.5 Hz) phrasal patterns. Therefore, compared to adults, language-learning infants temporal parsing of the speech signal shows highest relative acuity at Theta-Alpha rates. This temporal focus could support the accurate encoding of syllable and rhyme patterns during infants sensitive period for phonetic and phonotactic learning. Therefore, oscillatory entrainment could be one neural mechanism that supports early bootstrapping of language learning from infant-directed speech (such as nursery rhymes).",

    "abstract": "The bud tip epithelium of the branching mouse and human lung contains multipotent progenitors that are able to self-renew and give rise to all mature lung epithelial cell types. The current study aimed to understand the developmental signaling cues that regulate bud tip progenitor cells in the human fetal lung, which are present during branching morphogenesis, and to use this information to induce a bud tip progenitor-like population from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro. We identified that FGF7, CHIR-99021 and RA maintained isolated human fetal lung epithelial bud tip progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state in vitro, and led to the induction of a 3-dimensional lung-like epithelium from hPSCs. 3-dimensional hPSC-derived lung tissue was initially patterned, with airway-like interior domains and bud tip-like progenitor domains at the periphery. Epithelial bud tip-like domains could be isolated, expanded and maintained as a nearly homogeneous population by serial passaging. Comparisons between human fetal lung epithelial bud tip cells and hPSC-derived bud tip-like cells were carried out using immunostaining, in situ hybridization and transcriptome-wide analysis, and revealed that in vitro derived tissue was highly similar to native lung. hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip-like structures survived in vitro for over 16 weeks, could be easily frozen and thawed and maintained multi-lineage potential. Furthermore, hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip progenitors successfully engrafted in the proximal airways of injured immunocompromised NSG mouse lungs, where they persisted for up to 6 weeks and gave rise to several lung epithelial lineages.",

    "abstract": "Typical diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is susceptible to partial volume effects: different types of tissue that reside in the same voxel are inextricably mixed. For instance, in regions near the cerebral ventricles or parenchyma, fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be underestimated, due to partial volumes of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Free-water can be suppressed by adding parameters to diffusion MRI models. For example, the DTI model can be extended to separately take into account the contributions of tissue and CSF, by representing the tissue compartment with an anisotropic diffusion tensor and the CSF compartment as an isotropic free water diffusion coefficient. Recently, two procedures were proposed to fit this two-compartment model to diffusion-weighted data acquired for at least two different non-zero diffusion MRI b-values. In this work, the first open-source reference implementation of these procedures is provided. In addition to presenting some methodological improvements that increase model fitting robustness, the free water DTI procedures are re-evaluated using Monte-Carlo multicompartmental simulations. Analogous to previous studies, our results show that the free water elimination DTI model is able to remove confounding effects of fast diffusion for typical FA values of brain white matter. In addition, this study confirms that for a fixed scanning time the fwDTI fitting procedures have better performance when data is acquired for diffusion gradient direction evenly distributed along two b-values of 500 and 1500 s/mm2.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling plays an essential role in the proliferation, differentiation and cell fate determination of various tissues, including the developing pancreas. One regulator of the Notch pathway is GDE2 (or GDPD5), a transmembrane ecto-phosphodiesterase that cleaves GPI-anchored proteins at the plasma membrane, including a Notch ligand regulator. Here we report that Gde2 knockdown in zebrafish embryos leads to developmental defects, particularly, impaired motility and reduced pancreas differentiation, as shown by decreased expression of insulin and other pancreatic markers. Exogenous expression of human GDE2, but not catalytically dead GDE2, similarly leads to developmental defects. These data reveal functional conservation between zebrafish and human GDE2, and suggest that strict regulation of GDE2 expression and catalytic activity is critical for correct embryonic patterning. In particular, our data uncover a role for GDE2 in regulating pancreas differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerase II (Top2) is the essential protein that resolves DNA catenations. When the Top2 is inactivated, mitotic catastrophe results from massive entanglement of chromosomes. Top2 is also the target of many first-line anticancer drugs, the so-called Top2 poisons. Often, tumours become resistant to these drugs by downregulating Top2. Here, we have compared two isogenic yeast strains carrying top2 thermosensitive alleles that differ in their resistance to Top2 poisons, the broadly-used poison-sensitive top2-4 and the poison-resistant top2-5. We found that top2-5 transits through anaphase faster than top2-4. In order to define the biological importance of this difference, we performed genome-scale Synthetic Gene Array (SGA) analyses during chronic sublethal Top2 downregulation and acute, yet transient, Top2 inactivation. We find that downregulation of cell cycle progression, especially the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), protects against Top2 deficiency. In all conditions, genetic protection was stronger in top2-5, and this correlated with destabilization of anaphase bridges by execution of MEN. We suggest that mitotic exit may be a therapeutic target to hypersensitize cancer cells carrying downregulating mutations in TOP2.",

We used magnetoencephalography to investigate interregional interactions in the brain network for language, while 102 participants were reading sentences. Using Granger causality analysis, we identified inferior frontal cortex and anterior temporal regions to receive widespread input, and middle temporal regions to send widespread output. This fits well with the notion that these regions play a central role in language processing. Characterization of the functional topology of this network, using data-driven matrix factorization, which allowed for partitioning into a set of subnetworks, revealed directed connections at distinct frequencies of interaction. Connections originating from temporal regions peaked at alpha frequency, whereas connections originating from frontal and parietal regions peaked at beta frequency. These findings indicate that processing different types of linguistic information may depend on the contributions of distinct brain rhythms.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCommunication between language relevant areas in the brain is supported by rhythmic synchronization, where different rhythms reflect the direction of information flow.",

    "abstract": "The repeat region of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a major vaccine antigen because it can be targeted by parasite neutralizing antibodies; however, little is known about this interaction. We used isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis-validated modeling to analyze the binding of a murine neutralizing antibody to Plasmodium falciparum CSP. Strikingly, we found that the repeat region of CSP is bound by multiple antibodies. This repeating pattern allows multiple weak interactions of single FAB domains to accumulate and yield a complex with a dissociation constant in the low nM range. Because the CSP protein can potentially cross-link multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) we hypothesized that the B cell response might be T cell independent. However, while there was a modest response in mice deficient in T cell help, the bulk of the response was T cell dependent. By sequencing the BCRs of CSP-repeat specific B cells in inbred mice we found that these cells underwent somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation indicative of a T-dependent response. Last, we found that the BCR repertoire of responding B cells was limited suggesting that the structural simplicity of the repeat may limit the breadth of the immune response.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryVaccines aim to protect by inducing the immune system to make molecules called antibodies that can recognize molecules on the surface of invading pathogens. In the case of malaria, our most advanced vaccine candidates aim to promote the production of antibodies that recognize the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) molecule on the surface of the invasive parasite stage called the sporozoite. In this report we use X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of CSP-binding antibodies at the atomic level. We use other techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry and structural modeling to examine how this antibody interacts with the CSP molecule. Strikingly, we found that each CSP molecule could bind 6 antibodies. This finding has implications for the immune response and may explain why high titers of antibody are needed for protection. Moreover, because the structure of the CSP repeat is quite simple we determined that the number of different kinds of antibodies that could bind this molecule are quite small. However a high avidity interaction between those antibodies and CSP can result from a process called affinity maturation that allows the body to learn how to make improved antibodies specific for pathogen molecules. These data show that while it is challenging for the immune system to recognize and neutralize CSP, it should be possible to generate viable vaccines targeting this molecule.",

We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryResting state fMRI has become a ubiquitous tool for measuring connectivity in normal and diseased brains. Current dominant models of connectivity are based on coarse-scale connectivity among brain regions, ignoring fine-scale structure within those regions. We developed a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome that captures both coarse and fine-scale structure of connectivity shared across brains. We showed that this shared fine-scale structure is related to fine-scale distinctions in representation of information, and our model accounts for substantially more shared variance of connectivity compared to previous models.

Beyond their unsurpassed photostability, diamond can host multiple color centers, from the blue to the near infra-red spectral range. While nanodiamonds hosting nitrogen vacancy defects have been widely employed as bio-imaging probes, production and fabrication of nanodiamonds with other color centers is a challenge. In this work, a large scale production of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing a near infrared (NIR) color center - namely the silicon vacancy (SiV) defect, is reported. More importantly, a concept of application of different color centers for multi-color bio-imaging to investigate intercellular processes is demonstrated. Furthermore, two types of FNDs within cells can be easily resolved by their specific spectral properties, where data shows that SiV FNDs initially dispersed throughout the cell interior while NV FNDs localized in a close proximity to nucleus. The reported results are the first demonstration of multi-color labeling with FNDs that can pave the way for the wide-ranging use of FNDs in applications, including bio-sensing, bio-imaging and drug delivery applications.",

However, seed health quality in Ecuador, and its interaction with altitude and yield has been poorly investigated. We surveyed 11 farmers fields in Ecuador in 2010 to determine incidence and severity of pathogens and pests affecting foliage and seed tubers, and to determine the influence of altitude and seed sources over seed health quality (pathogen and pest diversity in/on the seed tuber). Additionally, a field experiment was planted in CIP-Quito using assessed seed tubers collected from surveyed farmers fields, during 2010 and 2011, to determine yield responses to seed health quality. Results show that foliage was mainly affected by late blight and flea beetle damages while seed tubers were predominantly affected by black scurf, andean weevil damages, potato virus S and potato virus X. We found that seed health quality was similar among farmers seed sources, and detected that increase in altitude decreased seed-borne virus diversity. Only seed-borne pathogens and presence of mechanical damages were found to explain yield variation. Seed-borne pathogens affecting yield variation were black scurf on seed tubers, potato virus S, and potato yellow vein virus. However, these factors changed when regressions were performed per seed source or variety. The yield responses to seed health quality of each variety should be considered to fine-tune integrated pest management strategies.",

Here, we show that selection on photosynthetic traits within and across taxa dampen the effects of temperature on GPP across a catchment of geothermally heated streams. Autotrophs from cold streams had higher photosynthetic rates and after accounting for differences in biomass among sites, rates of ecosystem-level GPP were independent of temperature, despite a 20 {o}C thermal gradient.

    "abstract": "An impressive number of researchers have devoted a great amount of effort toward examining various predictors of criminal justice processing outcomes. Indeed, a vast amount of research has examined various individual- and aggregate-level predictors of arrests, incarceration, and sentencing decisions. To this point, less attention has been devoted toward uncovering the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on variation in risk for criminal justice processing. As a result, the current study employs a behavioral genetic design in order to help fill this void in the existing literature. Using twin data from a national sample of youth, the current study produced evidence suggesting that genetic factors accounted for at least a portion of variance in risk for incarceration among female twins and probation among male twins. Shared and nonshared environmental influences accounted for the variance in risk for arrest among both female and male twins, probation among female twins, and incarceration among male twins. Ultimately, it appears that risk for contact with the criminal justice system and criminal justice processing is structured by a combination of factors beyond shared cultural and neighborhood environments, and appear to also include genetic factors as well. Moving forward, continuing to not use genetically sensitive research designs capable of estimating the role of genetic and nonshared environmental influences on criminal justice outcomes may result in misleading results.",
