    "abstract": "MotivationAnalysis of next-generation sequencing data often results in a list of genomic regions. These may include differentially methylated CpGs/regions, transcription factor binding sites, interacting chromatin regions, or GWAS-associated SNPs, among others. A common analysis step is to annotate such genomic regions to genomic annotations (promoters, exons, enhancers, etc.). Existing tools are limited by a lack of annotation sources and flexible options, the time it takes to annotate regions, an artificial one-to-one region-to-annotation mapping, a lack of visualization options to easily summarize data, or some combination thereof.\\n\\nResultsWe developed the annotatr Bioconductor package to flexibly and quickly summarize and plot annotations of genomic regions. The annotatr package reports all intersections of regions and annotations, giving a better understanding of the genomic context of the regions. A variety of graphics functions are implemented to easily plot numerical or categorical data associated with the regions across the annotations, and across annotation intersections, providing insight into how characteristics of the regions differ across the annotations. We demonstrate that annotatr is up to 27x faster than comparable R packages. Overall, annotatr enables a richer biological interpretation of experiments.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://bioconductor.org/packages/annotatr/\\n\\nContactrcavalca@umich.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Methods for genetic risk prediction have been widely investigated in recent years. However, most available training data involves European samples, and it is currently unclear how to accurately predict disease risk in other populations. Previous studies have used either training data from European samples in large sample size or training data from the target population in small sample size, but not both. Here, we introduce a multi-ethnic polygenic risk score that combines training data from European samples and training data from the target population. We applied this approach to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Latino cohort using both publicly available European summary statistics in large sample size and Latino training data in small sample size. We attained a >70% relative improvement in prediction accuracy (from R2=0.027 to R2=0.047) compared to methods that use only one source of training data, consistent with large relative improvements in simulations. We observed a systematically lower load of T2D risk alleles in Latino individuals with more European ancestry, which could be explained by polygenic selection in ancestral European and/or Native American populations. Application of our approach to predict T2D in a South Asian UK Biobank cohort attained a >70% relative improvement in prediction accuracy, and application to predict height in an African UK Biobank cohort attained a 30% relative improvement. Our work reduces the gap in polygenic risk prediction accuracy between European and non-European target populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe use of genetic information to predict disease risk is of great interest because of its potential clinical application. Prediction is performed via the construction of polygenic risk scores, which separate individuals into different risk categories. Polygenic risk scores can also be applied to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases. The ideal training data set would be a large cohort from the same population as the target sample, but this is generally unavailable for non-European populations. Thus, we propose a summary statistics based polygenic risk score that leverages both a large European training sample and a training sample from the same population as the target population. This approach produces a substantial relative improvement in prediction accuracy compared to methods that use a single training population when applied to predict type 2 diabetes in a Latino cohort, consistent with simulation results. We observed similar relative improvements in applications to predict type 2 diabetes in a South Asian cohort and height in an African cohort.",

    "abstract": "The striatum and thalamus are subcortical structures intimately involved in addiction. The morphology and microstructure of these have been studied in murine models of cocaine addiction, showing an effect of drug use, but also chronological age in morphology. Human studies using non-invasive MRI have shown inconsistencies in volume changes, and have also shown an age effect. In this exploratory study, we used MRI-based volumetric and novel shape analysis, as well as a novel fast diffusion kurtosis imaging sequence to study the morphology and microstructure of striatum and thalamus in crack cocaine addiction (CA) compared to matched healthy controls (HC), while investigating the effect of age and years of cocaine consumption. We did not find significant differences in volume and mean kurtosis (MKT) between groups. However, we found significant contraction of nucleus accumbens in CA compared to HC. We also found significant age related changes in volume and MKT of CA in striatum and thalamus that are different to those seen in normal aging. Interestingly, we found different effects and contributions of age and years of consumption in volume, displacement and MKT changes, suggesting each measure provides different but complementing information about morphological brain changes and that not all changes are related to the toxicity or the addiction to the drug. Our findings suggest that the use of finer methods and sequences provide complementing information about morphological and microstructural changes in cocaine addiction, and that brain alterations in cocaine addiction are related cocaine use and age differently.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments can detect the distance between a donor and an acceptor fluorophore on the 3-10nm scale. In ratiometric smFRET experiments, the FRET efficiency is estimated from the ratio of acceptor and total signal (donor + acceptor). An excitation scheme involving two alternating lasers (ALEX) is often employed to discriminate between singly- and doubly-labeled populations thanks to a second ratiometric parameter, the stoichiometry S. Accurate FRET and S estimations requires applying three well-known correction factors: donor emission leakage into the acceptor channel, acceptor direct excitation by the donor excitation laser and the \\\"gamma factor\\\" (i.e. correction for the imbalance between donor and acceptor signals due to different fluorophores quantum yields and photon detection effciencies).\\n\\nExpressions to directly correct both raw FRET and S values have been reported in [1] in the context of freely-diffusing smFRET. Here we extend Lee et al. work providing several expressions for the direct excitation coeffcient and highlighting a clear interpretation in terms of physical parameters and experimental quantities. Moreover, we derive a more complete set of analytic expressions for correcting FRET and S. We aim to provide a clear and concise reference for different definitions of correction coeffcients and correction formulas valid for any smFRET experiment both in immobilized and freely-diffusing form.",

The assembly contains 94.6 % of a metazoan core gene collection, indicating an almost complete coverage of the coding fraction. The discrepancy of ~690 Mb compared to the estimated genome size of R. auricularia (1.6 Gb) results from a high repeat content of 70 % mainly comprising DNA transposons.

The effect of copy number variations (CNVs) on the cellular proteome of tumours is poorly understood. Therefore, we have analysed recently generated proteogenomic data-sets on 282 tumour samples to investigate the impact of CNVs in the proteome of these cells. We found that CNVs are post-transcriptionally attenuated in 23-33% of proteins with an enrichment for protein complexes. Complex subunits are highly co-regulated and some act as rate-limiting steps of complex assembly, indirectly controlling the abundance of other complex members. We identified 48 such regulatory interactions and experimentally validated AP3B1 and GTF2E2 as controlling subunits. Lastly, we found that a gene-signature of protein attenuation is associated with increased resistance to chaperone and proteasome inhibitors. This study highlights the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in cancer which allow cells to cope with their altered genomes.",

    "abstract": "To understand cellular coordination of multiple transcriptome regulation mechanisms, we simultaneously measured transcription rate (TR), mRNA abundance (RA) and translation activity (TA). This revealed multiple quantitative insights. First, the genomic profiles of the three parameters are systematically different in key statistical features. Sequentially more genes exhibit extreme low or high expression values from TR to RA, then to TA. That is, because of cellular coordination of these regulatory mechanisms, sequentially higher levels of gene expression selectivity are achieved as genetic information flow from the genome to the proteome. Second, the contribution of the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism to the cellular coordination process was assessed. The data enabled an estimation of mRNA stability, revealing a moderate but significant positive correlation between the estimated mRNA stability and translation activity. Third, the proportion of a mRNA occupied by un-translated regions (UTR) exhibits a negative relationship with the level of this correlation, and is thus a major determinant of the mode of regulation of the mRNA. High-UTR-proportion mRNAs tend to defy the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism, staying out of the polysome but remaining stable; mRNAs with little UTRs largely follow this regulation. In summary, we quantitatively delineated the relationship among multiple transcriptome regulation parameters, i.e., cellular coordination of corresponding regulatory mechanisms.",

Unfortunately, applying theory to learn about the role of spatial structure on populations has been hindered by the lack of mechanistic spatial models and inability to make precise observations of population structure. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) represents an individual-based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory. SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and have been widely adopted in the last decade. We review the historical context and emerging developments in SCR models that enable the integration of explicit ecological hypotheses about landscape connectivity, movement, resource selection, and spatial variation in density, directly with individual encounter history data obtained by new technologies (e.g., camera trapping, non-invasive DNA sampling). We describe ways in which SCR methods stand to revolutionize the study of animal population ecology.",

Recent studies, however, have established that genetic diversities are mostly at maximum saturation levels maintained by selection, therefore challenging the explanatory power of the neutral theory and rendering the present molecular model of human origins untenable. Using improved methods and public data, we have revisited human evolution and found sharing of genetic variations among racial groups to be largely a result of parallel mutations rather than recent common ancestry and admixture as commonly assumed. We derived an age of 1.86-1.92 million years for the first split in modern human populations based on autosomal diversity data. We found evidence of modern Y and mtDNA originating in East Asia and dispersing via hybridization with archaic humans. Analyses of autosomes, Y and mtDNA all suggest that Denisovan and Neanderthal were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures and ancestors of South Asia Negritos and Aboriginal Australians. Verifying our model, we found more ancestry of Southern Chinese from Hunan in Africans relative to other East Asian groups examined. These results suggest multiregional evolution of autosomes and replacements of archaic Y and mtDNA by modern ones originating in East Asia, thereby leading to a coherent account of modern human origins.",

Prior work with lytic RNA bacteriophage f6 (family Cystoviridae) suggested that evolution under low multiplicity of infection (MOI; proportion of viruses to susceptible cells) selected for greater host exploitation, while evolution under high MOI selected for better intracellular competition against co-infecting viruses. We predicted that phage genotypes that experienced 300 generations of low MOI ecological history would be relatively advantaged in growth on two novel hosts. We inferred viral growth through changes in host population density, specifically by analyzing five attributes of growth curves of infected bacteria. Despite equivalent growth of evolved viruses on the original host, low MOI evolved clones were generally advantaged relative to high MOI clones in exploiting novel hosts. We also observed genotype-specific differences in clone infectivity: High fitness genotypes on the original host also performed better on novel hosts. Our results indicated that traits allowing greater exploitation of the original host correlated positively with performance on novel hosts. Based on infectivity differences of viruses from high versus low MOI histories, we suggest that prior MOI selection can later affect emergence potential.",

Sequence assembly offers a powerful approach to identifying SVs, but is difficult to apply at-scale genome-wide for SV detection due to its computational complexity and the difficulty of extracting SVs from assembly contigs. We describe SvABA, an efficient and accurate method for detecting SVs from short-read sequencing data using genome-wide local assembly with low memory and computing requirements. We evaluated SvABAs performance on the NA12878 human genome and in simulated and real cancer genomes. SvABA demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity across a large spectrum of SVs, and substantially improved detection performance for variants in the 20-300 bp range, compared with existing methods. SvABA also identifies complex somatic rearrangements with chains of short (< 1,000 bp) templated-sequence insertions copied from distant genomic regions. We applied SvABA to 344 cancer genomes from 11 cancer types, and found that templated-sequence insertions occur in ~4% of all somatic rearrangements. Finally, we demonstrate that SvABA can identify sites of viral integration and cancer driver alterations containing medium-sized SVs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate annotations of genes and their transcripts is a foundation of genomics, but no annotation technique presently combines throughput and accuracy. As a result, reference gene collections remain incomplete: many gene models are fragmentary, while thousands more remain uncatalogued-particularly for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To accelerate lncRNA annotation, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS), combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. We present an experimental re-annotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA population in matched human and mouse tissues, resulting in novel transcript models for 3574 / 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubles the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enable us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter- and gene-structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus CLS removes a longstanding bottleneck of transcriptome annotation, generating manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Native mass spectrometry coupled to ion mobility spectrometry is a promising tool for structural biology. Intact complexes can be transferred to the mass spectrometer and, if native conformations survive, collision cross sections give precious information on the structure of each species in solution. Based on several successful reports for proteins and their complexes, the conformation survival becomes more and more taken for granted. Here we report on the fate of nucleic acids conformation in the gas phase. Disturbingly, we found that DNA and RNA duplexes, at the electrospray charge states naturally obtained from native solution conditions ([&ge;] 100 mM aqueous NH4OAc), are significantly more compact in the gas phase compared to the canonical solution structures. The compaction is observed for short (12-bp) and long (36-bp) duplexes, and for DNA and RNA alike. Molecular modeling (density functional calculations on small helices, semi-empirical calculations on up to 12-bp, and molecular dynamics on up to 36-bp duplexes) demonstrates that the compaction is due to phosphate group self-solvation prevailing over Coulomb-driven expansion. Molecular dynamics simulations starting from solution structures do not reproduce the experimental compaction. To be experimentally relevant, molecular dynamics sampling should reflect the progressive structural rearrangements occurring during desolvation. For nucleic acid duplexes, the compaction observed for low charge states results from novel phosphate-phosphate hydrogen bonds formed across both grooves at the very late stages of electrospray.",

We aimed at objectifying this possible alteration by performing a systematic meta-analysis of the literature, and an analysis of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) cohort. Our meta-analysis sought to determine a combined effect size of ASD diagnosis on different measures of the cerebellar anatomy, as well as the effect of possible factors of variability across studies. We then analysed the cerebellar volume of 328 patients and 353 controls from the ABIDE project. The meta-analysis of the literature suggested a weak but significant association between ASD diagnosis and increased cerebellar volume (p=0.049, uncorrected), but the analysis of ABIDE did not show any relationship. The studies in the literature were generally underpowered, however, the number of statistically significant findings was larger than expected. Although we could not provide a conclusive explanation for this excess of significant findings, our analyses would suggest publication bias as a possible reason. Finally, age, sex and IQ were important sources of cerebellar volume variability, however, independent of autism diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is a complex biological process that results from a cascade of multiple events during meiosis. Understanding the genetic determinism of recombination can help to understand if and how these events are interacting. To tackle this question, we studied the patterns of recombination in sheep, using multiple approaches and datasets. We constructed male recombination maps in a dairy breed from the south of France (the Lacaune breed) at a fine scale by combining meiotic recombination rates from a large pedigree genotyped with a 50K SNP array and historical recombination rates from a sample of unrelated individuals genotyped with a 600K SNP array. This analysis revealed recombination patterns in sheep similar to other mammals but also genome regions that have likely been affected by directional and diversifying selection. We estimated the average recombination rate of Lacaune sheep at 1.5 cM/Mb, identified about 50,000 crossover hotspots on the genome and found a high correlation between historical and meiotic recombination rate estimates. A genome-wide association study revealed two major loci affecting inter-individual variation in recombination rate in Lacaune, including the RNF212 and HEI10 genes and possibly 2 other loci of smaller effects including the KCNJ15 and FSHR genes. Finally, we compared our results to those obtained previously in a distantly related population of domestic sheep, the Soay. This comparison revealed that Soay and Lacaune males have a very similar distribution of recombination along the genome and that the two datasets can be combined to create more precise male meiotic recombination maps in sheep. Despite their similar recombination maps, we show that Soay and Lacaune males exhibit different heritabilities and QTL effects for inter-individual variation in genome-wide recombination rates.",

Recently, researchers have proposed proportionality as a valid alternative to correlation for calculating pairwise association in relative data. Although the question of how to best measure proportionality remains open, we present here a computationally efficient R package that implements two proposed measures of proportionality. In an effort to advance the understanding and application of proportionality analysis, we review the mathematics behind proportionality, demonstrate its application to genomic data, and discuss some ongoing challenges in the analysis of relative abundance data.",

In this study, we used tooth root development as a model to investigate how the BMP signaling pathway regulates specific downstream transcriptional complexes to direct the fate determination of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We first identified the MSC population supporting mouse molar root growth as Gli1+ cells. Using a Gli1-mediated transgenic animal model, our results provide the first in vivo evidence that BMP signaling activity is required for the odontogenic differentiation of MSCs. Specifically, we identified transcription factors that are downstream of BMP signaling and are expressed in a spatially restricted pattern consistent with their potential involvement in determining distinct cellular identities within the dental mesenchyme. Finally, we found that overactivation of one key transcription factor, Klf4, associated with the odontogenic region, promotes odontogenic differentiation of MSCs. Collectively, our results demonstrate the functional significance of BMP signaling in regulating the fate of MSCs during root development and shed light on how BMP signaling can achieve functional specificity in regulating diverse organ development.\\n\\nSummary StatementBMP signaling activity is required for the lineage commitment of MSCs and transcription factors downstream of BMP signaling may determine distinct cellular identities within the dental mesenchyme.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is an ancient animal behavior that is regulated similarly in species ranging from flies to mammals. Various genes that regulate sleep have been identified in invertebrates, but whether the functions of these genes are conserved in mammals remains poorly explored. Drosophila insomniac (inc) mutants exhibit severely shortened and fragmented sleep. Inc protein physically associates with the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase, and neuronal depletion of Inc or Cul3 strongly curtails sleep, suggesting that Inc is a Cul3 adaptor that directs the ubiquitination of neuronal substrates that regulate sleep. Three proteins similar to Inc exist in vertebrates--KCTD2, KCTD5, and KCTD17--but are uncharacterized within the nervous system and their functional conservation with Inc has not been addressed. Here we show that Inc and its mouse orthologs exhibit striking biochemical and functional interchangeability within Cul3 complexes. Remarkably, KCTD2 and KCTD5 restore sleep to inc mutants, indicating that they can substitute for Inc in vivo and engage its neuronal targets that impact sleep. Inc and its orthologs traffic similarly within fly and mammalian neurons and are present at synapses, suggesting that their substrates include synaptic proteins. Consistent with such a mechanism, inc mutants exhibit defects in synaptic structure and physiology, indicating that Inc is vital for both synaptic function and sleep. Our findings reveal that molecular functions of Inc are conserved through ~600 million years of evolution and support the hypothesis that Inc and its orthologs participate in an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitination pathway that links synaptic function and sleep regulation.\\n\\nAuthor summarySleep is ubiquitous among animals and is regulated in a similar manner across phylogeny, but whether conserved molecular mechanisms govern sleep is poorly defined. The Insomniac protein is vital for sleep in Drosophila and is a putative adaptor for the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase. We show that two mammalian orthologs of Insomniac can restore sleep to flies lacking Insomniac, indicating that the molecular functions of these proteins are conserved through evolution. Our comparative analysis reveals that Insomniac and its mammalian orthologs localize to neuronal synapses and that Insomniac impacts synaptic structure and physiology. Our findings suggest that Insomniac and its mammalian orthologs are components of an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitination pathway that links synaptic function and the regulation of sleep.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from anthropogenic activities into the environment poses an emerging public health threat. Water constitutes a major vehicle for transport of both biological material and chemical substances. The present study focused on putative antibiotic resistance and integrase genes present in the microbiome of agricultural, urban influenced and protected watersheds in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. A metagenomics approach and high throughput quantitative PCR (HT qPCR) were used to screen for elements of resistance including ARGs and integron-associated integrase genes (intI). Sequencing of bacterial genomic DNA was used to characterize the resistome of microbial communities present in watersheds over a one-year period.\\n\\nResultsData mining using CARD and Integrall databases enabled the identification of putative antibiotic resistance genes present in watershed samples. Antibiotic resistance genes presence in samples from various watershed locations was low relative to the microbial population (<1 %). Analysis of the metagenomic sequences detected a total of 78 ARGs and intI1 across all watershed locations. The relative abundance and richness of antibiotic resistance genes was found to be highest in agriculture impacted watersheds compared to protected and urban watersheds. Gene copy numbers (GCNs) from a subset of 21 different elements of antibiotic resistance were further estimated using HT qPCR. Most GCNs of ARGs were found to be variable over time. A downstream transport pattern was observed in the impacted watersheds (urban and agricultural) during dry months. Urban and agriculture impacted sites had a higher GCNs of ARGs compared to protected sites. Similar to other reports, this study found a strong association between intI1 and ARGs (e.g., sul1), an association which may be used as a proxy for anthropogenic activities. Chemical analysis of water samples for three major groups of antibiotics was negative. However, the high richness and GCNs of ARGs in impacted sites suggest effects of effluents on microbial communities are occurring even at low concentrations of antimicrobials in the water column.\\n\\nConclusionAntibiotic resistance and integrase genes in a year-long metagenomic study showed that ARGs were driven mainly by environmental factors from anthropogenized sites in agriculture and urban watersheds. Environmental factors accounted for almost 40% of the variability observed in watershed locations.",

    "abstract": "Organ development is driven by a set of patterned inductive signals. However, how these signals are integrated to coordinate tissue patterning is still poorly understood. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are critical signaling components involved in signal integration and are regulated by a core Ca2+ signaling toolkit. Ca2+ signaling encodes a significant fraction of information in cells through both amplitude and frequency-dependent regulation of transcription factors and key regulatory enzymes. A range of intercellular Ca2+ transients, including coordinated oscillations, recently have been reported in Drosophila wing discs. In an accompanying paper, we show that impaired Ca2+ signaling impacts the final size and shape of the wing. Here, we discover specific spatiotemporal signatures of Ca2+ transients during wing disc development. To do so, we developed a new neural-network-based approach for registration of oscillatory signals in organs that frequently move during imaging, and a pipeline for spatiotemporal analysis of intercellular Ca2+ oscillations. As a specific test case, we further demonstrated that the morphogen pathway, Hedgehog, controls frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations uniformly in the tissue and is required for spatial patterning of oscillation amplitudes. Thus, the time-averaged dynamics of spontaneous intercellular Ca2+ transients reflect the morphogenetic signaling state of the tissue during development. This suggests a general mechanism of physiological signaling that provides a memory of morphogenetic patterns. Additionally, our study provides a powerful approach for registering and quantifying oscillatory dynamics in developing organs.",

    "abstract": "Polysome-profiling is commonly used to study genome wide patterns of translational efficiency, i.e. the translatome. The standard approach for collecting efficiently translated polysome-associated RNA results in laborious extraction of RNA from a large volume spread across multiple fractions. This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts such as primary cells or frozen tissues. To address this we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for mRNAs associated with >3 ribosomes in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10 fold. The technique can be applied to cells and frozen tissue samples from biobanks, and generates RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material. When coupled with smart-seq2, a single-cell RNA sequencing technique, translatomes from small tissue samples can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients are very similar to those obtained when applying linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized nonlinear gradients in HCT-116 cells with or without p53 identified a translatome associated with p53 status under serum starvation. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to larger studies, primary cells where RNA amount is low and frozen tissue samples.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPA fundamental challenge in ecology continues to be identifying mechanisms that stabilize community dynamics. By altering the interactions within a community, eco-evolutionary feedbacks may play a role in community stability. Indeed, recent empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate that these feedbacks can stabilize or destabilize communities, and moreover, that this sometimes depends on the relative rate of ecological to evolutionary processes. So far, theory on how eco-evolutionary feedbacks impact stability exists for only for a few special cases. In our work, we develop a general theory for determining the effects of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on stability in communities with an arbitrary number of interacting species and evolving traits for when evolution is slow and fast. We characterize how eco-evolutionary feedbacks lead to stable communities that would otherwise be unstable, and vice versa. We show how this characterization provides a partitioning of the roles of direct and indirect feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes on stability, and how this partitioning depends on the rate of evolution relative to the ecological time scales. Applying our methods to models of competing species and food chains, we demonstrate how the functional form of trade offs, genetic correlations between traits, and the rate of evolution determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks stabilize or destabilize communities.",
