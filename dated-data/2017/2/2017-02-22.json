    "abstract": "Neural activity during cognitive tasks exhibits complex dynamics that flexibly encode task-relevant variables. Chaotic recurrent networks, which spontaneously generate rich dynamics, have been proposed as a model of cortical computation during cognitive tasks. However, existing methods for training these networks are either biologically implausible, and/or require a continuous, real-time error signal to guide learning. Here we show that a biologically plausible learning rule can train such recurrent networks, guided solely by delayed, phasic rewards at the end of each trial. Networks endowed with this learning rule can successfully learn nontrivial tasks requiring flexible (context-dependent) associations, memory maintenance, nonlinear mixed selectivities, and coordination among multiple outputs. The resulting networks replicate complex dynamics previously observed in animal cortex, such as dynamic encoding of task features and selective integration of sensory inputs. We conclude that recurrent neural networks offer a plausible model of cortical dynamics during both learning and performance of flexible behavior.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of Big Data technologies can potentially boost the scalability of data-driven biology and health workflows by orders of magnitude. Consider, for instance, that technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem have been successfully used in data-driven industry to scale their processes to levels much larger than any biological- or health-driven work attempted thus far. In this work we demonstrate the scalability of a sequence alignment pipeline based on technologies from the Hadoop ecosystem - namely, Apache Flink and Hadoop MapReduce, both running on the distributed Apache YARN platform. Unlike previous work, our pipeline starts processing directly from the raw BCL data produced by Illumina sequencers. A Flink-based distributed algorithm reconstructs reads from the Illumina BCL data, and then demultiplexes them - analogously to the bcl2fastq2 program provided by Illumina. Subsequently, the BWA-MEM-based distributed aligner from the Seal project is used to perform read mapping on the YARN platform. While the standard programs by Illumina and BWA-MEM are limited to shared-memory parallelism (multi-threading), our solution is completely distributed and can scale across a large number of computing nodes. Results show excellent pipeline scalability, linear in the number of nodes. In addition, this approach automatically benefits from the robustness to hardware failure and transient cluster problems provided by the YARN pipeline, as well as the scalability of the Hadoop Distributed File System. Moreover, this YARN-based approach complements the up-and-coming version 4 of the GATK toolkit, which is based on Spark and therefore can run on YARN. Together, they can be used to form a scalable complete YARN-based variant calling pipeline for Illumina data, which will be further improved with the arrival of distributed in-memory filesystem technology such as Apache Arrow, thus removing the need to write intermediate data to disk.",

    "abstract": "The proteins responsible for mitochondrial function are encoded by two different genomes with distinct inheritance regimes, rendering rigorous inference of genotype-phenotype connections intractable for all but a few model systems. Asexual organisms provide a powerful means for addressing these challenges because offspring produced without recombination inherit both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from a single parent. As such, these offspring inherit mitonuclear genotypes that are identical to the mitonuclear genotypes of their parents and siblings and different from those of other asexual lineages. Here, we compared mitochondrial function across distinct asexual lineages of Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand freshwater snail model for understanding the evolutionary consequences of asexuality. Our analyses revealed substantial phenotypic variation across asexual lineages at three levels of biological organization: mitogenomic, organellar, and organismal. These data demonstrate that different asexual lineages have different mitochondrial function phenotypes and that there exists heritable variation (that is, the raw material for evolution) for mitochondrial function in P. antipodarum. The discovery of this variation combined with the methods developed here sets the stage to use P. antipodarum to study central evolutionary questions involving mitochondrial function, including whether mitochondrial mutation accumulation influences the maintenance of sexual reproduction in natural populations.",

Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread [1]. Strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes.

    "abstract": "Neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for particular properties of visual stimuli. Locomotion causes a change in cortical state that leaves their selectivity unchanged but strengthens their responses. Both locomotion and the change in cortical state are initiated by projections from the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), the latter through a disinhibitory circuit in V1. The function served by this change in cortical state is unknown. By recording simultaneously from a large number of single neurons in alert mice viewing moving gratings, we investigated the relationship between locomotion and the information contained within the neural population. We found that locomotion improved encoding of visual stimuli in V1 by two mechanisms. First, locomotion-induced increases in firing rates enhanced the mutual information between visual stimuli and single neuron responses over a fixed window of time. Second, stimulus discriminability was improved, even for fixed population firing rates, because of a decrease in noise correlations across the population during locomotion. These two mechanisms contributed differently to improvements in discriminability across cortical layers, with changes in firing rates most important in the upper layers and changes in noise correlations most important in layer V. Together, these changes resulted in a three- to five-fold reduction in the time needed to precisely encode grating direction and orientation. These results support the hypothesis that cortical state shifts during locomotion to accommodate an increased load on the visual system when mice are moving.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis paper contains three novel findings about the representation of information in neurons within the primary visual cortex of the mouse. First, we show that locomotion reduces by at least a factor of three the time needed for information to accumulate in the visual cortex that allows the distinction of different visual stimuli. Second, we show that the effect of locomotion is to increase information in cells of all layers of the visual cortex. Third we show that the means by which information is enhanced by locomotion differs between the upper layers, where the major effect is the increasing of firing rates, and in layer V, where the major effect is the reduction in noise correlations.",

Next-generation sequencing analyses are unable to reliably capture aberrations larger than the typical sequencing read length of several hundred bases. Long-read, single-molecule sequencing methods such as SMRT and nanopore sequencing can address larger variations, but require costly whole genome analysis. Here we describe a method for isolation and enrichment of a large genomic region of interest for targeted analysis based on Cas9 excision of two sites flanking the target region and isolation of the excised DNA segment by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The isolated target remains intact and is ideally suited for optical genome mapping and long-read sequencing at high coverage. In addition, analysis is performed directly on native genomic DNA that retains genetic and epigenetic composition without amplification bias. This method enables detection of mutations and structural variants as well as detailed analysis by generation of hybrid scaffolds composed of optical maps and sequencing data at a fraction of the cost of whole genome sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids interactions within protein families are so optimized that the sole analysis of evolutionary co-mutations can identify pairs of contacting residues. It is also known that evolution conserves functional dynamics, i.e., the concerted motion or displacement of large protein regions or domains. Is it, therefore, possible to use a pure sequence-based analysis to identify these dynamical domains? To address this question, we introduce here a general co-evolutionary coupling analysis strategy and apply it to a curated sequence database of hundreds of protein families. For most families, the sequence-based method partitions amino acids into few clusters. When viewed in the context of the native structure, these clusters have the signature characteristics of viable protein domains: they are spatially separated but individually compact. They have a direct functional bearings too, as shown for various reference cases. We conclude that even large-scale structural and functionally-related properties can be recovered from inference methods applied to evolutionary-related sequences. The method introduced here is available as a software package and web server (http://spectrus.sissa.it/spectrus-evo_webserver).",

    "abstract": "With advances in genomic sequencing technology, the number of reported gene-disease relationships has rapidly expanded. However, the evidence supporting these claims varies widely, confounding accurate evaluation of genomic variation in a clinical setting. Despite the critical need to differentiate clinically valid relationships from less well-substantiated relationships, standard guidelines for such evaluation do not currently exist. The NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has developed a framework to define and evaluate the clinical validity of gene-disease pairs across a variety of Mendelian disorders. In this manuscript we describe a proposed framework to evaluate relevant genetic and experimental evidence supporting or contradicting a gene-disease relationship, and the subsequent validation of this framework using a set of representative gene-disease pairs. The framework provides a semi-quantitative measurement for the strength of evidence of a gene-disease relationship which correlates to a qualitative classification: \\\"Definitive\\\", \\\"Strong\\\", \\\"Moderate\\\", \\\"Limited\\\", \\\"No Reported Evidence\\\" or \\\"Conflicting Evidence.\\\" Within the ClinGen structure, classifications derived using this framework are reviewed and confirmed or adjusted based on clinical expertise of appropriate disease experts. Detailed guidance for utilizing this framework and access to the curation interface is available on our website. This evidence-based, systematic method to assess the strength of gene-disease relationships will facilitate more knowledgeable utilization of genomic variants in clinical and research settings.",

A major barrier to reproducing neuroimaging studies is their high cost, in money and labor, and utilizing such datasets is an obvious solution for breaking down this barrier. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is an open access dataset consisting of extensive behavioral and neuroimaging data from over 1,100 individuals and there are numerous ongoing HCP-harmonized studies of lifespan and disease that will ultimately release data through HCP infrastructure. To bring attention to the HCP and related projects as an important resource for conducting replication studies, I used the HCP to conduct a replication of a highly cited neuroimaging study that showed correspondence between resting state and task brain networks.",

To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors which enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.",

    "abstract": "Thicker leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf thickness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the desert tomato species Solanum pennellii, and identified quantitative trait loci (QTL). We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with thick leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized thick ILs 2-5 and 4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf thickness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred Dynamic Bayesian Networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf thickness. We show that thick ILs share S. pennellii-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy, as well as a general signature of cell cycle related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf thickness in these two lines is patterned by at least partially distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes including thick leaves, higher ploidy levels and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf thickness in desert-adapted tomato.",

The presence of the queen is key for maintaining social harmony, but the specific role of the queen in the evolution of eusociality remains unclear. A long-discussed scenario is that a queen either behaviorally or chemically sterilizes her workers. However, the demographic and ecological conditions that enable such manipulation are unknown. Accordingly, we propose a simple model of evolutionary dynamics that is based on haplodiploid genetics. We consider a mutation that acts in a queen, causing her to control the reproductive behavior of her workers. Our mathematical analysis yields precise conditions for the evolutionary emergence and stability of queen-induced worker sterility. These conditions do not depend on the queen's mating frequency. Moreover, we find that queen control is always established if it increases colony reproductive efficiency and can evolve even if it decreases colony efficiency. We further outline the conditions under which queen control is evolutionarily stable against invasion by mutant, reproductive workers.",

After observation, subjects performed reaches in a force field as a behavioral assessment of gains in motor learning resulting from observation. We found that individual differences in resting-state FC, but not grey matter volume, predicted post-observation gains in motor learning. Pre-observation resting-state FC between left S1 and bilateral PMd, M1, S1 and left SPL was positively correlated with behavioral measures of post-observation motor learning. Sensory-motor resting-state FC can thus predict the extent to which observation will promote subsequent motor learning.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe show that individual differences in pre-observation brain function can predict subsequent observation-related gains in motor learning. Pre-observation resting-state functional connectivity within a sensory-motor network may be used as a biomarker for the extent to which observation promotes motor learning. This kind of information may be useful if observation is to be used as a way to boost neuroplasticity and sensory motor recovery for patients undergoing rehabilitation for diseases that impair movement such as stroke.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlbeit several studies show that cellular therapy with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI), the underlying mechanism is subject of controversy. Here we hypothesized that soluble factors, including VEGF, secreted by cardiomyocytes and BM-hMSCs under a low oxygen environment promote vascular differentiation of BM-hMSCs.\\n\\nMethodsHuman BM-MSCs were isolated and expanded in vitro by the same procedure we employed to prepare cells suitable for cardiac cell therapy. BM-hMSCs were characterized by flow cytometry and functional analysis. Vascular differentiation was induced by VEGF or by conditioned media from neonate rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCs) cultured in anoxia and confirmed by immunostaining, tube formation over matrigel and cell migration across transwells. Presence of VEGF in conditioned media was determined by ELISA and activation of VEGF signaling by Western blot.\\n\\nResultsBM-hMSCs used in this study met the criteria recommended by International Society for Cellular Therapy for defining mesenchymal stromal cells. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) expression and tube formation in matrigel indicate that these cells had the capacity to differentiate into the endothelial lineage, which was further enhanced by VEGF and conditioned media from NRVCs cultured in anoxia. Furthermore, condition media and VEGF stimulated cell migration across transwells, which demonstrates the migratory capacity of BM-hMSCs. Finally, when VEGF signaling was blocked by neutralizing anti-VEGF, vascular differentiation of BM-hMSCs was reduced to basal levels.\\n\\nConclusionsSoluble VEGF released in the culture media after exposure to low oxygen conditions is responsible for endothelial differentiation of BM-hMSCs.",

    "abstract": "Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS) represents a phenotypic spectrum of motor, sensory, and cranial nerve neuropathy, often with ataxia, optic atrophy and respiratory problems leading to ventilator-dependence. Loss-of-function mutations in two riboflavin transporter (RFVT) genes, SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, have recently been linked to BVVLS. However, the genetic frequency, neuropathology and downstream consequences of RFVT mutations have previously been undefined. By screening a large cohort of 132 patients with early-onset severe sensory, motor and cranial nerve neuropathy we confirmed the strong genetic link between RFVT mutations and BVVLS, identifying twenty-two pathogenic mutations in SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, fourteen of which were novel. Brain and spinal cord neuropathological examination of two cases with SLC52A3 mutations showed classical symmetrical brainstem lesions resembling pathology seen in mitochondrial disease, including severe neuronal loss in the lower cranial nerve nuclei, anterior horns and corresponding nerves, atrophy of the spinothalamic and spinocerebellar tracts and posterior column-medial lemniscus pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction has previously been implicated in an array of neurodegenerative disorders. Since riboflavin metabolites are critical components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), we hypothesized that reduced riboflavin transport would result in impaired mitochondrial activity, and confirmed this using in vitro and in vivo models. ETC complex I and complex II activity were decreased in SLC52A2 patient fibroblasts, while global knockdown of the single Drosophila RFVT homologue revealed reduced levels of riboflavin, downstream metabolites, and ETC complex I activity. RFVT knockdown in Drosophila also resulted in severely impaired locomotor activity and reduced lifespan, mirroring patient pathology, and these phenotypes could be partially rescued using a novel esterified derivative of riboflavin. Our findings indicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a downstream consequence of RFVT gene defects in BVVLS and validate riboflavin esters as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "The characterisation of the activation domains started three decades ago with Gcn4 and Gal4 activators. The amorphous character of the activation domains strongly hindered their definition. Moreover, during the attempts to localise the Gal4 activation domain, the artificial peptides, an unintended consequence of cloning, were responsible for artificial transcriptional activity of the several Gal4 constructs. These artefacts produced enormous experimental bias and misconception. The presence of inhibitory domains in some Gal4 constructs made the misperception even worse. Previously, we reported that the nine amino acid transactivation domain, 9aaTAD, is the exclusive activation domain in the Gal4 protein. The activation domain 9aaTAD could be identified in Gal4 paralogs Oaf1, Pip2, Pdr1, Pdr3 and other activators p53, E2A and MLL. Surprisingly, the activation domain 9aaTAD was reported as misconception for Gal4 activator. Here we demonstrated that small region of 10 amino acids adjacent to the Gal4 activation domain 9aaTAD is an inhibitory domain, which the authors included in their constructs. Moreover, we identified Gal4 region, which was able to the reverse the inhibitory effect. The 9aaTAD re-activation domain was localized to the 13 amino acid long region. In this report we clarified the numerous confusions and rebutted supposed 9aaTAD misconception.\\n\\nSummaryThe activation domain 9aaTAD has decisive function in Gal4 activation. Gal4 activation domain 9aaTAD could be inhibited by adjacent region of 10 amino acids. The inhibited Gal4 activation domain 9aaTAD could be reactivated by 13 amino acid long Gal4 region. The activation domains 9aaTAD could be identified by our 9aaTAD prediction algorithm, especially in the Gal4 family.",

Not only the local concentration but also duration of morphogen exposure is critical for correct cell fate decisions. Yet, how and when cells temporally integrate signals from a morphogen remains unclear. Here, we use optogenetic manipulation to switch off Bicoid-dependent transcription in the early Drosophila embryo with high temporal resolution, allowing time-specific and reversible manipulation of morphogen signalling. We find that Bicoid transcriptional activity is dispensable for embryonic viability in the first hour after fertilization, but persistently required throughout the rest of the blastoderm stage. Short interruptions of Bicoid activity alter the most anterior cell fate decisions, while prolonged inactivation expands patterning defects from anterior to posterior. Such anterior susceptibility correlates with high reliance of anterior gap gene expression on Bicoid. Therefore, cell fates exposed to higher Bicoid concentration require input for longer duration, demonstrating a previously unknown aspect of morphogen decoding.",

This strategy captures even the rarest outcomes of the model with no sampling error. Our method can incorporate heterogeneity in both cell state and, by augmenting the model, the underlying rules of the network as well (i.e. mutations).

    "abstract": "Nosema, a genus of parasitic microsporidia, causes pebrine disease in arthropods, including economically important silkworms and honeybees. Nosema have gene-poor genomes shaped by loss of the metabolic pathways, as a consequence of continued dependence on host-derived substrates. As an act of counterbalance, they have developed an array of transporter proteins that allow stealing from their hosts. Here, we have identified the core set of twelve transporter families present in Nosema genus, viz. N. apis, N. bombycis, N. ceranae and N. antheraea through in silico pipeline. Transportomes of N. apis, N. bombycis, N. ceranae and N. antheraea have a dominant share of secondary carriers and primary active transporters. The comparatively rich and diverse transportome of N. bombycis indicates the role of transporters in its remarkable capability of host adaptation. The core set of transporter families of Nosema includes ones that have a likely role in osmo-regulation, intra- and extra-cellular pH regulation, energy compensation and self-defence mechanism. This study has also revealed a set of ten species-specific transporter families within the genus. To our knowledge, this is the first ever intra-genus study on microsporidian transporters. Both these datasets constitutes a valuable resource that can aid in development of inhibitor-based Nosema management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Does processing the meanings of individual words vs. assembling words into phrases and sentences rely on distinct pools of cognitive and neural resources? Many have argued for such a dissociation, although the field is lacking a consensus on which brain region(s) support lexico-semantic vs. syntactic processing. Although some have also argued against such a dissociation, the dominant view in the field remains that distinct brain regions support these two fundamental components of language. One of the earlier and most cited pieces of evidence in favor of this dissociation comes from a paper by Dapretto & Bookheimer (1999, Neuron; DB). Using a sentence meaning comparison task, DB observed two distinct peaks within the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG): one more active when comparisons relied on lexico-semantic cues, and another - when they instead relied on syntactic cues. Although the paper has been highly cited over the years, no attempt has been made, to our knowledge, to replicate the original finding. We here report an fMRI study that attempts to do so. Using a combination of three approaches - whole-brain, group-level ROIs, and individual functional ROIs - we fail to replicate the originally reported dissociation. In particular, parts of the LIFG respond reliably more strongly during lexico-semantic than syntactic processing, but no part of the LIFG (including in the region defined around the peak reported by DB) shows the opposite response pattern. We hypothesize that the original result was a false positive, possibly driven by one participant or item given the use of a fixed-effects analysis and a small number of items (8 per condition) and participants (n=8).",

Indeed, analyses of breakthrough infections in the HIV vaccine trial RV144 identified HIV genotypes with differential rates of transmission in vaccine and placebo recipients. We hypothesized that, for HIV vaccination programs based on partially effective vaccines similar to RV144, HIV adaptation will diminish the expected vaccine impact. Using two HIV epidemic models, we simulated large-scale vaccination programs and, critically, included HIV strain diversity with respect to the vaccine response. We show here that rapid population-level viral adaptation can lead to decreased overall vaccine efficacy and substantially fewer infections averted by vaccination, when comparing scenarios with and without viral evolution (depending on vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacy against the sensitive allele, and the initial resistant allele frequency). Translating this to the epidemic in South Africa, a scenario with 70% vaccination coverage may result in 250,000 new infections within 10 years of vaccine rollout that are due solely to HIV adaptation, all else being equal. These findings suggest that approaches to HIV vaccine development, program implementation, and epidemic modeling may require attention to viral evolutionary responses to vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Dynactin is a dynein-regulating protein that increases the processivity of dynein movement on microtubules. Recent studies have shown that a tripartite complex of dynein-dynactin-Bicaudal D2 is essential for highly processive movement. To elucidate the regulation of dynein motility by dynactin, we focused on two isoforms (A and B) of dynactin 1 (DCTN1), the largest subunit of dynactin that contains both microtubule- and dynein-binding domains. The only difference between the primary structures of the two isoforms is that DCTN1B lacks the K-rich domain, a cluster of basic residues. We measured dynein motility by single molecule observation of recombinant dynein and dynactin. Whereas the tripartite complex containing DCTN1A exhibited highly processive movement, the complex containing DCTN1B dissociated from microtubules with no apparent processive movement. This inhibitory effect of DCTN1B was caused by reductions of the microtubule-binding affinities of both dynein and dynactin, which is attributed to the coiled-coil 1 domain of DCTN1. In DCTN1A, the K-rich domain antagonized these inhibitory effects. Therefore, dynactin has two antagonistic domains and promotes or suppresses dynein motility to accomplish correct localization and functions of dynein within a cell.",

    "abstract": "Clefts of the palate and/or lip arise in about 1/700 human live births and are caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Studies of mouse knockout models of cleft palate have improved our understanding of the molecular control of palatogenesis. While it is known that Pax9 regulates palatogenesis through Bmp, Fgf and Shh signaling, there is still much to learn about its precise relationship with other pathways. Here we show that alterations of Wnt expression and decreased Wnt activity in Pax9-/- palatal shelves are a result of Pax9s ability to directly bind and repress the promoters of Dkk1 and Dkk2, proteins that antagonize Wnt signaling. The delivery of small-molecule Dkk inhibitors (Wnt agonists) into the tail-veins of pregnant Pax9+/- mice from E10.5 to E14.5 restored Wnt signaling, promoted cell proliferation, bone formation and restored the fusion of palatal shelves in Pax9-/- embryos. In contrast, other organ defects in Pax9 mutants were not corrected. These data uncover a unique molecular relationship between Pax9 and Wnt genes in palatogenesis and offer a new approach for treating cleft palates in humans.\\n\\nSummary StatementThese studies demonstrate that the Pax9/Wnt genes regulate murine palatogenesis. This unique molecular relationship is proven by the correction of cleft defects in Pax9-deficient mice through Wnt agonist therapies.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of many animal and plant diseases relies on the behavior of arthropod vectors. In particular, the choice to feed on either infected or uninfected hosts can dramatically affect the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. I develop an epidemiological model to explore the impact of host choice behavior on the dynamics of these diseases and to examine selection acting on vector behavior, but also on pathogen manipulation of this behavior. This model identifies multiple evolutionary conflicts over the control of this behavior and generates testable predictions under different scenarios. In general, the vector should evolve the ability to avoid infected hosts. However, if the vector behavior is under the control of the pathogen, uninfected vectors should prefer infected hosts while infected vectors should seek uninfected hosts. But some mechanistic constraints on pathogen manipulation ability may alter these predictions. These theoretical results are discussed in the light of observed behavioral patterns obtained on a diverse range of vector-borne diseases. These patterns confirm that several pathogens have evolved conditional behavioral manipulation strategies of their vector species. Other pathogens, however, seem unable to evolve such complex conditional strategies. Contrasting the behavior of infected and uninfected vectors may thus help reveal mechanistic constraints acting on the evolution of the manipulation of vector behavior.",

    "abstract": "Chemical cues are arguably the most fundamental means of animal communication and play an important role in mate choice and kin recognition. Consequently, gas chromatography (GC) in combination with either mass spectrometry (MS) or flame ionisation detection (FID) are commonly used to characterise complex chemical samples. Both GC-FID and GC-MS generate chromatograms comprising peaks that are separated according to their retention times and which represent different substances. Across chromatograms of different samples, homologous substances are expected to elute at similar retention times. However, random and often unavoidable experimental variation introduces noise, making the alignment of homologous peaks challenging, particularly with GC-FID data where mass spectral data are lacking. Here we present GCalignR, a user-friendly R package for aligning GC-FID data based on retention times. The package also implements dynamic visualisations to facilitate inspection and fine-tuning of the resulting alignments, and can be integrated within a broader workflow in R to facilitate downstream multivariate analyses. We demonstrate an example workflow using empirical data from Antarctic fur seals and explore the impact of user-defined parameter values by calculating alignment error rates for multiple datasets. The resulting alignments had low error rates for most of the explored parameter space and we could also show that GCalignR performed equally well or better than other available software. We hope that GCalignR will help to simplify the processing of chemical datasets and improve the standardization and reproducibility of chemical analyses in studies of animal chemical communication and related fields.",

    "abstract": "We compare several molecular fingerprint encodings for marketed, small molecule drugs, and assess how their rank order varies with the fingerprint in terms of the Tanimoto similarity to the most similar endogenous human metabolite as taken from Recon2. For the great majority of drugs, the rank order varies very greatly depending on the encoding used, and also somewhat when the Tanimoto similarity (TS) is replaced by the Tversky similarity. However, for a subset of such drugs, amounting to some 10% of the set and a Tanimoto similarity of ~0.8 or greater, the similarity coefficient is relatively robust to the encoding used. This leads to a metric that, while arbitrary, suggests that a Tanimoto similarity of 0.75-0.8 or greater genuinely does imply a considerable structural similarity of two molecules in the drug-endogenite space. Although comparatively few (<10% of) marketed drugs are, in this sense, robustly similar to an endogenite, there is often at least one encoding with which they are genuinely similar (e.g. TS > 0.75). This is referred to as the Take Your Pick Improved Cheminformatic Analytical Likeness or TYPICAL encoding, and on this basis some 66% of drugs are within a TS of 0.75 to an endogenite.\\n\\nWe next explicitly recognise that natural evolution will have selected for the ability to transport dietary substances, including plant, animal and microbial  secondary metabolites, that are of benefit to the host. These should also be explored in terms of their closeness to marketed drugs. We thus compared the TS of marketed drugs with the contents of various databases of natural products. When this is done, we find that some 80% of marketed drugs are within a TS of 0.7 to a natural product, even using just the MACCS encoding. For patterned and TYPICAL encodings, 80% and 98% of drugs are within a TS of 0.8 to (an endogenite or) an exogenous natural product. This implies strongly that it is these exogeneous (dietary and medicinal) natural products that are more to be seen as the  natural substrates of drug transporters (as is recognised, for instance, for the solute carrier SLC22A4 and ergothioneine). This novel analysis casts an entirely different light on the kinds of natural molecules that are to be seen as most like marketed drugs, and hence potential transporter substrates, and further suggests that a renewed exploitation of natural products as drug scaffolds would be amply rewarded.",

    "abstract": "Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204 (N=32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and {Omega}nyx).\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe describe Latent change score modelling as a flexible statistical tool\\nC_LIO_LIKey developmental questions can be readily formalized using LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWe provide accessible open source code and software examples to fit LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWhite matter structural change is negatively correlated with processing speed gains\\nC_LIO_LIFrontal lobe thinning in adolescence is more variable in males than females\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Despite the promise that molecular data would provide a seemingly unlimited source of independent characters, many plant phylogenetic studies are based on only two regions, the plastid genome and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). Their popularity can be explained by high copy numbers and universal PCR primers that make their sequences easily amplified and converted into parallel datasets. Unfortunately, their utility is limited by linked loci and limited characters resulting in low confidence in the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates, especially when rapid radiations occur. In another contribution on anchored phylogenomics in angiosperms, we presented flowering plant-specific anchored enrichment probes for hundreds of conserved nuclear genes and demonstrated their use at the level of all angiosperms. In this contribution, we focus on a common problem in phylogenetic reconstructions below the family level: weak or unresolved backbone due to rapid radiations ([&le;] 10 million years) followed by long divergence, using the Cariceae-Dulichieae-Scirpeae clade (CDS, Cyperaceae) as a test case. By comparing our nuclear matrix of 461 genes to a typical Sanger-sequence dataset consisting of a few plastid genes (matK, ndhF) and an nrDNA marker (ETS), we demonstrate that our nuclear data is fully compatible with the Sanger dataset and resolves short backbone internodes with high support in both concatenated and coalescence-based analyses. In addition, we show that nuclear gene tree incongruence is inversely proportional to phylogenetic information content, indicating that incongruence is mostly due to gene tree estimation error. This suggests that large numbers of conserved nuclear loci could produce more accurate trees than sampling rapidly evolving regions prone to saturation and long-branch attraction. The robust phylogenetic estimates obtained here, and high congruence with previous morphological and molecular analyses, are strong evidence for a complete tribal revision of CDS. The anchored hybrid enrichment probes used in this study should be similarly effective in other flowering plant groups.

    "abstract": "Gaussian Bayesian networks have become a widely used framework to estimate directed associations between joint Gaussian variables, where the network structure encodes decomposition of multivariate normal density into local terms. However, the resulting estimates can be inaccurate when normality assumption is moderately or severely violated, making it unsuitable to deal with recent genomic data such as the Cancer Genome Atlas data. In the present paper, we propose a mixture copula Bayesian network model which provides great flexibility in modeling non-Gaussian and multimodal data for causal inference. The parameters in mixture copula functions can be efficiently estimated by a routine Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A heuristic search algorithm based on Bayesian information criterion is developed to estimate the network structure, and prediction can be further improved by the best-scoring network out of multiple predictions from random initial values. Our method outperforms Gaussian Bayesian networks and regular copula Bayesian networks in terms of modeling flexibility and prediction accuracy, as demonstrated using a cell signaling dataset. We apply the proposed methods to the Cancer Genome Atlas data to study the genetic and epigenetic pathways that underlie serous ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Cholera emergence is strongly linked to local environmental and ecological context. The 1991-2004 pandemic emerged in Peru and spread north into Ecuadors El Oro province, making this a key site for potential re-emergence. Machala, El Oro, is a port city of 250,000, near the Peruvian border. Many livelihoods depend on the estuarine system, from fishing for subsistence and trade, to domestic water use. In 2014, we conducted biweekly sampling for 10 months in five estuarine locations, across a gradient of human use, and ranging from inland to ocean. We measured water characteristics implicated in V. cholerae growth and persistence: pH, temperature, salinity, and algal concentration, and evaluated samples in five months for pathogenic and non-pathogenic Vibrio cholerae, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found environmental persistence of strains O1 and O139, but no evidence for toxigene presence. V. cholerae presence was coupled to algal and salinity concentration, and sites exhibited considerable seasonal and spatial heterogeneity. This study indicates that environmental conditions in Machala are optimal for human cholera re-emergence, with risk peaking during September, and higher risk near urban periphery low-income communities. This highlights a need for surveillance of this coupled cholera- estuarine system to anticipate potential future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Plant and algae plastids evolved from the endosymbiotic integration of a cyanobacterium by a heterotrophic eukaryote. A consequence of their ancestry is that new plastids can only emerge through fission and vital to organelle and host co-evolution was the early synchronization of bacterial division with the hosts eukaryotic cell cycle. Most of the sampled algae, including multicellular macroalgae, house a single plastid per cell -- or nucleus in case of coenocytic cells -- and basal branching relatives of polyplastidic lineages are all monoplastidic. The latter is also true regarding embryophytes, as some non-vascular plants are monoplastidic at least at some stage of their life cycle. Here we synthesize recent advances regarding plastid division and associated proteins, including those of the peptidoglycan wall biosynthesis, across the diversity of phototrophic eukaryotes. Through the comparison of the phenotype of 131 species harbouring plastids of primary or secondary origin, we uncover that one prerequisite for an algae or plant to house multiple plastids per nucleus appears the loss of the genes MinD and MinE from the plastid genome. Housing a single plastid whose division is coupled to host cytokinesis appears a prerequisite of plastid emergence; escaping that monoplastidic bottleneck succeeded rarely and appears tied to evolving a complex morphology. Considering how little we know about the mechanisms that guarantee proper organelle (and genome) inheritance raises the peculiar possibility that a quality control checkpoint of plastid transmission remains to be explored and which is tied to understanding the monoplastidic bottleneck.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies have shown that neural activity in vivo tends to be constrained to a low-dimensional manifold. Such activity does not arise in simulated neural networks with homogeneous connectivity and it has been suggested that it is indicative of some other connectivity pattern in neuronal networks. Surprisingly, the structure of the intrinsic manifold of the network activity puts constraints on learning. For instance, animals find it difficult to perform tasks that may require a change in the intrinsic manifold. Here, we demonstrate that the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) can be adapted to design a biologically plausible spiking neuronal network that exhibit low dimensional activity. Consistent with experimental observations, the resulting synaptic weight distribution is heavy-tailed (log-normal). In our model, a change in the intrinsic manifold of the network activity requires rewiring of the whole network, which may be either not possible or a very slow process. This observation provides an explanation of why learning is easier when it does not require the neural activity to leave its intrinsic manifold.\\n\\nSignificance statementA network in the brain consists of thousands of neurons. A priori, we expect that the network will have as many degrees of freedom as its number of neurons. Surprisingly, experimental evidence suggests that local brain activity is confined to a space spanned by 10 variables. Here, we describe an approach to construct spiking neuronal networks that exhibit low-dimensional activity and address the question: how the intrinsic dimensionality of the network activity restricts the learning as suggested by recent experiments? Specifically, we show that tasks that requires animals to change the network activity outside the intrinsic space would entail large changes in the neuronal connectivity, and therefore, animals are either slow or not able to acquire such tasks.",

    "abstract": "The responses of neurons in the visual cortex (V1) of adult mammals have long been thought to be stable over long periods. Here, we investigated whether repeated exposure to specific stimuli would enhance V1 visual responses in mice using intrinsic signal imaging through the intact skull and two-photon imaging of calcium signals in single neurons. Mice ran on Styrofoam balls floating on air while viewing one of three different, high-contrast visual stimuli. V1 responses to the stimuli that were viewed by the animal were specifically enhanced, while responses to other stimuli were unaffected. Similar exposure in stationary mice, or in mice in which NMDA receptors were partially blocked, did not significantly enhance responses. These findings indicate that stimulus-specific plasticity in the adult visual cortex depends on concurrent locomotion, presumably as a result of the high-gain state of visual cortex induced by locomotion.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe report a rapid and persistent increase in visual cortical responses to visual stimuli presented during locomotion in intact mice. We first used a method that is completely non-invasive, intrinsic signal imaging through the intact skull. We then measured the same effects on single neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging and found that the increase in response to a particular stimulus produced by locomotion depends on how well the neuron is initially driven by the stimulus. To our knowledge, this is the first time such enhancement has been described in single neurons or using non-invasive measurements.",
