    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe daily gene expression oscillations that underlie mammalian circadian rhythms show striking tissue differences and involve post-transcriptional regulation. Both aspects remain poorly understood. We have used ribosome profiling to explore the contribution of translation efficiency to temporal gene expression in kidney, and contrasted our findings with liver data available from the same mice.\\n\\nRESULTSRhythmic translation of constantly abundant mRNAs affected largely non-overlapping transcript sets with distinct phase clustering in the two organs. Moreover, tissue differences in translation efficiency modulated the timing and amount of protein biosynthesis from rhythmic mRNAs, consistent with organ-specificity in clock output gene repertoires and rhythmicity parameters. Our comprehensive datasets provided insights into translational control beyond temporal regulation. Between tissues, many transcripts showed differences in translation efficiency, which were, however, of markedly smaller scale than mRNA abundance differences. Tissue-specific changes in translation efficiency were associated with specific transcript features and, intriguingly, globally counteracted and compensated transcript abundance variations, leading to higher similarity at the level of protein biosynthesis between both tissues.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe show that tissue-specificity in rhythmic gene expression extends to the translatome and contributes to define the identities, the phases and the expression levels of rhythmic protein biosynthesis. Moreover, translational compensation of transcript abundance divergence leads to overall higher similarity at the level of protein production across organs. The unique resources provided through our study will serve to address fundamental questions of post-transcriptional control and differential gene expression in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Genetic incompatibilities can emerge as a by-product of genetic divergence. According to Dobzhansky and Muller, alleles at different loci that have fixed in different genetic backgrounds may be incompatible when brought together in a hybrid. Orr showed that the number of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) should accumulate faster than linearly--i.e., snowball--as two lineages diverge. Several studies have attempted to test the snowball model using data from natural populations. One limitation of these studies is that they have focused on predictions of the snowball model but not on its underlying assumptions. Here we use a computational model of RNA folding to test both predictions and assumptions of the snowball model. In this model, two populations are allowed to evolve in allopatry on a holey fitness landscape. We find that the number of DMIs involving pairs of loci (i.e., simple DMIs) does not snowball--rather, it increases approximately linearly with divergence. We show that the probability of emergence of a simple DMI is approximately constant, as assumed by the snowball model. However, simple DMIs can disappear after they have arisen, contrary to the assumptions of the snowball model. This occurs because simple DMIs become complex (i.e., involve alleles at three or more loci) as a result of later substitutions. We introduce a modified snowball model--the melting snowball model--where simple DMIs can become complex after they appear. The melting snowball model can account for the results of the RNA folding model. We also find that complex DMIs are common and, unlike simple ones, do snowball. Reproductive isolation, however, does not snowball because DMIs do not act independently of each other. We conclude that the RNA folding model supports the central prediction of the snowball model that the number of DMIs snowballs, but challenges some of its underlying assumptions.",

This bias could be caused by increased male mortality, lower male growth rate, or a higher threshold for achieving sexual maturity in males.

Next, we used putative sex-associated markers to identify the sex of individuals without sex structures.\\nC_LIO_LIKey results: We found an 18:1 phenotypic female: male sex ratio in the higher elevation site (Wrightwood), and no sex expression at the low elevation site (Phelan). In contrast, based on genetic data we found a 2:1 female bias in the Wrightwood site and only females in the Phelan site. The area occupied by male and female genets was indistinguishable.\\nC_LIO_LIConclusions: These data suggest that both differential mortality and sexual dimorphism in thresholds for sex expression likely contribute to population genetic and phenotypic sex ratio biases, and that phenotypic sex expression alone fails to capture the extent of actual sex ratio bias present in natural populations of S. caninervis.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Identification of dynamic protein-protein interactions at the peptide level on a proteomic scale is a challenging approach that is still in its infancy. We have developed a system to cross-link cells directly in culture with the special lysine cross-linker bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl-glutarate (BAMG). We used the Gram positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis as an exemplar system. Within 5 min extensive intracellular cross-linking was detected, while intracellular cross-linking in a Gram-negative species, Escherichia coli, was still undetectable after 30 min, in agreement with the low permeability in this organism for lipophilic compounds like BAMG. We were able to identify 82 unique inter-protein cross-linked peptides with less than a 1% false discovery rate by mass spectrometry and genome-wide data base searching. Nearly 60% of the inter-protein cross-links occur in assemblies involved in transcription and translation. Several of these interactions are new, and we identified a binding site between the {delta} and {beta}' subunit of RNA polymerase close to the downstream DNA channel, providing a clue into how {delta} might regulate promoter selectivity and promote RNA polymerase recycling. Our methodology opens new avenues to investigate the functional dynamic organization of complex protein assemblies involved in bacterial growth.",

Despite progresses in super-resolution microscopy, discriminating and quantifying these processes is a challenge, requiring tracking of rapidly moving, sub-diffraction objects in a crowded, noisy environment. Here we use Differential Dynamic Microscopy with different contrast mechanisms to provide a thorough characterization of the dynamics in the Drosophila oocyte. We study the movement of vesicles and the elusive motion of a cytoplasmic F-actin mesh, a known regulator of cytoplasmic flows. We find that cytoplasmic motility constitutes a combination of directed motion and random diffusion. While advection is mainly attributed to microtubules, we find that active diffusion is driven by the actin cytoskeleton, although it is also enhanced by the flow. We also find that an important dynamic link exists between vesicles and cytoplasmic F-actin motion, as recently suggested in mouse oocytes.",

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) supports adaptive behaviour, but how ACC signals are translated into motivational signals remains unclear. Rats implanted in the ACC and ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic brain area implicated in motivation, were trained to run laps around a rectangular track for a fixed reward, where each lap varied in physical effort (a 30cm climbable barrier). Partial directed coherence analysis of local field potentials revealed that ACC theta (4-12 Hz) activity increased as rats entered the barrier-containing region of the maze on trials when the barrier was absent, and predicted similar changes in VTA theta. This did not occur on effortful, barrier-present trials. These data suggest that ACC provides a top-down modulating signal which can influence the motivation with which to pursue a reward, and which may be, in our task, a neural correlate of relief.",

    "abstract": "Selection is commonly described by assigning constant relative fitness values to genotypes. Yet population density is often regulated by crowding. Relative fitness may then depend on density, and selection can change density when it acts on a density-regulating trait. When strong density-dependent selection acts on a density-regulating trait, selection is no longer describable by density-independent relative fitnesses, even in demographically stable populations. These conditions are met in most previous models of density-dependent selection (e.g. \\\"K-selection\\\" in the logistic and Lotka-Volterra models), suggesting that density-independent relative fitnesses must be replaced with more ecologically explicit absolute fit-nesses unless selection is weak. Here we show that density-independent relative fitnesses can also accurately describe strong density-dependent selection under some conditions. We develop a novel model of density-regulated population growth with three ecologically intuitive traits: fecundity, mortality, and competitive ability. Our model, unlike the logistic or Lotka-Volterra, incorporates a density-dependent juvenile \\\"reproductive excess\\\", which largely decouples density-dependent selection from the regulation of density. We find that density-independent relative fitnesses accurately describe strong selection acting on any one trait, even fecundity, which is both density-regulating and subject to density-dependent selection. Pleiotropic interactions between these traits recovers the familiar K-selection behavior. In such cases, or when the population is maintained far from demographic equilibrium, our model offers a possible alternative to relative fitness.",

To probe the mechanism of these changes, we used molecular simulation approaches to identify the protonation state of Na+ and K+ coordinating residues in E1P and E2P conformations. Further analysis of these simulations revealed a novel molecular mechanism responsible for the change in protonation state: the conformation-dependent binding of an anion (a chloride ion in our simulations) to a previously unrecognized cytoplasmic site in the loop between transmembrane helices 8 and 9, which influences the electrostatic potential of the crucial Na+-coordinating residue D926. This mechanistic model is consistent with experimental observations and provides a molecular-level picture of how E1P to E2P enzyme conformational transitions are coupled to changes in ion binding stoichiometry and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial microcompartments are a class of proteinaceous organelles comprising a characteristic protein shell enclosing a set of enzymes. Compartmentalization can prevent escape of volatile or toxic intermediates, prevent off-pathway reactions, and create private cofactor pools. Encapsulation in synthetic microcompartment organelles will enhance the function of heterologous pathways, but to do so, it is critical to understand how to control diffusion in and out of the microcompartment organelle. To this end, we explored how small differences in the shell protein structure result in changes in the diffusion of metabolites through the shell. We found that the ethanolamine utilization (Eut) protein EutM properly incorporates into the 1,2-propanediol utilization (Pdu) microcompartment, altering native metabolite accumulation and the resulting growth on 1,2-propanediol as the sole carbon source. Further, we identified a single pore-lining residue mutation that confers the same phenotype as substitution of the full EutM protein, indicating that small molecule diffusion through the shell is the cause of growth enhancement. Finally, we show that the hydropathy index and charge of pore amino acids are important indicators to predict how pore mutations will affect growth on 1,2- propanediol, likely by controlling diffusion of one or more metabolites. This study highlights the success of two strategies to engineer microcompartment control over metabolite transport: altering the existing shell protein pore via mutation of the pore-lining residues, and generating chimeras using shell proteins with the desired pores.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=99 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/106716_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f69a12org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd5560org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f01d6aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b442c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TOC Abstract Graphic C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Recent research shows that the covariance structure of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data - commonly described as functional connectivity - can change as a function of the participants cognitive state (for review see [35]). Here we present a Bayesian hierarchical matrix factorization model, termed hierarchical topographic factor analysis (HTFA), for efficiently discovering full-brain networks in large multi-subject neuroimaging datasets. HTFA approximates each subjects network by first re-representing each brain image in terms of the activities of a set of localized nodes, and then computing the covariance of the activity time series of these nodes. The number of nodes, along with their locations, sizes, and activities (over time) are learned from the data. Because the number of nodes is typically substantially smaller than the number of fMRI voxels, HTFA can be orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional voxel-based functional connectivity approaches. In one case study, we show that HTFA recovers the known connectivity patterns underlying a collection of synthetic datasets. In a second case study, we illustrate how HTFA may be used to discover dynamic full-brain activity and connectivity patterns in real fMRI data, collected as participants listened to a story. In a third case study, we carried out a similar series of analyses on fMRI data collected as participants viewed an episode of a television show. In these latter case studies, we found that the HTFA-derived activity and connectivity patterns can be used to reliably decode which moments in the story or show the participants were experiencing. Further, we found that these two classes of patterns contained partially non-overlapping information, such that decoders trained on combinations of activity-based and dynamic connectivity-based features performed better than decoders trained on activity or connectivity patterns alone. We replicated this latter result with two additional (previously developed) methods for efficiently characterizing full-brain activity and connectivity patterns.",

    "abstract": "The strictly anaerobic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum is well known for its ability to convert sugars into organic acids and solvents, most notably the potential biofuel butanol. However, the regulation of its fermentation metabolism, in particular the shift from acid to solvent production, remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cell-cell communication plays a role in controlling the timing of this shift or the extent of solvent formation. Analysis of the available C. acetobutylicum genome sequences revealed the presence of eight putative RNPP-type quorum sensing systems, here designated qssA to qssH, each consisting of RNPP-type regulator gene followed by a small open reading frame encoding a putative signalling peptide precursor. The identified regulator and signal peptide precursor genes were designated qsrA to qsrH and qspA to qspH, respectively. Triplicate regulator mutants were generated in strain ATCC 824 for each of the eight systems and screened for phenotypic changes. The qsrB mutants showed increased solvent formation during early solventogenesis and hence the QssB system was selected for further characterisation. Overexpression of qsrB severely reduced solvent and endospore formation and this effect could be overcome by adding short synthetic peptides to the culture medium representing a specific region of the QspB signalling peptide precursor. In addition, overexpression of qspB increased the production of acetone and butanol and the initial (48-hour) titre of heat-resistant endospores. Together, these findings establish a role for QssB quorum sensing in the regulation of early solventogenesis and sporulation in C. acetobutylicum.",

The accuracy and precision of cell membrane capacitance measurement is limited by the measuring system, which distorts membrane current responses used for analysis of impedance parameters. We developed a practical deconvolution procedure for reconstruction of the time course of membrane current and applied it to current responses recorded at step voltage changes by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. In contrast to the recorded current responses, the reconstructed current responses could be exactly described by adequate impedance models of the recorded circuit. Deconvolution of membrane currents improved the performance of the square-wave method of high-resolution membrane capacitance recording by providing higher accuracy in a wider range of cell sizes and by eliminating cross-talk errors in parameter estimates. This allowed resolving instabilities in the recording conditions arising from parasitic capacitance and seal resistance variation. Complex tests on hardware models, on simulated data sets, and on living cells confirmed reliability of the deconvolution method for membrane capacitance recording. The aptitude of the method was demonstrated in isolated cardiac myocytes by recording spontaneous vesicular events, by discerning formation of a fusion pore, and by revealing artefacts due to unstable seal resistance.",

    "abstract": "The brain is a large-scale complex network whose workings rely on the interaction between its various regions. In the past few years, the organization of the human brain network has been studied extensively using concepts from graph theory, where the brain is represented as a set of nodes connected by edges. This representation of the brain as a connectome can be used to assess important measures that reflect its topological architecture. We have developed a freeware MatLab-based software (BRAPH - BRain Analysis using graPH theory) for connectivity analysis of brain networks derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. BRAPH allows building connectivity matrices, calculating global and local network measures, performing non-parametric permutations for group comparisons, assessing the modules in the network, and comparing the results to random networks. By contrast to other toolboxes, it allows performing longitudinal comparisons of the same patients across different points in time. Furthermore, even though a user-friendly interface is provided, the architecture of the program is modular (object-oriented) so that it can be easily expanded and customized. To demonstrate the abilities of BRAPH, we performed structural and functional graph theory analyses in two separate studies. In the first study, using MRI data, we assessed the differences in global and nodal network topology in healthy controls, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimers disease. In the second study, using resting-state fMRI data, we compared healthy controls and Parkinsons patients with mild cognitive impairment.",

First, the participant played two piano pieces on an electronic piano with the sound volume of the digital keyboard on. Second, the participant replayed the same piano pieces, but without auditory feedback, and the participant was asked to imagine hearing the music in his mind. In both conditions, the sound output of the keyboard was recorded, thus allowing precise time-locking between the neural activity and the spectrotemporal content of the music imagery. For both conditions, we built encoding models to predict high gamma neural activity (70-150Hz) from the spectrogram representation of the recorded sound. We found robust similarities between perception and imagery - in frequency and temporal tuning properties in auditory areas.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Trends in carriage were assessed using iterative sequential regression. A subset of mcr-1-positive isolates was sequenced (Illumina), and genetic contexts of mcr-1 were characterised.\\n\\nResultsWe observed marked increases in mcr-1 (now ~30% prevalence) and more recent (since January 2014) increases in mcr-1-positive/third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae human colonisation (p<0.001). Sub-cultured mcr-1-positive/third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates were commonly multi-drug resistant.\\n\\nWGS of 50 mcr-1/third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates (49 Escherichia coli; 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae) demonstrated bacterial strain diversity (39 E. coli sequence types); mcr-1 in association with common plasmid backbones (IncI, IncHI2/HI2A, IncX4) and sometimes in multiple plasmids; frequent mcr-1 chromosomal integration; and loss of the mcr-1-associated insertion sequence ISApl1 in some plasmids. Significant sequence similarity with published mcr-1 plasmid sequences was consistent with spread amongst pig, chicken and human reservoirs.\\n\\nConclusionsThe high positivity rate (~10%) of mcr-1 in multidrug-resistant E. coli colonising humans is a clinical threat; the diverse genetic mechanisms (strains/plasmids/insertion sequences) associated with mcr-1 have likely contributed to its dissemination, and will facilitate its persistence.",

Key computational operations, including pattern recognition, event prediction, and plasticity, involve neural discrimination of spatio-temporal sequences. Here we show that synaptically-driven reaction-diffusion pathways on dendrites can perform sequence discrimination on behaviorally relevant time-scales. We used abstract signaling models to show that this selectivity arises when inputs at successive locations are aligned with, and amplified by, propagating chemical waves triggered by previous inputs. We incorporated biological detail using sequential synaptic input onto spines in morphologically, electrically, and chemically detailed pyramidal neuronal models. Again, sequences were recognized, and local channel modulation on the length-scale of sequence input could elicit changes in neuronal firing. We predict that dendritic sequence-recognition zones occupy 5 to 20 microns and recognize time-intervals of 0.2 to 5s. We suggest that this mechanism provides highly parallel and selective neural computation in a functionally important time range.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary studies of genes that have been functionally characterized and whose variation has been associated with pathological conditions represent an opportunity to understand the genetic basis of pathologies. 2-adrenoreceptors (ADRA2) are a class of G protein-coupled receptors that regulate several physiological processes including blood pressure, platelet aggregation, insulin secretion, lipolysis, and neurotransmitter release. This gene family has been extensively studied from a molecular/physiological perspective, yet much less is known about its evolutionary history. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to investigate the evolutionary history of 2-adrenoreceptors (ADRA2) in vertebrates. Our results show that in addition to the three well-recognized 2-adrenoreceptor genes (ADRA2A, ADRA2B and ADRA2C), we recovered a clade that corresponds to the fourth member of the 2-adrenoreceptor gene family (ADRA2D). We also recovered a clade that possesses two ADRA2 sequences found in two lamprey species. Furthermore, our results show that mammals and crocodiles are characterized by possessing three 2-adrenoreceptor genes, whereas all other vertebrate groups possess the full repertoire of 2-adrenoreceptor genes. Among vertebrates ADRA2D seems to be a dispensable gene, as it was lost two independent times during the evolutionary history of the group. Additionally, we found that most examined species possess the most common alleles described for humans; however, there are cases in which non-human mammals possess the alternative variant.",

    "abstract": "Pedigrees contain information about the genealogical relationships among individuals and are of fundamental importance in many areas of genetic studies. However, pedigrees are often unknown and must be inferred from genetic data. Despite the importance of pedigree inference, existing methods are limited to inferring only close relationships or analyzing a small number of individuals or loci. We present a simulated annealing method for estimating pedigrees in large samples of otherwise seemingly unrelated individuals using genome-wide SNP data. The method supports complex pedigree structures such as polygamous families, multi-generational families, and pedigrees in which many of the member individuals are missing. Computational speed is greatly enhanced by the use of a composite likelihood function which approximates the full likelihood. We validate our method on simulated data and show that it can infer distant relatives more accurately than existing methods. Furthermore, we illustrate the utility of the method on a sample of Greenlandic Inuit.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPedigrees contain information about the genealogical relationships among individuals. This information can be used in many areas of genetic studies such as disease association studies, conservation efforts, and learning about the demographic history and social structure of a population. Despite their importance, pedigrees are often unknown and must be estimated from genetic information. However, pedigree inference remains a difficult problem due to the high cost of likelihood computation and the enormous number of possible pedigrees we must consider. These difficulties limit existing methods in their ability to infer pedigrees when the sample size or the number of markers is large, or when the sample contains only distant relatives. In this report, we present a method that circumvents these computational barriers in order to infer pedigrees of complex structure for a large number of individuals. From our simulation studies, we found that our method can infer distant relatives much more accurately than existing methods. Our ability to infer pedigrees with a greater accuracy opens up possibilities for developing or improving pedigree-based methods in many areas research such as linkage analysis, demographic inference, association studies, and conservation.",

    "abstract": "Within a rational framework a decision-maker selects actions based on the reward-maximisation principle which stipulates they acquire outcomes with the highest values at the lowest cost. Action selection can be divided into two dimensions: selecting an action from several alternatives, and choosing its vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. Both of these dimensions depend on the values of the outcomes, and these values are often affected as more outcomes are consumed, and so are the actions. Despite this, previous works have addressed the computational substrates of optimal actions only in the specific condition that the values of outcomes are constant, and it is still unknown what the optimal actions are when the values of outcomes are non-stationary. Here, based on an optimal control framework, we derive a computational model for optimal actions under non-stationary outcome values. The results imply that even when the values of outcomes are changing, the optimal response rate is constant rather than decreasing. This finding shows that, in contrast to previous theories, the commonly observed changes in the actions cannot be purely attributed to the changes in the outcome values. We then prove that this observation can be explained based on the uncertainty about temporal horizons; e.g., in the case of experimental protocols, the session duration. We further show that when multiple outcomes are available, the model explains probability matching as well as maximisation choice strategies. The model provides, therefore, a quantitative analysis of optimal actions and explicit predictions for future testing.",

    "abstract": "Resistance genes are a major tool for managing crop diseases. The crop breeder networks that exchange resistance genes and deploy them in elite varieties help to determine the global landscape of resistance and epidemics, and comprise an important system for maintaining food security. These networks function as complex adaptive systems, with associated strengths and vulnerabilities, and implications for policies to support resistance gene deployment strategies. Extensions of epidemic network analysis can be used to evaluate the multilayer agricultural networks that support and influence crop breeding networks. We evaluate the general structure of crop breeding networks for cassava, potato, rice, and wheat, which illustrate a range of public and private configurations. These systems must adapt to global change in climate and land use, the emergence of new diseases, and disruptive breeding technologies. Principles for maintaining system resilience can be applied to global resistance gene deployment. For example, both diversity and redundancy in the roles played by individual crop breeding groups (public versus private, global versus local) may support societal goals for crop production. Another principle is management of connectivity, where enhanced connectivity among crop breeders may benefit global resistance gene deployment, but increase risks to the durability of resistance genes without effective policies regarding deployment.",

Using data from Mendelian disease-gene discovery projects, we show that ALoFT can distinguish between LoF variants deleterious as heterozygotes and those causing disease only in the homozygous state. Investigation of variants discovered in healthy populations suggests that each individual carries at least two heterozygous premature stop alleles that could potentially lead to disease if present as homozygotes. When applied to de novo pLoF variants in autism-affected families, ALoFT distinguishes between deleterious variants in patients and benign variants in unaffected siblings. Finally, analysis of somatic variants in > 6,500 cancer exomes shows that pLoF variants predicted to be deleterious by ALoFT are enriched in known driver genes.",

Here, we propose to extend this approach to estimating the structure of transmission networks of viruses in human populations. In particular, we are interested in estimating the transmission parameters under four very general network structures: random, Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert and an extension that incorporates aging. Estimation was evaluated under three approaches, based on ABC, ABC-Markov chain Monte Carlo (ABC-MCMC) and ABC-Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) samplers. We show that ABC-SMC samplers outperform both ABC and ABC-MCMC, achieving high accuracy and low variance in simulations. This approach paves the way to estimating parameters of real transmission networks of transmissible diseases.",

Here, we present the WormBase Enrichment Suite, which offers users the ability to test all nematode ontologies simultaneously. We show that the WormBase Enrichment Suite provides valuable insight into different biological problems. Briefly, we show that phenotype enrichment analysis (PEA) can help researchers identify disease phenologs, phenotypes that are homologous across species, which can inform disease modeling in C. elegans. The WormBase Enrichment Suite analysis can also shed light on RNA-seq datasets by showing what molecular functions are enriched, which phenotypes these functions are implicated in and what tissues are overrepresented in the dataset. Finally, we explore the phenotype-anatomy relationship, showing that a small subset of highly specific tissues are disproportionately likely to cause an Egl phenotype, but inferring tissue expression from an Egl phenotype is limited to the largest tissues.",

Therefore, in this study, we sampled biofilms from sea floor stones around Hisanohama Port, which is less than 30 km south of the accident site, and then analyzed the microbial community structure and element profiles, including those of radioactive elements, of these biofilms in order to determine the accumulation and retention of radioactive elements in them. Our results showed that the biofilm samples contained relatively high levels of radioactive cesium even when the sampling was performed 8-11 months after the accident. Our results also suggested that the structure of the biofilm organismal community is related to the element profile of radioactive cesium.

    "abstract": "Cerebellar volume abnormalities have been often suggested as a possible endophenotype for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We aimed at objectifying this possible alteration by performing a systematic meta-analysis of the literature, and an analysis of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) cohort. Our meta-analysis sought to determine a combined effect size of ASD diagnosis on different measures of the cerebellar anatomy, as well as the effect of possible factors of variability across studies. We then analysed the cerebellar volume of 328 patients and 353 controls from the ABIDE project. The meta-analysis of the literature suggested a weak but significant association between ASD diagnosis and increased cerebellar volume (p=0.049, uncorrected), but the analysis of ABIDE did not show any relationship. The studies in the literature were generally underpowered, however, the number of statistically significant findings was larger than expected. Although we could not provide a conclusive explanation for this excess of significant findings, our analyses would suggest publication bias as a possible reason. Finally, age, sex and IQ were important sources of cerebellar volume variability, however, independent of autism diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Despite the variety, prominence, and adaptive significance of butterfly wing patterns surprisingly little known about the genetic basis of wing color diversity. Even though there is intense interest in wing pattern evolution and development, the technical challenge of genetically manipulating butterflies has slowed efforts to functionally characterize color pattern development genes. To identify candidate wing pigmentation genes we used RNA-seq to characterize transcription across multiple stages of butterfly wing development, and between different color pattern elements, in the painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui. This allowed us to pinpoint genes specifically associated with red and black pigment patterns. To test the functions of a subset of genes associated with presumptive melanin pigmentation we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in four different butterfly genera. pale, Ddc, and yellow knockouts displayed reduction of melanin pigmentation, consistent with previous findings in other insects. Interestingly, however, yellow-d, ebony, and black knockouts revealed that these genes have localized effects on tuning the color of red, brown, and ochre pattern elements. These results point to previously undescribed mechanisms for modulating the color of specific wing pattern elements in butterflies, and provide an expanded portrait of the insect melanin pathway.",

Here we show that cohesion in postnatal mouse oocytes is regulated by Tex19.1. We show that Tex19.1-/- oocytes have defects in the maintenance of chiasmata, mis-segregate their chromosomes during meiosis, and transmit aneuploidies to the next generation. By reconstituting aspects of this pathway in mitotic somatic cells, we show that Tex19.1 regulates an acetylated SMC3-marked subpopulation of cohesin by inhibiting the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2 towards specific substrates, and that UBR2 itself has a previously undescribed role in negatively regulating acetylated SMC3. Lastly, we show that acetylated SMC3 is associated with meiotic chromosome axes in oocytes, but that this is reduced in the absence of Tex19.1. These findings indicate that Tex19.1 maintains acetylated SMC3 and sister chromatid cohesion in postnatal oocytes, and prevents aneuploidy in the female germline.",

Proper invasion of trophoblast cells into the maternal decidua is required for a successful pregnancy.

Here, we found that the overall birth rate of the MARVELD1 knockout mouse is much lower than that of the wild-type mouse (P<0.001). In E18.5 MARVELD1 knockout mice, we observed an over-invasion of trophoblast cells, and indeed, the pregnant mice had a partial placenta accreta phenotype. The HTR8/SVneo cell line was used as an in vitro model to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MARVELD1-mediated trophoblast invasion. We detected a diminished expression of integrin {beta}4 upon the downregulation of MARVELD1 and enhanced migration and invasive abilities of trophoblast cells both in vivo and in vitro. The integrin {beta}4 rescue assay also supported the results. In conclusion, this study found that MARVELD1 mediated the invasion of trophoblast cells via regulating the expression of integrin {beta}4.",

The mechanistic underpinnings of this approach remain enignmatic, however. Using quantitative proteomics and RNA sequencing, we explore the molecular basis of attenuation in a strain of bacteriophage T7 whose major capsid gene was engineered to carry 182 suboptimal codons. As expected, there was no evident effect of the recoding on transcription. Proteomic observations revealed that translation is halved for the recoded major capsid gene, and a smaller reduction applies to a few genes downstream, potentially caused by translational coupling. Viral burst size is also approximately halved, and the fitness drop accompanying attenuation is compatible with the reduced burst size. Overall, the fitness effect and molecular basis of attenuation by codon deoptimization are compatible with a relatively simple model of reduced translation of a few genes and a consequent diminished virion assembly. This mechanism is simpler than that operating in eukaryotic viruses.",

    "abstract": "Competitive gene-set analysis, also called enrichment analysis, is a widely used tool for functional interpretation of high-throughput biological data such as gene expression data. It aims at testing a known category (e.g. a pathway) of genes for enriched differential expression (DE) signals compared to genes not in the category. Most enrichment testing methods ignore the widespread correlations among genes, which has been shown to result in excessive false positives. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that existing methods to account for correlations, such as GSEA and CAMERA, can result in severely mis-calibrated type 1 error and/or considerable power loss due to the failure to properly accommodate the DE heterogeneity across genes. We propose MEACA, a new gene-set testing framework based on a mixed effects model. Our method flexibly incorporates the unknown distribution of DE effects, effectively adjusts for completely unknown, unstructured correlations among genes, and does not rely on time-consuming permutations. Compared to existing methods, MEACA enjoys robust type 1 error control in widely ranging scenarios and substantially improves power. Applications of MEACA to a Huntingtons disease study and a lymphoblastoid cell line data set demonstrate its ability to recover biologically meaningful relationships.

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen major investment in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), with the goal of identifying and motivating research on novel genes involved in complex human disease. To assess whether this goal is being met, we quantified the effect of GWAS on the overall distribution of biomedical research publications and on the subsequent publication history of genes newly associated with complex disease. We found that the historical skew of publications toward genes involved in Mendelian disease has not changed since the advent of GWAS. Genes newly implicated by GWAS in complex disease do experience additional publications compared to control genes, and they are more likely to become exceptionally studied. But the magnitude of both effects has declined dramatically over the past decade. Our results suggest that reforms to encourage follow-up studies may be needed for GWAS to most successfully guide biomedical research toward the molecular mechanisms underlying complex human disease.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOver the past decade, thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to link genetic variation with complex human disease. A major goal of such studies is to identify novel disease genes, so they can be further studied. We tested whether this goal is being met, by studying patterns of scientific research publications on human genes. We found that publications are still concentrated on genes involved in simple Mendelian disease, even after the advent of GWAS. Compared to other genes, disease genes discovered by GWAS do experience additional publications, but that effect has declined dramatically since GWAS were first performed. Our results suggest that the ability of GWAS to stimulate research into novel disease genes is declining. To realize the full potential of GWAS to reveal the molecular mechanisms driving human disease, this decline and the reasons for it must be understood, so that it can be reversed.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding results from the mating of related individuals and has negative consequence because it brings together deleterious variants in one individual. Inbreeding is associated with recessive diseases and reduced production or fitness. In general, inbreeding is estimated with respect to a base population that needs to be defined. Ancestors in generations anterior to the base population are considered unrelated. We herein propose a model that estimates inbreeding relative to multiple age-based classes. Each inbreeding distribution is associated to a different time in the past: recent inbreeding generating longer homozygous stretches than more ancient. Our model is a mixture of exponential distribution implemented in a hidden Markov model framework that uses marker allele frequencies, genetic distances, genotyping error rates and the sequences of observed genotypes. Based on simulations studies, we show that the inbreeding coefficients and the age of inbreeding are correctly estimated. Mean absolute errors of estimators are low, the efficiency depending on the available information. When several inbreeding classes are simulated, the model captures them if their ages are sufficiently different. Genotyping errors or low-fold sequencing data are easily accommodated in the hidden Markov model framework. Application to real data sets illustrate that the method can reveal recent different demographic histories among populations, some of them presenting very recent bottlenecks or founder effects. The method also clearly identifies individuals resulting from extreme consanguineous matings.",

In asexual populations, the identification of beneficial alleles is confounded by the presence of genetically-linked hitchhiker mutations. Parallel evolution experiments enable the recognition of common targets of selection, yet these targets are inherently enriched for genes of large target size and mutations of large effect. A comprehensive study of individual mutations is necessary to create a realistic picture of the evolutionarily significant spectrum of beneficial mutations. Here we utilize a bulk-segregant approach to identify the beneficial mutations across 11 lineages of experimentally-evolved yeast populations. We report that most genome sequence evolution is non-adaptive: nearly 80% of detected mutations have no discernable effects on fitness and less than 1% are deleterious. We determine the distribution of driver and hitchhiker mutations in 31 mutational cohorts, groups of up to ten mutations that arise synchronously from low frequency and track tightly with one another. Surprisingly, we find that one-third of cohorts lack identifiable driver mutations. In addition, we identify intra-cohort synergistic epistasis between mutations in hsl7 and kel1, which arose together in a low frequency lineage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSerologicalantibody levels are a sensitive marker of pathogen exposure, and advances in multiplex assays have created enormous potential for large-scale, integrated infectious disease surveillance. Most methods to analyze antibody measurements reduce quantitative antibody levels to seropositive and seronegative groups, but this can be difficult for many pathogens and may provide lower resolution information than quantitative levels in low transmission settings. Analysis methods have predominantly maintained a single disease focus, yet integrated surveillance platforms would benefit from methodologies that work across diverse pathogens included in multiplex assays.\\n\\nMethods/Principal FindingsWe developed an approach to measure changes in transmission from quantitative antibody levels that can be applied to diverse pathogens of global importance. We compared age-dependent immunoglobulin G curves in repeated cross-sectional surveys between populations with differences in transmission for multiple pathogens, including: lymphatic filariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti) measured before and after mass drug administration on Mauke, Cook Islands, malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) before and after a combined insecticide and mass drug administration intervention in the Garki project, Nigeria, and enteric protozoans (Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica), bacteria (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.), and viruses (norovirus groups I and II) in children living in Haiti and the USA. Age-dependent antibody curves fit with ensemble machine learning followed a characteristic shape across pathogens that aligned with predictions from basic mechanisms of humoral immunity. Differences in pathogen transmission led to shifts in fitted antibody curves that were remarkably consistent across pathogens, assays, and populations. Mean antibody levels correlated strongly with traditional measures of transmission intensity, such as the entomological inoculation rate for P. falciparum (Spearmans rho=0.75). Seroprevalence estimates recapitulated patterns observed in quantitative antibody levels, albeit with lower resolution.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceAge-dependent antibody curves and summary means provided a robust and sensitive measure of changes in transmission, with greatest sensitivity among young children. The method generalizes to pathogens that can be measured in high-throughput, multiplex serological assays, and scales to surveillance activities that require high spatiotemporal resolution. The approach represents a new opportunity to conduct integrated serological surveillance for neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and other infectious diseases with well-defined antigen targets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGlobal elimination strategies for infectious diseases like neglected tropical diseases and malaria rely on accurate estimates of pathogen transmission to target and evaluate control programs. Circulating antibody levels can be a sensitive measure of recent pathogen exposure, but no broadly applicable method exists to measure changes in transmission directly from quantitative antibody levels. We developed a novel method that applies recent advances in machine learning and data science to flexibly fit age-dependent antibody curves. Shifts in age-dependent antibody curves provided remarkably consistent, sensitive measures of transmission changes when evaluated across many globally important pathogens (filarial worms, malaria, enteric infections). The methods generality and performance in diverse applications demonstrate its broad potential for integrated serological surveillance of infectious diseases.",

However, without the enrichment of mitochondria, roughly 99 % of all sequencing reads are of non-mitochondrial origin and mostly useless for common applications, e.g. species identification.\\n\\nHere, we present a simple centrifugation protocol that leads to an average 140-fold enrichment of mitochondrial DNA. By sequencing six  mock- communities - comprising the freshwater taxa Corbicula fluminea, Gammarus roeselii and Hydropsyche exocellata each - we recovered whole mitochondrial genomes of these species and the acanthocephalan endoparasite Pomphorhynchus laevis.\\n\\nThe presented protocol will greatly speed up building reference libraries for whole mitochondrial genomes, as dozens of species could be sequenced on a single MiSeq run. Subsequently, it will also allow biodiversity assessments using mitogenomics at greatly reduced costs in comparison to mitogenomic approaches without prior enrichment for mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable new and exciting insights that are fundamental to understanding the basis of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (Escherichia coli and Thermotoga maritima) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed E. coli ME-model called iJL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives virtually identical solutions to previous E. coli ME-models while using [1/4] the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be reconstructed and edited most efficiently using the software.",

    "abstract": "1Codon usage bias (CUB), where certain codons are used more frequently than expected by chance, is a ubiquitous phenomenon and occurs across the tree of life. The dominant paradigm is that the proportion of preferred codons is set by weak selection. While experimental changes in codon usage have at times shown large phenotypic effects in contrast to this paradigm, genome-wide population genetic estimates have supported the weak selection model. Here we use deep genomic sequencing of two Drosophila melanogaster populations to measure selection on synonymous sites in a way that allowed us to estimate the prevalence of both weak and strong selection. We find that selection in favor of preferred codons ranges from weak (|Nes| [~] 1) to strong (|Nes| > 10). While previous studies indicated that selection at synonymous sites could be strong, this is the first study to detect and quantify strong selection specifically at the level of CUB. We suggest that the level of CUB in the genome is determined by the proportion of synonymous sites under no, weak, and strong selection. This model challenges the standard Li-Bulmer model and explains some of the longest-standing puzzles in the field.",
