    "abstract": "The more than 1.5 billion people who live in South Asia are correctly viewed not as a single large population, but as many small endogamous groups. We assembled genome-wide data from over 2,800 individuals from over 260 distinct South Asian groups. We identify 81 unique groups, of which 14 have estimated census sizes of more than a million, that descend from founder events more extreme than those in Ashkenazi Jews and Finns, both of which have high rates of recessive disease due to founder events. We identify multiple examples of recessive diseases in South Asia that are the result of such founder events. This study highlights an under-appreciated opportunity for reducing disease burden among South Asians through the discovery of and testing for recessive disease genes.",

    "abstract": "The fate of H2O2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been inferred indirectly from the activity of ER localized thiol oxidases and peroxiredoxins, in vitro, and the consequences of their genetic manipulation, in vivo. Here we report on the development of TriPer, a vital optical probe sensitive to changes in the concentration of H2O2 in the thiol-oxidizing environment of the ER. Consistent with the hypothesized contribution of oxidative protein folding to H2O2 production, ER-localized TriPer detected an increase in the luminal H2O2 signal upon induction of pro-insulin (a disulfide bonded protein of pancreatic {beta}-cells), which was attenuated by the ectopic expression of catalase in the ER lumen. Interfering with glutathione production in the cytosol by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or enhancing its localized destruction by expression of the glutathione-degrading enzyme ChaC1 in lumen of the ER, enhanced further the luminal H2O2 signal and eroded {beta}-cell viability. Tracking ER H2O2 in live cells points to an unanticipated role for glutathione in H2O2 turnover.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe presence of millimolar glutathione in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum has been difficult to understand purely in terms of modulation of protein-based disulphide bond formation in secreted proteins. Over the years hints have suggested that glutathione might have a role in reducing the heavy burden of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by the luminal enzymatic machinery for disulphide bond formation. However, limitations in existing in vivo H2O2 probes have rendered them all but useless in the thiol-oxidizing ER, precluding experimental follow-up of glutathiones role ER H2O2 metabolism.\\n\\nHere we report on the development and mechanistic characterization of an optical probe, TriPer that circumvents the limitations of previous sensors by retaining specific responsiveness to H2O2 in thiol-oxidizing environments. Application of this tool to the ER of an insulin-producing pancreatic b-cells model system revealed that ER glutathione antagonizes locally-produced H2O2 resulting from the oxidative folding of pro-insulin.\\n\\nThis study presents an interdisciplinary effort intersecting cell biology and chemistry: An original redox chemistry concept leading to development of a biological tool, broadly applicable for in vivo studies of H2O2 metabolism in the ER. More broadly, the concept developed here sets a precedent for applying a tri-cysteine relay system to discrimination between various oxidative reactants, in complex redox milieux.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAt present Docker technology has received increasing level of attention throughout the bioinformatics community. However, its implementation details have not yet been mastered by most biologists and applied widely in biological researches. In order to popularizing this technology in the bioinformatics and sufficiently use plenty of public resources of bioinformatics tools (Dockerfile and image of scommunity, officially and privately) in Docker Hub Registry and other Docker sources based on Docker, we introduced full and accurate instance of a bioinformatics workflow based on Docker to analyse and visualize pan-genome and biosynthetic gene clusters of a bacteria in this article, provided the solutions for mining bioinformatics big data from various public biology databases. You could be guided step-by-step through the workflow process from docker file to build up your own images and run an container fast creating an workflow.\\n\\nResultsWe presented a BGDMdocker (bacterial genome data mining docker-based) workflow based on docker. The workflow consists of three integrated toolkits, Prokka v1.11, panX, and antiSMASH3.0. The dependencies were all written in Dockerfile, to build docker image and run container for analysing pan-genome of total 44 Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains, which were retrieved from public? database. The pan-genome totally includes 172,432 gene, 2,306 Core gene cluster. The visualized pan-genomic data such as alignment, phylogenetic trees, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree, infers loss and gain of genes on the core-genome phylogeny for each gene cluster were presented. Besides, 997 known (MIBiG database) and 553 unknown (antiSMASH-predicted clusters and Pfam database) genes of biosynthesis gene clusters types and orthologous groups were mined in all strains. This workflow could also be used for other species pan-genome analysis and visualization. The display of visual data can completely duplicated as well as done in this paper. All result data and relevant tools and files can be downloaded from our website with no need to register. The pan-genome and biosynthetic gene clusters analysis and visualization can be fully reusable immediately in different computing platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac and deployed in the cloud), achieved cross platform deployment flexibility, rapid development integrated software package.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationBGDMdocker is available at http://42.96.173.25/bapgd/ and the source code under GPL license is available at https://github.com/cgwyx/debian_prokka_panx_antismash_biodocker.\\n\\nContactchenggongwyx@foxmail.com\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at biorxiv online.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe most commonly used effect size when using meta-analysis to compare a measurement of interest in two different populations is the standardised mean difference. This is the mean difference of the measurement divided by the pooled standard deviation in the two groups. The standard deviation is usually supposed to be the same for both groups, although this assumption is often made without any particular evidence. It is possible, however, that the difference of the measurement in the two populations resides precisely in their standard deviations. This could be the case, for example, if a population of patients exhibited more \\\"abnormal\\\" values than a control population - both large and small - even if the mean values were the same. Fishers test of equality of variance is designed to compare standard deviations. A variance ratio is a Fishers ratio and Fisher distribution can be used to give confidence intervals to the estimate for one study. However, confidence interval for one study can be very wide if the study does not contain enough subjects. Here we present an approach to combine variance ratios of different studies in a meta-analytic way which produces more robust estimates under these circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many risk loci for complex traits and common diseases, most of the identified associations reside in noncoding regions and have unknown biological functions. Recent genomic sequencing studies have produced a rich resource of annotations that help characterize the function of genetic variants. Integrative analysis that incorporates these functional annotations into GWAS can help elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the identified associations and help prioritize causal-variants. Here, we develop a novel, flexible Bayesian variable selection model with efficient computational techniques for such integrative analysis. Different from previous approaches, our method models the effect-size distribution and probability of causality for variants with different annotations and jointly models genome-wide variants to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD), thus prioritizing associations based on the quantification of the annotations and allowing for multiple causal-variants per locus. Our efficient computational algorithm dramatically improves both computational speed and posterior sampling convergence by taking advantage of the block-wise LD structures of human genomes. With simulations, we show that our method accurately quantifies the functional enrichment and performs more powerful for identifying true causal-variants than several competing methods. The power gain brought up by our method is especially apparent in cases when multiple causal-variants in LD reside in the same locus. We also apply our method for an in-depth GWAS of age-related macular degeneration with 33,976 individuals and 9,857,286 variants. We find the strongest enrichment for causality among non-synonymous variants (54x more likely to be causal, 1.4x larger effect-sizes) and variants in active promoter (7.8x more likely, 1.4x larger effect-sizes), as well as identify 5 potentially novel loci in addition to the 32 known AMD risk loci. In conclusion, our method is shown to efficiently integrate functional information in GWASs, helping identify causal variants and underlying biology.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical model to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and multiple functional annotations in GWAS, paired with an expectation-maximization Markov chain Monte Carlo (EM-MCMC) computational algorithm to jointly analyze genome-wide variants. Our method improves the MCMC convergence property to ensure accurate Bayesian inference of the quantifications of the functional enrichment pattern and fine-mapped association results. By applying our method to the real GWAS of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with various functional annotations (i.e., gene-based, regulatory, and chromatin states), we find that the variants of non-synonymous, coding, and active promoter annotations have the highest causal probability and the largest effect-sizes. In addition, our method produces fine-mapped association results in the identified risk loci, two of which are shown as examples (C2/CFB/SKIV2L and C3) with justifications by haplotype analysis, model comparison, and conditional analysis. Therefore, we believe our integrative method will be useful for quantifying the enrichment pattern of functional annotations in GWAS, and then prioritizing associations with respect to the learned functional enrichment pattern.",

    "abstract": "Myelin around axons is currently widely studied by structural analyses and large scale imaging techniques, with the goal to decipher its critical role in neuronal protection. While there is strong evidence that in myelin, lipid composition and lipid membrane morphology are affected during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, there is no quantitative method yet to report its ultrastructure in tissues at both molecular and macroscopic levels, in conditions potentially compatible with in vivo observations. In this work, we study and quantify molecular order of lipids in myelin at sub-diffraction scales, using label-free polarization resolved Coherent Anti Stokes Raman (PR-CARS), which exploits CARS sensitivity to coupling between light polarization and oriented molecular vibrational bonds. Importantly, the method does not use any a priori parameters in the sample such as lipid type, orientational organization and composition. We show that lipid molecular order of myelin in the mouse spinal cord is significantly reduced throughout the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, even in myelin regions that appear morphologically unaffected. This technique permits to unravel molecular-scale perturbations of lipid layers at early stage of the demyelination progression, while the membrane architecture at the mesoscopic scale (here about 100 nm) seems much less affected. Such information cannot be brought by pure morphological observation and opens new prospectives towards molecular-scale understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "New architectures of multilayer artificial neural networks and new methods for training them are rapidly revolutionizing the application of machine learning in diverse fields, including business, social science, physical sciences, and biology. Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Domestication research has largely focused on identification of morphological and genetic differences between extant populations of crops and their wild relatives. Little attention has been paid to the potential effects of environment despite substantial known changes in climate from the time of domestication to modern day. Recent research, in which maize and teosinte (i.e., wild maize) were exposed to environments similar to the time of domestication, resulted in a plastic induction of domesticated phenotypes in teosinte and little response to environment in maize. These results suggest that early agriculturalists may have selected for genetic mechanisms that cemented domestication phenotypes initially induced by a plastic response of teosinte to environment, a process known as genetic assimilation. To better understand this phenomenon and the potential role of environment in maize domestication, we examined differential gene expression in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) between past and present conditions. We identified a gene set of over 2000 loci showing a change in expression across environmental conditions in teosinte and invariance in maize. In fact, overall we observed both greater plasticity in gene expression and more substantial re-wiring of expression networks in teosinte across environments when compared to maize. While these results suggest genetic assimilation played at least some role in domestication, genes showing expression patterns consistent with assimilation are not significantly enriched for previously identified domestication candidates, indicating assimilation did not have a genome-wide effect.",

    "abstract": "The kinetochore links chromosomes to dynamic spindle microtubules and drives both chromosome congression and segregation. To do so, the kinetochore must hold on to depolymerizing and polymerizing microtubules. At metaphase, one sister kinetochore couples to depolymerizing microtubules, pulling its sister along polymerizing microtubules [1,2]. Distinct kinetochore-microtubule interfaces mediate these behaviors: active interfaces transduce microtubule depolymerization into mechanical work, and passive interfaces generate friction as the kinetochore slides along microtubules [3,4]. We do not know the physical and molecular nature [5-7] of these interfaces, or how they are regulated to support diverse mitotic functions in mammalian cells. To address this question, we focus on the mechanical role of the essential load-bearing protein Hec1 [8-11]. Hec1s affinity for microtubules is regulated by Aurora B phosphorylation on its N-terminal tail [12-15], but its role at the passive and active interfaces remains unclear. Here, we use laser ablation to trigger cellular pulling on mutant kinetochores and decouple sisters in vivo, and thereby separately probe Hec1s role as it moves on polymerizing versus depolymerizing microtubules. We show that Hec1 phosphorylation tunes passive friction along polymerizing microtubules, modulating both the magnitude and timescale of responses to force. In contrast, we find that Hec1 phosphorylation does not affect the kinetochores ability to grip depolymerizing microtubules, or switch to this active force-generating state. Together, the data suggest that different kinetochore interfaces engage with growing and shrinking microtubules, and that passive friction can be regulated without disrupting active force generation. Through this mechanism, the kinetochore can modulate its grip on microtubules as its functional needs change during mitosis, and yet retain its ability to couple to microtubules powering chromosome movement.",

Under this reciprocally imposed selective regime, we expect to see a runaway evolutionary arms race, ultimately leading to the extinction of one species. Despite this prediction, in many systems host and pathogen coexist with minimal coevolution even when well-mixed. Previous work explained this puzzling phenomenon by invoking fitness tradeoffs, which can diminish an arms race dynamic. Here we propose that the regular loss of immunity by the bacterial host can also produce host-phage coexistence. We pair a general model of immunity with an experimental and theoretical case study of the CRISPR-Cas immune system to contrast the behavior of tradeoff and loss mechanisms in well-mixed systems. We find that, while both mechanisms can produce stable coexistence, only immune loss does so robustly within realistic parameter ranges.",

In this study, we used dual site silicon probe recordings in freely moving mice to examine interactions between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens in cocaine CPP. We found that CPP was associated with recruitment of nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons to fire in the cocaine-paired location, and this recruitment was driven predominantly by selective strengthening of hippocampal inputs arising from place cells that encode the cocaine-paired location. These findings provide in vivo evidence that the synaptic potentiation in the accumbens caused by repeated cocaine administration preferentially affects inputs that were active at the time of drug exposure. This provides a potential physiological mechanism by which drug use becomes associated with specific environmental contexts.",

The Andes are a major centre of diversification and source of diversity for adjacent areas in plants and vertebrates, but studies on insects remain scarce, even though they constitute the largest fraction of terrestrial biodiversity. Here, we combine molecular and morphological characters to generate a dated phylogeny of the butterfly genus Pteronymia (Nymphalidae: Danainae), which we use to infer spatial, elevational and temporal diversification patterns. We first propose six taxonomic changes that raise the generic species total to 53, making Pteronymia the most diverse genus of the tribe Ithomiini. Our biogeographic reconstruction shows that Pteronymia originated in the Northern Andes, where it diversified extensively. Some lineages colonized lowlands and adjacent montane areas, but diversification here remained scarce. The recent colonization of lowland areas was reflected by an increase in the rate of evolution of species elevational ranges towards present. By contrast, speciation rate decelerated with time, with no extinction. The geological history of the Andes and adjacent regions have likely contributed to Pteronymia diversification by providing compartmentalized habitats and an array of biotic and abiotic conditions, and by limiting dispersal between some areas while promoting interchange across others.",

For non-human primates, previous in vivo templates have lacked sufficient contrast to reliably validate known anatomical brain regions and have not provided tools for automated single-subject processing.

The NMT is a high-resolution in vivo MRI template of the average macaque brain generated from 31 subjects, as well as a neuroimaging tool for improved data analysis and visualization. From the NMT volume, we generated maps of tissue segmentation and cortical thickness. Surface reconstructions and transformations to previously published digital brain atlases are also provided. We further provide an analysis pipeline using the NMT that automates and standardizes the time-consuming processes of brain extraction, tissue segmentation, and morphometric feature estimation for anatomical scans of individual subjects. The NMT and associated tools thus provide a common platform for precise single-subject data analysis and for characterizations of neuroimaging results across subjects and studies.",

    "abstract": "AAA+ unfoldases are thought to unfold substrate through the central pore of their hexameric structures, but how this process occurs is not known. VAT, the Thermoplasma acidophilum homologue of eukaryotic CDC48/p97, works in conjunction with the proteasome to degrade misfolded or damaged proteins. We show that in the presence of ATP, VAT with its regulatory N-terminal domains removed unfolds other VAT complexes as substrate. We captured images of this transient process by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal the structure of the substrate-bound intermediate. Substrate binding breaks the six-fold symmetry of the complex, allowing five of the six VAT subunits to constrict into a tight helix that grips an ~80 [A] stretch of unfolded protein. The structure suggests a processive hand-over-hand unfolding mechanism, where each VAT subunit releases the substrate in turn before re-engaging further along the target protein, thereby unfolding it.",

However, the signals that link the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis to membrane growth are poorly understood. Here, we used proteome-wide mass spectrometry to systematically discover signals associated with membrane growth. The results suggest that membrane trafficking events required for membrane growth generate sphingolipid-dependent signals. A conserved signaling network plays an essential role in signaling by responding to delivery of sphingolipids to the plasma membrane. In addition, sphingolipid-dependent signals control phosphorylation of protein kinase C (Pkc1), which plays an essential role in the pathways that link the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis to membrane growth. Together, these discoveries provide new clues to how growth-dependent signals control cell growth and the cell cycle.",

Our objectives were to present additional quantitative genetics theory for GWAS, evaluate the relative efficiency of GWAS in non-inbred and inbred populations and in an inbred lines panel, and assess factors affecting GWAS. Fifty samples of 400 individuals from populations with linkage disequilibrium were simulated. Individuals were genotyped for 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for traits controlled by 10 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 90 minor genes, assuming different degrees of dominance and heritabilities of 40 and 80%. The average SNP density was 0.1 centiMorgan and the QTL heritabilities ranged from 3.2 to 11.8%. To increase the QTL detection power, the additive-dominance model must be fitted for traits controlled by dominance effects but must not be fitted for traits showing no dominance. The power of detection was maximized increasing the sample size to 400 and the false discovery rate (FDR) to 5%. The average power of detection for the low, intermediate, and high heritability QTLs were 9.7, 32.7, and 87.7%, respectively. Under sample size of 400 the observed FDR was equal to or lower than the specified level of significance. The association mapping was highly precise. The analysis of the inbred random cross population provided essentially the same results from the non-inbred population.

The emergence of new sequencing technologies that generate longer sequence reads can, in theory, provide direct evidence for all types of SVs regardless of the length of region through which it spans.

Here, we present VaPoR, a highly efficient algorithm that autonomously validates large SV sets using long read sequencing data.

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a threat to humanity, and understanding its neuroinvasiveness is a major challenge. Microcephaly observed in neonates in Brazil is associated with ZIKV that belongs to the Asian lineage. What distinguishes the neuroinvasiveness between the RNA lineages from Asia and Africa is still unknown. Here we identify an aspect that may explain the different behavior between the two lineages. The distinction between the two groups is the occurrence of an alternative protein NS1 (ZIKV-NS1), which happens through a pseudoknot in the virus RNA that induces a ribosomal frameshift. Presence of NS1 protein is also observed in other Flavivirus that are neuroinvasive, and when NS1 production issuppressed, neuroinvasiveness is reduced.1 This evidence gives grounds to suggest that the ZIKV-NS1 occurring in the Asian lineage is responsible for neuro-tropism, which causes the neuro-pathologies associated with ZIKV infection, of which microcephaly is the most dev astating. The existence of ZIKV-NS1, which only exists in the Asian lineage, was inferred through bioinformatic methods, and it has yet to be experimentally observed. If its occurrence is confirmed, it will be a potential target in fighting the neuro-diseases associated with ZIKV.",

Despite its genus name, this yeast is more closely related to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae than to other Candida pathogens, and hence its ability to infect humans is thought to have emerged independently. Morover, C. glabrata has all the necessary genes to undergo a sexual cycle, but it is considered an asexual organism due to the lack of direct evidence of sexual reproduction. Here, we assessed genomic and phenotypic variation across 33 globally-distributed C. glabrata isolates. We cataloged extensive copy number variation, which particularly affects genes encoding cell-wall associated proteins, including adhesins. The observed level of genetic variation in C. glabrata is significantly larger than that found in Candida albicans. This variation is structured in seven deeply divergent clades, which show recent geographical dispersion and large within-clade genomic and phenotypic differences. We show compelling evidence of recent admixture between differentiated lineages, and of purifying selection on mating genes, which provide fist evidence for the existence of a sexual cycle in this yeast. Altogether, our data point to a recent global spread of previously genetically isolated populations and suggest that humans are only a secondary niche for this yeast.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTHypoxia is known to play important role during various cellular process, including regeneration. Regeneration is a complex process involving wound healing and tissue repair. We propose that hypoxia might mediate regeneration through angiogenesis involving angiogenic factors such as VEGF, VEGF-R2, NRP1a during the wound healing process. We have chosen Zebrafish model to study the role of hypoxia induced regeneration. Unlike mammals Zebrafish has the ability to regenerate. Hypoxic condition was mimicked using inorganic salt cobalt chloride to study caudal fin regeneration in adult Zebrafish. Intense blood vessel formation, with increased tail fin length experimented at various time points have been observed when adult zebrafish caudal fin partially amputated were exposed to 1% CoCl2. Regeneration is enhanced under hypoxia, with increased VEGF expression. To study the significance of VEGF signaling during wound healing and tissue regeneration, sunitinib well known inhibitor of VEGF receptor is used against CoCl2-induced caudal fin regeneration. Diminished fin length, lowering of blood vessel formation was documented using angioquant software, reduction in mRNA level of hypoxia inducible factors, VEGF and other pro-angiogenic genes such as VEGF, VEGF-R2, NRP1A, FGFR2, ANGPT1 were observed, while reduction in VEGF protein was demonstrated using western blot analysis. Genistein inhibitor of HIF-1 completely arrested regeneration, with suppression of VEGF highlighting the significance of hypoxia induced VEGF signaling during fin regeneration. Our results suggest that hypoxia through HIF-1 might lead to angiogenesis involving VEGF signaling during wound healing and this might throw light on therapeutic efficacy of cobalt chloride during regeneration.",

Participants ascended over five days to 4559 m, before undertaking an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a bicycle ergometer, with breath-by-breath gas measurements recorded using a portable gas analysis system. Maximum power output (Pmax) was reduced on Az compared with placebo (p=0.03), as was maximum O2 uptake (VO2max) (20.7 vs 24.6 mL/kg/min; p=0.06) and maximum expired CO2 (VCO2max) (23.4 vs 29.5 mL/kg/min; p=0.01).

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering strategies allow the directed modification of the C. elegans genome to introduce point mutations, generate knock-out mutants and insert coding sequences for epitope or fluorescent tags. Three practical aspects however complicate such experiments. First, the efficiency and specificity of single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) cannot be reliably predicted. Second, the detection of animals carrying genome edits can be challenging in the absence of clearly visible or selectable phenotypes. Third, the sgRNA target site must be inactivated after editing to avoid further double-strand break events. We describe here a strategy that addresses these complications by transplanting the protospacer of a highly efficient sgRNA into a gene of interest to render it amenable to genome engineering. This sgRNA targeting the dpy-10 gene generates genome edits at comparatively high frequency. We demonstrate that the transplanted protospacer is cleaved at the same time as the dpy-10 gene. Our strategy generates scarless genome edits because it no longer requires the introduction of mutations in endogenous sgRNA target sites. Modified progeny can be easily identified in the F1 generation, which drastically reduces the number of animals to be tested by PCR or phenotypic analysis. Using this strategy, we reliably generated precise deletion mutants, transcriptional reporters, and translational fusions with epitope tags and fluorescent reporter genes. In particular, we report here the first use of the new red fluorescent protein mScarlet in a multicellular organism. wrmScarlet, a C. elegans-optimized version, dramatically surpassed TagRFP-T by showing an 8-fold increase in fluorescence in a direct comparison.",

    "abstract": "There is growing concern that some managed and wild insect pollinator populations are in decline, potentially threatening biodiversity and sustainable food production on a global scale. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that sub-lethal exposure to neurotoxic, neonicotinoid pesticides can negatively affect pollinator immunocompetence and amplify the effects of diseases, likely contributing to pollinator declines. Here we show that a range of non-neural tissues and haemocytes of the honeybee Apis mellifera express the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that is the target of neonicotinoids. In addition, we demonstrate that the haemocytes, which form the cellular arm of the innate immune system, actively synthesize acetylcholine. This suggests the presence of a neural-independent acetylcholine-based immune signalling system in insects similar to that found in vertebrates. Lastly we establish that field-relevant doses of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin alter this communication system. These findings provide a novel, mechanistically informed framework to understand the numerous siede-effects on insects of sub-lethal pesticide exposure, including immunosuppression. They support the growing evidence for acetylcholine-based immune regulation in invertebrates that operates independently of the nervous system.",

To fully exploit such data there is an increasing need for software that allows user-friendly composition of efficient, 3D models of vascularized tissue growth, and comparison of predictions with in vivo or in vitro experiments and other models. Microvessel Chaste is a new open-source library for building spatial models of vascularized tissue growth. It can be used to simulate vessel growth and adaptation in response to mechanical and chemical stimuli, intra- and extra-vascular transport of nutrient, growth factor and drugs, and cell proliferation in complex 3D geometries. The library provides a comprehensive Python interface to solvers implemented in C++, allowing user-friendly model composition, and integration with experimental data. Such integration is facilitated by interoperability with a growing collection of scientific Python software for image processing, statistical analysis, model annotation and visualization. The library is available under an open-source Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licence at https://jmsgrogan.github.io/MicrovesselChaste. This article links to two reproducible example problems, showing how the library can be used to model tumour growth and angiogenesis with realistic vessel networks.",

    "abstract": "A thermodynamic method for computing the stability and dynamics of chromatin loops is proposed. The CTCF-mediated interactions as observed in ChIA-PET experiments for human B-lymphoblastoid cells are evaluated in terms of a polymer model for chain folding physical properties and the experimentally observed frequency of contacts within the chromatin regions. To estimate the optimal free energy and a Boltzmann distribution of suboptimal structures, the approach uses dynamic programming with methods to handle degeneracy and heuristics to compute parallel and antiparallel chain stems and pseudoknots. Moreover, multiple loops mediated by CTCF proteins connected together and forming multimeric islands are simulated using the same model. Based on the thermodynamic properties of those topological three-dimensional structures, we predict the correlation between the relative activity of chromatin loop and the Boltzmann probability, or the minimum free energy, depending also on its genomic length. Segments of chromatin where the structures show a more stable minimum free energy (for a given genomic distance) tend to be inactive, whereas structures that have lower stability in the minimum free energy (with the same genomic distance) tend to be active.",

    "abstract": "Dense-core vesicles (DCVs) are secretory organelles that store and release modulatory neurotransmitters from neurons and endocrine cells. Recently, the conserved coiled-coil protein CCCP-1 was identified as a component of the DCV biogenesis pathway in the nematode C. elegans. CCCP-1 binds the small GTPase RAB-2 and colocalizes with it at the trans-Golgi. Here we report a structure-function analysis of CCCP-1 to identify domains of the protein important for its localization, binding to RAB-2, and function in DCV biogenesis. We find that the CCCP-1 C-terminal domain (CC3) has multiple activities. CC3 is necessary and sufficient for CCCP-1 localization and for binding to RAB-2, and is required for the function of CCCP-1 in DCV biogenesis. Additionally, CCCP-1 binds membranes directly through its CC3 domain, indicating that CC3 may comprise a previously uncharacterized lipid-binding motif. We conclude that CCCP-1 is a coiled-coil protein that binds an activated Rab and localizes to the Golgi via its C-terminus, properties similar to members of the golgin family of proteins. CCCP-1 also shares biophysical features with golgins; it has an elongated shape and forms oligomers.\\n\\nSynopsis statementCCCP-1 is a coiled-coil protein important for dense-core vesicle (DCV) biogenesis. A structure-function analysis of CCCP-1 shows that its C-terminal domain is required for (1) localization to membrane compartments near the trans-Golgi, (2) binding to activated RAB-2, (3) function in DCV biogenesis, and (4) direct binding to membranes. CCCP-1 has an elongated shape and forms oligomers. These findings suggest that CCCP-1 resembles members of the golgin family of proteins that act as membrane tethers.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe majority of the human genome is composed of non-coding regions containing regulatory elements such as enhancers, which are crucial for controlling gene expression. Many variants associated with complex traits are in these regions, and may disrupt gene regulatory sequences. Consequently, it is important to not only identify true enhancers but also to test if a variant within an enhancer affects gene regulation. Recently, allele-specific analysis in high-throughput reporter assays, such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), have been used to functionally validate non-coding variants. However, we are still missing high-quality and robust data analysis tools for these datasets.\\n\\nResultsWe have further developed our method for allele-specific analysis QuASAR (quantitative allele-specific analysis of reads) to analyze allele-specific signals in barcoded read counts data from MPRA. Using this approach, we can take into account the uncertainty on the original plasmid proportions, over-dispersion, and sequencing errors. The provided allelic skew estimate and its standard error also simplifies meta-analysis of replicate experiments. Additionally, we show that a beta-binomial distribution better models the variability present in the allelic imbalance of these synthetic reporters and results in a test that is statistically well calibrated under the null. Applying this approach to the MPRA data by Tewhey et al. (2016), we found 602 SNPs with significant (FDR 10%) allele-specific regulatory function in LCLs. We also show that we can combine MPRA with QuASAR estimates to validate existing experimental and computational annotations of regulatory variants. Our study shows that with appropriate data analysis tools, we can improve the power to detect allelic effects in high throughput reporter assays.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://github.com/piquelab/QuASAR/tree/master/mpra\\n\\nContactfluca@wayne.edu; rpique@wayne.edu",

We systematically assessed goals and outcomes of the first 30 years of the TNAP using high-resolution remote sensing and ground survey data. With almost 23 billion dollars invested between 1978 and 2008, the forested area within the TNAP region increased by 1.20 x 107 ha, but the proportion of high quality forests declined by 15.8%. The establishment of shelterbelts improved crop yield by 1.7%, much lower than the 5.9% expected once all crop fields are fully protected by shelterbelts. The area subjected to soil erosion by water decreased by 36.0% from 6.72 x 107 to 4.27 x 107 ha; the largest reductions occurred in areas where soil erosion had been most severe and forests contributed more than half of this improvement. Desertification area increased from 1978 to 2000 but decreased from 2000 to 2008; the 30-year net reduction was 13.0% (4.05x106 ha), with 8.0% being accounted for by afforestation in areas with only slight, prior desertification. In addition to its direct impacts, the TNAP has enhanced peoples awareness of environmental protection and attracted consistent attention and long-term commitment from the Chinese government to the restoration and protection of fragile ecosystems in the vast Three-North region. The significant decline in forest quality, limited success in reducing desertification, and low coverage of shelterbelts are aspects of the TNAP in need of re-assessment, and additional ca. 34 billion dollars will be needed to ensure the completion of the TNAP.",

Using fluorescence-labeled actin reporters, we examined the actin distribution in Xenopus embryonic cells and found that F-actin accumulates in nuclei during the blastula stage but not during the gastrula stage. To further investigate nuclear F-actin, we devised a Xenopus egg extract that reproduces the formation of nuclei in which F-actin accumulates. Using this extract, we found that F-actin accumulates primarily at the sub-nuclear membranous region and is essential to maintain chromatin binding to the nuclear envelope in well-developed nuclei. We also provide evidence that nuclear F-actin increases the structural stability of nuclei and contributes to chromosome alignment on the mitotic spindle at the following M phase. These results suggest the physiological importance of nuclear F-actin accumulation in rapidly dividing, large Xenopus blastula cells.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of very large cohorts in genomic research has facilitated a focus on genotype-imputation strategies to power rare variant association. Consequently, a new generation of genotyping arrays are being developed designed with tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to improve rare variant imputation. Selection of these tag SNPs poses several challenges as rare variants tend to be continentally-or even population-specific and reflect fine-scale linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure impacted by recent demographic events. To explore the landscape of tag-able variation and guide design considerations for large-cohort and biobank arrays, we developed a novel pipeline to select tag SNPs using the 26 population reference panel from Phase of the 1000 Genomes Project. We evaluate our approach using leave-one-out internal validation via standard imputation methods that allows the direct comparison of tag SNP performance by estimating the correlation of the imputed and real genotypes for each iteration of potential array sites. We show how this approach allows for an assessment of array design and performance that can take advantage of the development of deeper and more diverse sequenced reference panels. We quantify the impact of demography on tag SNP performance across populations and provide population-specific guidelines for tag SNP selection. We also examine array design strategies that target single populations versus multi-ethnic cohorts, and demonstrate a boost in performance for the latter can be obtained by prioritizing tag SNPs that contribute information across multiple populations simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of improved array design to provide meaningful improvements in power, particularly in trans-ethnic studies. The unified framework presented will enable investigators to make informed decisions for the design of new arrays, and help empower the next phase of rare variant association for global health.",

Although approaches exist for identifying relevant biological conservation units, attempts to identify priority conservation areas for intraspecific diversity are scarce, especially within a multi-specific framework. We used neutral molecular data on six European freshwater fish species (Squalius cephalus, Phoxinus phoxinus, Barbatula barbatula, Gobio occitaniae, Leuciscus burdigalensis and Parachondrostoma toxostoma) sampled at the riverscape scale (i.e. the Garonne-Dordogne River basin, France) to determine hot- and cold-spots of genetic diversity, and to identify priority conservation areas using a systematic conservation planning approach. We demonstrate that systematic conservation planning is efficient for identifying priority areas representing a predefined part of the total genetic diversity of a whole landscape. With the exception of private allelic richness, classical genetic diversity indices (allelic richness, genetic uniqueness) were poor predictors for identifying priority areas. Moreover, we identified weak surrogacies among conservation solutions found for each species, implying that conservation solutions are highly species-specific. Nonetheless, we showed that priority areas identified using intraspecific genetic data from multiple species provide more effective conservation solutions than areas identified for single species or on the basis of traditional taxonomic criteria.",

    "abstract": "In phenotype prediction, the physical characteristics of an organism are predicted from knowledge of its genotype and environment. Such studies are of the highest societal importance, as they are of central importance to medicine, crop-breeding, etc. We investigated three phenotype prediction problems: one simple and clean (yeast), and the other two complex and real-world (rice and wheat). We compared standard machine learning methods (elastic net, ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosting machines (GBM), and support vector machines (SVM)), with two state-of-the-art classical statistical genetics methods (including genomic BLUP). Additionally, using the clean yeast data, we investigated how performance varied with the complexity of the biological mechanism, the amount of observational noise, the number of examples, the amount of missing data, and the use of different data representations. We found that for almost all phenotypes considered standard machine learning methods outperformed the methods from classical statistical genetics. On the yeast problem, the most successful method was GBM, followed by lasso regression, and the two statistical genetics methods; with greater mechanistic complexity GBM was best, while in simpler cases lasso was superior. When applied to the wheat and rice studies the best two methods were SVM and BLUP. The most robust method in the presence of noise, missing data, etc. was random forests. The classical statistical genetics method of genomic BLUP was found to perform well on problems where there was population structure, which suggests one way to improve standard machine learning methods when population structure is present. We conclude that the application of machine learning methods to phenotype prediction problems holds great promise.",

    "abstract": "A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the \\\"hidden\\\" portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron r' to a post-synaptic neuron r can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from r' to r plus corrections from every directed path from r' to r through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have--or do not have--major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for the impact of hidden units in random networks with \\\"strong\\\" coupling--connection weights that scale with [Formula], where N is the network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.",

    "abstract": "Due to the importance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in wine-making, the genomic variation of wine yeast strains has been extensively studied. One of the major insights stemming from these studies is that wine yeast strains harbor low levels of genetic diversity in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genomic structural variants, such as copy number (CN) variants, are another major type of variation segregating in natural populations. To test whether genetic diversity in CN variation is also low across wine yeast strains, we examined genome-wide levels of CN variation in 132 whole-genome sequences of S. cerevisiae wine strains. We found an average of 97.8 CN variable regions (CNVRs) affecting ~4% of the genome per strain. Using two different measures of CN diversity, we found that gene families involved in fermentation-related processes such as copper resistance (CUP), flocculation (FLO), and glucose metabolism (HXT), as well as the SNO gene family whose members are expressed before or during the diauxic shift showed substantial CN diversity across the 132 strains examined. Importantly, these same gene families have been shown, through comparative transcriptomic and functional assays, to be associated with adaptation to the wine fermentation environment. Our results suggest that CN variation is a substantial contributor to the genomic diversity of wine yeast strains and identify several candidate loci whose levels of CN variation may affect the adaptation and performance of wine yeast strains during fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization is an influential evolutionary process that has been viewed alternatively as an evolutionary dead-end or as an important creative evolutionary force. In colonizing species, such as introduced biological control agents, hybridization can negate the effects of bottlenecks and genetic drift through increasing genetic variation. Such changes could be beneficial to a biological control program by increasing the chances of establishment success. However, hybridization can also lead to the emergence of transgressive phenotypes that could alter host specificity; an important consideration when assessing potential non-target impacts of planned agents. In a series of lab experiments, we investigated the effects of hybridization between three species of Diorhabda released to control invasive Tamarix (saltcedar) on life history traits through two generations, and through the third generation for one cross. Depending on the cross, hybridization had either a positive or neutral impact on development time, adult mass, and fecundity. We evaluated preference for the target (saltcedar) relative to a non-target host Tamarixaphylla (athel), and found host specificity patterns varied in two of the three hybrids, demonstrating the possibility for hybridization to alter host preference. Importantly, the overall effects of hybridization were inconsistent by cross, leading to unpredictability in the outcome of using hybrids in biological control.",

Here, we investigate the biochemistry, metabolic pathways, and thermodynamics corresponding to OC oxidation in the Columbia River corridor using ultra-high resolution C characterization. We leverage natural vegetative differences to encompass variation in terrestrial C inputs. Our results suggest that decreases in terrestrial C deposition associated with diminished riparian vegetation induce oxidation of physically -bound OC. We also find that contrasting metabolic pathways oxidize OC in the presence and absence of vegetation and--in direct conflict with the  priming concept--that inputs of water-soluble and thermodynamically favorable terrestrial OC protects bound-OC from oxidation. In both environments, the most thermodynamically favorable compounds appear to be preferentially oxidized regardless of which OC pool microbiomes metabolize. In turn, we suggest that the extent of riparian vegetation causes sediment microbiomes to locally adapt to oxidize a particular pool of OC, but that common thermodynamic principles govern the oxidation of each pool (i.e., water-soluble or physically-bound). Finally, we propose a mechanistic conceptualization of OC oxidation along terrestrial-aquatic interfaces that can be used to model heterogeneous patterns of OC loss under changing land cover distributions.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LIRiparian vegetation protects bound-OC stocks\\nC_LIO_LIBiochemical processes associated with OC oxidation vary with vegetation conditions\\nC_LIO_LICommon thermodynamic principles underlie OC oxidation regardless of vegetation conditions\\nC_LI",

What signals the SAC monitors remains unclear. We do not know the contributions of different microtubule attachment features, or tension from biorientation, to SAC satisfaction in normal mitosis - or how these possible cues change during attachment. Here, we quantify concurrent Mad1 intensity, reporting on SAC silencing, and real-time attachment geometry, occupancy, and tension at individual mammalian kinetochores. We show that Mad1 loss from the kinetochore occurs in switch-like events with robust kinetics, and that metaphase-like tension across sister kinetochores is established just before Mad1 loss events at the first sister. We demonstrate that CenpE-mediated lateral attachment of the second sister can persistently generate this metaphase-like tension prior to biorientation, likely stabilizing sister end-on attachment, yet cannot induce Mad1 loss from that kinetochore. Instead, Mad1 loss begins after several end-on microtubules attach. Thus, end-on attachment provides geometry-specific molecular cues, or force on specific kinetochore linkages, that other attachment geometries cannot provide.\\n\\nSummaryThe spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays anaphase until kinetochores are properly attached to the spindle.

RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover cis acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE) - genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.",

When smallholder farmers use seed produced on-farm or acquired outside certified programs, it is often infected. We introduce a risk assessment framework for seed degeneration, evaluating the relative performance of individual and combined components of an integrated seed health strategy. The frequency distribution of management performance outcomes was evaluated for models incorporating biological and environmental heterogeneity, with the following results. (1) On-farm seed selection can perform as well as certified seed, if the rate of success in selecting healthy plants for seed production is high; (2) When choosing among within-season management strategies, external inoculum can determine the relative usefulness of  incidence-altering management (affecting the proportion of diseased plants/seeds) and rate-altering management (affecting the rate of disease transmission in the field); (3) Under severe disease scenarios, where it is difficult to implement management components at high levels of effectiveness, combining management components can produce synergistic benefits and keep seed degeneration below a threshold; (4) Combining management components can also close the yield gap between average and worst-case scenarios. We also illustrate the potential for expert elicitation to provide parameter estimates when data are unavailable.",

Brazil has the highest number of reported ZIKV cases worldwide (>200,000 by 24 Dec 20162) as well as the greatest number of cases associated with microcephaly and other birth defects (2,366 confirmed cases by 31 Dec 20162). Following the initial detection of ZIKV in Brazil, 47 countries and territories in the Americas have reported local ZIKV transmission, with 22 of these reporting ZIKV-associated severe disease3. Yet the origin and epidemic history of ZIKV in Brazil and the Americas remain poorly understood, despite the value of such information for interpreting past trends in reported microcephaly. To address this we generated 53 complete or partial ZIKV genomes, mostly from Brazil, including data generated by the ZiBRA project - a mobile genomics lab that travelled across Northeast Brazil in 2016. One sequence represents the earliest confirmed ZIKV infection in Brazil. Joint analyses of viral genomes with ecological and epidemiological data estimate that the ZIKV epidemic first became established in NE Brazil by March 2014 and likely disseminated from there, both nationally and internationally, before the first detection of ZIKV in the Americas. Estimated dates of the international spread of ZIKV from Brazil coincide with periods of high vector suitability in recipient regions and indicate the duration of pre-detection cryptic transmission in those regions. NE Brazils role in the establishment of ZIKV in the Americas is further supported by geographic analysis of ZIKV transmission potential and by estimates of the virus basic reproduction number.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryVirus genomes reveal the establishment of Zika virus in Northeast Brazil and the Americas, and provide an appropriate timeframe for baseline (pre-Zika) microcephaly in different regions.",

We aimed at objectifying this possible alteration by performing a systematic meta-analysis of the literature, and an analysis of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) cohort. Our meta-analysis sought to determine a combined effect size of ASD diagnosis on different measures of the cerebellar anatomy, as well as the effect of possible factors of variability across studies. We then analysed the cerebellar volume of 328 patients and 353 controls from the ABIDE project. The meta-analysis of the literature suggested a weak but significant association between ASD diagnosis and increased cerebellar volume (p=0.049, uncorrected), but the analysis of ABIDE did not show any relationship. The studies in the literature were generally underpowered, however, the number of statistically significant findings was larger than expected. Although we could not provide a conclusive explanation for this excess of significant findings, our analyses would suggest publication bias as a possible reason. Finally, age, sex and IQ were important sources of cerebellar volume variability, however, independent of autism diagnosis.",

In July 2016, mosquito-borne ZIKV transmission was first reported in the continental United States and since then, hundreds of locally-acquired infections have been reported in Florida3. To gain insights into the timing, source, and likely route(s) of introduction of ZIKV into the continental United States, we tracked the virus from its first detection in Miami, Florida by direct sequencing of ZIKV genomes from infected patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We show that at least four distinct ZIKV introductions contributed to the outbreak in Florida and that local transmission likely started in the spring of 2016 - several months before its initial detection. By analyzing surveillance and genetic data, we discovered that ZIKV moved among transmission zones in Miami. Our analyses show that most introductions are phylogenetically linked to the Caribbean, a finding corroborated by the high incidence rates and traffic volumes from the region into the Miami area. By comparing mosquito abundance and travel flows, we describe the areas of southern Florida that are especially vulnerable to ZIKV introductions.

The causative pathogen, Mycobac-terium tuberculosis (MTB), is estimated to have infected up to a third of the worlds population; however, only approximately 10% of infected healthy individuals progress to active TB. Despite evidence for heritability, it is not currently possible to predict who may develop TB. To explore approaches to classify susceptibility to TB, we infected with MTB dendritic cells (DCs) from putatively resistant individuals diagnosed with latent TB, and from susceptible individuals that had recovered from active TB. We measured gene expression levels in infected and non-infected cells and found hundreds of differentially expressed genes between susceptible and resistant individuals in the non-infected cells. We further found that genetic polymorphisms nearby the differentially expressed genes between susceptible and resistant individuals are more likely to be associated with TB susceptibility in published GWAS data. Lastly, we trained a classifier based on the gene expression levels in the non-infected cells, and demonstrated decent performance on our data and an independent data set. Overall, our promising results from this small study suggest that training a classifier on a larger cohort may enable us to accurately predict TB susceptibility.",

Specifically, we compare the relative stability of pairwise DMIs among autosomes, X chromosomes, and mitochondrial genes. In an analytical approach based on a continent-island framework, we determine how the maximum permissible migration rates depend on the genomic architecture of the DMI, on sex bias in migration rates, and on sex-dependence of allelic and epistatic effects, such as dosage compensation. Our results show that X-linkage of DMIs can enlarge the migration bounds relative to autosomal DMIs or autosome-mitochondrial DMIs, in particular in the presence of dosage compensation. The effect is further strengthened with male-biased migration. This mechanism might contribute to a higher density of DMIs on the X chromosome (large X-effect) that has been observed in several species clades. Furthermore, our results agree with empirical findings of higher introgression rates of autosomal compared to X-linked loci.",

Here, we advocate the use of persistent homology, a mathematical method robust to noise, invariant with respect to orientation, capable of application across diverse scales, and importantly, compatible with diverse functions to quantify disparate plant morphologies, architectures, and textures. To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we apply persistent homology approaches to the shape of leaves, serrations, and root architecture as measured in the same plants of a domesticated tomato Solanum pennellii near-isogenic introgression line population under field conditions. We find that genetic contributions to morphology affect the plant in a concerted fashion, affecting both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural variation in tomato.",
