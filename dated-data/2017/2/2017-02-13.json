    "abstract": "Characterizing traits critical for adaptation to a given environment is an important first step in understanding how phenotypes evolve. How animals adapt to the extreme heat and aridity commonplace to deserts represents is an exceptionally interesting example of these processes, and has been the focus of study for decades. In contrast to those studies, where experiments are conducted on either wild animals or captive animals held in non-desert conditions, the study described here leverages a unique environmental chamber that replicates desert conditions for captive Peromyscus eremicus (cactus mouse). Here we establish baseline values for daily water intake and for serum electrolytes, as well as the response of these variables to experimental dehydration. In brief, P. eremicus daily water intake is very low. Its serum electrolytes are distinct from many previously studied animals, and its response to acute dehydration is profound, though not suggestive of renal impairment, which is atypical of mammals.\\n\\nSummary statementThe establishment of baseline values for serum electrolytes and water intake, as well as their response to acute dehydration is critical for characterizing the physiology necessary for desert survival.\\n\\nConflict of Interest StatementThe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "Approximately half of proteins with experimentally determined structures can interact with other copies of themselves and assemble into homomeric complexes, the overwhelming majority of which (>96%) are symmetric. Although homomerisation is often assumed to be functionally beneficial and the result of evolutionary selection, there has been little systematic analysis of the relationship between homomer structure and function. Here, utilizing the large numbers of structures and functional annotations now available, we have investigated how proteins that assemble into different types of homomers are associated with different biological functions. We observe that homomers from different symmetry groups are significantly enriched in distinct functions, and can often provide simple physical and geometrical explanations for these associations in regards to substrate recognition or physical environment. One of the strongest associations is the tendency for metabolic enzymes to form dihedral complexes, which we suggest is closely related to allosteric regulation. We provide a physical explanation for why allostery is related to dihedral complexes: it allows for efficient propagation of conformational changes across isologous (i.e. symmetric) interfaces. Overall we demonstrate a clear relationship between protein function and homomer symmetry that has important implications for understanding protein evolution, as well as for predicting protein function and quaternary structure.",

    "abstract": "Reactive Fe(III) minerals can influence methane (CH4) emissions by inhibiting microbial methanogenesis or by stimulating anaerobic CH4 oxidation. The balance between Fe(III) reduction, methanogenesis, and methane oxidation in ferruginous Archean and Paleoproterozoic oceans would have controlled CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, thereby regulating the capacity for CH4 to warm the early Earth under the Faint Young Sun. We studied CH4 and Fe cycling in anoxic incubations of ferruginous sediment from the ancient ocean analogue Lake Matano, Indonesia over three successive transfers (500 days total). Iron reduction, methanogenesis, methane oxidation, and microbial taxonomy were monitored in treatments amended with ferrihydrite or goethite. After three dilutions, Fe(III) reduction persisted only in bottles with ferrihydrite. Enhanced CH4 production was observed in the presence of goethite, highlighting the potential for reactive Fe(III)-oxides to inhibit methanogenesis. Supplementing the media with hydrogen, nickel and selenium did not stimulate methanogenesis. There was limited evidence for Fe(III)-dependent CH4 oxidation, although some incubations displayed CH4-stimulated Fe(III)-reduction. 16S rRNA profiles continuously changed over the course of enrichment, with ultimate dominance of unclassified members of the order Desulfuromonadales in all treatments. Microbial diversity decreased markedly over the course of incubation, with subtle differences between ferrihydrite and goethite amendments. These results suggest that Fe(III)-oxide mineralogy and availability of electron donors could have led to spatial separation of Fe(III)-reducing and methanogenic microbial communities in ferruginous marine sediments, potentially explaining the persistence of CH4 as a greenhouse gas throughout the first half of Earth history.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are an important analytical tool for evaluating community diversity and evolutionary history. In the case of microorganisms, the decreasing cost of sequencing has enabled researchers to generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history of microbial groups. However, phylogenetic analyses of these types of datasets create complex trees that can be challenging to interpret. Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree. Yet, manual customization is time-consuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require programming experience or complicated file formats for annotation. Iroki, a user-friendly web interface for tree visualization, addresses these issues by providing automatic customization of large trees based on metadata contained in tab-separated text files. Irokis utility for exploring biological and ecological trends in sequencing data was demonstrated through a variety of microbial ecology applications in which trees with hundreds to thousands of leaf nodes were customized according to extensive collections of metadata.

    "abstract": "The intestinal immune system must be able to respond to a wide variety of infectious organisms while maintaining tolerance to non-pathogenic microbes and food antigens. The Vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) has been implicated in the regulation of this balance, partially by regulating innate lymphoid cell (ILC) responses in the intestine. However, the molecular mechanisms of RA-dependent intestinal immunity and homeostasis remain elusive. Here we define a role for the transcriptional repressor Hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1, ZBTB29) in the regulation of ILC responses in the intestine. Intestinal ILCs express HIC1 in a vitamin A-dependent manner. In the absence of HIC1, group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are lost, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection with the bacterial pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. In addition, the loss of ILC3s leads to a local and systemic increase in IFN-{gamma}-producing T cells that prevents the development of protective immunity against infection with the parasitic helminth Trichuris muris. Thus, RA-dependent expression of HIC1 in ILC3s regulates intestinal homeostasis and protective immunity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInnate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are emerging as important regulators of immune responses at barrier sites such as the intestine. However, the molecular mechanisms that control this are not well described. In the intestine, the Vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to be an important component of the homeostatic mechanisms. In this manuscript, we show that the RA-dependent transcription factor Hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1, ZBTB29) is required for ILC homeostasis and function in the steady state as well as following infection with the bacterial pathogen Citrobacter rodentium or the helminth parasite Trichuris muris. Thus, HIC1 links RA signalling to intestinal immune responses. Further, our results identify HIC1 as a potential target to modulate ILC responses in vivo in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Body size is a tightly regulated phenotype in metazoans that is dependent on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. While signaling pathways such as insulin, Hippo, and myostatin are known to control organ and body size, the downstream effectors that mediate their effects are still poorly understood. In the nematode C. elegans, a Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-related signaling pathway is the major regulator of growth and body size. DBL-1, the BMP-related ligand, is secreted by neurons and body wall muscle, and acts as a dose-dependent regulator of body size. We investigated the transcriptional network through which the DBL-1/BMP pathway regulates body size and identified cuticle collagen genes as major effectors of growth control. Here we demonstrate that cuticle collagen genes can act as positive regulators (col-41), dose-sensitive regulators (rol-6), and negative regulators (col-141, col-142) of body size. Moreover, we show requirement of DBL-1/BMP signaling for stage-specific expression of cuticle collagen genes. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to show that the Smad signal transducers directly associate with conserved Smad binding elements in regulatory regions of col-141 and col-142, but not of col-41. Hence, cuticle collagen genes are directly and indirectly regulated via the DBL-1/BMP pathway. These results provide the first direct regulatory link between this conserved signaling pathway and the collagen genes that act as its downstream effectors in body size regulation. Since collagen mutations and misregulation are implicated in numerous human genetic disorders and injury sequelae, understanding how collagen gene expression is regulated has broad implications.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBody size in humans and other animals is determined by the combined influence of genetic and environmental factors. Failure to regulate growth and body size appropriately can lead to a variety of functional impairments and reduced fitness. Progress has been made in identifying genetic determinants of body size, but these have not often been connected into functional pathways. In the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans, single gene mutations in the BMP signaling pathway have profound effects on body size. Here we have elucidated the BMP transcriptional network and identified cuticle collagen genes as downstream effectors of body size regulation through the BMP pathway. Collagens play diverse roles in biology; mutations are often associated with rare heritable diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Our work thus connects a conserved signaling pathway with its critical downstream effectors, advancing insight into how body size is specified.",

Compared to the homologous bacterial type IV pilus (T4P), we observe structural similarities as well as several unique features.

In addition to anchoring the lophotrichous bundle of archaella, the conical frustum associates with chemosensory arrays and ribosome-excluding material and may function as a polar organizing center for the coccoid cells.",

This technique has greatly advanced our understanding of the ultrastructure of bacterial cells. Rather than undifferentiated bags of enzymes, we now view bacteria as structurally complex assemblies of macromolecular machines. To date, our group has applied ECT to nearly 90 different bacterial species, collecting more than 15,000 cryotomograms. In addition to known structures, we have observed several, to our knowledge, uncharacterized features in these tomograms. Some are completely novel structures; others expand the features or species range of known structure types. Here we present a survey of these uncharacterized bacterial structures in the hopes of accelerating their identification and study, and furthering our understanding of the structural complexity of bacterial cells.",

    "abstract": "Mutualism describes the biological phenomenon where two or more species are reciprocally beneficial, regardless of their ecological intimacy or evolutionary history. Classic theory shows that mutualistic benefit must be relatively weak, or else it overpowers the stabilizing influence of intraspecific competition and leads to unrealistic, unbounded population growth. Interestingly, the conclusion that strong positive interactions lead to runaway population growth is strongly grounded in the behavior of a single model. This model [-] the Lotka-Volterra competition model with a sign change to generate mutualism rather than competition between species [-] assumes logistic growth of each species plus a linear interaction term to represent the mutualism. While it is commonly held that the linear interaction term is to blame for the models unrealistic behavior, we show here that a linear mutualism added to a{theta} -logistic model of population growth can prevent unbounded growth. We find that when density dependence is decelerating, the benefit of mutualism at equilibrium is greater than when density dependence is accelerating. Although there is a greater benefit, however, decelerating density dependence tends to destabilize populations whereas accelerating density dependence is always stable. We interpret these findings tentatively, but with promise for the understanding of the population ecology of mutualism by generating several predictions relating growth rates of mutualist populations and the strength of mutualistic interaction.",

Of these, 13 reported genes, 15 novel genes in known loci, and 6 genes in novel loci replicated (FDRrep < 0.05) in an independent study (ncases {approx} 10K, ncontrols {approx} 62K). We also found enrichment of significant associations in expected tissues such as liver, pancreas, adipose, and muscle but also in tibial nerve, fibroblasts, and breast. Finally, we found that monogenic diabetes genes are enriched in T2D genes from our analysis suggesting that moderate alterations in monogenic (severe) diabetes genes may promote milder and later onset type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The plaque assay is a common technique used to measure virus concentrations and is based upon the principle that each plaque represents a single infectious unit. As such, plaque number is expected to correlate linearly with the virus dilution plated and each plaque should be formed by a single founder virus. Here, we examined whether more than one virus can contribute to plaque formation. By using genetic and phenotypic assays with genetically marked polioviruses, we found that multiple parental viruses are present in 5-7% of plaques, even at an extremely low multiplicity of infection. We demonstrated through visual and biophysical assays that, like many viral stocks, our viral stocks contain both single particles and aggregates. These data suggest that aggregated virions are capable of inducing co-infection and chimeric plaque formation. In fact, inducing virion aggregation via exposure to low pH increased co-infection in a flow cytometry-based assay. We hypothesized that plaques generated by viruses with high mutation loads may have higher co-infection frequencies due to fitness restoring processes such as complementation and recombination. Indeed, we found that co-infection frequency correlated with mutation load, with 17% chimeric plaque formation for heavily mutagenized viruses. Importantly, the frequency of chimeric plaques may be underestimated by up to three-fold, since co-infection with the same parental virus cannot be scored in our assay. This work indicates that more than one virus can contribute to plaque formation and that co-infection may assist plaque formation in situations where the amount of genome damage is high.",

Here, we show that the deubiquitylating enzyme Ubp12 interacts with Cdc48 and regulates proteasomal degradation of Rad23-dependent substrates. Overexpression of Ubp12 results in stabilization of Rad23-dependent substrates. We show that Ubp12 removes short ubiquitin chains from the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UbL) of Rad23. Preventing ubiquitylation of Rad23 by substitution of lysine residues within the UbL domain, Rad23UbLK0, does not affect the non-proteolytic role of Rad23 in DNA repair but causes an increase in ubiquitylated cargo bound to the UBA2 domains of Rad23 and recapitulates the stabilization of Rad23-dependent substrates observed upon overexpression of Ubp12. Expression of Rad23UbLK0 or overexpression of Ubp12 impairs the ability of yeast to cope with proteotoxic stress consistent with inefficient clearance of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Our data suggest that ubiquitylation of Rad23 plays a stimulatory role in facilitating the transfer of ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome.\\n\\nSummary statementUbiquitylation of a ubiquitin shuttle factor regulates the delivery of substrates at the proteasome, uncovering a novel regulatory link between ubiquitin and proteasomal degradation.",

    "abstract": "As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic transformation such as cancer. Since aging appears to be a stochastic process of increasing disorder1 cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways - thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult tissues difficult to characterize. Here we directly measure the effects of aging in primary human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We find that islet cells from older donors have increased levels of molecular disorder as measured both by noise in the transcriptome and by the number of cells which display inappropriate hormone expression, revealing a transcriptional instability associated with aging. By further analyzing the spectrum of somatic mutations in single cells, we found a specific age-dependent mutational signature characterized by C to A and C to G transversions. These mutations are indicators of oxidative stress and the signature is absent in single cells from human brain tissue or in a tumor cell line. We have used the single cell measurements of transcriptional noise and mutation level to identify molecular pathways correlated with these changes that could influence human disease. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA-seq data from primary cells to derive meaningful insights into the genetic processes that operate on aging human tissue and to determine molecular mechanisms coordinated with these processes.",

    "abstract": "Ciliated surfaces harbouring synchronously beating cilia can generate fluid flow or drive locomotion. In ciliary swimmers, ciliary beating, arrests, and changes in beat frequency are often coordinated across extended or discontinuous surfaces. To understand how such coordination is achieved, we studied the ciliated larvae of Platynereis dumerilii, a marine annelid. Platynereis larvae have segmental multiciliated cells that regularly display spontaneous coordinated ciliary arrests. We used whole-body connectomics, activity imaging, transgenesis, and neuron ablation to characterize the ciliomotor circuitry. We identified cholinergic, serotonergic, and catecholaminergic ciliomotor neurons. The synchronous rhythmic activation of cholinergic cells drives the coordinated arrests of all cilia. The serotonergic cells are active when cilia are beating. Serotonin inhibits the cholinergic rhythm, and increases ciliary beat frequency. Based on their connectivity and alternating activity, the catecholaminergic cells may generate the rhythm. The ciliomotor circuitry thus constitutes a stop-and-go pacemaker system for the whole-body coordination of ciliary locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Studies of neuron-behaviour correlation and causal manipulation have long been used separately to understand the neural basis of perception. Yet these approaches sometimes lead to drastically conflicting conclusions about the functional role of brain areas. Theories that focus only on choice-related neuronal activity cannot reconcile those findings without additional experiments involving large-scale recordings to measure interneuronal correlations. By expanding current theories of neural coding and incorporating results from inactivation experiments, we demonstrate here that it is possible to infer decoding weights of different brain areas without precise knowledge of the correlation structure. We apply this technique to neural data collected from two different cortical areas in macaque monkeys trained to perform a heading discrimination task. We identify two opposing decoding schemes, each consistent with data depending on the nature of correlated noise. Our theory makes specific testable predictions to distinguish these scenarios experimentally without requiring measurement of the underlying noise correlations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe neocortex is structurally organized into distinct brain areas. The role of specific brain areas in sensory perception is typically studied using two kinds of laboratory experiments: those that measure correlations between neural activity and reported percepts, and those that inactivate a brain region and measure the resulting changes in percepts. The two types of experiments have generally been interpreted in isolation, in part because no theory has been able combine their outcomes. Here, we describe a mathematical framework that synthesizes both kinds of results, giving us a new way to assess how different brain areas contribute to perception. When we apply our framework to experiments on behaving monkeys, we discover two models that can explain the perplexing finding that one brain area can predict an animals percepts, even though the percepts are not affected when that brain area is inactivated. The two models ascribe dramatically different efficiencies to brain computation. We show that these two models can be distinguished by an experiment that measures correlations while inactivating different brain areas.",

The splicing reaction requires definition of splice sites, which are initially recognized in either intron-spanning (\\\"intron definition\\\") or exon-spanning (\\\"exon definition\\\") pairs. To understand how exon and intron length and splice site recognition mode impact splicing, we measured splicing rates genome-wide in Drosophila, using metabolic labeling/RNA sequencing and new mathematical models to estimate rates. We found that the modal intron length range of 60-70 nt represents a local maximum of splicing rates, but that much longer exon-defined introns are spliced even faster and more accurately. Surprisingly, we observed low variation in splicing rates across introns in the same gene, suggesting the presence of gene-level influences, and we identified multiple gene level variables associated with splicing rate. Together our data suggest that developmental and stress response genes may have preferentially evolved exon definition in order to enhance rates of splicing.",

Simulations based on the Gillespie algorithm at the bursting limit show the occurrence of bursts of multiple sizes and durations.

    "abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is prevalent among all plants and is involved in many interactions with environmental stresses. However, the evolutionary patterns and underlying mechanisms of AS in plants remain unclear. By analyzing the transcriptomes of six plant species, we revealed that AS diverged rapidly among closely related species, largely due to the gains and losses of AS events among orthologous genes. Furthermore, AS that generates transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTC), although only representing a small fraction of the total AS, are more conserved than those that generate non-PTC containing transcripts, suggesting that AS coupled with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) might play an important role in regulating mRNA levels post-transcriptionally. With a machine learning approach we analyzed the key determinants of AS to understand the mechanisms underlying its rapid divergence. Among the studied species, the presence/absence of alternative splicing site (SS) within the junction, the distance between the authentic SS and the nearest alternative SS, the size of exon-exon junctions were the major determinants for both alternative 5 donor site and 3acceptor site, suggesting a relatively conserved AS mechanism. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that variations of the identified AS determinants, mostly are located in introns, significantly contributed to the AS turnover among closely related species in both Solanaceae and Brassicaceae taxa. These new mechanistic insights into the evolution of AS in plants highlight the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in mediating plant-environment interactions.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryChanges of intron located splicing regulators contributed to the rapid evolution of alternative splicing in plants.",

    "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing and informatics have revolutionised biology over the past four decades, but technological limitations have left many applications unexplored1,2. Recently, portable, real-time, nanopore sequencing (RTnS) has become available. This offers opportunities to rapidly collect and analyse genomic data anywhere3-5. However, the generation of datasets from large, complex genomes has been constrained to laboratories6,7. The portability and long DNA sequences of RTnS offer great potential for field-based species identification, but the feasibility and accuracy of these technologies for this purpose have not been assessed. Here, we show that a field-based RTnS analysis of closely-related plant species (Arabidopsis spp.)8 has many advantages over laboratory-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods for species level identification-by-sequencing and de novo phylogenomics. Samples were collected and sequenced in a single day by RTnS using a portable, \\\"al fresco\\\" laboratory. Our analyses demonstrate that correctly identifying unknown reads from matches to a reference database with RTnS reads enables rapid and confident species identification. Individually annotated RTnS reads can be used to infer the evolutionary relationships of A. thaliana. Furthermore, hybrid genome assembly with RTnS and HTS reads substantially improved upon a genome assembled from HTS reads alone. Field-based RTnS makes real-time, rapid specimen identification and genome wide analyses possible. These technological advances are set to revolutionise research in the biological sciences9 and have broad implications for conservation, taxonomy, border agencies and citizen science.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant North Carolina macular dystrophy (NCMD) is believed to represent a failure of macular development. The disorder has been assigned by linkage to two loci, MCDR1 on chromosome 6q16 and MCDR3 on chromosome 5p15-p13. Recently, noncoding variants upstream of PRDM13 and a large duplication including IRX1 have been identified. However, the underlying disease-causing mechanism remains uncertain. Through a combination of sequencing studies, we report two novel overlapping duplications at the MCDR3 locus, in a gene desert downstream of IRX1 and upstream of ADAMTS16. One duplication of 43 kb was identified in nine NCMD families (with evidence for a shared ancestral haplotype), and another one of 45 kb was found in a single family. The MCDR3 locus is thus refined to a shared region of 39 kb that contains DNAse hypersensitive sites active at a restricted time window during retinal development. Publicly available data confirmed expression of IRX1 and ADAMTS16 in human fetal retina, with IRX1 preferentially expressed in fetal macula. These findings represent a major advance in our understanding of the molecular genetics of NCMD at the MCDR3 locus and provide insights into the genetic pathways involved in human macular development.\\n\\nAbbreviations list",
