    "abstract": "Abbreviations\\n\\nAbstractAn alternative model for protein translation is presented wherein ribosomes utilize a complementary RNA copy of protein coding sequences to monitor the progress of messenger RNAs during their translation to reduce the frequency of frameshifting errors. The synthesis of this  framing RNA is postulated to be catalyzed by the small subunit of the ribosome, in the decoding center, by excising and concatemerizing tRNA anticodons bound to each codon of the mRNA template. Various components of the model are supported by previous observations of tRNA mutants that impact ribosomal frameshifting, unique globin-coding RNAs in developing erythroblasts, and the epigenetic, intergenerational transfer of phenotypic traits via mammalian sperm RNA. Confirmation of the proposed translation mechanism is experimentally tractable and might significantly enhance our understanding of several fundamental biological processes.",

    "abstract": "When sensory feedback is perturbed, accurate movement is restored by a combination of implicit processes and deliberate re-aiming to strategically compensate for errors. Here, we directly compare two methods used previously to dissociate implicit from explicit learning on a trial-by-trial basis: 1) asking participants to report the direction that they aim their movements, and contrasting this with the directions of the target and the movement that they actually produce, 2) manipulating movement preparation time. By instructing participants to re-aim without a sensory perturbation, we show that re-aiming is possible even with the shortest possible preparation times, particularly when targets are narrowly distributed. Nonetheless, re-aiming is effortful and comes at the cost of increased variability, so we tested whether constraining preparation time is sufficient to suppress strategic re-aiming during adaptation to visuomotor rotation with a broad target distribution. The rate and extent of error reduction under preparation time constraints were similar to estimates of implicit learning obtained from self-report without time pressure, suggesting that participants chose not to apply a re-aiming strategy to correct visual errors under time pressure. Surprisingly, participants who reported aiming directions showed less implicit learning according to an alternative measure, obtained during trials performed without visual feedback. This suggests that the process of reporting can affect the extent or persistence of implicit learning. The data extend existing evidence that restricting preparation time can suppress explicit re-aiming, and provide an estimate of implicit visuomotor rotation learning that does not require participants to report their aiming directions.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyDuring sensorimotor adaptation, implicit, error-driven learning can be isolated from explicit strategy-driven re-aiming by subtracting self-reported aiming directions from movement directions, or by restricting movement preparation time. Here, we compared the two methods. Restricting preparation times did not eliminate re-aiming, but was sufficient to suppress reaiming during adaptation with widely-distributed targets. The self-report method produced a discrepancy in implicit learning estimated by subtracting aiming directions, and implicit learning measured in no-feedback trials.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or non-adaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses, and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends upon whether plastic responses are adaptive or non-adaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change, or whether simpler non-evolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers are DNA regulatory elements that influence gene expression. There is substantial diversity in enhancers activity patterns: some enhancers drive expression in a single cellular context, while others are active across many. Sequence characteristics, such as transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, influence the activity patterns of regulatory sequences; however, the regulatory logic through which specific sequences drive enhancer activity patterns is poorly understood. Recent analysis of Drosophila enhancers suggested that short dinucleotide repeat motifs (DRMs) are general enhancer sequence features that drive broad regulatory activity. However, it is not known whether the regulatory role of DRMs is conserved across species. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between short DNA sequence patterns, including DRMs, and human enhancer activity in 38,538 enhancers across 411 different contexts. In a machine-learning framework, the occurrence patterns of short sequence motifs accurately predicted broadly active human enhancers. However, DRMs alone were weakly predictive of broad enhancer activity in humans and showed different enrichment patterns than in Drosophila. In general, GC-rich sequence motifs were significantly associated with broad enhancer activity; consistent with this enrichment, broadly active human TFs recognize GC-rich motifs. Our results reveal the importance of specific sequence motifs in broadly active human enhancers, demonstrate the lack of evolutionary conservation of the role of DRMs, and provide a computational framework for investigating the logic of enhancer sequences.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are major evolutionary drivers of insect immune systems. Much of our knowledge of insect immune responses derives from experimental infections using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Most experiments, however, employ lethal pathogen doses through septic injury, frequently overwhelming host physiology. While this approach has revealed a number of immune mechanisms, it is less informative about the fitness costs hosts may experience during infection in the wild. Using both systemic and oral infection routes we find that even apparently benign, sub-lethal infections with the horizontally transmitted Drosophila C Virus (DCV) can cause significant physiological and behavioral morbidity that is relevant for host fitness. We describe DCV-induced effects on fly reproductive output, digestive health, and locomotor activity, and we find that viral morbidity varies according to the concentration of pathogen inoculum, host genetic background and sex. Notably, sub-lethal DCV infection resulted in a significant increase in fly reproduction, but this effect depended on host genotype. We discuss the relevance of sub-lethal morbidity for Drosophila ecology and evolution, and more broadly, we remark on the implications of deleterious and beneficial infections for the evolution of insect immunity.",

    "abstract": "The impact of diseases depends on the dynamic interplay between host, pathogen and the environment. Newly emerging diseases may be the consequence of novel pathogen introductions that are typically associated with unpredictable outcomes, as their interaction with the host in a novel environment is unprecedented. Alternatively, new diseases may emerge from latent, previously established, pathogen populations that are triggered by changes in environmental factors like weather, agricultural practices and ecosystem management. Verticillium stem striping recently emerged in British oilseed rape (Brassica napus) production from a latent Verticillium longisporum population. V. longisporum is a hybrid fungal pathogen consisting of three lineages, each representing a separate hybridization event. Despite its prevalence, little is known of the pathogenicity of the British V. longisporum population. In this study, the pathogenicity of British isolates was tested on four different cultivars of three different Brassica crop species as well as on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and compared with previously characterized V. longisporum strains from other regions of the world, including representatives of all three hybrid lineages. Intriguingly, the British isolates appeared to be amongst the most pathogenic strains on Brassica crops. In conclusion, Verticillium stem striping poses a genuine threat to oilseed rape production as the British V. longisporum population consists of aggressive pathogens that have the potential to significantly impact Brassica crops.",

    "abstract": "Lux-type quorum sensing systems enable communication in bacteria with only two protein components: a signal synthase and an inducible transcription activator. The simplicity of these systems makes them a popular choice for engineering collaborative behaviors in synthetic bacterial consortia, such as photographic edge detection and synchronized oscillation. To add to this body of work, we propose a pulsatile communication circuit that enables dynamic patterning and long-distance communication analogous to action potentials traveling through nerve tissue. We employed a model-driven design paradigm involving incremental characterization of in vivo design candidates with increasing circuit complexity. Beginning with a simple inducible reporter system, we screened a small number of circuits varying in their promoter and ribosomal binding site (RBS) strengths. From this candidate pool, we selected a candidate to be the seed network for the subsequent round of more complex circuit variants, likewise variable in promoter and RBS strengths. The selection criteria at each level of complexity is tailored to optimize a different desirable performance characteristic. By this approach we individually optimized reporter signal-to-background ratio, pulsatile response to induction, and quiescent basal transcription, avoiding large library screens while ensuring robust performance of the composite circuit.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is believed to be important for rapid learning of arbitrary stimulus-response contingencies, or S-R bindings. In support of this, Schnyer et al., 2006 (Experiment 2) measured priming of reaction times (RTs) to categorise visual objects, and found that patients with medial temporal lobe damage, unlike healthy controls, failed to show evidence of reduced priming when response contingencies were reversed between initial and repeated categorisation of objects (a signature of S-R bindings). We ran a similar though extended object classification task on 6 patients who appear to have selective hippocampal lesions, together with 24 age-matched controls. Unlike Schnyer et al., 2006, we found that reversing response contingencies abolished priming in both controls and patients. Bayes Factors provided no reason to believe that response reversal had less effect on patients than controls. We therefore conclude that it is unlikely that the hippocampus is needed for S-R bindings.",

    "abstract": "Modern advances in neurotechnology rely on effectively harnessing physical tools and insights towards remote neural control, thereby creating major new scientific and therapeutic opportunities. Specifically, rapid temperature pulses were shown to increase membrane capacitance, causing capacitive currents that explain neural excitation, but the underlying biophysics is not well understood. Here, we show that an intramembrane thermal-mechanical effect wherein the phospholipid bilayer undergoes axial narrowing and lateral expansion accurately predicts a potentially universal thermal capacitance increase rate of ~0.3%/{degrees}C. This capacitance increase and concurrent changes in the surface charge related fields lead to predictable exciting ionic displacement currents. The new theorys predictions provide an excellent agreement with multiple experimental results and indirect estimates of latent biophysical quantities. Our results further highlight the role of electro-mechanics in neural excitation; they may also help illuminate sub-threshold and novel physical cellular effects, and could potentially lead to advanced new methods for neural control.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin 18 (IL18) is known to induce the expression of interferon-{gamma} (IFNG), but its effects on T cell proliferation and costimulation are not completely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of IL18 in CART cells caused significant T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced antitumor effects in xenograft models. Moreover, IL18 mediated T cell expansion required neither tumor antigen nor CAR expression, and produced severe GVHD in NSG mice. Furthermore, recombinant IL18 costimulated IFNG secretion and proliferation of anti-CD3 beads treated T cells. Interestingly, IL18 costimulation could expand purified CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells. However, CD8 T cells proliferated greater than CD4 T cells in magnitude within bulk T cells, suggesting CD4 help effect was involved. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we confirmed that IL18-driven expansion was both TCR and IL18 receptor (IL18R) dependent. Importantly, we demonstrated that TCR-deficient, IL18-expressing CD19 CART cells exhibited remarkable proliferation and persistent antitumor activity against CD19-expressing tumor cells in vivo, without eliciting any detectable GVHD symptom. Finally, we describe APACHE T cells, a novel strategy for coupling IL18 expression in CART cells to antigen stimulation, thereby limiting potential toxicity associated with persistent IL18 production. In sum, our study supports human IL18 as a T cell costimulatory cytokine for fueling CART therapy.",

    "abstract": "In this study we used age at onset of Alzheimers disease (AD), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) datasets to identify candidate causal genes and mechanisms underlying AD GWAS loci. In a genome-wide survival analysis of 40,255 samples, eight of the previously reported AD risk loci are significantly (P < 5x10-8) or suggestively (P < 1x10-5) associated with age at onset-defined survival (AAOS) and a further fourteen novel loci reached suggestive significance. Using stratified LD score regression we demonstrated a significant enrichment of AD heritability in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage. We then investigated the impact of these 22 AAOS-associated variants on CSF biomarkers and gene expression in cells of the myeloid lineage. In particular, the minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, shows association with higher age at onset of AD (P=8.40x10-6), higher CSF levels of A{beta}42 (P=1.2x10-4), and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes (P=1.50x10-105) and macrophages (P=6.41x10-87). SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability is enriched within the SPI1 cistromes of monocytes and macrophages, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in the etiology of AD. Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels are correlated with phagocytic activity of BV2 mouse microglial cells and specific changes in the expression of multiple myeloid-expressed genes, including the mouse orthologs of AD-associated genes, APOE, CLU/APOJ, CD33, MS4A4A/MS4A6A, and TYROBP.
