    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation whose contribution to disease susceptibility remains to be fully understood. Here, we present a novel Bayesian smoothing approach (called ABBA) to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS). We also show how this approach can be leveraged to identify disease-associated changes in DNA methylation, suggesting mechanisms through which these alterations might affect disease. From a data modeling perspective, ABBA has the distinctive feature of automatically adapting to different correlation structures in CpG methylation levels across the genome whilst taking into account the distance between CpG sites as a covariate. Our simulation study shows that ABBA has greater power to detect DMRs than existing methods, providing an accurate identification of DMRs in the large majority of simulated cases. To empirically demonstrate the methods efficacy in generating biological hypotheses, we performed WGBS of primary macrophages derived from an experimental rat system of glomerulonephritis and used ABBA to identify >1,000 disease-associated DMRs. Investigation of these DMRs revealed differential DNA methylation localized to a 600bp region in the promoter of the Ifitm3 gene. This was confirmed by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses, showing differential transcription factor binding at the Ifitm3 promoter by JunD (an established determinant of glomerulonephritis) and a consistent change in Ifitm3 expression. Our ABBA analysis allowed us to propose a new role for Ifitm3 in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis via a mechanism involving promoter hypermethylation that is associated with Ifitm3 repression in the rat strain susceptible to glomerulonephritis.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is thought to be the principal mechanism underlying learning in the brain. Models of plastic networks typically combine point neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as the learning rule. However, a point neuron does not capture the complexity of dendrites, which allow non-linear local processing of the synaptic inputs. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that STDP is not the only learning rule available to neurons. Implementing biophysically realistic neuron models, we studied how dendrites allow for multiple synaptic plasticity mechanisms to coexist in a single cell. In these models, we compared the conditions for STDP and for the synaptic strengthening by local dendritic spikes. We further explored how the connectivity between two cells is affected by these plasticity rules and the synaptic distributions. Finally, we show how memory retention in associative learning can be prolonged in networks of neurons with dendrites.",

When auditory stimuli are absent, A1 becomes hyperactive, while A1 responses to auditory stimuli are reduced. Such activation pattern of A1 responses during auditory hallucination is consistent with aberrant gamma rhythms in schizophrenia observed during auditory tasks, raising the possibility that the pathology underlying abnormal gamma rhythms can account for auditory hallucination. Moreover, A1 receives top-down signals in the gamma frequency band from an adjacent association area (Par2), and cholinergic modulation regulates interactions between A1 and Par2. In this study, we utilized a computational model of A1 to ask if disrupted cholinergic modulation could underlie abnormal gamma rhythms in schizophrenia. Furthermore, based on our simulation results, we propose potential pathology by which A1 can directly contribute to auditory hallucination.",

    "abstract": "High-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) is an emerging brain imaging technique that can permit investigating fast dynamics of cortical electrical activity in the healthy and the diseased human brain. Its applications are however currently limited by a number of methodological issues, among which the difficulty in obtaining accurate source localizations. In particular, these issues have so far prevented EEG studies from showing brain networks similar to those previously detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, we report for the first time a robust detection of brain networks from resting state (256-channel) hdEEG recordings. Specifically, we obtained 14 networks previously described in fMRI studies by means of realistic 12-layer head models and eLORETA source localization, together with ICA for functional connectivity analysis. Our analyses revealed three important methodological aspects. First, brain network reconstruction can be improved by performing source localization using the cortex as source space, instead of the whole brain. Second, conducting EEG connectivity analyses in individual space rather than on concatenated datasets may be preferable, as it permits to incorporate realistic information on head modeling and electrode positioning. Third, the use of a wide frequency band leads to an unbiased and generally accurate reconstruction of several network maps, whereas filtering data in a narrow frequency band may enhance the detection of specific networks and penalize that of others. We hope that our methodological work will contribute to rise of hdEEG as a powerful tool for brain research.",

Although locomotion-induced vasoactive intestinal polypeptide positive (VIP) interneuron depolarization can account for the reduction of surround suppression, the functions of VIP cell depolarization are not fully understood. Here we utilize a firing rate model and a computational model to elucidate the potential functions of VIP cell depolarization during locomotion. Our analyses suggest 1) that surround suppression sharpens the visual responses in V1 to a stationary scene, 2) that depolarized VIP cells enhance V1 responses to moving objects by reducing self-induced surround suppression and 3) that during locomotion V1 neuron responses to some features of the moving objects can be selectively enhanced. Thus, VIP cells regulate surround suppression to allow pyramidal neurons to optimally encode visual information independent of behavioral state.",

Previously, the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio was identified as a direct effector of Gq that acts in parallel to the canonical Gq effector phospholipase C. Here we examine how Trio and Rho act to stimulate neuronal activity downstream of Gq in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Through two forward genetic screens, we identify the cation channels NCA-1 and NCA-2, orthologs of mammalian NALCN, as downstream targets of the Gq/Rho pathway. By performing genetic epistasis analysis using dominant activating mutations and recessive loss-of-function mutations in the members of this pathway, we show that NCA-1 and NCA-2 act downstream of Gq in a linear pathway. Through cell-specific rescue experiments, we show that function of these channels in head acetylcholine neurons is sufficient for normal locomotion in C. elegans. Our results suggest that NCA-1 and NCA-2 are physiologically relevant targets of neuronal Gq-Rho signaling in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the \\\"hidden\\\" portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron r' to a post-synaptic neuron r can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from r' to r plus corrections from every directed path from r' to r through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have--or do not have--major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for the impact of hidden units in random networks with \\\"strong\\\" coupling--connection weights that scale with [Formula], where N is the network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.",

    "abstract": "An explosion in the number of available genome sequences obtained through metagenomics and single-cell genomics has enabled a new view of the diversity of microbial life, yet we know surprisingly little about how microbes interact with each other or their environment. In fact, the majority of microbial species remain uncultivated, while our perception of their ecological niches is based on reconstruction of their metabolic potential. In this work, we demonstrate how the \\\"seed set framework\\\", which computes the set of compounds that an organism must acquire from its environment (1), enables computational analysis of metabolic reconstructions, while providing new insights into a microbes metabolic capabilities, such as nutrient use and auxotrophies. We apply this framework to members of the ubiquitous freshwater Actinobacterial lineage acI, confirming and extending previous experimental and genomic observations implying that acI bacteria are heterotrophs reliant on peptides and saccharides. We also present the first metatranscriptomic study of the acI lineage, revealing high expression of transport proteins and the light-harvesting protein actinorhodopsin. Putative transport proteins complement predictions of nutrients and essential metabolites while providing additional support to the hypothesis that members of the acI are photoheterotrophs.\\n\\nImportanceThe metabolic activity of uncultivated microorganisms contributes to numerous ecosystem processes, ranging from nutrient cycling in the environment to influencing human health and disease. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the assembly of genomes for these microorganisms, but our ability to generate reference genomes far outstrips our ability to analyze them. Common approaches to analyzing microbial metabolism require reconstructing the entirety of an organisms metabolic pathways, or performing targeted searches for genes involved in a specific process. This paper presents a third approach, in which draft metabolic reconstructions are used to identify compounds through which an organism may interact with its environment. These compounds can then guide more intensive metabolic reconstruction efforts, and also provide new hypotheses about the specific contributions microbes make to ecosystem-scale metabolic processes.",

    "abstract": "The duplication of genes can occur through various mechanisms and is thought to make a major contribution to the evolutionary diversification of organisms. There is increasing evidence for a large-scale duplication of genes in some chelicerate lineages including two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD) in horseshoe crabs. To investigate this further we sequenced and analyzed the genome of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We found pervasive duplication of both coding and non-coding genes in this spider, including two clusters of Hox genes. Analysis of synteny conservation across the P. tepidariorum genome suggests that there has been an ancient WGD in spiders. Comparison with the genomes of other chelicerates, including that of the newly sequenced bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, suggests that this event occurred in the common ancestor of spiders and scorpions and is probably independent of the WGDs in horseshoe crabs. Furthermore, characterization of the sequence and expression of the Hox paralogs in P. tepidariorum suggests that many have been subject to neofunctionalization and/or subfunctionalization since their duplication, and therefore may have contributed to the diversification of spiders and other pulmonate arachnids.",

    "abstract": "Massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable unprecedented opportunities to test for regulatory activity of thousands of regulatory sequences. However, MPRA only assay a subset of the genome thus limiting their applicability for genome-wide functional annotations. To overcome this limitation, we have used existing MPRA datasets to train a machine learning model that uses DNA sequence information, regulatory motif annotations, evolutionary conservation, and epigenomic information to predict genomic regions that show enhancer activity when tested in MPRA assays. We used the resulting model to generate global predictions of regulatory activity at single-nucleotide resolution across 14 million common variants. We find that genetic variants with stronger predicted regulatory activity show significantly lower minor allele frequency, indicative of evolutionary selection within the human population. They also show higher over-lap with eQTL annotations across multiple tissues relative to the background SNPs, indicating that their perturbations in vivo more frequently result in changes in gene expression. In addition, they are more frequently associated with trait-associated SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), enabling us to prioritize genetic variants that are more likely to be causal based on their predicted regulatory activity. Lastly, we use our model to compare MPRA inferences across cell types and platforms and to prioritize the assays most predictive of MPRA assay results, including cell-dependent DNase hypersensitivity sites and transcription factors known to be active in the tested cell types. Our results indicate that high-throughput testing of thousands of putative regions, coupled with regulatory predictions across millions of sites, presents a powerful strategy for systematic annotation of genomic regions and genetic variants.",

The isolated target remains intact and is ideally suited for optical genome mapping and long-read sequencing at high coverage.

    "abstract": "Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are an abundant and functionally diverse class of eukaryotic transcripts. Reported lincRNA repertoires in mammals vary, but are commonly in the thousands to tens of thousands of transcripts, covering ~90% of the genome. In addition to elucidating function, there is particular interest in understanding the origin and evolution of lincRNAs. Aside from mammals, lincRNA populations have been sparsely sampled, precluding evolutionary analyses focused on lincRNA emergence and persistence. Here we present Evolinc, a two-module pipeline designed to facilitate lincRNA discovery and characterize aspects of lincRNA evolution. The first module (Evolinc-I) is a lincRNA identification workflow that also facilitates downstream differential expression analysis and genome browser visualization of identified lincRNAs. The second module (Evolinc-II) is a genomic and transcriptomic comparative analyses workflow that determines the phylogenetic depth to which a lincRNA locus is conserved within a user-defined group of related species. Evolinc-II builds families of homologous lincRNA loci, aligns constituent sequences, infers gene trees, and then uses gene tree / species tree reconciliation to reconstruct evolutionary processes such as gain, loss, or duplication of the locus. Here we demonstrate that Evolinc-I is agnostic to target organism by validating against previously annotated Arabidopsis and human lincRNA data. Using Evolinc-II, we examine ways in which conservation can rapidly be used to winnow down large lincRNA datasets to a small set of candidates for functional analysis. Finally, we show how Evolinc-II can be used to recover the evolutionary history of a known lincRNA, the human telomerase RNA (TERC). The analyses revealed unexpected duplication events as well as the loss and subsequent acquisition of a novel TERC locus in the lineage leading to mice and rats. The Evolinc pipeline is currently integrated in CyVerses Discovery Environment and is free to use by researchers.",

    "abstract": "Stratifying healthy and malignant phenotypes and identifying their biological states using high-throughput molecular data has been the focus of many computational approaches during the last decade. Using multivariate changes in expression of genes within biological pathways, as fingerprints of complex phenotypes, we developed a new methodology for Similarity Identification in Gene expressioN (SIGN). In this approach, we use centroid classifier to identify phenotype of each biological sample. To obtain similarity of a given biological sample with classes of phenotypes, we defined a new distance measure, transcriptional similarity coefficient (TSC) which captures similarity of gene expression patterns between a biological pathway in two samples or populations. We showed that TSC, as an interpretable and stable distance measure in SIGN, captures all oncogenic hallmarks for breast cancer even with low sample size, by comparing healthy and patient tumor samples in the largest breast cancer dataset. In this study, we demonstrate that SIGN is a flexible, yet robust approach for classification based on transcriptomics data. Comparing early and late relapses within each molecular subtypes of breast cancer, our method enabled subtype-specific stratification of breast cancer patients into groups with significantly different survival. Moreover, we used SIGN to classify with more than 99% specificity the site of extraction of healthy and tumor samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. We showed that SIGN also enables robust identification of hematopoietic stem cell and progenitors within the hematopoietic hierarchy. We further explored chemical perturbation data in the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database and showed that SIGN was able to classify seven classes of drugs based on their mechanism of action. In conclusion, we showed that SIGN can be used to achieve interpretable and robust transcriptomic-based classification of healthy and malignant samples, as well as drugs based on their known mechanism of action, supporting the generalizability and relevance of the method for the analysis of gene expression profiles.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementNEK1 kinase regulates the assembly and function of the meiosis I spindle by phosphorylating -adducin (ADD1) and thereby facilitating its interaction with Myosin X (MYO10)\\n\\nAbstractNIMA-related kinase 1 (NEK1) is a serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in mammalian germ cells. Mutations in Nek1 induce anemia, polycystic kidney and infertility. In this study we evaluated the role of NEK1 in meiotic spindle formation in both male and female gametes. Our results show that the lack of NEK1 provokes an abnormal organization of the meiosis I spindle characterized by elongated and/or multipolar spindles, and abnormal chromosome congression. The aberrant spindle structure is concomitant with the disruption in localization and protein levels of myosin X (MYO10) and -adducin (ADD1), both of which are implicated in the regulation of spindle formation during mitosis. Interaction of ADD1 with MYO10 is dependent on phosphorylation, whereby phosphorylation of ADD1 enables its binding to MYO10 on mitotic spindles. Reduction in ADD1 protein in NEK1 mutant mice is associated with hyperphosphorylation of ADD1, thereby preventing the interaction with MYO10 during meiotic spindle formation. Our results reveal a novel regulatory role for NEK1 in the regulation of spindle architecture and function during meiosis.",

    "abstract": "During meiotic prophase, a structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) assembles at the interface between aligned pairs of homologous chromosomes, and crossover recombination events occur between their DNA molecules. Here we investigate the inter-relationships between these two hallmark features of the meiotic program in the nematode C. elegans, revealing dynamic properties of the SC that are modulated by recombination. We demonstrate that the SC incorporates new subunits and switches from a more highly dynamic/labile state to a more stable state as germ cells progress through the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase. We further show that the more dynamic state of the SC is prolonged in mutants where meiotic recombination is impaired. Moreover, in meiotic mutants where recombination intermediates are present in limiting numbers, SC central region subunits become preferentially stabilized on the subset of chromosome pairs that harbor a site where pro-crossover factors COSA-1 and MutS{gamma} are concentrated. Polo-like kinase PLK-2 becomes preferentially localized to the SCs of chromosome pairs harboring recombination sites prior to the enrichment of SC central region proteins on such chromosomes, and PLK-2 is required for this enrichment to occur. Further, late pachytene nuclei in a plk-2 mutant exhibit the more highly dynamic SC state. Together our data demonstrate that crossover recombination events elicit chromosome-autonomous stabilizing effects on the SC and implicate PLK-2 in this process. We discuss how this recombination-triggered modulation of SC state might contribute to regulatory mechanisms that operate during meiosis to ensure the formation of crossovers while at the same time limiting their numbers.",

    "abstract": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signalling cascade is conserved across evolution and plays an important role in development and disease. In the absence of Hh, activity of the key signal transducer Smoothened (Smo) is downregulated by the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc). However, the mechanisms underlying this inhibition, and especially its release upon ligand stimulation, are still poorly understood, in part because tools for directly following Smo activation at the subcellular level were long lacking. Here we present a high throughput, cell culture assay based on a fluorescent sensor for Drosophila Smo phosphorlyation. Using this approach we could first demonstrate that the graded response to increasing Hh levels observed at the population level can be traced back to threshold responses of individual cells exhibiting differential Hh sensitivity. Second, we screened a small molecule inhibitor library for regulators of Smo phosphorylation. We observed increased Smo sensor fluorescence with compounds aimed at two major target groups, the MAPK signalling cascade and polo and aurora kinases. Biochemical validation confirmed the screen results for selected inhibitors (dobrafenib, tak-733, volasertib) and revealed differences in the mode of Smo activation, demonstrating that the assay is in principle suitable for dissecting the cell biological basis of Hh pathway activation.",

However, there is a scarcity of -omics data for understanding the organism at a molecular level. Our present study decodes the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of A. assamensis and presents comparative analysis with other lepidopterans. Mitogenome is a 15,272 bp long AT rich (~80.2%) molecule containing 37 genes (13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs) and a 328 bp long control region. The overall mitogenome arrangement was similar to the other lepidopterans. Two PCGs cox1 and cox2 were found to have CGA and GTG as start codons respectively like some lepidopterans. Typical clover-leaf shaped secondary structures of tRNAs were found with a few exceptions such as unstable DHU and T{Psi}C loop in tRNASer1 and tRNATyr; significant number of mismatches (35) spread over 19 tRNAs. The control region contained a six bp deletion atypical of other Antheraea species. Phylogenetic position was consistent with the traditional taxonomic classification of Saturniidae. The complete annotated mitogenome is available in GenBank (Accession No. KU379695). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on complete mitogenome of A. assamensis.",

    "abstract": "Our behavior entails a flexible and context-sensitive interplay between brain areas to integrate information according to goal-directed requirements. How-ever, the neural mechanisms governing the entrainment of functionally specialized brain areas remain poorly understood. In particular, the question arises whether observed changes in the regional activity for different cognitive conditions are explained by modifications of the inputs to the brain or its connectivity? We observe that transitions of fMRI activity between areas convey information about the tasks performed by 19 subjects, watching a movie versus a black screen (rest). We use a model-based framework that explains this spatiotemporal functional connectivity pattern by the local variability for 66 cortical regions and the network effective connectivity between them. We find that, among the estimated model parameters, movie viewing affects to a larger extent the local activity, which we interpret as extrinsic changes related to the increased stimulus load. However, detailed changes in the effective connectivity preserve a balance in the propagating activity and select specific pathways such that high-level brain regions integrate visual and auditory information, in particular boosting the communication between the two brain hemispheres. These findings speak to a dynamic coordination underlying the functional integration in the brain.",

Bacteria regulate their gene expression based on the inferred state of the environment. This raises the question whether the phenotypes of neighboring cells can become correlated through interactions via the shared microenvironment. Here, we addressed this question by following gene expression dynamics in Escherichia coli microcolonies. We observed strong spatial correlations in the expression dynamics for pathways involved in toxin production, SOS-stress response, and metabolism. These correlations can partly be explained by a combination of shared lineage history and spatial gradients in the colony. Interestingly, we also found evidence for cell-cell interactions in SOS-stress response, methionine biosynthesis and overall metabolic activity. Together our data suggests that intercellular feedbacks can couple the phenotypes of neighboring cells, raising the question whether gene-regulatory networks have evolved to spatially organize biological functions.",

    "abstract": "A recurrent question within oncology drug development is predicting phase III outcome for a new treatment using early clinical data. One approach to tackle this problem has been to derive metrics from mathematical models that describe tumour size dynamics termed re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth. They have shown to be strong predictors of overall survival in numerous studies but there is debate about how these metrics are derived and if they are more predictive than empirical end-points. This work explores the issues raised in using model-derived metric as predictors for survival analyses. Re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth were calculated for three large clinical studies by forward and reverse alignment. The latter involves re-aligning patients to their time of progression. Hence it accounts for the time taken to estimate re-growth rate and time to tumour re-growth but also assesses if these predictors correlate to survival from the time of progression. We found that neither re-growth rate nor time to tumour re-growth correlated to survival using reverse alignment. This suggests that the dynamics of tumours up until disease progression has no relationship to survival post progression. For prediction of a phase III trial we found the metrics performed no better than empirical end-points. These results highlight that care must be taken when relating dynamics of tumour imaging to survival and that bench-marking new approaches to existing ones is essential.",

This presents a number of challenges in context of how drone use might impact nearby wildlife. Interactions between birds and drones naturally come to mind, since they share the airspace. This paper details initial findings on the interactions between drones and birds for a range of waterbird, passerine and raptor species, across of a range of scientific applications and natural environments. The primary aims of this paper are to provide guidance for those planning or undertaking drone monitoring exercises, as well as provide direction for future research into safe and effective monitoring with drones. Our study sites we all located within Australia and spanned a range of arid, semi-arid, dunefield, floodplain, wetland, woodland, forest, coastal heath and urban environments. We particularly focus on behavioral changes towards drones during breeding season, interactions with raptors, and effects on nesting birds in large colonies - three areas yet to be explored in published literature. In over 70 hours of flight, there were no incidents with birds. Although some aggressive behavior was encountered from solitary breeding birds. Several large breeding bird colonies were surveyed, and included in our observations is monitoring and counting of nests in a colony of over 200,000 Straw-necked Ibis, the largest drone-based bird monitoring exercise to date. In addition to providing observations of interactions with specific bird species, we recommend procedures for flight planning, safe flying and avoidance. This paper also provides a basis for a number of critical and emerging areas of research into bird-drone interactions, most notably, territorial breeding birds, safety around large raptors, and the effect of drones on the behaviour of birds in large breeding colonies.",

The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to iteratively track backwards from the potential neuronal termini to the soma centre. An online confidence score is computed to decide if a tracing iteration should be stopped and discarded from the final reconstruction. The performance improvements comparing to the previous methods are mainly introduced by a more accurate estimation of the traced area and the confidence controlled back-tracking algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports large-scale batch-processing by requiring only one hyper-parameter for background segmentation. We bench-tested the proposed algorithm on the images obtained from both the DIADEM challenge and the BigNeuron challenge. Our proposed algorithm achieved the state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "Biogenesis of the outer membrane (OM) in Gram-negative bacteria, which is essential for viability, requires the coordinated transport and assembly of proteins and lipids, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and phospholipids (PLs), into the membrane. While pathways for LPS and OM protein assembly are well-studied, how PLs are transported to and from the OM is not clear. Mechanisms that ensure OM stability and homeostasis are also unknown. The trans-envelope Tol-Pal complex, whose physiological role has remained elusive, is important for OM stability. Here, we establish that the Tol-Pal complex is required for PL transport and OM lipid homeostasis in Escherichia coli. Cells lacking the complex exhibit defects in lipid asymmetry and accumulate excess phospholipids (PLs) in the OM. This imbalance in OM lipids is due to defective retrograde PL transport in the absence of a functional Tol-Pal complex. Thus, cells ensure the assembly of a stable OM by maintaining an excess flux of PLs to the OM only to return the surplus to the inner membrane. Our findings also provide insights into the mechanism by which the Tol-Pal complex may promote OM invagination during cell division.",

    "abstract": "The availability of electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotypes allows for genome-wide association analyses in thousands of traits, and has great potential to identify novel genetic variants associated with clinical phenotypes. We can interpret the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) result for a single genetic variant by observing its association across a landscape of phenotypes. Since PheWAS can test 1000s of binary phenotypes, and most of them have unbalanced (case:control = 1:10) or often extremely unbalanced (case:control = 1:600) case-control ratios, existing methods cannot provide an accurate and scalable way to test for associations. Here we propose a computationally fast score test-based method that estimates the distribution of the test statistic using the saddlepoint approximation. Our method is much faster than the state of the art Firths test ([~] 100 times). It can also adjust for covariates and control type I error rates even when the case-control ratio is extremely unbalanced. Through application to PheWAS data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative, we show that the proposed method can control type I error rates while replicating previously known association signals even for traits with a very small number of cases and a large number of controls.",

Oceanic fronts are widespread mesoscale features, present in the boundary between different water masses, and are arguably the best potential examples of ecotones in the ocean. Here we performed the first seasonal study along an oceanic front, combining 16S rRNA gene sequencing coupled with a high spatial resolution analysis of the physical properties of the water masses. Using the Subtropical Frontal Zone off New Zealand we demonstrate that fronts delimit shifts in bacterioplankton community composition between water masses, but that the strength of this effect is seasonally dependent. While creating a transition zone where physicochemical parameters and bacterioplankton communities get mixed, this ecotone does not result in increased diversity. Thus unlike terrestrial ecotones, oceanic ecotones like fronts are boundaries but not hotspot of bacterioplankton diversity in the ocean.",

    "abstract": "Chronic extracellular recordings are a powerful tool for systems neuroscience, but spike sorting remains a challenge. A common approach is to fit a generative model, such as a mixture of Gaussians, to the observed spike data. Even if non-parametric methods are used for spike sorting, such generative models provide a quantitative measure of unit isolation quality, which is crucial for subsequent interpretation of the sorted spike trains. We present a spike sorting strategy that models the data as a mixture of drifting t-distributions. This model captures two important features of chronic extracellular recordings--cluster drift over time and heavy tails in the distribution of spikes--and offers improved robustness to outliers. We evaluate this model on several thousand hours of chronic tetrode recordings and show that it fits the empirical data substantially better than a mixture of Gaussians. We also provide a software implementation that can re-fit long datasets (several hours, millions of spikes) in a few seconds, enabling interactive clustering of chronic recordings. Using experimental data, we identify three common failure modes of spike sorting methods that assume stationarity. We also characterize the limitations of several popular unit isolation metrics in the presence of empirically-observed variations in cluster size and scale. We find that the mixture of drifting t-distributions model enables efficient spike sorting of long datasets and provides an accurate measure of unit isolation quality over a wide range of conditions.",

    "abstract": "In the classic gain/loss framing effect, describing a gamble as a potential gain or loss biases people to make risk-averse or risk-seeking decisions, respectively. The canonical explanation for this effect is that frames differentially modulate emotional processes - which in turn leads to irrational choice behavior. Here, we evaluate the source of framing biases by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 143 human participants performing a gain/loss framing task with meta-analytic data from over 8000 neuroimaging studies. We found that activation during choices consistent with the framing effect were most correlated with activation associated with the resting or default brain, while activation during choices inconsistent with the framing effect most correlated with the task-engaged brain. Our findings argue against the common interpretation of gain/loss framing as a competition between emotion and control. Instead, our study indicates that this effect results from differential cognitive engagement across decision frames.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe biases frequently exhibited by human decision-makers have often been attributed to the presence of emotion. Using a large fMRI sample and analysis of whole-brain networks defined with the meta-analytic tool Neurosynth, we find that neural activity during frame-biased decisions are more significantly associated with default behaviors (and the absence of executive control) than with emotion. These findings point to a role for neuroscience in shaping longstanding psychological theories in decision science.",

    "abstract": "Brain computations depend on how neurons transform inputs to spike outputs. Here, to understand input-output transformations in cortical networks, we recorded spiking responses from visual cortex (V1) of awake mice of either sex while pairing sensory stimuli with optogenetic perturbation of excitatory and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons. We found V1 neurons average responses were primarily additive (linear). We used a recurrent cortical network model to determine if these data, as well as past observations of nonlinearity, could be described by a common circuit architecture. The model showed cortical input-output transformations can be changed from linear to sublinear with moderate ([~]20%) strengthening of connections between inhibitory neurons, but this change depends on the presence of feedforward inhibition. Thus, feedforward inhibition, a common feature of cortical circuitry, enables networks to flexibly change their spiking responses via changes in recurrent connectivity.\\n\\nSignificance statementBrains are made up of neural networks that process information by receiving input activity and transforming those inputs into output activity. We use optogenetic manipulations in awake mice to expose how a transformation in a cortical network depends on internal network activity. Combining numerical simulations with our observations uncovers that transformation depend critically on feedforward inhibition - the fact that inputs to the cortex often make strong connections on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.",

    "abstract": "Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens in natura is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease, and from the computationally intractable number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a fragmented landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (Plum pox virus) surveyed for 15 years over 600 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of the flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. Most infectious aphids leaving a tree land beyond the bounds of a 1-ha orchard (50% of flights terminate within about 90 m). Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare (10% of flights exceed 1 km). By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphids dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn spatial epidemiology, dispersal kernels quantify how the probability of pathogen dissemination varies with distance. Spatial models of pathogen spread are sensitive to kernel parameters; yet these parameters have rarely been estimated using field data gathered at relevant scales. Robust estimation is rendered difficult by practical constraints limiting the number of surveyed individuals, and uncertainties concerning their disease status. Here, we present a framework that overcomes these barriers and permits inference for a between-patch transmission model. Extensive simulations show that dispersal kernels can be estimated from epidemiological surveillance data. When applied to such data collected from more than 600 orchards during 15 years of a plant virus epidemic our approach enables the estimation of the dispersal kernel of infectious winged aphids. This kernel is long-tailed, as 50% of the infectious aphids leaving a tree terminate their infectious flight within 90 m and 10% beyond 1 km. This first estimate of flight distances at the landscape scale for aphids-a group of vectors transmitting numerous viruses-is crucial for the science-based design of control strategies targeting plant virus epidemics.",

    "abstract": "The Honghe-Hani landscape in China is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site due to the beauty of its thousands of rice terraces, but these structures are in danger from the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish dig nest holes, which collapse terrace walls and destroy rice production. Under the current control strategy, farmers self-report crayfish and are issued pesticide, but this strategy is not expected to eradicate the crayfish nor to prevent their spread since farmers are not able to detect small numbers of crayfish. Thus, we tested whether environmental DNA (eDNA) from paddy-water samples could provide a sensitive detection method. In an aquarium experiment, Real-time Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) successfully detected crayfish, even at a simulated density of one crayfish per average-sized paddy (with one false negative). In a field test, we tested eDNA and bottle traps against direct counts of crayfish. eDNA successfully detected crayfish in all 25 paddies where crayfish were observed and in none of the 7 paddies where crayfish were absent. Bottle-trapping was successful in only 68% of the crayfish-present paddies. eDNA concentrations also correlated positively with crayfish counts. In sum, these results suggest that single samples of eDNA are able to detect small crayfish populations, but not perfectly. Thus, we conclude that a program of repeated eDNA sampling is now feasible and likely reliable for measuring crayfish geographic range and for detecting new invasion fronts in the Honghe Hani landscape, which would inform regional control efforts and help to prevent the further spread of this invasive crayfish.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSusceptibility genes for psychiatric and neurological disorders - including APOE, BDNF, CLU,CNTNAP2, COMT, DISC1, DTNBP1, ErbB4, HFE, NRG1, NTKR3, and ZNF804A - have been reported to affect white matter (WM) microstructure in the healthy human brain, as assessed through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes explain only a small fraction of the overall variance and are challenging to detect reliably in single cohort studies. To date, few studies have evaluated the reproducibility of these results. As part of the ENIGMA-DTI consortium, we pooled regional fractional anisotropy (FA) measures for 6,165 subjects (CEU ancestry N=4,458) from 11 cohorts worldwide to evaluate effects of 15 candidate SNPs by examining their associations with WM microstructure. Additive association tests were conducted for each SNP. We used several meta-analytic and mega-analytic designs, and we evaluated regions of interest at multiple granularity levels. The ENIGMA-DTI protocol was able to detect single-cohort findings as originally reported. Even so, in this very large sample, no significant associations remained after multiple-testing correction for the 15 SNPs investigated. Suggestive associations (1.3x10-4 < p < 0.05, uncorrected) were found for BDNF, COMT, and ZNF804A in specific tracts. Meta-and mega-analyses revealed similar findings. Regardless of the approach, the previously reported candidate SNPs did not show significant associations with WM microstructure in this largest genetic study of DTI to date; the negative findings are likely not due to insufficient power. Genome-wide studies, involving large-scale meta-analyses, may help to discover SNPs robustly influencing WM microstructure.",

    "abstract": "Research Data Management (RDM) presents an unusual challenge for service providers in Higher Education. There is increased awareness of the need for training in this area but the nature of discipline-specific practices involved make it difficult to provide training across a multi-disciplinary organisation. Whilst most UK universities now have a research data team of some description, they are often small and rarely have the resources necessary to provide targeted training to the different disciplines and research career stages that they are increasingly expected to support.\\n\\nThis practice paper describes the approach taken at the University of Cambridge to address this problem by creating a community of Data Champions. This collaborative initiative, working with researchers to provide training and advocacy for good RDM practice, allows for more discipline-specific training to be given, researchers to be credited for their expertise and an opportunity for those interested in RDM to exchange knowledge with others. The  community of practice model has been used in many sectors, including Higher Education, to facilitate collaboration across organisational units and this initiative will adopt some of the same principles to improve communication across a decentralised institution. The Data Champions initiative at Cambridge was launched in September 2016 and this paper reports on the early months, plans for building the community in the future and the possible risks associated with this approach to providing RDM services.",
