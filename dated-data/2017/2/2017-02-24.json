    "abstract": "Ongoing speciation in most African malaria vectors gives rise to cryptic populations, which differ remarkably in their behaviour, ecology and capacity to vector malaria parasites. Understanding the population structure and the drivers of genetic differentiation among mosquitoes is critical for effective disease control because heterogeneity within species contribute to variability in malaria cases and allow fractions of vector populations to escape control efforts. To examine the population structure and the potential impacts of recent large-scale control interventions, we have investigated the genomic patterns of differentiation in mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles nili group, a large taxonomic group that diverged [~]3-Myr ago. Using 4343 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we detected strong population structure characterized by high FST values between multiple divergent populations adapted to different habitats within the Central African rainforest. Delineating the cryptic species within the Anopheles nili group is challenging due to incongruence between morphology, ribosomal DNA and SNP markers consistent with incomplete lineage sorting and/or interspecific gene flow. A very high proportion of loci are fixed (FST = 1) within the genome of putative species, which suggests that ecological and/or reproductive barriers are maintained by strong selection on a substantial number of genes.",

    "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a central regulator that turns on vast gene networks to maintain cellular integrity upon various stimuli. p53 activates transcription initiation in part by aiding recruitment of TFIID to the promoter. However, the precise means by which p53 dynamically interacts with TFIID to facilitate assembly on target gene promoters remains elusive. To address this key question, we have undertaken an integrated approach involving single molecule fluorescence microscopy, single particle cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemistry. Our real-time single molecule imaging demonstrates that TFIID alone binds poorly to native p53 target promoters. p53 unlocks TFIIDs ability to bind DNA by increasing TFIID contacts with both the core promoter and a region surrounding p53s response element (RE). Analysis of single molecule dissociation kinetics reveals that TFIID interacts with promoters via transient and prolonged DNA binding modes that are each regulated by p53. Importantly, our structural work reveals that TFIIDs conversion from a canonical form to a rearranged DNA-binding conformation is enhanced in the presence of DNA and p53. Notably, TFIIDs interaction with DNA induces p53 to rapidly dissociate, effectively liberating the RE on the promoter. Collectively, these findings indicate that p53 dynamically escorts and loads the basal transcription machinery onto its target promoters.",

    "abstract": "Here we report the findings from the first two years of an arbovirus surveillance study conducted in Machala, Ecuador, a dengue endemic region (2014-2015). Patients with suspected dengue virus (DENV) infections (index cases, n=324) were referred from five Ministry of Health clinical sites. A subset of DENV positive index cases (n = 44) were selected, and individuals from the index household and four neighboring homes within 200-meters were recruited (n = 400). Individuals who entered the study, other than index cases, are referred to as associates. In 2014, 70.9% of index cases and 35.6% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. In 2015, 28.3% of index cases and 12.8% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. For every DENV infection captured by passive surveillance, we detected an additional three acute or recent DENV infections in associates. Of associates with acute DENV infections, 68% reported dengue-like symptoms, with the highest prevalence of symptomatic acute infections in children under 10 years of age. The first chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections were detected on epidemiological week 12 in 2015. 43.1% of index cases and 3.5% of associates had acute CHIKV infections. No Zika virus infections were detected. Phylogenetic analyses of isolates of DENV from 2014 revealed genetic relatedness and shared ancestry of DENV1, DENV2 and DENV4 genomes from Ecuador with those from Venezuela and Colombia, indicating presence of viral flow between Ecuador and surrounding countries. Enhanced surveillance studies, such as this, provide high-resolution data on symptomatic and inapparent infections across the population.",

The emergence of new sequencing technologies that generate longer sequence reads can, in theory, provide direct evidence for all types of SVs regardless of the length of region through which it spans. However, current efforts to use these data in this manner require the use of large computational resources to assemble these sequences as well as manual inspection of each region. Here, we present VaPoR, a highly efficient algorithm that autonomously validates large SV sets using long read sequencing data.

    "abstract": "Functional Connectivity (FC) during resting-state or task conditions is not fixed but inherently dynamic. Yet, there is no consensus on whether fluctuations in FC may resemble isolated transitions between discrete FC states rather than continuous changes. This quarrel hampers advancing the study of dynamic FC. This is unfortunate as the structure of fluctuations in FC can certainly provide more information about developmental changes, aging, and progression of pathologies. We merge the two perspectives and consider dynamic FC as an ongoing network reconfiguration, including a stochastic exploration of the space of possible steady FC states. The statistical properties of this random walk deviate both from a purely \"order-driven\" dynamics, in which the mean FC is preserved, and from a purely \"randomness-driven\" scenario, in which fluctuations of FC remain uncorrelated over time. Instead, dynamic FC has a complex structure endowed with long-range sequential correlations that give rise to transient slowing and acceleration epochs in the continuous flow of reconfiguration. Our analysis for fMRI data in healthy elderly revealed that dynamic FC tends to slow down and becomes less complex as well as more random with increasing age. These effects appear to be strongly associated with age-related changes in behavioural and cognitive performance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) at rest and during cognitive task performs a \"complex\" (anomalous) random walk.\nC_LIO_LISpeed of dFC slows down with aging.\nC_LIO_LIResting dFC replaces complexity by randomness with aging.\nC_LIO_LITask performance correlates with the speed and complexity of dFC.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Competitive gene-set analysis, also called enrichment analysis, is a widely used tool for functional interpretation of high-throughput biological data such as gene expression data. It aims at testing a known category (e.g. a pathway) of genes for enriched differential expression (DE) signals compared to genes not in the category. Most enrichment testing methods ignore the widespread correlations among genes, which has been shown to result in excessive false positives. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that existing methods to account for correlations, such as GSEA and CAMERA, can result in severely mis-calibrated type 1 error and/or considerable power loss due to the failure to properly accommodate the DE heterogeneity across genes. We propose MEACA, a new gene-set testing framework based on a mixed effects model. Our method flexibly incorporates the unknown distribution of DE effects, effectively adjusts for completely unknown, unstructured correlations among genes, and does not rely on time-consuming permutations. Compared to existing methods, MEACA enjoys robust type 1 error control in widely ranging scenarios and substantially improves power. Applications of MEACA to a Huntingtons disease study and a lymphoblastoid cell line data set demonstrate its ability to recover biologically meaningful relationships. MEACA is available as an R package.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the hippocampus and adjacent brain areas show a large diversity in their tuning to location and head direction. The underlying circuit mechanisms are not fully resolved. In particular, it is unclear why certain cell types are selective to one spatial variable, but invariant to another. For example, a place cell is highly selective to location, but typically invariant to head direction. Here, we propose that all observed spatial tuning patterns - in both their selectivity and their invariance - are a consequence of the same mechanism: Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity that is driven by the spatial tuning statistics of synaptic inputs. Using simulations and a mathematical analysis, we show that combined excitatory and inhibitory plasticity can lead to localized, grid-like or invariant activity. Combinations of different input statistics along different spatial dimensions reproduce all major spatial tuning patterns observed in rodents. The model is robust to changes in parameters, develops patterns on behavioral time scales and makes distinctive experimental predictions. Our results suggest that the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory plasticity is a general principle for the formation of neural representations.",

Here, we present OMMAwell, a simple, reusable device that makes it easy to mount up to hundreds of embryos in arrays of agarose microwells with customizable dimensions and spacing. OMMAwell can be configured to mount specimens for upright or inverted microscopes, and includes a reservoir to hold live-imaging medium to maintain constant moisture and osmolarity of specimens during time-lapse imaging. All device components can be cut from a sheet of acrylic using a laser cutter. Even a novice user will be able to cut the pieces and assemble the device in less than an hour. At the time of writing, the total materials cost is less than five US dollars. We include all device design files in a commonly used format, as well as complete instructions for its fabrication and use. We demonstrate a detailed workflow for designing a custom mold and employing it to simultaneously live-image dozens of embryos at a time for more than five days, using embryos of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus as an example. Further, we include descriptions, schematics, and design files for molds that can be used with 14 additional vertebrate and invertebrate species, including most major traditional laboratory models and a number of emerging model systems.

It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which Bcl-2 suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase after serum starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells. Based on the fact that ROS mediate cell cycle progression, and are controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{gamma} co-activator 1 (PGC-1), a key molecule induced by prolonged starvation and involved in mitochondrial metabolism, we hypothesized that PGC-1 might be related with the cell cycle function of Bcl-2. Here, we showed that PGC-1 was upregulated upon Bcl-2 overexpression and downregulated following Bcl-2 knockdown during serum starvation. Knockdown of PGC-1 activated Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that after serum depletion, PGC-la might coordinate with Bcl-2 to reduce ROS, which in turn delay cell cycle progression.\\n\\nSummary statementPGC-1 coordinate with Bcl-2 delay cell cycle progression to reduce ROS after serum depletion in human glioma U251 cells.",

Like all macroscopic organisms, it possesses a microbiome which may play critical roles in modulating the interaction of eelgrass with its environment. For example, its leaf surface microbiome could inhibit or attract eukaryotic epibionts which may overgrow the eelgrass leading to reduced primary productivity and subsequent eelgrass meadow decline. We used amplicon sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes to assess the leaf surface microbiome (prokaryotes) as well as eukaryotic epibionts in-and outside lagoons on the German Baltic Sea coast. Bacterial microbiomes varied substantially both between sites inside lagoons and between open coastal and lagoon sites. Water depth, leaf area and biofilm chlorophyll a concentration explained a large amount of variation in both bacterial and eukaryotic community composition. Communities of bacterial and eukaryotic epibionts were highly correlated, and network analysis revealed disproportionate co-occurrence between a limited number of eukaryotic taxa and several bacterial taxa. This suggests that eelgrass leaf surface biofilms are a mosaic of the microbiomes of several eukaryotes, in addition to that of the eelgrass itself, and underlines that eukaryotic microbial diversity should be taken into account in order to explain microbiome assembly and dynamics in aquatic environments.",

Compared to the one of wild populations, the microbiota of laboratory-reared flies is less diverse, and comprises fewer bacterial taxa; nevertheless, the main commensal bacteria found in fly microbiota always belong to the Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae families. The bacterial communities associated with the fly are environmentally acquired, and the partners engage in a perpetual re-association process. Adult flies constantly ingest and excrete microbes from and onto their feeding substrate, which are then transmitted to the next generation developing within this shared habitat. We wanted to analyze the potential changes in the bacterial community during its reciprocal transfer between the two compartments of the niche (i.e. the fly and the diet). To address this question, we used a diverse, wild-derived microbial community and analyzed its relationship with the fly population and the nutritive substrate in a given habitat. Here we show that the community was overall well maintained upon transmission to a new niche, to a new fly population and to their progeny, illustrating the stable association of a Drosophila-derived microbiota with its fly partner and the nutritional environment. These results highlight the preponderant role of the nutritional substrate in the dynamics of Drosophila/microbiota interactions, and the need to fully integrate this variable when performing such studies.",

MTs participate in maturation and traffic of autophagosomes through their dynamic state changes and post-translational modifications of tubulin, including acetylation. We demonstrated the involvement of tobacco cell MTs in the development of starvation-induced autophagy via tubulin acetylation and denitrotyrosination. Induced metabolic stress caused by prolonged cultivation of BY-2 suspension cells results in glucose depletion in the culture medium and following increased rates of protein hydrolysis and autophagy. Development of autophagy was strongly accompanied by -tubulin acetylation and detyrosination. Both post-translational modifications were caused by changes in the molecular microenvironment of the tobacco cell MTs that was revealed via Co-IP assay. The termination of autophagy led to the development of programmed cell death that was characterised by nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and decreases in -tubulin acetylation and detyrosination. Our data suggest the role of the functional state of MTs in the mediation of plant autophagy via changes in the tubulin microenvironment and in its post-translational modifications.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe main findings cover a possible impact of plant microtubular cytoskeleton to starvation-induced autophagy development.

Label-free quantitative shotgun proteomic strategies (including LC-MS ion intensity quantification and spectral counting) are attractive because of their relatively low cost, ease of implementation, and the lack of multiplexing restrictions when comparing multiple samples. Owing to improvements in the resolution and sensitivity of mass spectrometers, and the availability of analytical software packages, protein quantification by LC-MS ion intensity has increased in popularity. Here, we have addressed the importance of chromatographic alignment on protein quantification, and then assessed how spectral counting compares to ion intensity-based proteomic quantification. Using a spiked-in protein strategy, we analysed two situations that commonly arise in the application of proteomics to cell biology: (i) samples with a small number of proteins of differential abundance in a larger non-changing background, and (ii) samples with a larger number of proteins of differential abundance. To perform these assessments on biologically relevant samples, we used isolated integrin adhesion complexes (IACs). Technical replicate analysis of isolated IACs resulted in a range of alignment scores using the Progenesis QI software package and demonstrated that higher LC-MS chromatographic alignment scores increased the precision of protein quantification. Furthermore, implementation of a simple sample batch-running strategy enabled good chromatographic alignment for hundreds of samples over multiple batches. Finally, we applied the sample batch-running strategy and compared quantification by LC-MS ion intensity to spectral counting and found that quantification by LC-MS ion intensity was more accurate and precise. In summary, these results demonstrate that chromatographic alignment is important for precise and accurate protein quantification based on LC-MS ion intensity and accordingly we present a simple sample re-ordering strategy to facilitate improved alignment. These findings are not only relevant to label-free quantification using Progenesis QI but may be useful to the wide range of MS-based quantification strategies that rely on chromatographic alignment.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience has long focused on finding encoding models that effectively ask \\\"what predicts neural spiking?\\\" and generalized linear models (GLMs) are a typical approach. It is often unknown how much of explainable neural activity is captured, or missed, when fitting a GLM. Here we compared the predictive performance of GLMs to three leading machine learning methods: feedforward neural networks, gradient boosted trees (using XGBoost), and stacked ensembles that combine the predictions of several methods. We predicted spike counts in macaque motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices from standard representations of reaching kinematics, and in rat hippocampal cells from open field location and orientation. In general, the modern methods (particularly XGBoost and the ensemble) produced more accurate spike predictions and were less sensitive to the preprocessing of features. This discrepancy in performance suggests that standard feature sets may often relate to neural activity in a nonlinear manner not captured by GLMs. Encoding models built with machine learning techniques, which can be largely automated, more accurately predict spikes and can offer meaningful benchmarks for simpler models.",

We integrated binding data with transcriptome and phased whole genome data to investigate allelic DAP interactions and the impact of heterozygous sequence variation on the expression of neighboring genes. We find our tissue-based dataset demonstrates binding patterns more consistent with liver biology than cell lines, and describe uses of these data to better prioritize impactful non-coding variation.

    "abstract": "Postcopulatory sexual selection (PCSS) is a potent evolutionary force that can drive rapid changes of reproductive genes within species, and thus has the potential to generate reproductive incompatibilities between species. Male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are major players in postmating interactions, and likely the main targets of PCSS in males. The virilis subgroup of Drosophila exhibits strong interspecific gametic incompatibilities, and can serve as a model to study the genetic basis of PCSS and gametic isolation. However, reproductive genes in this group have not been characterized. Here we use short-read RNA sequencing of male reproductive organs to examine the evolutionary dynamics of reproductive genes in members of the virilis subgroup: D. americana, D. lummei, D. novamexicana, and D. virilis. For each of the three male reproductive organs (accessory glands, ejaculatory bulb, and testes), we identify genes that show strong expression bias in a given tissue relative to the remaining tissues. We find that the majority of male reproductive transcripts are testes-biased, accounting for ~15% of all annotated genes. Ejaculatory bulb-biased transcripts largely code for lipid metabolic enzymes, and contain orthologs of the D. melanogaster ejaculatory bulb protein, Peb-me, which is involved in mating-plug formation. In addition, we identify 71 candidate SFPs, and show that this set of genes has the highest rate of nonsynonymous codon substitution relative to testes- and ejaculatory bulb-biased genes. Furthermore, these SFPs are underrepresented on the X chromosome and are enriched for proteolytic enzymes, which is consistent with SFPs in other insect species. Surprisingly, we find 35 D. melanogaster SFPs with conserved accessory gland expression in the virilis group, suggesting these genes may have conserved reproductive roles in Drosophila. Finally, we show that several of the SFPs that have the highest rate of nonsynonymous codon substitutions reside on the centromeric half of chromosome 2, which contributes to paternal gametic incompatibility between species. Our results suggest that SFPs are under strong selection in the virilis group, and likely play a major role in PCSS and/or gametic isolation.",

We observe that 22 out of 29 mutational signatures are significantly impacted by DNA replication. The distinct associations of different signatures with replication timing and direction around origins shed new light on several mutagenic processes, for example suggesting that oxidative damage to the nucleotide pool substantially contributes to the mutational landscape of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

    "abstract": "Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N=1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76%{+/-}13% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N=265) also obtaining a 76% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.",

    "abstract": "Models of hallucinations across disorders emphasise an imbalance between sensory input and top-down influences over perception. However, the psychological and mechanistic correlates of this imbalance remain underspecified. Visual hallucinations in Parkinsons disease (PD) are associated with impairments in lower level visual processes and attention, accompanied by over activity and connectivity in higher-order association brain networks. PD therefore provides an attractive framework to explore the relative contributions of bottom-up versus top-down disturbances in hallucinations. Here, we characterised sensory processing in PD patients with and without visual hallucinations, and in healthy controls, by fitting a hierarchical drift diffusion model (hDDM) to an attentional task. The hDDM uses Bayesian estimates to decompose reaction time and response output into parameters reflecting drift rates of evidence accumulation, decision thresholds and non-decision time. We observed slower drift rates in PD patients with hallucinations, which were insensitive to changes in task demand. In contrast, wider decision boundaries and shorter non-decision times relative to controls were found in PD regardless of hallucinator status. Inefficient and less flexible sensory evidence accumulation emerge as unique features of PD hallucinators. We integrate these results with current models of hallucinations, suggesting that slow and inefficient sensory input in PD is less informative, and may therefore be down-weighted leading to an over reliance on top-down influences. Our findings provide a novel computational framework to better specify the impairments in dynamic sensory processing that are a risk factor for visual hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Non-membrane-bound organelles that behave like liquid droplets are widespread among eukaryotic cells. Their dysregulation appears to be a critical step in several neurodegenerative conditions. Here we report that tau protein, the primary constituent of Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles, can form liquid droplets and therefore has the necessary biophysical properties to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cells. Consonant with the factors that induce LLPS, tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that complexes with RNA to form droplets. Uniquely, the pool of RNAs to which tau binds in living cells are tRNAs. This phase state of tau is held in an approximately 1:1 charge balance across the protein and the nucleic acid constituents, and can thus be maximal at different RNA:tau mass ratios depending on the biopolymer constituents involved. This feature is characteristic of complex coacervation. We furthermore show that the LLPS process is directly and sensitively tuned by salt concentration and temperature, implying it is modulated by both electrostatic interactions between the involved protein and nucleic acid constituents, as well as net changes in entropy. Despite the high protein concentration within the complex coacervate phase, tau is locally freely tumbling and capable of diffusing through the droplet interior. In fact, tau in the condensed phase state does not reveal any immediate changes in local protein packing, local conformations and local protein dynamics from that of tau in the dilute solution state. In contrast, the population of aggregation-prone tau as induced by the complexation with heparin is accompanied by large changes in local tau conformations and irreversible aggregation. However, prolonged residency within the droplet state eventually results in the emergence of detectable {beta}-sheet structures according to thioflavin-T assay. These findings suggest that the droplet state can incubate tau and pre-dispose the protein toward the formation of insoluble fibrils.",

For this purpose, protein transfer onto the surface of polyacrylamide hydrogels must result in geometrically well-resolved micropatterns with homogeneous protein distribution. Yet the outcomes of micropatterning methods have not been pairwise evaluated against these criteria. We report a high-fidelity photoresist lift-off patterning method to pattern ECM proteins on polyacrylamide hydrogels ranging from 5 to 25 kPa. We directly compare the protein transfer efficiency and pattern geometrical accuracy of this protocol to the widely used microcontact printing method. Lift-off patterning achieves higher protein transfer efficiency, increases pattern accuracy, increases pattern yield, and reduces variability of these factors within arrays of patterns as it bypasses the drying and transfer steps of microcontact printing. We demonstrate that lift-off patterned hydrogels successfully control cell size and shape and enable long-term imaging of actin intracellular structure and lamellipodia dynamics when we culture epithelial cells on these substrates.",

Here the oxygen consumption rate in specimens of three-spine stickleback collected from a non-migratory population was quantified with the aim to test if the S. solidus infection drives a change in the oxygen consumption level of the host fish. The results showed that the infected fishes have a higher rate of oxygen consumption compared with the uninfected one.

    "abstract": "Dynactin is a dynein-regulating protein that increases the processivity of dynein movement on microtubules. Recent studies have shown that a tripartite complex of dynein-dynactin-Bicaudal D2 is essential for highly processive movement. To elucidate the regulation of dynein motility by dynactin, we focused on two isoforms (A and B) of dynactin 1 (DCTN1), the largest subunit of dynactin that contains both microtubule- and dynein-binding domains. The only difference between the primary structures of the two isoforms is that DCTN1B lacks the K-rich domain, a cluster of basic residues. We measured dynein motility by single molecule observation of recombinant dynein and dynactin. Whereas the tripartite complex containing DCTN1A exhibited highly processive movement, the complex containing DCTN1B dissociated from microtubules with no apparent processive movement. This inhibitory effect of DCTN1B was caused by reductions of the microtubule-binding affinities of both dynein and dynactin, which is attributed to the coiled-coil 1 domain of DCTN1. In DCTN1A, the K-rich domain antagonized these inhibitory effects. Therefore, dynactin has two antagonistic domains and promotes or suppresses dynein motility to accomplish correct localization and functions of dynein within a cell.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of alternative polyadenylation (APA) as an engine driving transcriptomic diversity has stimulated the development of sequencing methodologies designed to assess genome-wide polyadenylation events. The goal of these approaches is to enrich, partition, capture, and ultimately sequence poly(A) site junctions. However, these methods often require poly(A) enrichment, 3{acute} linker ligation steps, and RNA fragmentation, which can necessitate higher levels of starting RNA, increase experimental error, and potentially introduce bias. We recently reported a click-chemistry based method for generating RNAseq libraries called \\\"ClickSeq\\\". Here, we adapt this method to direct the cDNA synthesis specifically toward the 3{acute} UTR/poly(A) tail junction of cellular RNA. With this novel approach, we demonstrate sensitive and specific enrichment for poly(A) site junctions without the need for complex sample preparation, fragmentation or purification. Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-seq) is therefore a simple procedure that generates high-quality RNA-seq poly(A) libraries. As a proof-of-principle, we utilized PAC-seq to explore the poly(A) landscape of both human and Drosophila cells in culture and observed outstanding overlap with existing poly(A) databases and also identified previously unannotated poly(A) sites. Moreover, we utilize PAC-seq to quantify and analyze APA events regulated by CFIm25 illustrating how this technology can be harnessed to identify alternatively polyadenylated RNA.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making in the real world presents the challenge of requiring flexible yet prompt behavior, a balance that has been characterized in terms of a trade-off between a slower, prospective goal-directed model-based (MB) strategy and a fast, retrospective habitual model-free (MF) strategy. Theory predicts that flexibility to changes in both reward values and transition contingencies can determine the relative influence of the two systems in reinforcement learning, but few studies have manipulated the latter. Therefore, we developed a novel two-level contingency change task in which transition contingencies between states change every few trials; MB and MF control predict different responses following these contingency changes, allowing their relative influence to be inferred. Additionally, we manipulated the rate of contingency changes in order to determine whether contingency change volatility would play a role in shifting subjects between a MB and MF strategy. We found that human subjects employed a hybrid MB/MF strategy on the task, corroborating the parallel contribution of MB and MF systems in reinforcement learning. Further, subjects did not remain at one level of MB/MF behavior but rather displayed a shift towards more MB behavior over the first two blocks that was not attributable to the rate of contingency changes but rather to the extent of training. We demonstrate that flexibility to contingency changes can distinguish MB and MF strategies, with human subjects utilizing a hybrid strategy that shifts towards more MB behavior over blocks, consequently corresponding to a higher payoff.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo make good decisions, we must learn to associate actions with their true outcomes. Flexibility to changes in action/outcome relationships, therefore, is essential for optimal decision-making. For example, actions can lead to outcomes that change in value - one day, your favorite food is poorly made and thus less pleasant. Alternatively, changes can occur in terms of contingencies - ordering a dish of one kind and instead receiving another. How we respond to such changes is indicative of our decision-making strategy; habitual learners will continue to choose their favorite food even if the quality has gone down, whereas goal-directed learners will soon learn it is better to choose another dish. A popular paradigm probes the effect of value changes on decision making, but the effect of contingency changes is still unexplored. Therefore, we developed a novel task to study the latter. We find that humans used a mixed habitual/goal-directed strategy in which they became more goal-directed over the course of the task, and also earned more rewards with increasing goal-directed behavior. This shows that flexibility to contingency changes is adaptive for learning from rewards, and indicates that flexibility to contingency changes can reveal which decision-making strategy is used.",
