    "abstract": "Gaining insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the transcriptional variation observed between individual cells necessitates the development of methods that measure chromatin organization in single cells. Here I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of CTCF binding events and to estimate the average nucleosome phasing distances in single cells. scNOMe-seq is therefore well-suited to characterize the chromatin organization of single cells in heterogeneous cellular mixtures.",

    "abstract": "The most widespread measures of human brain activity are the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and surface field potential. Prior studies report a variety of relationships between these signals. To develop an understanding of how to interpret these signals and the relationship between them, we developed a model of (a) neuronal population responses, and (b) transformations from neuronal responses into the fMRI BOLD signal and electrocorticographic (ECoG) field potential. Rather than seeking a transformation between the two measures directly, this approach interprets each measure with respect to the underlying neuronal population responses. This model accounts for the relationship between BOLD and ECoG data from human visual cortex in V1-V3, with the model predictions and data matching in three ways: Across stimuli, the BOLD amplitude and ECoG broadband power were positively correlated, the BOLD amplitude and alpha power (8-13 Hz) were negatively correlated, and the BOLD amplitude and narrowband gamma power (30-80 Hz) were uncorrelated. The two measures provide complementary information about human brain activity and we infer that features of the field potential that are uncorrelated with BOLD arise largely from changes in synchrony, rather than level, of neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "Gut innate immune defenses contain bacterial populations and protect the host interior from invasive microbes. Although excess intestinal immune activity frequently promotes inflammatory illnesses, we know little about the consequences of chronic innate immune activity exclusively in endodermal gut cells of an otherwise normal animal. To address this question, we generated a transgenic line that allows us to activate inflammatory signals in adult fly intestinal progenitor cells. We found that constitutive immune activity in intestinal progenitors disrupts expression of homeostatic regulators such as Notch signal transduction pathway components and induces hyperplasia throughout the gut. Consistent with these observations, we found that persistent immune signaling interferes with progenitor cell differentiation and exacerbates the formation of Notch-dependent intestinal tumors. These findings uncover a novel link between constitutive immune activity and tumorigenesis in intestinal stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Learning from reward feedback is essential for survival but can become extremely challenging with myriad choice options. Here, we propose that learning reward values of individual features can provide a heuristic for estimating reward values of choice options in dynamic, multidimensional environments. We hypothesized that this feature-based learning occurs not just because it can reduce dimensionality, but more importantly because it can increase adaptability without compromising precision of learning. We experimentally tested this hypothesis and found that in dynamic environments, human subjects adopted feature-based learning even when this approach does not reduce dimensionality. Even in static, low-dimensional environments, subjects initially adopted feature-based learning and gradually switched to learning reward values of individual options, depending on how accurately objects values can be predicted by combining feature values. Our computational models reproduced these results and highlight the importance of neurons coding feature values for parallel learning of values for features and objects.",

    "abstract": "Despite great attention given to the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas, much remains unknown about its epidemiology and evolution, in part due to a lack of genomic data. We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 110 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions; our phylogenetic evidence suggests rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil and multiple introductions of outbreak strains into Puerto Rico, Honduras, Colombia, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in multiple regions for many months before the first locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the importance of viral surveillance. We identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis, as well as those potentially relevant to the effectiveness of diagnostic tests.",

Here we combine population genomic, biophysical modeling, and evolutionary simulations to predict future adaptation of the common coral Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef. Loss of coral cover in recent decades did not yet have detectable effect on genetic diversity in our species. Genomic analysis of migration patterns closely matched the biophysical model of larval dispersal in favoring the spread of existing heat-tolerant alleles from lower to higher latitudes. Given these conditions we find that standing genetic variation could be sufficient to fuel rapid adaptation of A. millepora to warming for the next 100-200 years, although random thermal anomalies would drive increasingly severe mortality episodes. However, this adaptation will inevitably cease unless the warming is slowed down, since no realistic mutation rate could replenish adaptive genetic variation fast enough.",

In this study, we investigated the anti-microbial antibodies in circulation in cases of Crohns disease (CD), Sjogrens syndrome (SS) and other autoimmune disease and their roles in the pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases.\\n\\nMaterial and methodsWestern blot was used to determine the reactivity of human plasmas from patients with CD and SS as the primary antibodies against the whole microbial extracts. The microbial proteins reactive to patients plasma were further identified and the modified sandwich ELISA assays were used to determine the blood levels of antibodies against these microbial proteins in patients with CD and SS. Antibodies against the microbial proteins are used for immunohistochemical staining of normal human tissue.\\n\\nResultsA group of 7 microbial proteins was identified reactive to the plasmas of patients with CD and SS including DNA-directed RNA polymerase B (RPOB), and elongation factor G (EF-G) from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius), ATP synthase alpha (ATP5a) and heat shock protein 65 (Hsp65) from Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and outer membrane porin C (ompC) from Escherichia Coli (E. coli). Anti-microbial antibodies can cross-react to normal human tissues. The levels of antibodies against the microbial proteins are significantly elevated in the patients with CD and SS.\\n\\nConclusionThe levels of antibodies against the microbial proteins are significantly elevated in CD and SS.

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes genotype datasets have undergone several well powered genome wide analysis studies (GWAS), identifying 57 associated regions at the time of analysis. There are still many regions of smaller effect size or low frequency left to discover, and better exploitation of existing type 1 diabetes cohorts with meta analysis and imputation can precede the acquisition of new or larger cohorts. An existing dataset of 5,913 case and 8,829 control samples was analysed using genome-wide microarrays (Affymetrix GeneChip 500K and Illumina Infinium 550K) with imputation via IMPUTE2 with the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3) reference panel. Genotyping coverage was doubled in known association regions, and increased by four fold in other regions compared to previous studies. Our analysis resulted in new index variants for 17/57 regions, an expanded set of plausible candidate SNPs for 17 regions, and five novel type 1 diabetes association regions at 1p31.3, 1q24.3, 1q31.2, 2q11.2 and 11q12.2. Candidate genes for the new loci included ITGB3BP, FASLG, RGS1, AFF3 and CD5/CD6. Further prioritisation of causal genes and causal variants will require detailed RNA and protein expression studies, in conjunction with genome annotation studies including analysis of physical promoter-enhancer interactions.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology is derived from a microbial adaptive immune system, where bacteriophages are often the intended target. Natural inhibitors of CRISPR-Cas9 enable phages to evade immunity and show promise in controlling Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells. However, the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 inhibition is not known and the potential applications for Cas9 inhibitor proteins in mammalian cells has not fully been established. We show here that the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4 binds only to assembled Cas9-single guide RNA (sgRNA) complexes and not to Cas9 protein alone. A 3.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the Cas9-sgRNA-AcrIIA4 complex revealed that the surface of AcrIIA4 is highly acidic and binds with 1:1 stoichiometry to a region of Cas9 that normally engages the DNA protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Consistent with this binding mode, order-of-addition experiments showed that AcrIIA4 interferes with DNA recognition but has no effect on pre-formed Cas9-sgRNA-DNA complexes. Timed delivery of AcrIIA4 into human cells as either protein or expression plasmid allows on-target Cas9-mediated gene editing while reducing off-target edits. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of AcrIIA4 function and demonstrate that inhibitors can modulate the extent and outcomes of Cas9-mediated gene editing.",

Here we integrated hundreds of eCLIP-seq and RNA-seq from ENCODE project and used RBP-position combinations on events to predict if the events are spliced out or not and the results showed that only a small of them can regulate the alternative splicing process in a degree. We observed SRSF1, LIN28B, FMR1, SRSF7, RBM22, PRPF8, SF3B4, TIA1 and hnRNP M are important features by binding the exon or intron region respectively. SF3B4 and RBM22 show opposite regulatory function when binding exons downstream and upstream intron. This supports the asymmetric exon decision model that state the exon exclusion pathway compete with the exon inclusion pathway to regulate splicing. We also observed that some peaks locate in exon-exon junction regions and indicate some splicing related RBPs also bind on mRNAs.",

However, this technology has also raised several new computational challenges including questions related to handling the noisy and sometimes incomplete data, how to identify unique group of cells in such experiments and how to determine the state or function of specific cells based on their expression profile. To address these issues we develop and test a method based on neural networks (NN) for the analysis and retrieval of single cell RNA-Seq data. We tested various NN architectures, some biologically motivated, and used these to obtain a reduced dimension representation of the single cell expression data. We show that the NN method improves upon prior methods in both, the ability to correctly group cells in experiments not used in the training and the ability to correctly infer cell type or state by querying a database of tens of thousands of single cell profiles. Such database queries (which can be performed using our web server) will enable researchers to better characterize cells when analyzing heterogeneous scRNA-Seq samples.\\n\\nSupporting website: http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/scnn/\\n\\nPassword for accessing the retrieval task webserver: scRNA-Seq",

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms are surface attached microbial communities encased in self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Development of a mature biofilm must require coordinating cell differentiation and multicellular activity at scales much larger than the single microbial unit. Here we demonstrate that during development of Bacillus subtilis biofilms, EPS matrix production is localized to a front propagating at the periphery. We show that within the front, cells switch off matrix production and transition to sporulation after a set time delay of[~] 100 min. Correlation analyses of fluctuations in fluorescence reporter activity reveals that the front emerges from a pair of gene expression waves of matrix production and sporulation. The expression waves travel across cells that are immobilized in the biofilm matrix, in contrast to active cell migration or horizontal colony spreading. A single length scale and time scale couples the spatiotemporal propagation of both fronts throughout development, with the front displacement obeying a t1/2 scaling law. As a result, gene expression patterns within the advancing fronts collapse to self-similar expression profiles. Our results indicate that development of bacterial biofilms may be governed by universal wave-like dynamics localized to a self-similar front.",

The resulting metabolic-vitality framework hypothesizes mortality results from replicative senescence of the hematopoietic system and predator-prey interactions. Fitting the metabolic-vitality model to body mass and maximum lifespan data of 494 nonvolant mammals yields allometric relationships of body mass to the vitality parameters, from which full survivorship profiles can be predicted from body mass. Comparisons of the mass-derived vitality parameters to those estimated directly from survival data identifies how intrinsic and extrinsic mortality processes of specific populations deviate from the aggregate. Highlighted findings include a mathematical explanation for the shift from Type I to Type II survivorship curves with decreasing body mass, a quantification of the impact of hunting on wild populations and a quantification of the reduce rate of primate aging relative to the aggregate of mammal populations. Finally, the framework allows explorations of the combined effects of animal aging and predation on survival patterns.",

Here, we characterize for the first time the genomic content of some of these heterotrophic bacterial diazotrophs (HBDs) inhabiting the open surface ocean waters. They represent new lineages within Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria, a phylum never linked to nitrogen fixation prior to this study. HBDs were surprisingly abundant in the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean northwest, conflicting with decades of PCR surveys. The abundance and widespread occurrence of non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs in the surface ocean emphasizes the need to re-evaluate their role in the nitrogen cycle and primary productivity.",

    "abstract": "In fMRI research, the goal of correcting for multiple comparisons is to identify areas of activity that reflect true effects, and thus would be expected to replicate in future studies. Finding an appropriate balance between trying to minimize false positives (Type I error) while not being too stringent and omitting true effects (Type II error) can be challenging. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of these types of errors may differ for different areas of study. In many areas of social neuroscience that involve complex processes and considerable individual differences, such as the study of moral judgment, effects are typically smaller and statistical power weaker, leading to the suggestion that less stringent corrections that allow for more sensitivity may be beneficial, but also result in more false positives. Using moral judgment fMRI data, we evaluated four commonly used methods for multiple comparison correction implemented in SPM12 by examining which method produced the most precise overlap with results from a meta-analysis of relevant studies and with results from nonparametric permutation analyses. We found that voxel-wise thresholding with family-wise error correction based on Random Field Theory provides a more precise overlap (i.e., without omitting too few regions or encompassing too many additional regions) than either clusterwise thresholding, Bonferroni correction, or false discovery rate correction methods.",

    "abstract": "Self-control and the ability to resist temptation are critical for successful completion of long-term goals. Contemporary models in cognitive neuroscience emphasize the primary role of prefrontal cognitive control networks in aligning behavior with such goals. Here we use gaze pattern analysis and dynamic functional connectivity fMRI data to explore how individual differences in the ability to resist temptation are related to intrinsic brain dynamics of the cognitive control and salience networks. Behaviorally, individuals exhibit greater gaze distance from target location (e.g. higher distractibility) during presentation of tempting erotic images compared with neutral images. Individuals whose intrinsic dynamic functional connectivity patterns gravitate towards configurations in which salience detection systems are less strongly coupled with visual systems resist tempting distractors more effectively. The ability to resist tempting distractors was not significantly related to intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive control network. These results suggest that susceptibility to temptation is governed in part by individual differences in salience network dynamics, and provide novel evidence for involvement of brain systems outside canonical cognitive control networks in contributing to individual differences in self-control.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy and apoptosis regulate cell survival and death, and are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. The same type of stress signals can induce either process, but it is unclear how cells  assess cellular damage and make a  life or  death decision by activating autophagy or apoptosis. A computational model of coupled apoptosis and autophagy is built here to study the systems-level dynamics of the underlying signaling network. The model explains the differential dynamics of autophagy and apoptosis in response to various experimental stress signals. Autophagic response dominates at low-to-moderate stress; whereas the response shifts from autophagy (graded activation) to apoptosis (switch-like activation) with increasing intensity of stress. The model reveals that this dynamic cell fate decision is conferred by a core regulatory network involving cytoplasmic Ca2+ as a rheostat that fine-tunes autophagic and apoptotic responses. A G-protein signaling-mediated feedback loop maintains cytoplasmic Ca2+ level, which in turn governs autophagic response through an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated feedforward loop. The model identified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase {beta} (CaMKK{beta}) as a determinant of the opposite roles of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in autophagy regulation. The results also demonstrated that the model could contribute to the development of pharmacological strategies modulate cell fate decisions.",
