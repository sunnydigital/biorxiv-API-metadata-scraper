    "abstract": "O_LIThe coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the proportion of variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R2 for (generalized) linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called R2GLMM for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families.\\nC_LIO_LISimilarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients ICC (also known as repeatability in the field of ecology and evolution) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. ICC is related to R2 because they are both ratios of variance components.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this article we expand our method to additional non-Gaussian distributions, namely quasi-Poisson, negative binomial and gamma GLMMs. However, in theory, our extension could be applied to any distribution and we include an explanatory calculation for the Tweedie distribution.\\nC_LIO_LIWhile expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts, Jensens inequality and the delta method, both of which help in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensens inequality has important implications for the interpretation GLMMs while the delta method allows a general derivation of distribution-specific variances. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data.\\nC_LIO_LIWe illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples in the R environment. However, our method can be used regardless of statistical packages and environments. We finish by referring to two alternative methods to our approach along with a cautionary note.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Bird song is the most widely studied example of vocal learning outside human language and shares important parallels with it, including the importance of social factors during development. Our understanding of how social factors affect song learning however remains surprisingly incomplete. Here we examine the possible role of aggressive interactions in determining song \\\"tutor\\\" choice in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), a songbird in which individuals display song learning strategies ranging from learning primarily from one tutor, to learning a few songs each from a number of tutors. We test two hypotheses: The Competition hypothesis suggests that young birds learn more from tutors with whom they compete especially intensely and predicts that tutees will respond with high aggression to tutor songs. In contrast the Cooperation hypothesis suggests that song learning reflects a cooperative relationship between the tutor and the tutee and predicts that tutees will respond with low aggression to tutor songs. In a playback experiment we found that birds respond more aggressively to songs of their tutors than they do to songs of strangers and that the strength of aggressive response correlated positively with how much they had learned from that tutor. These results provide the first field evidence for the hypothesis that young males preferentially learn their songs from adult males with whom they compete most intensely during the song-learning phase, and perhaps afterwards.",

    "abstract": "Co-expression networks have long been used as a tool for investigating the molecular circuitry governing biological systems. However, most algorithms for constructing co-expression networks were developed in the microarray era, before high-throughput sequencing--with its unique statistical properties--became the norm for expression measurement. Here we develop Bayesian Relevance Networks, an algorithm that uses Bayesian reasoning about expression levels to account for the differing levels of uncertainty in expression measurements between highly- and lowly-expressed entities, and between samples with different sequencing depths. It combines data from groups of samples (e.g., replicates) to estimate group expression levels and confidence ranges. It then computes uncertainty-moderated estimates of cross-group correlations between entities, and uses permutation testing to assess their statistical significance. Using large scale miRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that our Bayesian update of the classical Relevance Networks algorithm provides improved reproducibility in co-expression estimates and lower false discovery rates in the resulting co-expression networks.

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) which was originally recognized as posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis has been a major global health problem affecting 3% of the world population. Interferon/peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy was the backbone of chronic HCV therapy for two decades of the journey. However, the interferon based treatment success rate was around 50% with many side effects. Many chronic HCV patients with psychiatric diseases, or even cytopenias, were ineligible for HCV treatment. Now, we no longer need any injectable medicine. New direct-acting antiviral agents against HCV allowed the advance of interferon-free and ribavirin-free oral regimens with high rates of response and tolerability. The cost of the medications should not be a barrier to their access in certain parts of the world. While we are getting closer, we should still focus on preventing the spread of the disease, screening and delivering the cure globally to those in need. In the near future, development of an effective vaccine against HCV would make it possible to eradicate HCV infection worldwide completely.",

The problem is particularly evident concerning Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The objective of this study is to estimate whether the \\\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\\" (DSM) is biologically valid for ADHD diagnosis using a multivariate analysis for small samples from a large dataset concerning neurophysiological, behavioral, and psychological variables.\\n\\nMethodsTwenty typically developing boys and 19 boys diagnosed with ADHD, aged 10-13 years, were examined using the Attentional Network Test (ANT) with records of event-related potentials (ERPs). From 815 variables, a reduced number of latent variables (LVs) were extracted with a clustering method, for further reclassification of subjects using the k-means method. This approach allowed multivariate analysis to be applied to a significantly larger number of variables than the number of cases (E. Wigneau et al., 2003, 2015)\\n\\nResultsFrom datasets including ERPs from the mid-frontal, mid-parietal, right frontal, and central channels, only seven subjects were miss-reclassified by the LVs. An estimated specificity of 75.00% and sensitivity of 89.47% for DSM were found in the reclassification. The kappa index between DSM and behavioral/psychological/neurophysiological data was 0.75, which is regarded as a \\\"substantial level of agreement\\\".\\n\\nDiscussionResults showed that CLV is a useful method for diagnostic classification using a large dataset of small samples, suggesting the biological validity of DSM for ADHD diagnosis, in accordance to alterations in fronto-striatal networks previously related to ADHD.",

    "abstract": "RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited, and in particular identification of the RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been a difficult problem. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel semi-automatic algorithm, SARNAclust, to computationally identify combined structure/sequence motifs from immunoprecipitation data. SARNAclust is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised method that can identify RNA motifs at full structural resolution while also being able to simultaneously deconvolve multiple motifs. SARNAclust makes use of a graph kernel to evaluate similarity between sequence/structure objects, and provides the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. SARNAclust includes a key method for predicting RNA secondary structure at CLIP peaks, RNApeakFold, which we have verified to be effective on synthetic motif data. We applied SARNAclust to 30 ENCODE eCLIP datasets, identifying known motifs and novel predictions. Notably, we predicted a new motif for the protein ILF3 similar to that for the splicing factor hnRNPC, providing evidence for interaction between these two proteins. To validate our predictions, we performed a directed RNA bind-n-seq assay for two proteins: ILF3 and SLBP, in each case revealing the effectiveness of SARNAclust in predicting RNA sequence and structure elements important to protein binding.

    "abstract": "The detection of ancient gene flow between human populations is an important issue in population genetics. A common tool for detecting ancient admixture events is the D-statistic. The D-statistic is based on the hypothesis of a genetic relationship that involves four populations, whose correctness is assessed by evaluating specific coincidences of alleles between the groups.\\n\\nWhen working with high throughput sequencing data calling genotypes accurately is not always possible, therefore the D-statistic currently samples a single base from the reads of one individual per population. This implies ignoring much of the information in the data, an issue especially striking in the case of ancient genomes.\\n\\nWe provide a significant improvement to overcome the problems of the D-statistic by considering all reads from multiple individuals in each population. We also apply type-specific error correction to combat the problems of sequencing errors and show a way to correct for introgression from an external population that is not part of the supposed genetic relationship, and how this leads to an estimate of the admixture rate.\\n\\nWe prove that the D-statistic is approximated by a standard normal. Furthermore we show that our method outperforms the traditional D-statistic in detecting admixtures. The power gain is most pronounced for low/medium sequencing depth (1-10X) and performances are as good as with perfectly called genotypes at a sequencing depth of 2X. We show the reliability of error correction on scenarios with simulated errors and ancient data, and correct for introgression in known scenarios to estimate the admixture rates.",

    "abstract": "Population-level theta and beta band activity in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) are prominent signatures of endogenously controlled, adaptive behaviors. But how these rhythmic activities are linked to cell-type specific activity has remained unclear. Here, we suggest such a cell-to-systems level linkage. We found that the rate of burst spiking events is enhanced particularly during attention states and that attention-specific burst spikes have a unique temporal relationship to local theta and beta band population level activities. For the 5-10Hz theta frequency range, bursts coincided with transient increases of local theta power relative to non-bursts, particularly for bursts of putative interneurons. For the 16-30Hz beta frequency, bursts of putative interneurons phase synchronized stronger than nonbursts, and were associated with larger beta power modulation. In contrast, burst of putative pyramidal cells were overall similarly beta-synchronized than nonbursts, but were linked with stronger beta power only when they occurred early in the beta cycle. These findings suggests that in the ACC/PFC during attention states, mechanisms underlying burst firing are intimately linked to narrow band population level activities, providing a cell-type specific window into the emergence, resetting, or termination of oscillatory activities.",

    "abstract": "Translational control of gene expression is an important regulator of growth, homeostasis and aging in Drosophila. The ability to measure changes in protein synthesis in response to genetic and environmental cues is therefore important in studying these processes. Here we describe a simple and cost effective approach to assay protein synthesis in Drosophila larval cells and tissues. The method is based on the incorporation of puromycin into nascent peptide chains. Using an ex vivo approach, we label newly synthesized peptides in larvae with puromycin and then measure levels of new protein synthesis using an anti-puromycin antibody. We show that this method can detect changes in protein synthesis in specific cells and tissues in the larvae, either by immunostaining or western blotting. We find that the assay reliably detects changes in protein synthesis induced by two known stimulators of mRNA translation - the nutrient/TORC1 kinase pathway and the transcription factor dMyc. We also use the assay to describe how protein synthesis changes through larval development and in response to two environmental stressors - hypoxia and heat-shock. We propose that this puromycin-labelling assay is a simple but robust method to detect protein synthesis changes at the levels of cells, tissues or whole body in Drosophila.",
