    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) are etiologically heterogeneous and complex. Functional genomics work has begun to identify a diverse array of dysregulated transcriptomic programs (e.g., synaptic, immune, cell cycle, DNA damage, WNT signaling, cortical patterning and differentiation) potentially involved in ASD brain abnormalities during childhood and adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether such diverse dysregulated pathways are independent of each other or instead reflect coordinated hierarchical systems-level pathology.\\n\\nMethodsTwo ASD cortical transcriptome datasets were re-analyzed using consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify common coexpression modules across datasets. Linear mixed-effect models and Bayesian replication statistics were used to identify replicable differentially expressed modules. Eigengene network analysis was then utilized to identify between-group differences in how co-expression modules interact and cluster into hierarchical meta-modular organization. Protein-protein interaction analyses were also used to determine whether dysregulated co-expression modules show enhanced interactions.\\n\\nResultsWe find replicable evidence for 10 gene co-expression modules that are differentially expressed in ASD cortex. Rather than being independent non-interacting sources of pathology, these dysregulated co-expression modules work in synergy and physically interact at the protein level. These systems-level transcriptional signals are characterized by downregulation of synaptic processes coordinated with upregulation of immune/inflammation, response to other organism, catabolism, viral processes, translation, protein targeting and localization, cell proliferation, and vasculature development. Hierarchical organization of meta-modules (clusters of highly correlated modules) is also highly affected in ASD.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings highlight that dysregulation of the ASD cortical transcriptome is characterized by the dysregulation of multiple coordinated transcriptional programs producing synergistic systems-level effects that cannot be fully appreciated by studying the individual component biological processes in isolation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSeveral recent studies have demonstrated that the bottom-up signaling of a visual stimulus is subserved by interareal gamma-band synchronization, whereas top-down influences are mediated by alpha-beta band synchronization. These processes may implement top-down control of stimulus processing if top-down and bottom-up mediating rhythms are coupled via cross-frequency interaction. To test this possibility, we investigated Granger-causal influences among awake male macaque primary visual area V1, higher visual area V4 and parietal control area 7a during attentional task performance. Top-down 7a-to-V1 beta-band influences enhanced visually driven V1-to-V4 gamma-band influences. This enhancement was spatially specific and largest when beta-band activity preceded gamma-band activity by [~]0.1 s, suggesting a causal effect of top-down processes on bottom-up processes. We propose that this cross-frequency interaction mechanistically subserves the attentional control of stimulus selection.\\n\\nSignificance StatementContemporary research indicates that the alpha-beta frequency band underlies top-down control, while the gamma-band mediates bottom-up stimulus processing. This arrangement inspires an attractive hypothesis, which posits that top-down beta-band influences directly modulate bottom-up gamma band influences via cross-frequency interaction. We evaluate this hypothesis determining that beta-band top-down influences from parietal area 7a to visual area V1 are correlated with bottom-up gamma frequency oscillations from V1 to area V4, in a spatially specific manner, and that this correlation is maximal when top-down activity precedes bottom-up activity. These results show that for top-down processes such as spatial attention, elevated top-down beta-band influences directly enhance feedforward stimulus induced gamma-band processing, leading to enhancement of the selected stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Much of our lives are spent in unconstrained rest states, yet cognitive brain processes are primarily investigated using task-constrained states. It may be possible to utilize the insights gained from experimental control of task processes as reference points for investigating unconstrained rest. To facilitate comparison of rest and task functional MRI (fMRI) data we focused on activation amplitude patterns, commonly used for task but not rest analyses. During rest, we identified spontaneous changes in temporally extended whole-brain activation pattern states. This revealed a hierarchical organization of rest states. The top consisted of two competing states consistent with previously identified \\\"task-positive\\\" and \\\"task-negative\\\" activation patterns. These states were composed of more specific states that repeated over time and across individuals. Contrasting with the view that rest consists of only task-negative states, task-positive states occurred 40% of the time while individuals \\\"rested,\\\" suggesting task-focused activity occurs during rest. Further, analysis of task data revealed a similar hierarchical structure of brain states. Together these results suggest brain activation dynamics form a general hierarchy across task and rest, with a small number of dominant general states reflecting basic functional modes and a variety of specific states likely reflecting a rich variety of cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary history of vertebrates is marked by three ancient whole-genome duplications: two successive rounds in the ancestor of vertebrates, and a third one specific to teleost fishes. Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for specific genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebrafish and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in non-renewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.",

For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation. Both in biology and in computational biology, a female last author increases the probability of other authors on the paper being female, pointing to a potential role of female PIs in influencing the gender balance.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is considered pivotal to recall, allowing retrieval of information not available in the immediate environment. In contrast, neocortex is thought to signal familiarity, and to contribute to recall only when called upon by the hippocampus. However, this view is not compatible with representational accounts of memory, which reject the mapping of cognitive processes onto brain regions. According to representational accounts, the hippocampus is not engaged by recall per se, rather it is engaged whenever hippocampal representations are required. To test whether hippocampus is engaged by recall when hippocampal representations are not required, we used functional imaging and a non-associative recall task, with images (objects, scenes) studied in isolation, and image-patches used as cues. As predicted by a representational account, hippocampal activation increased during recall of scenes - which are known to be processed by hippocampus - but not during recall of objects. Object recall instead engaged neocortical regions known to be involved in object-processing. Further supporting the representational account, effective connectivity analyses revealed that recall was associated with increased information flow out of lateral occipital cortex (object recall) and parahippocampal cortex (scene recall), suggesting that recall-related activation spread from neocortex to hippocampus, not the reverse.",

A critical, often limiting step is the preparation of cells in an unperturbed state, not compromised by stress or ageing. Another challenge are rare cells that need to be collected over several days, or samples prepared at different times or locations.\\n\\nResultsHere, we used chemical fixation to overcome these problems. Methanol fixation allowed us to stabilize and preserve dissociated cells for weeks. By using mixtures of fixed human and mouse cells, we showed that individual transcriptomes could be confidently assigned to one of the two species. Single-cell gene expression from live and fixed samples correlated well with bulk mRNA-seq data. We then applied methanol fixation to transcriptionally profile primary single cells from dissociated complex tissues. Low RNA content cells from Drosophila embryos, as well as mouse hindbrain and cerebellum cells sorted by FACS, were successfully analysed after fixation, storage and single-cell droplet RNA-seq. We were able to identify diverse cell populations, including neuronal subtypes.

    "abstract": "Over the last ten years, isogenic tagging (IT) has revolutionised the study of bacterial infection dynamics in laboratory animal models. However, quantitative analysis of IT data has been hindered by the piecemeal development of relevant statistical models. The most promising approach relies on stochastic Markovian models of bacterial population dynamics within and among organs. Here we present an efficient numerical method to fit such stochastic dynamic models to in vivo experimental IT data. A common approach to statistical inference with stochastic dynamic models relies on producing large numbers of simulations, but this remains a slow and inefficient method for all but simple problems, especially when tracking bacteria in multiple locations simultaneously. Instead, we derive and solve the systems of ordinary differential equations for the two lower-order moments of the stochastic variables (mean, variance and covariance). For any given model structure, and assuming linear dynamic rates, we demonstrate how the model parameters can be efficiently and accurately estimated by divergence minimisation. We then apply our method to an experimental dataset and compare the estimates and goodness-of-fit to those obtained by maximum likelihood estimation. While both sets of parameter estimates had overlapping confidence regions, the new method produced lower values for the division and death rates of bacteria: these improved the goodness-of-fit at the second time point at the expense of that of the first time point. This flexible framework can easily be applied to a range of experimental systems. Its computational efficiency paves the way for model comparison and optimal experimental design.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecent advancements in technology have meant that microbiologists are producing vast amounts of experimental data. However, statistical methods by which we can analyse that data, draw informative inference, and test relevant hypotheses, are much needed. Here, we present a new, efficient inference tool for estimating parameters of stochastic models, with a particular focus on models of within-host bacterial dynamics. The method relies on matching the two lower-order moments of the experimental data (i.e., mean, variance and covariance), to the moments from the mathematical model. The method is verified, and particular choices justified, through a number of simulation studies.

A binary-coded primary sequence can be obtained for an unbroken protein molecule from current blockades in a nanopore. Only two (instead of 20) blockade levels need to be recognized to identify a residues subset; a hard or soft detector can do this with two current thresholds. Computations were done on the complete proteome of Helicobacter pylori (http://www.uniprot.org; database id UP000000210, 1553 sequences) using a binary alphabet based on published data for residue volumes in the range [~]0.06 nm3 to [~]0.225 nm3. Assuming normally distributed volumes, more than 93% of binary subsequences of length 20 from the primary sequences of H. pylori are correct with a confidence level of 90-95%; they can uniquely identify over 98% of the proteins. Recently published work shows that a 0.7 nm diameter nanopore can measure residue volume with a resolution of [~]0.07 nm3; this makes the procedure described here both feasible and practical.

    "abstract": "A statistical thermodynamics approach to the temporal development of biological regulation provides a phenomenological description of the dynamical behavior of genome expression in terms of autonomous self-organization with a critical transition (Self-Organized Criticality: SOC). In early mouse embryo development, the dynamical change in the self-organization of overall expression determines how and when reprogramming of the genome-expression state occurs. Reprogramming occurs via a transition state (climbing over an epigenetic landscape), where the critical-regulation pattern of the zygote state disappears. A critical transition is well captured in terms of the bimodality of expression ensembles, which reflects distinct thermodynamic states (critical states). These critical states exhibit a genome avalanche pattern: competition between order (scaling) and disorder (divergence) around a critical point. The genome avalanche in mouse embryo development, which is committed to erase a previous ordered state, reveals that the direction of early embryo single-cell development traverses the same steps as in differentiation, but in the opposite order of self-organization.",

    "abstract": "Human genome sequencing has generated population variant datasets containing millions of variants from hundreds of thousands of individuals1-3. The datasets show the genomic distribution of genetic variation to be influenced on genic and sub-genic scales by gene essentiality,1,4,5 protein domain architecture6 and the presence of genomic features such as splice donor/acceptor sites.2 However, the variant data are still too sparse to provide a comparative picture of genetic variation between individual protein residues in the proteome.1,6 Here, we overcome this sparsity for [~]25,000 human protein domains in 1,291 domain families by aggregating variants over equivalent positions (columns) in multiple sequence alignments of sequence-similar (paralagous) domains7,8. We then compare the resulting variation profiles from the human population to residue conservation across all species9 and find that the same tertiary structural and functional pressures that affect amino acid conservation during domain evolution constrain missense variant distributions. Thus, depletion of missense variants at a position implies that it is structurally or functionally important. We find such positions are enriched in known disease-associated variants (OR = 2.83, p {approx} 0) while positions that are both missense depleted and evolutionary conserved are further enriched in disease-associated variants (OR = 1.85, p = 3.3x10-17) compared to those that are only evolutionary conserved (OR = 1.29, p = 4.5x10-19). Unexpectedly, a subset of evolutionary Unconserved positions are Missense Depleted in human (UMD positions) and these are also enriched in pathogenic variants (OR = 1.74, p = 0.02). UMD positions are further differentiated from other unconserved residues in that they are enriched in ligand, DNA and protein binding interactions (OR = 1.59, p = 0.003), which suggests this stratification can identify functionally important positions. A different class of positions that are Conserved and Missense Enriched (CME) show an enrichment of ClinVar risk factor variants (OR = 2.27, p = 0.004). We illustrate these principles with the G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) family, Nuclear Receptor Ligand Binding Domain family and In Between Ring-Finger (IBR) domains and list a total of 343 UMD positions in 211 domain families. This study will have broad applications to: (a) providing focus for functional studies of specific proteins by mutagenesis; (b) refining pathogenicity prediction models; (c) highlighting which residue interactions to target when refining the specificity of small-molecule drugs.",

This question is particularly relevant for amacrine cells, a diverse class of retinal interneurons, which receive input and provide output through the same neurites. Here, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging to analyze visual processing in VGluT3-expressing amacrine cells (VG3-ACs), an important component of object motion sensitive circuits in the retina. VG3-AC neurites differed in their preferred stimulus contrast (ON vs. OFF); and ON and OFF responses varied in transience and preferred stimulus size. Contrast preference changed predictably with the laminar position of neurites in the inner plexiform layer. Yet, neurites at all depths were strongly activated by local but not by global image motion. Thus, VG3-AC neurites process visual information locally, exhibiting diverse responses to contrast steps, but uniform object motion selectivity.",

Here, we investigated whether RNAseq using the long-read single-molecule Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technology (ONT RNAseq) would be able to identify and quantify complex isoforms without sacrificing accurate gene expression quantification. After successfully benchmarking our experimental and computational approaches on a mixture of synthetic transcripts, we analyzed individual murine B1a cells using a new cellular indexing strategy. Using the Mandalorion analysis pipeline we developed, we identified thousands of unannotated transcription start and end sites, as well as hundreds of alternative splicing events in these B1a cells. We also identified hundreds of genes expressed across B1a cells that displayed multiple complex isoforms, including several B cell specific surface receptors and the antibody heavy chain (IGH) locus. Our results show that not only can we identify complex isoforms, but also quantify their expression, at the single cell level.",

In this work it is shown that a rather simplistic, but truly stochastic transmission model, is competitive with respect to model fit when compared with more detailed deterministic transmission models and even preferable because the role of each parameter and its identifiability is clearly understood in the simpler model. The inference framework for the stochastic model is provided by iterated filtering methods which are readily implemented in the R package pomp.

    "abstract": "Motility of the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is enabled by the glideosome, a multi-protein complex containing the class XIV myosin motor, PfMyoA. Parasite motility is necessary for invasion into host cells and for virulence. Here we show that milligram quantities of functional PfMyoA can be expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system, provided that a UCS (UNC-45/CRO1/She4p) family myosin co-chaperone from Plasmodium spp. is co-expressed with the heavy chain. The homologous chaperone from the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii does not functionally substitute. We expressed a functional full-length PfMyoA with bound myosin tail interacting protein (MTIP), the only known light chain of PfMyoA. We then identified an additional \\\"essential\\\" light chain (PfELC) that co-purified with PfMyoA isolated from parasite lysates. PfMyoA expressed with both light chains moved actin at ~3.8 m/sec, more than twice that of PfMyoA-MTIP (~1.7 m/sec), consistent with the light chain binding domain acting as a lever arm to amplify nucleotide-dependent motions in the motor domain. Surprisingly, PfMyoA moved skeletal actin or expressed P. falciparum actin at the same speed. Duty ratio estimates suggest that PfMyoA may be able to move actin at maximal speed with as few as 6 motors. Under unloaded conditions, neither phosphorylation of Ser19 of the heavy chain, phosphorylation of several Ser residues in the N-terminal extension of MTIP, or calcium affected the speed of actin motion. These studies provide the essential framework for targeting the glideosome as a potential drug target to inhibit invasion by the malaria parasite.\\n\\nSignificanceMotility of the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies on a divergent actomyosin system powered by the class XIV myosin, PfMyoA. We show that functional PfMyoA can be expressed in Sf9 cells if a Plasmodium spp. myosin chaperone is co-expressed. We identified an \\\"essential\\\" light chain (PfELC) that binds to PfMyoA in parasites. In vitro expression of PfMyoA heavy chain with PfELC and the known light chain MTIP produced the fastest speeds of actin movement (~3.8 m/sec). Duty ratio estimates suggest that ~6 PfMyoA motors can move actin at maximal speed, a feature that may facilitate interaction with short, dynamic Plasmodium actin filaments.

When membrane protein structures are determined by different techniques in different environments, a natural question is \\\"which structure is most biologically relevant?\\\" Towards answering this question, we compiled a dataset of membrane proteins with known structures determined by both solution NMR and X-ray crystallography. By investigating differences between the structures, we found that RMSDs between crystal and NMR structures are below 5 [A] in the membrane region, NMR ensembles have a higher convergence in the membrane region, crystal structures typically have a straighter transmembrane region, have higher stereo-chemical correctness, and are more tightly packed. After quantifying these differences, we used high-resolution refinement of the NMR structures to mitigate them, which paves the way for identifying and improving the structural quality of membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "List of abbreviations\\n\\nAbstractOrange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) is known to be an effector and regulator of cyanobacterial photoprotection. This 35 kDa water-soluble protein provides specific environment for keto-carotenoids, the excitation of which induced by the absorption of blue-green light causes dramatic but fully reversible rearrangements of the OCP structure, including carotenoid translocation and separation of C- and N-terminal domains upon transition from the basic orange to photoactivated red OCP form. While recent studies significantly improved our understanding of the OCP photocycle and interaction with phycobilisomes and the fluorescence recovery protein, the mechanism of OCP assembly remains unclear. Apparently, this process requires targeted delivery and incorporation of a highly hydrophobic carotenoid molecule into the water-soluble apoprotein of OCP. Recently, we introduced a novel carotenoid carrier protein, COCP, which consists of dimerized C-domain(s) of OCP and can combine with the isolated N-domain to form transient OCP-like species. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro COCP efficiently transfers otherwise tightly bound carotenoid to the full-length OCP apoprotein, resulting in formation of the photoactive OCP from completely photoinactive species. We accurately analyze peculiarities of this carotenoid transfer process which, to the best of our knowledge, seems unique, previously uncharacterized protein-to-protein carotenoid transfer process. We hypothesize that a similar OCP assembly can occur in vivo, substantiating specific roles of the COCP carotenoid carrier in cyanobacterial photoprotection.",

Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis provides a solution to overcome the limit of FACS-based cell type definition system for the dissection of complex cellular hierarchy. However, large-scale scRNA-seq is constrained by the throughput and cost of traditional methods. Here, we developed Microwell-seq, a high-throughput and low-cost scRNA-seq platform using extremely simple devices. Using Microwell-seq, we constructed a single-cell resolution transcriptome atlas of human hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy by profiling more than 50,000 single cells throughout adult human hematopoietic system. We found that adult human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment is dominated by progenitors primed with lineage specific regulators. Our analysis revealed differentiation pathways for each cell types, through which HSPCs directly progress to lineage biased progenitors before differentiation. We propose a revised adult human hematopoietic hierarchy independent of oligopotent progenitors. Our study also demonstrates the broad applicability of Microwell-seq technology.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYUpon fertilization, the genome of animal embryos remains transcriptionally inactive until the maternal-to-zygotic transition. At this time, the embryo takes control of its development and transcription begins. How the onset of zygotic transcription is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that a dynamic competition for DNA binding between nucleosome-forming histones and transcription factors regulates zebrafish genome activation. Taking a quantitative approach, we found that the concentration of non-DNA bound core histones sets the time for the onset of transcription. The reduction in nuclear histone concentration that coincides with genome activation does not affect nucleosome density on DNA, but allows transcription factors to compete successfully for DNA binding. In agreement with this, transcription factor binding is sensitive to histone levels and the concentration of transcription factors also affects the time of transcription. Our results demonstrate that the relative levels of histones and transcription factors regulate the onset of transcription in the embryo.",

    "abstract": "Recent calls for a revision of standard evolutionary theory (SET) are based in part on arguments about the reciprocal causation. Reciprocal causation means that cause-effect relationships are obscured, as a cause could later become an effect and vice versa. Such dynamic cause-effect relationships raise questions about the distinction between proximate and ultimate causes, as originally formulated by Ernst Mayr. They have also motivated some biologists and philosophers to argue for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES). The EES will supposedly expand the scope of the Modern Synthesis (MS) and Standard Evolutionary Theory (SET), which has been characterized as gene-centred, relying primarily on natural selection and largely neglecting reciprocal causation. I critically examine these claims, with a special focus on the last conjecture and conclude - on the contrary- that reciprocal causation has long been recognized as important both in SET and in the MS tradition, although it remains underexplored. Numerous empirical examples of reciprocal causation in the form of positive and negative feedbacks are now well known from both natural and laboratory systems. Reciprocal causation have also been explicitly incorporated in mathematical models of coevolutionary arms races, frequency-dependent selection, eco-evolutionary dynamics and sexual selection. Such dynamic feedbacks were already recognized by Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin, well before the recent call for an EES. Reciprocal causation and dynamic feedbacks is one of the few contributions of dialectical thinking and Marxist philosophy in evolutionary theory, and should be recognized as such. I discuss some promising empirical and analytical tools to study reciprocal causation and the implications for the EES. While reciprocal causation have helped us to understand many evolutionary processes, I caution against uncritical extension of dialectics towards heredity and constructive development, particularly if such extensions involves attempts to restore Lamarckian or \\\"soft inheritance\\\".",

    "abstract": "The oncogenic Ras/MAPK pathway is evolutionary conserved across metazoans and is essential for many cellular functions. Mutant screens in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been invaluable for elucidating Ras/MAPK pathway characteristics and identification of the genes involved. Almost all of these screens have been conducted in a single genetic background. However, phenotypic traits of induced mutations can vary widely depending on the genetic background. At the moment, we lack insight into how different genetic backgrounds modulate Ras/MAPK-signaling and which genetic modifiers are involved.\\n\\nWe previously introduced a gain-of-function mutation in the Ras/MAPK pathway gene let-60 in over 200 recombinant inbred lines (mutant introgressed RILs: miRILs) and detected genetic modifiers affecting this pathway by studying variation in vulval development. In the present study, we investigate how gene expression regulation is affected by the let-60 gain-of-function mutation and the genetic background by mapping eQTL using 33 miRILs. We found that the majority ([~]73%) of the 1516 detected cis-eQTL are not specific for the let-60 mutation, whereas most ([~]76%) of the 898 detected trans-eQTL are associated with the let-60 mutation. We detected 6 eQTL trans-bands that were specific for the interaction between the genetic background and the mutation. One of these eQTL hotspots co-localizes with the previously identified polymorphic Ras/MAPK modifier amx-2. Comparing gene expression profiles between transgenic lines expressing either the N2 or the CB4856 alleles of amx-2 showed the involvement of amx-2 in 79% of the trans-eQTLs for genes mapping to this trans-band.\\n\\nTogether, our results have revealed hidden loci affecting Ras/MAPK signaling using sensitized backgrounds in C. elegans. These loci harbor putative polymorphic modifier genes that would not have been detected using mutant screens in single genetic backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental tenet of inheritance in sexually reproducing organisms such as humans and laboratory mice is that genetic variants combine randomly at fertilization, thereby ensuring a balanced and statistically predictable representation of inherited variants in each generation. This principle is encapsulated in Mendels First Law. But exceptions are known. With transmission ratio distortion (TRD), particular alleles are preferentially transmitted to offspring without reducing reproductive productivity. Preferential transmission usually occurs in one sex but not both and is not known to require interactions between gametes at fertilization. We recently discovered, in our work in mice and in other reports in the literature, instances where any of 12 mutant genes bias fertilization, with either too many or too few heterozygotes and too few homozygotes, depending on the mutant gene and on dietary conditions. Although such deviations are usually attributed to embryonic lethality of the under-represented genotypes, the evidence is more consistent with genetically-determined preferences for specific combinations of egg and sperm at fertilization that results in genotype bias without embryo loss. These genes and diets could bias fertilization in at least three not mutually exclusive ways. They could trigger a reversal in the order of meiotic divisions during oogenesis so that the genetics of fertilizing sperm elicits preferential chromatid segregation, thereby dictating which allele remains in the egg versus the 2nd polar body. Bias could also result from genetic- and diet-induced anomalies in polyamine metabolism on which function of haploid gametes normally depends. Finally, secreted and cell-surface factors in female reproductive organs could control access of sperm to eggs based on their genetic content. This unexpected discovery of genetically-biased fertilization in mice could yield insights about the molecular and cellular interactions between sperm and egg at fertilization, with implications for our understanding of inheritance, reproduction, population genetics, and medical genetics.",

These datasets, however, may come with restrictive terms of use, conditioned by the consent frameworks within which individuals donate their data. Having an aggregated genome dataset with unrestricted use, analogous to public domain licensing, is therefore unusually rare. Yet public domain data is tremendously useful because it allows freedom to perform research with it. This comes with the price of donors surrendering their privacy and accepting the associated risks derived from publishing personal data. Using the Repositive platform (https://repositive.io/?23andMe), an indexing service for human genome datasets, we aggregated all deposited files in public data sources under a CC0 license from 23andMe, a leading Direct-to-Consumer genetic testing service. After downloading 3,137 genotypes, we filtered out those that were incomplete, corrupt or duplicated, ending up with a dataset of 2,280 curated files, each one corresponding to a unique individual. Although the size of this dataset is modest compared to current major genome data aggregation projects, its full access and licensing terms, which allows free reuse without attribution, make it a useful reference pool for validation purposes and control experiments.",

    "abstract": "With advances in transcript profiling, the presence of transcriptional activities in intergenic regions has been well established in multiple model systems. However, whether intergenic expression reflects transcriptional noise or the activity of novel genes remains unclear. We identified intergenic transcribed regions (ITRs) in 15 diverse flowering plant species and found that the amount of intergenic expression correlates with genome size, a pattern that could be expected if intergenic expression is largely non-functional. To further assess the functionality of ITRs, we first built machine learning classifiers using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model that can accurately distinguish functional sequences (phenotype genes) and non-functional ones (pseudogenes and random unexpressed intergenic regions) by integrating 93 biochemical, evolutionary, and sequence-structure features. Next, by applying the models to ITRs, we found that 2,453 (21%) had features significantly similar to phenotype genes and thus were likely parts of functional genes, while an additional 17% resembled benchmark RNA genes. However, [~]60% of ITRs were more similar to nonfunctional sequences and should be considered transcriptional noise unless falsified with experiments. The predictive framework establish here provides not only a comprehensive look at how functional, genic sequences are distinct from likely non-functional ones, but also a new way to differentiate novel genes from genomic regions with noisy transcriptional activities.",

    "abstract": "Genomic studies to date in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have largely focused on newly arising mutations that disrupt protein coding sequence and strongly influence risk. We evaluate the contribution of noncoding regulatory variation across the size and frequency spectrum through whole genome sequencing of 519 ASD cases, their unaffected sibling controls, and parents. Cases carry a small excess of de novo (1.02-fold) noncoding variants, which is not significant after correcting for paternal age. Assessing 51,801 regulatory classes, no category is significantly associated with ASD after correction for multiple testing. The strongest signals are observed in coding regions, including structural variation not detected by previous technologies and missense variation. While rare noncoding variation likely contributes to risk in neurodevelopmental disorders, no category of variation has impact equivalent to loss-of-function mutations. Average effect sizes are likely to be smaller than that for coding variation, requiring substantially larger samples to quantify this risk.",

    "abstract": "Local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the human and rodent ventral striatum (vStr) exhibit prominent, behaviorally relevant gamma-band oscillations. These oscillations are related to local spiking activity and transiently synchronize with anatomically related areas, suggesting a possible role in organizing vStr activity. However, the origin of vStr gamma is unknown. We recorded vStr gamma oscillations across a 1.4mm2 grid spanned by 64 recording electrodes as rats rested and foraged for rewards, revealing a highly consistent power gradient originating in the adjacent piriform cortex. Phase differences across the vStr were consistently small (<10{degrees}) and current source density analysis further confirmed the absence of local sink-source pairs in the vStr. Reversible occlusions of the ipsilateral (but not contralateral) nostril, known to abolish gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, strongly reduced vStr gamma power and the occurrence of transient gamma-band events. These results imply that local circuitry is not a major contributor to gamma oscillations in the vStr LFP, and that piriform cortex is an important driver of gamma-band oscillations in the vStr and associated limbic areas.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe ventral striatum is an area of anatomical convergence in circuits underlying motivated behavior, but it remains unclear how its inputs from different sources interact. One of the major proposals of how neural circuits may dynamically switch between convergent inputs is through temporal organization reflected in local field potential (LFP) oscillations. Our results show that in the rat, the mechanisms controlling vStr gamma oscillations are primarily located in the in the adjacent piriform cortex, rather than vStr itself. This provides a novel interpretation of previous rodent work on gamma oscillations in the vStr and related circuits, and an important consideration for future work seeking to use oscillations in these areas as biomarkers in rodent models of human behavioral and neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Many behaviors of cancer, such as progression, metastasis and drug resistance etc., cannot be fully understood by genetic mutations or intracellular signaling alone. Instead, they are emergent properties of cell community that forms a tumor. Studies of tumor heterogeneity reveal that many cancer behaviors critically depend on the intercellular communication mediated by secreted signaling ligands and their cognate receptors that take place between cancer cells and stromal cells. Owing to systematic cancer omics efforts, we studied such cell-cell interactions using data from cancer transcriptome database. We curated a list of more than 2,500 ligand-receptor pairs and developed a method to identify their enrichment in tumors from TCGA pancancer data and to build a cell interaction network from single-cell data for the case of melanoma. Using the specificity of the ligand-receptor interaction and their expressions measured in individual cells, we built a map of a cell-cell communication network which indicate what signal is exchanged between which cell types. Such networks establish a new formal phenotypes which are embodied by the cell communication structure - it may offer new opportunities to identify the molecular signatures which may influence cancer cell behaviors by changing cell population dynamics.",

We use a wagering experiment to show that modeling subjects' choices allows for classifying individuals according to their prior biases, which fully explain from first principles the differences in their later confidence reports. Our parameter-free confidence model predicts two counterintuitive patterns for individuals with different prior beliefs: pessimists should report higher confidence than optimists, and, for the same task difficulty, the confidence of pessimists should increase with the generosity of the task. These findings show how systematic confidence biases can be simply understood as differences in prior expectations.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal determines gene flow among groups in a population and so plays a major role in many ecological and evolutionary processes, from biological invasions to species extinctions. Because patterns of gene flow shape kin structure, dispersal is also important to the evolution of social behaviours that influence reproduction and survival within groups. Conversely, dispersal patterns depend on kin structure and social behaviour. Dispersal and social behaviour therefore co-evolve but the nature and consequences of this interplay are not well understood. Here, we model this co-evolution and show that it readily leads to the emergence and maintenance of two broadly-defined social morphs: a sessile, benevolent morph expressed by individuals who tend to increase the fecundity of others within their group relative to their own; and a dispersive, selfserving morph expressed by individuals who tend to increase their own fecundity relative to others within their group. This social polymorphism arises as a consequence of a positive linkage between the loci responsible for dispersal and social behaviour, leading to benevolent individuals preferentially interacting with relatives and self-serving individuals with non-relatives. We find that this positive linkage is favoured under a large spectrum of conditions, which suggests that an association between dispersal proclivity and other social traits should be common in nature. In line with this prediction, dispersing individuals across a wide range of organisms have been reported to differ in their social tendencies from non-dispersing individuals.",

    "abstract": "Dietary restriction is arguably the most promising non-pharmacological intervention to extend human life and health span. Yet, only few genetic regulators mediating the cellular response to dietary restriction are known, and the question remains which other transcription factors and regulatory pathways are involved. To gain a comprehensive view of how lifespan extension under dietary restriction is elicited, we screened the chronological lifespan of most gene deletions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under two dietary regimens, restricted and non-restricted. We identified 472 mutants with enhanced or diminished extension of lifespan by dietary restriction. Functional analysis of such dietary-restriction genes revealed novel processes underlying longevity specifically by dietary restriction. Importantly, this set of genes allowed us to generate a prioritized catalogue of transcription factors orchestrating the dietary-restriction response, which underscored the relevance of cell-cycle arrest control as a key mechanism of chronological longevity in yeast. We show that the transcription factor Ste12 is needed for full lifespan extension and cell-cycle arrest in response to nutrient limitation; linking the pheromone/invasive growth pathway with cell survivorship. Strikingly, STE12 overexpression was sufficient to extend chronological lifespan under non-restricted conditions. Our global picture of the genetic players of longevity by dietary restriction highlights intricate regulatory cross-talks in aging cells.",

In the present work we report the de novo midgut transcriptomes of four non-model insects from four distinct orders: Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera), Musca domestica (Diptera), Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera) and Dysdercus peruvianus (Hemiptera). We employed a computational strategy to merge assemblies obtained with two different algorithms, which substantially increased the quality of the final transcriptomes. Unigenes were annotated and analyzed using the eggNOG database, which allowed us to assign some level of functional and evolutionary information to 79.7% to 93.1% of the transcriptomes. We found interesting transcriptional patterns, such as: i) the intense use of lysozymes in digestive functions of M. domestica larvae, which are streamlined and adapted to feed on bacteria; ii) the up-regulation of orthologous UDP-glycosyl transferase and cytochrome P450 genes in the whole midguts different species, supporting the presence of an ancient defense frontline to counter xenobiotics; iii) evidence supporting roles for juvenile hormone binding proteins in the midgut physiology, probably as a way to activate genes that help fight anti-nutritional substances (e.g. protease inhibitors). The results presented here shed light on the digestive and structural properties of the digestive systems of these distantly related species. Furthermore, the produced datasets will also be useful for scientists studying these insects.",

We also illustrate the importance of read quality for base modification detection and compare to PacBio methylation calls. With recent demonstrations of nanopore sequencing in Antarctica and onboard the International Space Station, the ability to reliably characterize m6A presents an opportunity to further examine the role of methylation in bacterial adaptation to extreme or very remote environments.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we described a method for multiplex genome editing by natural transformation (MuGENT). Mutant constructs for MuGENT require large arms of homology (>2000 bp) surrounding each genome edit, which necessitates laborious in vitro DNA splicing. In Vibrio cholerae, we uncover that this requirement is due to cytoplasmic ssDNA exonucleases, which inhibit natural transformation. In ssDNA exonuclease mutants, one arm of homology can be reduced to as little as 40 bp while still promoting integration of genome edits at rates of ~50% without selection in cis. Consequently, editing constructs are generated in a single PCR reaction where one homology arm is oligonucleotide encoded. To further enhance editing efficiencies, we also developed a strain for transient inactivation of the mismatch repair system. As a proof-of-concept, we used these advances to rapidly mutate 10 high-affinity binding sites for the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA and generated a duodecuple mutant of 12 diguanylate cyclases in V. cholerae. Whole genome sequencing revealed little to no off-target mutations in these strains. Finally, we show that ssDNA exonucleases inhibit natural transformation in Acinetobacter baylyi. Thus, rational removal of ssDNA exonucleases may be broadly applicable for enhancing the efficacy and ease of MuGENT in diverse naturally transformable species.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the nature and form of prefrontal cortex representations that support flexible behavior is an important open problem in cognitive neuroscience. In humans, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI BOLD measurements has emerged as an important approach for studying neural representations. An implicit, untested assumption underlying many PFC MVPA studies is that the base rate of decoding information from PFC BOLD activity patterns is similar to that of other brain regions. Here we estimate these base rates from a meta-analysis of published MVPA studies and show that the PFC has a significantly lower base rate for decoding than visual sensory cortex. Our results have implications for the design and interpretation of MVPA studies of prefrontal cortex, and raise important questions about its functional organization.",

    "abstract": "Previous research investigating structural neurodevelopmental alterations in individuals who were born very preterm demonstrated a complex pattern of grey matter changes that defy straightforward summary. Here we addressed this problem by characterising volumetric brain alterations in individuals who were born very preterm from adolescence to adulthood at three hierarchically related levels - global, modular and regional. We demarcated structural components that were either particularly resilient or vulnerable to the impact of very preterm birth. We showed that individuals who were born very preterm had smaller global grey matter volume compared to controls, with subcortical and medial temporal regions being particularly affected. Conversely, frontal and lateral parieto-temporal cortices were relatively resilient to the effects of very preterm birth, possibly indicating compensatory mechanisms. Exploratory analyses supported this hypothesis by showing a stronger association of lateral parieto-temporal volume with IQ in the very preterm group compared to controls. We then related these alterations to brain maturation processes. Very preterm individuals exhibited a higher maturation index compared to controls, indicating accelerated brain ageing and this was specifically associated with younger gestational age. We discuss how the findings of accelerated maturation might be reconciled with evidence of delayed maturation at earlier stages of development.",

    "abstract": "Metabolite exchanges in microbial communities give rise to ecological interaction networks that influence ecosystem diversity and stability1-6. These exchanges depend on complex intracellular pathways thus raising the question of whether ecological interactions are inferable from genomes. We address these questions by integrating genome-scale models of metabolism7, to compute the fitness of interacting microbes, with evolutionary game theory, which uses these fitness values to infer evolutionarily stable interactions in multi-species microbial \\\"games\\\". After validating our approach using data on sucrose hydrolysis by S. cerevisiae, we performed over 80,000 in silico experiments to evaluate the rise of unidirectional and cross-feeding metabolic dependencies in populations of Escherichia coli secreting 189 amino acid pairs. We found that, despite the diversity of exchanged amino acids, most pairs conform to general patterns of inter-species interactions. However, several amino acid pairs deviate from these patterns due to pleiotropy and epistasis in metabolic pathways. To better understand the emergence of cross-feeding, we performed in silico invasion experiments and found possible evolutionary paths that could lead to such association. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insights into the rise of evolutionarily stable interdependencies, with important implications for biomedicine and microbiome engineering 8-10.",

    "abstract": "Tumors are composed of an evolving population of cells subjected to tissue-specific selection, which fuels tumor heterogeneity and ultimately complicates cancer driver gene identification. Here, we integrate cancer cell fraction, population recurrence, and functional impact of somatic mutations as signatures of selection into a Bayesian inference model for driver prediction. In an in-depth benchmark, we demonstrate that our model, cDriver, outperforms competing methods when analyzing solid tumors, hematological malignancies, and pan-cancer datasets. Applying cDriver to exome sequencing data of 21 cancer types from 6,870 individuals revealed 98 unreported tumor type-driver gene connections. These novel connections are highly enriched for chromatin-modifying proteins, hinting at a universal role of chromatin regulation in cancer etiology. Although infrequently mutated as single genes, we show that chromatin modifiers are altered in a large fraction of cancer patients. In summary, we demonstrate that integration of evolutionary signatures is key for identifying mutational driver genes, thereby facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.",
