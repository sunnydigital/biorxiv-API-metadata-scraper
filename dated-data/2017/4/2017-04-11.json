    "abstract": "BackgroundCharacterizations of the dynamics of hybrid zones in space and time can give insights about traits and processes important in population divergence and speciation. We characterized a hybrid zone between tanagers in the genus Ramphocelus (Aves, Thraupidae) located in southwestern Colombia. We tested whether this hybrid zone originated as a result of secondary contact or of primary differentiation, and described its dynamics across time using spatial analyses of molecular, morphological, and coloration data in combination with paleodistribution modeling.\\n\\nResultsModels of potential historical distributions based on climatic data and genetic signatures of demographic expansion suggested that the hybrid zone likely originated following secondary contact between populations that expanded their ranges out of isolated areas in the Quaternary. Concordant patterns of variation in phenotypic characters across the hybrid zone and its narrow extent are suggestive of a tension zone, maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. Estimates of phenotypic cline parameters obtained using specimens collected over nearly a century revealed that, in recent decades, the zone appears to have moved to the east and to higher elevations, and has apparently become narrower. Genetic variation was not clearly structured along the hybrid zone, but comparisons between historical and contemporary specimens suggested that temporal changes in its genetic makeup may also have occurred.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data suggest that the hybrid zone likey resulted from secondary contact between populations. The observed changes in the hybrid zone may be a result of sexual selection, asymmetric gene flow, or environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Forward Wright-Fisher simulations are powerful in their ability to model complex demography and selection scenarios, but suffer from slow execution on the CPU, thus limiting their usefulness. The single-locus Wright-Fisher forward algorithm is, however, exceedingly parallelizable, with many steps which are so-called embarrassingly parallel, consisting of a vast number of individual computations that are all independent of each other and thus capable of being performed concurrently. The rise of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and programming languages designed to leverage the inherent parallel nature of these processors have allowed researchers to dramatically speed up many programs that have such high arithmetic intensity and intrinsic concurrency. The presented GPU Optimized Wright-Fisher simulation, or GO Fish for short, can be used to simulate arbitrary selection and demographic scenarios while running over 250-fold faster than its serial counterpart on the CPU. Even modest GPU hardware can achieve an impressive speedup of well over two orders of magnitude. With simulations so accelerated, one can not only do quick parametric bootstrapping of previously estimated parameters, but also use simulated results to calculate the likelihoods and summary statistics of demographic and selection models against real polymorphism data - all without restricting the demographic and selection scenarios that can be modeled or requiring approximations to the single-locus forward algorithm for efficiency. Further, as many of the parallel programming techniques used in this simulation can be applied to other computationally intensive algorithms important in population genetics, GO Fish serves as an exciting template for future research into accelerating computation in evolution. GO Fish is part of the Parallel PopGen Package available at: http://dl42.github.io/ParallelPopGen/",

    "abstract": "Numerous methods have been developed to analyse RNA sequencing data, but most rely on the availability of a reference genome, making them unsuitable for non-model organisms. De novo transcriptome assembly can build a reference transcriptome from the non-model sequencing data, but falls short of allowing most tools to be applied. Here we present superTranscripts, a simple but powerful solution to bridge that gap. SuperTranscripts are a substitute for a reference genome, consisting of all the unique exonic sequence, in transcriptional order, such that each gene is represented by a single sequence. We demonstrate how superTranscripts allow visualization, variant detection and differential isoform detection in non-model organisms, using widely applied methods that are designed to work with reference genomes. SuperTranscripts can also be applied to model organisms to enhance visualization and discover novel expressed sequence. We describe Lace, software to construct superTranscripts from any set of transcripts including de novo assembled transcriptomes. In addition we used Lace to combine reference and assembled transcriptomes for chicken and recovered the sequence of hundreds of gaps in the reference genome.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of genomic and physiological mechanisms related to how organisms living in extreme environments survive and reproduce is an outstanding question facing evolutionary and organismal biologists. One interesting example of adaptation is related to the survival of mammals in deserts, where extreme water limitation is common. Research on desert rodent adaptations has focused predominantly on adaptations related to surviving dehydration, while potential reproductive physiology adaptations for acute and chronic dehydration have been relatively neglected. This study aims to explore the reproductive consequences of acute dehydration by utilizing RNAseq data in the desert-specialized cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus). Specifically, we exposed 22 male cactus mice to either acute dehydration or control (fully hydrated) treatment conditions, quasimapped testes-derived reads to a cactus mouse testes transcriptome, and then evaluated patterns of differential transcript and gene expression. Following statistical evaluation with multiple analytical pipelines, nine genes were consistently differentially expressed between the hydrated and dehydrated mice. We hypothesized that male cactus mice would exhibit minimal reproductive responses to dehydration; therefore, this low number of differentially expressed genes between treatments aligns with current perceptions of this species extreme desert specialization. However, these differentially expressed genes include Insulin-like 3 (Insl3), a regulator of male fertility and testes descent, as well as the solute carriers Slc45a3 and Slc38a5, which are membrane transport proteins that may facilitate osmoregulation. Together, these results suggest that in male cactus mice, acute dehydration may be linked to reproductive modulation via Insl3, but not through gene expression differences in the subset of other a priori tested reproductive hormones. Although water availability is a reproductive cue in desert-rodents exposed to chronic drought, potential reproductive modification via Insl3 in response to acute water-limitation is a result which is unexpected in an animal capable of surviving and successfully reproducing year-round without available external water sources. Indeed, this work highlights the critical need for integrative research that examines every facet of organismal adaptation, particularly in light of global climate change, which is predicted, amongst other things, to increase climate variability, thereby exposing desert animals more frequently to the acute drought conditions explored here.",

    "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of transmitter release probability (Pr) are thought to be triggered by the activation of glutamate receptors. Here, we demonstrate that glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses is in fact inhibitory and unnecessary for increases in Pr. Instead, at active presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic depolarization alone can increase Pr by promoting the release of nitric oxide from neuronal dendrites in a manner dependent on L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The release of glutamate, in contrast, decreases Pr by activating presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Thus, net changes in Pr are determined by the combined effect of both LTP-promoting and LTD-promoting processes, that is, by the amount of glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization that accompany presynaptic activity, respectively. Neither of these processes directly depends on the activation of postsynaptic NMDARs. We further show that presynaptic changes can be captured by a simple learning rule, in which the role of presynaptic plasticity is to ensure that the ability for a presynaptic terminal to release glutamate is matched with its ability to predict postsynaptic spiking.",

    "abstract": "The dinoflagellate-coral partnership influences the coral holobionts tolerance to thermal stress and bleaching. However, the comparative roles of host genetic versus environmental factors in determining the composition of this symbiosis are largely unknown. Here we quantify the heritability of the initial Symbiodinium communities for two broadcast-spawning corals with different symbiont transmission modes: Acropora tenuis has environmental acquisition, whereas Montipora digitata has maternal transmission. Using high throughput sequencing of the ITS-2 region to characterize communities in parents, juveniles and eggs, we describe previously undocumented Symbiodinium diversity and dynamics in both corals. After one month of uptake in the field, Symbiodinium communities associated with A. tenuis juveniles were dominated by A3, C1, D1, A-type CCMP828, and D1a in proportional abundances conserved between experiments in two years. M. digitata eggs were predominantly characterized by C15, D1, and A3. In contrast to current paradigms, host genetic influences accounted for a surprising 29% of phenotypic variation in Symbiodinium communities in the horizontally-transmitting A. tenuis, but only 62% in the vertically-transmitting M. digitata. Our results reveal hitherto unknown flexibility in the acquisition of Symbiodinium communities and substantial heritability in both species, providing material for selection to produce partnerships that are locally adapted to changing environmental conditions.",

Recent studies, however, have established that genetic diversities are mostly at maximum saturation levels maintained by selection, therefore challenging the explanatory power of the neutral theory and rendering the present molecular model of human origins untenable. Using improved methods and public data, we have revisited human evolution and found sharing of genetic variations among racial groups to be largely a result of parallel mutations rather than recent common ancestry and admixture as commonly assumed. We derived an age of 1.86-1.92 million years for the first split in modern human populations based on autosomal diversity data. We found evidence of modern Y and mtDNA originating in East Asia and dispersing via hybridization with archaic humans. Analyses of autosomes, Y and mtDNA all suggest that Denisovan and Neanderthal were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures and ancestors of South Asia Negritos and Aboriginal Australians. Verifying our model, we found more ancestry of Southern Chinese from Hunan in Africans relative to other East Asian groups examined. These results suggest multiregional evolution of autosomes and replacements of archaic Y and mtDNA by modern ones originating in East Asia, thereby leading to a coherent account of modern human origins.",

We have found that a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells in the olfactory bulb explicitly represent {Delta}Ct. These concentration change detectors are direction selective: some respond to positive {Delta}Ct, while others represent negative {Delta}Ct. This change detection enhances the contrast between different concentrations and the magnitude of contrast enhancement scales with the size of the concentration step. Further, {Delta}Ct can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells explicitly represents {Delta}Ct, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.",

During a reinforcement learning task, the information content of positive and negative outcomes was manipulated independently by varying the volatility of their occurrence. Human participants altered the learning rates used for the outcomes selectively, preferentially learning from the most informative. This behaviour was associated with activity of the central norepinephrine system, estimated using pupilometry, for loss outcomes.

ROS are essential for antigen specific activation of T cells, but little is known about what role ROS play in NKT cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of ROS in NKT cell function. We found that ROS levels are similar among CD4, CD8 and NKT cell subsets in the thymus. However, NKT cells, but neither CD4 nor CD8 T cells, showed dramatically increased ROS in the spleen and liver but not in adipose tissues. ROS in the peripheral NKT cells were primarily produced by NADPH oxidases not mitochondria. Accordingly, ROS-high NKT cells were susceptible to oxidative stress and underwent apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, ROS play an important role in regulating the inflammatory function of NKT cells because antioxidant treatment of NKT cells showed reduced frequencies of IFN-{gamma}+ and IL-17+ cells. In line with this, freshly isolated ROS-high NKT cells had more NKT1 and NKT17 cells but less NKT2 than ROS-low cells. These characteristics are regulated by promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) as evidenced by low ROS in NKT cells from PLZF haplodeficient mice and also from adipose tissues that do not express PLZF. Conversely, ROS were highly elevated in CD4 T cells from mice ectopically expressing PLZF. Together, our study revealed for the first time that ROS regulate NKT cell functions through PLZF.",

We analysed somatic mutations called from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from 3000 tumors across the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes to identify and functionally characterize mutation accumulation and its impact on gene dysregulation in cancer. We identified 1.5 million motif disruption domains (MDDs) across 40 cancer types, which we characterized as pan-cancer targets for recurrent mutation accumulation. These MDDs deregulate gene expression in cancer-specific and pan-cancer patterns by disrupting transcription factor binding sites in regulatory and insulator elements. Disruption is most recurrent across individuals at MDDs in conserved open chromatin, revealing potential drivers. This accumulation of somatic variants targeting regulatory and structural elements in MDDs generates gene expression dysregulation during tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Stable cytoplasmic bridges arise from failed cytokinesis, the last step of cell division, and are a key feature of syncytial architectures in the germ line of most metazoans. Whereas the C. elegans germ line is syncytial, its formation remains poorly understood. We studied the role of ANI-2, a noncanonical and shorter form of the actomyosin scaffold protein anillin that is expressed specifically during embryogenesis in the germ line precursor blastomere, P4. We found that the P4 blastomere does not complete abscission following cytokinesis, leaving a stable cytoplasmic bridge between the two daughter cells. Interestingly, depletion of ANI-2 results in a regression of the membrane partition between the two cells, indicating that ANI-2 is required to stabilize the cytoplasmic bridge. We identified several contractility regulators that, like ANI-2, localize to the cytoplasmic bridge and are required to stabilize it. Epistatic analysis of these regulators mutual dependencies revealed a pathway in which Rho regulators promote ANI-2 accumulation at the stable cytoplasmic bridge, which in turns promotes the accumulation of the non-muscle myosin II NMY-2 and the midbody component CYK-7 at the bridge, in part by limiting the accumulation of canonical anillin ANI-1. Our results uncover key steps in C. elegans germ line formation and define a set of conserved regulators that ensure the proper stability of the primordial germ cell cytoplasmic bridge during embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in GLE1 underlie Lethal Congenital Contracture syndrome (LCCS1) and Lethal Arthrogryposis with Anterior Horn Cell Disease (LAAHD). Both LCCS1 and LAAHD are characterized by reduced fetal movements, congenital contractures, and a severe form of motor neuron disease that results in fetal death or death in the perinatal period, respectively. Via trio-exome sequencing, we identified bi-allelic mutations in GLE1 in two unrelated individuals with motor delays, feeding difficulties and respiratory insufficiency who survived beyond the perinatal period. Each affected child had missense variants predicted to result in amino acid substitutions near the C-terminus of GLE1 that are predicted to disrupt protein-protein interaction or GLE1 protein targeting. We hypothesize that mutations that preserve function of the coiled-coil domain of GLE1 cause LAAHD whereas mutations that abolish the function of the coiled-coil domain cause LCCS1. The phenotype of LAAHD is now expanded to include multiple individuals surviving into childhood suggesting that LAAHD is a misnomer and should be re-named Arthrogryposis with Anterior Horn Cell Disease (AAHD). Too few cases have been reported to identify significant genotype-phenotype relationships, but given that perinatal lethality in AAHD typically resulted from respiratory failure, it is possible that early or aggressive airway management such as early tracheostomy and ventilation may enable survival beyond the perinatal period.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomic analyses of microRNAs (miRNAs) have yielded myriad insights into their biogenesis and regulatory activity. While miRNAs have been deeply annotated in a small cohort of model organisms, evolutionary assessments of miRNA flux are clouded by the functional uncertainty of orthologs in related species, and insufficient data regarding the extent of species-specific miRNAs. We address this by generating a comparative small RNA (sRNA) catalog of unprecedented breadth and depth across the Drosophila genus, extending our extant deep analyses of D. melanogaster with sRNA data from multiple tissues of 11 other fly species. Aggregate analysis of several billion sRNA reads permits curation of accurate and holistic compendia of miRNAs across this genus, providing abundant opportunities to identify species- and clade-specific variation in miRNA identity, abundance, and processing. Amongst well-conserved miRNAs, we observe unexpected cases of clade-specific variation in 5' end precision, occasional antisense loci, and some putatively non-canonical loci. We also employ strict criteria to identify a massive set (649) of novel, evolutionarily-restricted miRNAs. Amongst the bulk collection of species-restricted miRNAs, two notable subpopulations of rapidly-evolving miRNAs are splicing-derived mirtrons and testis-restricted, clustered (TRC) canonical miRNAs. We quantify rates of miRNA birth and death using our annotation and a phylogenetic model for estimating rates of miRNA turnover in the presence of annotation uncertainty. We show striking differences in birth and death rates across miRNA classes defined by biogenesis pathway, genomic clustering, and tissue restriction, and even identify variation heterogeneity amongst Drosophila clades. In particular, distinct molecular rationales underlie the distinct evolutionary behavior of different miRNA classes. We broaden observations made from D. melanogaster as Drosophilid-wide principles for opposing evolutionary viewpoints for miRNA maintenance. Mirtrons are associated with a high rate of 3' untemplated addition, a mechanism that impedes their biogenesis, whereas TRC miRNAs appear to evolve under positive selection. Altogether, these data reveal miRNA diversity amongst Drosophila species and permit future discoveries in understanding their emergence and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is involved in a multitude of essential cellular functions. Dyneins activity is controlled by the combinatorial action of several regulators. The molecular mechanism of this regulation is poorly understood. Using purified proteins, we reconstitute the regulation of the human dynein complex by three prominent regulators on dynamic microtubules in the presence of end binding proteins (EBs). We find that dynein can be in biochemically and functionally distinct pools: either passively tracking dynamic microtubule plus-ends in an EB-dependent manner or moving processively towards minus ends in an adaptor protein-dependent manner. Whereas both dynein pools share the dynactin complex, they have opposite preferences for binding other regulators, either the adaptor protein Bicaudal D2 (BicD2) or the multifunctional regulator Lisencephaly-1 (Lis1). Remarkably, dynactin, but not EBs, strongly biases motility initiation locally from microtubule plus ends by autonomous plus end recognition. BicD2 and Lis1 together control the overall efficiency of motility initiation. Our study provides insight into the mechanism of dynein activity regulation by dissecting the distinct functional contributions of the individual members of a dynein regulatory network.",

Using the planarian stem cell system to investigate the role of the COMPASS family of MLL3/4 histone methyltransferases, we demonstrate that their role as tumour suppressors in stem cells is conserved over a large evolutionary distance in animals. This also suggested the potential conservation of a genome wide epigenetic regulation program in animal stem cells, so we assessed the regulatory effects of Mll3/4 loss of function by performing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on the G2/M planarian stem cell population, part of which contributes to the formation of outgrowths. We find many oncogenes and tumour suppressors among the affected genes that are therefore likely candidates for mediating MLL3/4 tumour suppression function in mammals, where little is known about in vivo regulatory targets. Our work demonstrates conservation of an important epigenetic regulatory program in animals and highlights the utility of the planarian model system for studying epigenetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks (GRN) evolve as a result of the coevolutionary process acting on transcription factors and the cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) they bind. The zinc-finger transcription factor (TF) zelda (zld) is essential for maternal zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand CRMs to regulate chromatin accessibility. D. melanogaster displays a long germ type of embryonic development, where all segments are simultaneously generated along the whole egg. However, it remains unclear if zld is also involved in MZT of short-germ insects (including those from basal lineages) or in other biological processes. Here we show that zld is an innovation of the Pancrustacea lineage, being absent in more distant arthropods (e.g. chelicerates) and other organisms. To better understand zlds ancestral function, we thoroughly investigated its roles in a short-germ beetle, Tribolium castaneum, using molecular biology and computational approaches. Our results demonstrate roles for zld not only during the MZT, but also in posterior segmentation and patterning of imaginal disc derived structures. Further, we also demonstrate that zld is critical for posterior segmentation in the hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus, indicating this function predates the origin of holometabolous insects and was subsequently lost in long-germ insects. Our results unveil new roles of zld in maintaining pluripotent state of progenitor cells at the posterior region and suggest that changes in expression of zld (and probably other pioneer TFs) are critical in the evolution of insect GRNs.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). This homeostatic response activates signaling pathways that seek to reinstate a proper ER protein folding balance or induce apoptosis if ER stress persists. Recently, we and others identified human FICD (Filamentation induced by cyclic AMP domain-containing protein), an enzyme with adenylyltransferase (aka AMPylation) activity, as a new UPR target. Here, we demonstrate that FICD is functionally linked to the UPR, as evidenced by the finding that the adenylyltransferase activity of the protein induces ER stress, while FICD silencing increases sensitivity to ER stress. We identify BiP, an abundant ER chaperone and key regulator of the UPR, as the main substrate of FICD AMPylation in ER-derived microsomes, further emphasizing close functional connection of FICD to the UPR and in line with recent reports that AMPylation inactivates BiP. Notably, BiP overexpression increased the levels of BiP AMPylation as well as FICD auto-AMPylation, suggesting a homeostatic response that balances the pool of active BiP to modulate its functions in protein folding as well as UPR signaling. Finally, we show that overexpressed FICD forms a disulfide-bonded homo-dimer through Cys51 and Cys75 and demonstrate that mutation of these two cysteines in the context of a hyperactive FICD mutant leads to increased BiP AMPylation. This latter finding opens up the possibility that FICD activity is redox regulated and closely connected with ER redox homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of transcriptional cofactors by sequence-specific transcription factors challenges the basis of high affinity and selective interactions. Extending previous studies that the N-terminal activation domain (AD) of ETV5 interacts with Mediator subunit 25 (MED25), we establish that similar, aromatic-rich motifs located both in the AD and in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the related ETS factor ETV4 interact with MED25. These ETV4 regions bind MED25 independently, display distinct kinetics, and combine to contribute to a high-affinity interaction of full-length ETV4 with MED25. Within the ETS family, high-affinity interactions with MED25 are specific for the ETV1/4/5 subfamily as other ETS factors display weaker or no detectable binding. The AD binds to a single site on MED25 and the DBD interacts with three MED25 sites, allowing for simultaneous binding of both domains in full-length ETV4. MED25 also stimulates the in vitro DNA binding activity of ETV4 by relieving autoinhibition. ETV1/4/5 factors are often overexpressed in prostate cancer and genome-wide studies in a prostate cancer cell line indicate that ETV4 and MED25 occupy enhancers that are enriched for ETS-binding sequences and are both functionally important for the transcription of genes regulated by these enhancers. AP1-binding sequences were observed in MED25-occupied regions and JUN/FOS also contact MED25; FOS strongly binds to the same MED25 site as ETV4 AD and JUN interacts with the other two MED25 sites. In summary, we describe features of the multivalent ETV4- and AP1-MED25 interactions, thereby implicating these factors in the recruitment of MED25 to transcriptional control elements.",

    "abstract": "Many cancer cell lines depend on extracellular glutamine as a major tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anaplerotic substrate to support proliferation in vitro. However, recent studies have suggested that some cells that depend on glutamine anaplerosis in culture rely much less on glutamine catabolism to proliferate in vivo, with environmental differences between tumors and cell culture influencing the extent of glutamine catabolism. Here we sought to better understand the environmental differences that cause differential dependence on glutamine for TCA cycle anaplerosis. We find that cells cultured in adult bovine serum, a condition that more closely reflects the nutrients available to cells in vivo, leads to decreased glutamine catabolism and reliance on glutamine anaplerosis compared to standard tissue culture conditions. By analyzing the nutrient differences between bovine serum and media, we find that levels of a single nutrient, cystine, can account for the differential dependence on glutamine in these different environmental contexts. Further, we show that cystine levels dictate glutamine dependence via the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT/SLC7A11, and that environmental cystine levels in conjunction with xCT/SLC7A11 expression is necessary and sufficient to drive increased glutamine anaplerosis, defining important determinants of glutamine anaplerosis and glutaminase dependence in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Many automatic classifiers were introduced to aid inference of phenotypical effects of uncategorised nsSNVs (nonsynonymous Single Nucleotide Variations) in theoretical and medical applications. Lately, several meta-estimators have been proposed that combine different predictors, such as PolyPhen and SIFT, to integrate more information in a single score. Although many advances have been made in feature design and machine learning algorithms used, the shortage of high-quality reference data along with the bias towards intensively studied in vitro models call for improved generalisation ability in order to further increase classification accuracy and handle records with insufficient data. Since a meta-estimator basically combines different scoring systems with highly complicated nonlinear relationships, we investigated how deep learning (supervised and unsupervised), which is particularly efficient at discovering hierarchies of features, can improve classification performance. While it is believed that one should only use deep learning for high-dimensional input spaces and other models (logistic regression, support vector machines, Bayesian classifiers, etc) for simpler inputs, we still believe that the ability of neural networks to discover intricate structure in highly heterogenous datasets can aid a meta-estimator. We compare the performance with various popular predictors, many of which are recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), as well as available deep learning-based predictors. Thanks to hardware acceleration we were able to use a computationally expensive genetic algorithm to stochastically optimise hyper-parameters over many generations. Overfitting was hindered by noise injection and dropout, limiting coadaptation of hidden units. Although we stress that this work was not conceived as a tool comparison, but rather an exploration of the possibilities of deep learning application in ensemble scores, our results show that even relatively simple modern neural networks can significantly improve both prediction accuracy and coverage.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSince the introduction of microarrays in 1995, researchers world-wide have used both commercial and custom-designed microarrays for understanding differential expression of transcribed genes. Public databases such as ArrayExpress and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) have made millions of samples readily available. One main drawback to microarray data analysis involves the selection of probes to represent a specific transcript of interest, particularly in light of the fact that transcript-specific knowledge (notably alternative splicing) is dynamic in nature.\\n\\nResultsWe therefore developed a framework for reannotating and reassigning probe groups for Affymetrix(R) GeneChip(R) technology based on functional regions of interest. This framework addresses three issues of Affymetrix(R) GeneChip(R) data analyses: removing nonspecific probes, updating probe target mapping based on the latest genome knowledge and grouping probes into gene, transcript and region-based (UTR, individual exon, CDS) probe sets. Updated gene and transcript probe sets provide more specific analysis results based on current genomic and transcriptomic knowledge. The framework selects unique probes, aligns them to gene annotations and generates a custom Chip Description File (CDF). The analysis reveals only 87% of the Affymetrix(R) GeneChip(R) HG-U133 Plus 2 probes uniquely align to the current hg38 human assembly without mismatches. We also tested new mappings on the publicly available data series using rat and human data from GSE48611 and GSE72551 obtained from GEO, and illustrate that functional grouping allows for the subtle detection of regions of interest likely to have phenotypical consequences.\\n\\nConclusionThrough reanalysis of the publicly available data series GSE48611 and GSE72551, we profiled the contribution of UTR and CDS regions to the gene expression levels globally. The comparison between region and gene based results indicated that the detected expressed genes by gene-based and region-based CDFs show high consistency and regions based results allows us to detection of changes in transcript formation.",

However, downstream variant analysis, whole-genome level in particular, has been lacking a multi-purpose tool, which could take advantage of rapidly growing genomic information and integrate genetic variant, sequence, genomic annotation and regulatory (e.g. ENCODE) data interactively and in a visual fashion. Here we introduce a highly efficient and user-friendly software, BasePlayer (http://baseplayer.fi), for biological discovery in large-scale NGS data. BasePlayer enables tightly integrated comparative variant analysis and visualization of thousands of NGS data samples and millions of variants, with numerous applications in disease, regulatory and population genomics. Although BasePlayer has been designed primarily for whole-genome and exome sequencing data, it is well-suited to various study settings, diseases and organisms by supporting standard and upcoming file formats. BasePlayer transforms an ordinary desktop computer into a large-scale genomic research platform, enabling also a non-technical user to perform complex comparative variant analyses, population frequency filtering and genome level annotations under intuitive, scalable and highly-responsive user interface to facilitate everyday genetic research as well as the search of novel discoveries.",

    "abstract": "One of the triumphs of evolutionary biology is the discovery of robust mechanisms that promote the evolution of cooperative behaviors even when those behaviors reduce the fertility or survival of cooperators. Though these mechanisms, kin selection, reciprocity, and nonlinear payoffs to cooperation, have been extensively studied separately, investigating their joint effect on the evolution of cooperation has been more difficult. Moreover, how these mechanisms shape variation in cooperation is not well known. Such variation is crucial for understanding the evolution of behavioral syndromes and animal personality. Here, I use the tools of kin selection theory and evolutionary game theory to build a framework that integrates these mechanisms for pairwise social interactions. Using relatedness as a measure of the strength of kin selection, responsiveness as a measure of reciprocity, and synergy as a measure of payoff nonlinearity, I show how different combinations of these three parameters produce directional selection for or against cooperation or variation in levels of cooperation via balancing or diversifying selection. Moreover, each of these outcomes maps uniquely to one of four classic games from evolutionary game theory, which means that modulating relatedness, responsiveness, and synergy effectively transforms the payoff matrix from one the evolutionary game to another. Assuming that cooperation exacts a fertility cost on cooperators and provides a fertility benefit to social partners, a prisoners dilemma game and directional selection against cooperation occur when relatedness and responsiveness are low and synergy is not too positive. Enough positive synergy in these conditions generates a stag-hunt game and diversifying selection. High levels of relatedness or responsiveness turn cooperation from a fitness cost into a fitness benefit, which produces a mutualism game and directional selection for cooperation when synergy is not too negative. Sufficiently negative synergy in this case creates a hawk-dove game and balancing selection for cooperation. I extend the results with relatedness and synergy to larger social groups and show that how group size changes the effect of relatedness and synergy on selection for cooperation depends on how the per capita benefit of cooperation changes with group size. Together, these results provide a general framework with which to generate comparative predictions that can be tested using quantitative genetic techniques and experimental techniques that manipulate investment in cooperation. These predictions will help us understand both interspecific variation in cooperation as well as within-population and within-group variation in cooperation related to behavioral syndromes.",

We here describe a new species as Oscarella pearsei, sp. nov. and redescribe Oscarella carmela; the original description was based upon material from both species. Further, we correct the identification of published genomic/transcriptomic resources that were originally attributed to O. carmela, and present new Illumina-sequenced transcriptome assemblies for each of these species, and the mitochondrial genome sequence for O. pearsei sp. nov. Using SSU and LSU ribosomal DNA and the mitochondrial genome, we report the phylogenetic relationships of these species relative to other Oscarella species, and find strong support for placement of O. pearsei sp. nov. in a clade defined by the presence of spherulous cells that contain paracrystalline inclusions; O. carmela lacks this cell type and is most closely related to the Western Pacific species, O. malakhovi. Oscarella pearsei sp. nov and O. carmela can be tentatively distinguished based upon gross morphological differences such as color, surface texture and extent of mucus production, but can be more reliably identified using mitochondrial and nuclear barcode sequencing, ultrastructural characteristics of cells in the mesohyl, and the morphology of the follicle epithelium which surrounds the developing embryo in reproductively active individuals. Usually, cryptic species are very closely related to each other, but in this case and in sponges generally, cryptic species may be very distantly related because sponges can be difficult to identify based upon gross morphological characteristics.",

Generation of this atlas was made possible by the use of CAGE, an experimental approach to localise transcription start sites at single-nucleotide resolution by sequencing the 5' ends of capped RNAs after their conversion to cDNAs. While 50% of CAGE-defined promoter regions could be confidently associated to adjacent transcriptional units, nearly 100,000 promoter regions remained gene-orphan. To address this, we used the CAGEscan method, in which random-primed 5'-cDNAs are paired-end sequenced. Pairs starting in the same region are assembled in transcript models called CAGEscan clusters. Here, we present the production and quality control of CAGEscan libraries from 56 FANTOM5 RNA sources, which enhances the FANTOM5 expression atlas by providing experimental evidence associating core promoter regions with their cognate transcripts.",

    "abstract": "In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration banned the use of specific microbicides in some household and personal wash products. This decision was due to concerns that these chemicals might induce antibiotic resistance or disrupt human microbial communities. Triclosan and triclocarban (referred to as TCs) are the most common antimicrobials in household and personal care products, but the extent to which TC exposure perturbs microbial communities in humans, particularly during infant development, was unknown. We conducted a randomized intervention of TC-containing household and personal care products during the first year following birth to characterize whether TC exposure from wash products perturbs microbial communities in mothers and their infants. Longitudinal survey of the intestinal microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing showed that TC exposure from wash products did not induce global reconstruction of either infant or maternal intestinal microbiotas following 10 months of exposure after birth. However, broadly antibiotic-resistant species from the phylum Proteobacteria were enriched in stool samples from mothers in TC households only after the introduction of triclosan-containing toothpaste. Despite the minimal effects of TC exposure from wash products on the gut microbial community of infants and adults, these results suggest detected taxonomic differences are associated with potential harmful effects on host physiology, highlighting the need for consumer safety testing of self-care products not subject to the ban on the human microbiome and health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive theories suggest that working memory maintains not only the identity of recently-presented stimuli but also a sense of the elapsed time since the stimuli presentation. Previous studies of the neural underpinnings of working memory have focused on sustained firing, which can account for maintenance of the stimulus identity, but not for representation of the elapsed time. We analyzed single-unit recordings from the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) during performance of a delayed-match-to-category task. The sample stimulus triggered a consistent sequence of neurons, each neuron in the sequence firing during a circumscribed period of time. The sequences initiated by different sample stimuli were distinct but overlapping, with the degree of overlap reflecting the visual similarity of the stimuli that caused the sequences. These sequences of neurons encoded both stimulus identity and the elapsed time. The temporal code became less precise as the sample stimulus receded into the past. These findings suggest that working memory is maintained as a compressed timeline, consistent with longstanding cognitive theories of human memory.",

To isolate these mechanisms, we developed a multi-step decision task for mice in which both action-state transition probabilities and reward probabilities changed over time. Calcium imaging revealed ramps of choice-selective neuronal activity, followed by an evolving representation of the state reached and trial outcome, with different neuronal populations representing reward in different states. ACC neurons represented the current action-state transition structure, whether state transitions were expected or surprising, and the predicted state given chosen action.

While the mechanism of this oscillation continues to be debated, it has been shown to bear positive relation to memory capacity, attention and a host of other cognitive outcomes. Here we show that this feature is largely undetected in the EEG of adults without post-primary education and access to modern technologies. Furthermore, we show that the spatial extent and energy of the oscillation have wide variation, with energy ranging over a thousand fold across the breath of humanity with no centralizing mean. This represents a divergence in a fundamental functional characteristic of an organ demonstrating both that modernization has had a profound influence on brain dynamics and that a meaningful  average human brain does not exist in a dynamical sense.",

    "abstract": "The small caliber of central nervous system (CNS) axons makes routine study of axonal physiology relatively difficult. However, while recording extracellular action potentials from neurons cultured on planer multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) we found activity among groups of electrodes consistent with action potential propagation in single neurons. Action potential propagation was evident as widespread, repetitive cooccurrence of extracellular action potentials (eAPs) among groups of electrodes. These eAPs occurred with invariant sequences and inter-electrode latencies that were consistent with reported measures of action potential propagation in unmyelinated axons. Within co-active electrode groups, the inter-electrode eAP latencies were temperature sensitive, as expected for action potential propagation. Our data are consistent with these signals primarily reflecting axonal action potential propagation, from axons with a high density of voltage-gated sodium channels. Repeated codetection of eAPs by multiple electrodes confirmed these eAPs are from individual neurons and averaging these eAPs revealed sub-threshold events at other electrodes. The sequence of electrodes at which eAPs co-occur uniquely identifies these neurons, allowing us to monitor spiking of single identified neurons within neuronal ensembles. We recorded dynamic changes in single axon physiology such as simultaneous increases and decreases in excitability in different portions of single axonal arbors over several hours. Over several weeks, we measured changes in inter-electrode propagation latencies and ongoing changes in excitability in different regions of single axonal arbors. We recorded action potential propagation signals in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons which could thus be used to study axonal physiology in human disease models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementStudying the physiology of central nervous system axons is limited by the technical challenges of recording from axons with pairs of patch or extracellular electrodes at two places along single axons. We studied action potential propagation in single axonal arbors with extracellular recording with multi-electrode arrays. These recordings were non-invasive and were done from several sites of small caliber axons and branches. Unlike conventional extracellular recording, we unambiguously identified and labelled the neuronal source of propagating action potentials. We manipulated and quantified action potential propagation and found a surprisingly high density of axonal voltage-gated sodium channels. Our experiments also demonstrate that the excitability of different portions of axonal arbors can be independently regulated on time scales from hours to weeks.",

Finally, composite EEG scores representing the dominant principal component scale in remarkable lockstep with the dominant component of the features of modernization.

From 815 variables, a reduced number of latent variables (LVs) were extracted with a clustering method, for further reclassification of subjects using the k-means method. This approach allowed multivariate analysis to be applied to a significantly larger number of variables than the number of cases (E.

However, in theory, a large number of small effect-size genes could cumulative play a substantial role in pathway function, potentially by acting as \\\"modifiers\\\" that tune the levels of large effect size pathway components. To understand the role of these small effect-size genes, we used a quantitative assay to determine the number, strength, and identity of all non-essential genes that affect two galactose-responsive (GAL) traits, in addition to re-analyzing two previously screened quantitative traits. Over a quarter of assayed genes have a detectable effect; approximately two thirds of the quantitative trait variation comes from small effect-size genes. The functions of small effect-size genes are partially overlapping between traits and are enriched in core cellular processes.

However, it remains unclear how chaperonin-assisted folding is different from spontaneous folding. Chaperonin GroEL/GroES facilitates folding of denatured protein encapsulated in its central cage but the denatured protein often escapes from the cage to the outside during reaction. Here, we show evidence that the in-cage-folding and the escape occur diverging from the same intermediate complex in which polypeptide is tethered loosely to the cage and partly protrudes out of the cage. Furthermore, denatured proteins in the chaperonin cage start their folding from extended conformations but not from compact conformations as usually observed in spontaneous folding. We propose that the formation of tethered intermediate of polypeptide is necessary to prevent polypeptide collapse at the expense of polypeptide escape. The tethering of polypeptide would allow freely mobile portions of tethered polypeptide to fold segmentally. The folding acceleration and deceleration by chaperonin for various substrate proteins can be explained by considering the tethering.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial adhesion to host receptors is an early and essential step in bacterial colonization, and the nature of adhesion-receptor interactions determines bacterial localization and thus the outcome of these interactions. Here, we determine the host receptors for the Multivalent Adhesion Molecule from the gut commensal E. coli HS (MAMHS), which contains an array of seven mammalian cell entry (MCE) domains. The MAMHS adhesin interacts with a range of host receptors, through recognition of a shared 3-O-sulfo-galactosyl moiety. This functional group is also found in mucin, a component of the intestinal mucus layer and thus one of the prime adherence targets for commensal E. coli. Mucin gels impede the motility of E. coli by acting as a physical barrier, and the barrier effect is enhanced by specific interactions between mucin and MAMHS in a sulfation-dependent manner. Desulfation of mucin by pure sulfatase or the sulfatase-producing commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron decreases binding of E. coli to mucin and increases attachment of bacteria to the epithelial surface, through interactions with surface-localized sulfated lipid and protein receptors. Together, our results demonstrate that the E. coli adhesin MAMHS facilitates retention of a gut commensal by mucin, and suggest that the amount of sulfatase secreted by mucin-foraging bacteria inhabiting the same niche, such as B. thetaiotaomicron, may affect the capacity of the mucus barrier to retain commensal E. coli.",

Although the positioning of this boundary is critical for leaf morphogenesis, how the boundary is established and how it influences development remains unclear. Using live-imaging and perturbation experiments we show that leaf orientation, morphology and position are pre-patterned by HD-ZIPIII and KAN gene expression in the shoot, leading to a model in which dorsoventral genes coordinate to regulate plant development by localizing auxin response between their expression domains. However we also find that auxin levels feedback on dorsoventral patterning by spatially organizing HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression in the shoot periphery. By demonstrating that the regulation of these genes by auxin also governs their response to wounds, our results also provide a parsimonious explanation for the influence of wounds on leaf dorsoventrality.\\n\\nOnce sentence summaryCell type boundaries regulate plant development",

Here we show that a specific class of central amygdala neurons, the protein kinase C-{delta}-expressing neurons, is essential for the synaptic plasticity underlying learning in the lateral amygdala, as it is required for lateral amygdala neurons to respond to unconditioned stimulus, and furthermore carries information about the unconditioned stimulus to instruct learning.

    "abstract": "The present study examined whether a cognitive process model that is inferred based on group data holds, and is meaningful, at the level of the individual person. Investigation of this issue is tantamount to questioning that the same set and configuration of cognitive processes is present within all individuals, a usually untested assumption in standard group-based experiments. Search from memory as assessed with the Sternberg memory scanning paradigm is among the most widely studied phenomena in cognitive psychology. According to the original memory scanning model, search is serial and exhaustive. Here we critically examined the validity of this model across individuals and practice. 32 younger adults completed 1488 trials of the Sternberg task distributed over eight sessions. In the first session, group data followed the pattern predicted by the original model, replicating earlier findings. However, data from the first session were not sufficiently reliable for identifying whether each individual complied with the serial exhaustive search model. In sessions six to eight, when participants performed near asymptotic levels of performance, between-person differences were reliable, group data deviated substantially from the original memory search model, and the model fit only 13 of the 32 participants data. Our findings challenge the proposition that one general memory search process exists within a group of healthy younger adults, and questions the testability of this proposition at the individual level in single-session experiments. Implications for cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience are discussed with reference to earlier work emphasizing the explicit consideration of potentially existent individual differences.\\n\\nAuthor NoteThis study was conducted within the project \\\"Cognitive and Neural Dynamics of Memory Across the Lifespan (CONMEM) \\\" at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.

This study was conducted to determine if elevated physical activity contributes to hyperthermic responses to MDMA in a well controlled animal model. Unrestrained male Wistar rats were monitored with minimally-invasive radiotelemetry techniques following challenge with MDMA (1.0, 5.6 and 10.0 mg/kg, s.c.). Studies were conducted in low (23-25{degrees}C) and high (27{degrees}C) ambient temperature (TA), with and without access to an activity wheel. The study confirmed dose dependent effects on body temperature, chamber activity and wheel activity which were modified by different TA conditions. Increases in wheel and home chamber activity produced by 10 mg/kg MDMA increased the magnitude of hyperthermia under 27{degrees}C TA. Furthermore, greater subject mortality was observed in the wheel-access condition compared with the no-wheel condition. These data provide direct evidence that sustained physical activity increases the hyperthermic response to MDMA and that this is associated with increased lethality. This is the first direct experimental confirmation that increased physical activity may be a risk factor for adverse reactions to MDMA in human user populations.",

The advent of third generation sequencing technologies providing significantly longer reads opens up new possibilities. However, the high error rates common to these technologies set new bioinformatics challenges for the gapped alignment of reads to their genomic origin. In this study, we have explored how currently available RNA-seq splice-aware alignment tools cope with increased read lengths and error rates. All tested tools were initially developed for short NGS reads, but some have claimed support for long PacBio or even ONT MinION reads.\\n\\nResultsThe tools were tested on synthetic and real datasets from the PacBio and ONT MinION technologies, and both alignment quality and resource usage were compared across tools. The effect of error correction of long reads was explored, both using self-correction and correction with an external short reads dataset. A tool was developed for evaluating RNA-seq alignment results. This tool can be used to compare the alignment of simulated reads to their genomic origin, or to compare the alignment of real reads to a set of annotated transcripts.\\n\\nOur tests show that while some RNA-seq aligners were unable to cope with long error-prone reads, others produced overall good results.

    "abstract": "We introduce the feature-weighted receptive field (fwRF), an encoding model designed to balance expressiveness, interpretability and scalability. The fwRF is organized around the notion of a feature map--a transformation of visual stimuli into visual features that preserves the topology of visual space (but not necessarily the native resolution of the stimulus). The key assumption of the fwRF model is that activity in each voxel encodes variation in a spatially localized region across multiple feature maps. This region is fixed for all feature maps; however, the contribution of each feature map to voxel activity is weighted. Thus, the model has two separable sets of parameters: \\\"where\\\" parameters that characterize the location and extent of pooling over visual features, and \\\"what\\\" parameters that characterize tuning to visual features. The \\\"where\\\" parameters are analogous to classical receptive fields, while \\\"what\\\" parameters are analogous to classical tuning functions. By treating these as separable parameters, the fwRF model complexity is independent of the resolution of the underlying feature maps. This makes it possible to estimate models with thousands of high-resolution feature maps from relatively small amounts of data. Once a fwRF model has been estimated from data, spatial pooling and feature tuning can be read-off directly with no (or very little) additional post-processing or in-silico experimentation.\\n\\nWe describe an optimization algorithm for estimating fwRF models from data acquired during standard visual neuroimaging experiments. We then demonstrate the models application to two distinct sets of features: Gabor wavelets and features supplied by a deep convolutional neural network. We show that when Gabor feature maps are used, the fwRF model recovers receptive fields and spatial frequency tuning functions consistent with known organizational principles of the visual cortex. We also show that a fwRF model can be used to regress entire deep convolutional networks against brain activity. The ability to use whole networks in a single encoding model yields state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. Our results suggest a wide variety of uses for the feature-weighted receptive field model, from retinotopic mapping with natural scenes, to regressing the activities of whole deep neural networks onto measured brain activity.",

Across various conditions including metabolic (glycolytic or mitochondrial) inhibition or cell proliferation, we observed distinct patterns of AMPK activity, including stable adaptation and highly dynamic behaviors such as periodic oscillations and irregular fluctuations, indicating a failure to reach a steady state.

In this study, we report that during quiescence, the unicellular haploid fission yeast accumulates mutations as a linear function of time. We determined that 3 days of quiescence generate a number of invalidating mutations equivalent to that of one round of DNA replication. The novel mutational landscape of quiescence is characterized by insertion/deletion accumulating as fast as single nucleotide variants, and elevated amounts of deletions. When we extended the study to 3 months of quiescence, we confirmed the replication-independent mutational spectrum at the whole-genome level of a clonally aged population and uncovered phenotypic variations that subject the cells to natural selection. Thus, our results support the idea that genomes continuously evolve under two alternating phases that will impact on their size and composition.",

Building on previous work (Sohoglu & Chait, 2016b), stimuli were artificial  sound-scapes populated by multiple (up to 14) simultaneous sources ( auditory objects) comprised of tone-pip sequences, each with a distinct frequency and pattern of amplitude modulation. Sequences were either temporally regular or random.\\n\\nWe show that listeners ability to detect abrupt appearance or disappearance of a source is facilitated when scene sources were characterized by a temporally regular fluctuation pattern. The patterning of the changing source as well as that of the background (non-changing) sources contribute independently to this effect. Remarkably, listeners benefit from regularity even when they are not consciously aware of it.

    "abstract": "Gene drives have the potential to rapidly replace a harmful wild-type allele with a gene drive allele engineered to have desired functionalities. However, an accidental or premature release of a gene drive construct to the natural environment could damage an ecosystem irreversibly. Thus, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal consequences of the super-Mendelian population genetics prior to potential applications. Here, we employ a reaction-diffusion model for sexually reproducing diploid organisms to study how a locally introduced gene drive allele spreads to replace the wild-type allele, even though it posses a selective disadvantage s > 0. Using methods developed by N. Barton and collaborators, we show that socially responsible gene drives require 0.5 < s < 0.697, a rather narrow range. In this \\\"pushed wave\\\" regime, the spatial spreading of gene drives will be initiated only when the initial frequency distribution is above a threshold profile called \\\"critical propagule\\\", which acts as a safeguard against accidental release. We also study how the spatial spread of the pushed wave can be stopped by making gene drives uniquely vulnerable (\\\"sensitizing drive\\\") in a way that is harmless for a wild-type allele. Finally, we show that appropriately sensitized drives in two dimensions can be stopped even by imperfect barriers perforated by a series of gaps.",
