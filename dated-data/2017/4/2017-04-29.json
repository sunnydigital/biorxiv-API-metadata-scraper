    "abstract": "We present an improved de novo pipeline by combining long-range polymerase chain reaction (LR-PCR) and capture hybridization for enriching mitochondrial DNA to high-throughput sequencing. We test a new set of primers and hybridizing long-range library (LR-HY) with 112 mitochondrial genomes (MtG) representing three orders, 12 families, 54 genera, and 106 species of Amphibia. The primers are used for obtaining wide taxonomic MtG amplicons to sequence directly and/or make probes for closely related species. LR-HY is compared to standard hybridization. The primers successfully amplify 82 MtGs from all three order, all families, 92.6% (50/54) of the genera, and 74.5% (79/106) of the species, despite some DNA degradation and gene rearrangement. We observe a significantly negative correlation between sequence depth and gene variation. The pattern of highly variable regions is separately distributed in different regions within the length of < 4 kb in the 33-pooled sample. We demonstrate that using 2 kb libraries generate deeper sequence coverage in the highly variable loci than using 400 bp libraries. In total, the pipeline successfully recovers 83 complete and 14 almost complete MtGs from 53 of 54 genera, including 14 MtGs had rearranged protein-coding genes. This universal primers combined with LR-HY is an efficient way to enrich complete MtGs across the entire Amphibia.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has revolutionised our understanding of transcriptome variability, with profound implications both fundamental and translational. While scRNA-seq provides a comprehensive measurement of stochasticity in transcription, the limitations of the technology have prevented its application to dissect variability in RNA processing events such as splicing. Here we present BRIE (Bayesian Regression for Isoform Estimation), a Bayesian hierarchical model which resolves these problems by learning an informative prior distribution from sequence features. We show that BRIE yields reproducible estimates of exon inclusion ratios in single cells and provides an effective tool for differential isoform quantification between scRNA-seq data sets. BRIE therefore expands the scope of scRNA-seq experiments to probe the stochasticity of RNA-processing.",

    "abstract": "We investigate and analyse the data quality of nucleotide sequence databases with the objective of automatic detection of data anomalies and suspicious records. Specifically, we demonstrate that the published literature associated with each data record can be used to automatically evaluate its quality, by cross-checking the consistency of the key content of the database record with the referenced publications. Focusing on GenBank, we describe a set of quality indicators based on the relevance paradigm of information retrieval (IR). Then, we use these quality indicators to train an anomaly detection algorithm to classify records as \\\"confident\\\" or \\\"suspicious\\\".\\n\\nOur experiments on the PubMed Central collection show assessing the coherence between the literature and database records, through our algorithms, is an effective mechanism for assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Although fewer than 0.25% of the records in our data set are known to be faulty, we would expect that there are many more in GenBank that have not yet been identified. By automated comparison with literature they can be identified with a precision of up to 10% and a recall of up to 30%, while strongly outperforming several baselines. While these results leave substantial room for improvement, they reflect both the very imbalanced nature of the data, and the limited explicitly labelled data that is available. Overall, the obtained results show promise for the development of a new kind of approach to detecting low-quality and suspicious sequence records based on literature analysis and consistency. From a practical point of view, this will greatly help curators in identifying inconsistent records in large-scale sequence databases by highlighting records that are likely to be inconsistent with the literature.",

Because a drug targets not mRNAs but proteins, mRNA expression of drug target genes is not always altered. In addition, the interaction between a drug and protein can be context dependent; this means that simple drug incubation experiments on cell lines do not always reflect the real situation during active disease. In this paper, I apply tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction to the integrated analysis of gene expression between heart failure and the DrugMatrix dataset where comprehensive data on gene expression during various drug treatments of rats were reported. I found that this strategy, in a fully unsupervised manner, enables us to identify a combined set of genes and compounds, for which various associations with heart failure were reported.",

We examine here the detailed mechanistic basis of hybrid incompatibilities for a genotype-phenotype map for developmental system drift under stabilising selection, where the organismal phenotype is conserved, but the underlying molecular phenotypes and genotype can drift. This leads to number of emergent phenomenon not obtainable by modelling genotype or phenotype alone. Our results show that: 1) speciation is more rapid at smaller population sizes with a characteristic, Orr-like, power law, but at large population sizes slow, characterised by a sub-diffusive growth law; 2) the molecular phenotypes under weakest selection contribute to the earliest incompatibilities; and 3) pairwise incompatibilities dominate over higher order, contrary to previous predictions that the latter should dominate. Our results indicate that biophysics and population size provide a much stronger constraint to speciation than suggested by previous models.",

    "abstract": "Fruit attributes that affect wine quality are thought to be largely driven by the interaction of grapevines genetic characteristics with environmental factors (i.e. climate, soil and topography) and vineyard management. All these variables, in conjunction with the wine making process, give a wine its distinctive character. Understanding how grapevines perceive and adapt to a changing environment will provide us with an insight into how to better manage crop quality. Mounting evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are a key interface between the environment and the genotype that ultimately affect the plants phenotype. Moreover, it is now widely accepted that epigenetic mechanisms are a source of useful variability during crop varietal selection that could affect crop performance. While the contribution of DNA methylation to plant performance has been extensively studied in other major crops, very little work has been done in grapevine. Here we used Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphisms to obtain global patterns of DNA methylation, and to identify the main drivers of epigenetic diversity across 22 vineyards planted with the cultivar Shiraz in six distinctive wine areas of a major wine zone, The Barossa, South Australia. The observed epigenetic profiles showed a high level of differentiation that grouped vineyards by their area of provenance despite the low genetic differentiation between vineyards and sub-regions. Furthermore, pairwise epigenetic distances between vineyards with similar management systems showed a significant correlation with geographic distance. Finally, methylation sensitive Genotyping By Sequencing identified 3,598 differentially methylated genes that were assigned to 1,144 unique GO terms of which 8.6% were associated with response to environmental stimulus. Taken together, our results indicate that the intensity and directionality of DNA methylation differentiation between vineyards and wine sub-regions within The Barossa are driven by management and local growing conditions. Finally, we discuss how epigenetic variability can be used as a tool to understand and potentially modulate terroir in grapevine.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how populations adapt to changing environments is a major goal in evolutionary biology and ecology, and particularly urgent for predicting resilience to climate change. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability to express multiple phenotypes from the same genome, is a widespread adaptation to short-term environmental fluctuations, but whether it facilitates adaptation to environmental change on evolutionary timescales, such as those under climate change, remains contentious. Here, we investigate plasticity and adaptive potential in an African savannah butterfly displaying extensive plasticity as adaptation to predictable dry-wet seasonality. We assess the transcriptional architecture of seasonal plasticity and find pervasive gene expression differences between the seasonal phenotypes, reflecting a genome-wide plasticity programme. Strikingly, intra-population genetic variation for this response is highly depleted, possibly reflecting strong purifying selection in its savannah habitat where an environmental cue (temperature) reliably predicts seasonal transitions and the cost of a mismatched phenotype is high. Under climate change the accuracy of such cues may deteriorate, rendering dominant reactions norm maladaptive. Therefore, depleted variation for plasticity as reported here may crucially limit evolutionary potential when conditions change, and seasonally plastic species may in fact be especially vulnerable to climate change.",

It performs numerous essential functions during translation, including formation of the initiation complex and proofreading of base-pairs between mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons. The core constituent of the small ribosomal subunit is a [~]1.5 kb RNA strand in prokaryotes (16S rRNA) and a homologous [~]1.8 kb RNA strand in eukaryotes (18S rRNA). Traditional sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) of rRNA genes or rRNA cDNA copies has achieved wide use as a  molecular chronometer for phylogenetic studies 1, and as a tool for identifying infectious organisms in the clinic 2. However, epigenetic modifications on rRNA are erased by SBS methods. Here we describe direct MinION nanopore sequencing of individual, full-length 16S rRNA absent reverse transcription or amplification. As little as 5 picograms ([~]10 attomole) of E. coli 16S rRNA was detected in 4.5 micrograms of total human RNA. Nanopore ionic current traces that deviated from canonical patterns revealed conserved 16S rRNA base modifications, and a 7-methylguanosine modification that confers aminoglycoside resistance to some pathological E. coli strains.

The primary endpoint was caries arrest (lesion inactivity, Nyvad criteria) 14-21 days post intervention. Dental plaque was collected from all children, and microbial composition was assessed by RNA sequencing from 2 lesions and 1 unaffected surface before treatment and at follow-up for 3 children from each group.\\n\\nResults and ConclusionMean fraction of arrested caries lesions in the silver diamine fluoride group was higher (0.72; 95% CI; 0.55, 0.84) than in the placebo group (0.05; 95% CI; 0.00, 0.16). Confirmatory analysis using generalized estimating equation log-linear regression, accounting for the number of treated surfaces and length of follow-up, indicated the fraction of arrested caries was significantly higher in the treatment group (relative risk, 17.3; 95% CI: 4.3 to 69.4).

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that aerosol transmission is a major contributor to the spread of influenza. Despite this, virtually all studies assessing the dynamics and control of influenza assume that it is transmitted solely through direct contact and large droplets, requiring close physical proximity. Here, we use wireless sensors to measure simultaneously both the location and close proximity contacts in the population of a US high school. This dataset, highly resolved in space and time, allows us to model both droplet and aerosol transmission either in isolation or in combination. In particular, it allows us to computationally assess the effectiveness of overlooked mitigation strategies such as improved ventilation that are available in the case of aerosol transmission. While the effects of the type of transmission on disease outbreak dynamics appear to be weak, we find that good ventilation could be as effective in mitigating outbreaks as vaccinating the majority of the population. In simulations using empirical transmission levels observed in households, we find that bringing ventilation to recommended levels has the same mitigating effect as a vaccination coverage of 50% to 60%. Our results therefore suggest that improvements of ventilation in public spaces could be an important and easy-to-implement strategy supplementing vaccination efforts for effective control of influenza spread.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative resistance is likely to be more durable than major gene resistance for controlling Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. Earlier studies hypothesized that resistance affecting the degree of host damage, as measured by the percentage of leaf area covered by STB lesions, is distinct from resistance that affects pathogen reproduction, as measured by the density of pycnidia produced within lesions. We tested this hypothesis using a collection of 335 elite European winter wheat cultivars that was naturally infected by a diverse population of Zymoseptoria tritici in a replicated field experiment. We used automated image analysis (AIA) of 21420 scanned wheat leaves to obtain quantitative measures of conditional STB intensity that were precise, objective, and reproducible. These measures allowed us to explicitly separate resistance affecting host damage from resistance affecting pathogen reproduction, enabling us to confirm that these resistance traits are largely independent. The cultivar rankings based on host damage were different from the rankings based on pathogen reproduction, indicating that the two forms of resistance should be considered separately in breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance. We hypothesize that these different forms of resistance are under separate genetic control, enabling them to be recombined to form new cultivars that are highly resistant to STB. We found a significant correlation between rankings based on automated image analysis and rankings based on traditional visual scoring, suggesting that image analysis can complement conventional measurements of STB resistance, based largely on host damage, while enabling a much more precise measure of pathogen reproduction. We showed that measures of pathogen reproduction early in the growing season were the best predictors of host damage late in the growing season, illustrating the importance of breeding for resistance that reduces pathogen reproduction in order to minimize yield losses caused by STB. These data can already be used by breeding programs to choose wheat cultivars that are broadly resistant to naturally diverse Z. tritici populations according to the different classes of resistance.",

    "abstract": "Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of class 2 type V CRISPR-Cas system, emerging as a powerful genome editing tool 1,2. To provide insight into its DNA targeting mechanism, we have determined the crystal structure of Francisella novicida Cpf1 (FnCpf1) in complex with the triple strand R-loop formed after target DNA cleavage. The structure reveals a unique machinery for target DNA unwinding to form a crRNA-DNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand inside FnCpf1. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is recognised by the PAM interacting (PI) domain. In this domain, the conserved K667, K671 and K677 are arranged in a dentate manner in a loop-lysine helix-loop motif (LKL). The helix is inserted at a 45{degrees} angle to the dsDNA longitudinal axis. Unzipping of the dsDNA in a cleft arranged by acidic and hydrophobic residues facilitates the hybridization of the target DNA strand with crRNA. K667 initiates unwinding by pushing away the guanine after the PAM sequence of the dsDNA. The PAM ssDNA is funnelled towards the nuclease site, which is located 70 [A] away, through a hydrophobic protein cavity with basic patches that interact with the phosphate backbone. In this catalytically active conformation the PI and the helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif in the REC1 domain adopt a \\\"rail shape\\\" and \\\"flap-on\\\" conformations, channelling the PAM strand into the cavity. A steric barrier between the RuvC-II and REC1 domains forms a \\\"septum\\\" that separates the displaced PAM strand and the crRNA-DNA hybrid, avoiding re-annealing of the DNA. Mutations in key residues reveal a novel mechanism to determine the DNA product length, thereby linking the PAM and DNAase sites. Our study reveals a singular working model of RNA-guided DNA cleavage by Cpf1, opening up new avenues for engineering this genome modification system2-4.",

    "abstract": "Anti-proliferative agents that target lymphoid cells are common immunosuppressive agents used in the treatment of diverse autoimmune, graft versus host and inflammatory diseases. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an anti-proliferative agent that targets lymphoid dependence on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase for the de novo purine synthesis of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) for DNA replication. Here we show that MMF has a distinct and specific in vivo effect on macrophages, in the absence of lymphoid cells. This results in increased macrophage cell death that is dependent on the depletion of cellular GTP, independent of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the macrophage specific effect of MMF treatment causes an increase in susceptibility to the opportunistic fungal infection Cryptococcus neoformans by reducing phagocytosis and increasing the release of intracellular pathogens via macrophage lysis. Our study demonstrates the need for a better mechanistic understanding of immunosuppressive treatments used in clinical practice and of the specific infection risks associated with certain treatment regimens.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis delivers multiple Type 3 secreted effector proteins to host epithelial cells to manipulate cytoskeletal functions, membrane dynamics and signaling pathways. TepP is the most abundant effector protein secreted early in infection but its molecular function is poorly understood. In this report, we provide evidence that TepP is important for bacterial replication in cervical epithelial cells, the activation of Type I IFN genes, and the recruitment of Class I phosphoinositide 3 kinases (PI3K) and the signaling adaptor protein CrkL to nascent pathogen-containing vacuoles (inclusions). We also show that TepP is a target of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinases but these modifications do not appear to influence the recruitment of PI3K or CrkL. The translocation of TepP correlated with an increase in the intracellular pools of phosphoinositide 3,4,5 triphosphate but not the activation of the pro-survival kinase Akt, suggesting that TepP-mediated activation of PI3K is spatially restricted to early inclusions. Furthermore, we linked PI3K activity to the dampening of transcription of Type I IFN induced genes early in infection. Overall, these findings indicate that TepP can modulate cell signaling and potentially membrane trafficking events by spatially restricted activation of PI3K.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput technologies for genome-wide expression profiling, a large number of methods have been proposed to discover gene-based signatures as biomarkers to guide cancer prognosis. However, it is often difficult to interpret the list of genes in a prognostic signature regarding the underlying biological processes responsible for disease progression or therapeutic response. A particularly interesting alternative to gene-based biomarkers is mechanistic biomarkers, derived from signaling pathway activities, which are known to play a key role in cancer progression and thus provide more informative insights into cellular functions involved in cancer mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that pathway-level features, such as the activity of signaling circuits, outperform conventional gene-level features in prediction performance in breast cancer prognosis. We also show that the proposed classification scheme can even suggest, in addition to relevant signaling circuits related to disease outcome, a list of genes that do not code for signaling proteins whose contribution to cancer prognosis potentially supplements the mechanisms detected by pathway analysis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer develops as a result of somatic mutation and clonal selection, but quantitative measures of selection in cancer evolution are lacking. We applied methods from evolutionary genomics to 7,664 human cancers across 29 tumor types. Unlike species evolution, positive selection outweighs negative selection during cancer development. On average, <1 coding base substitution/tumor is lost through negative selection, with purifying selection only detected for truncating mutations in essential genes in haploid regions. This allows exome-wide enumeration of all driver mutations, including outside known cancer genes. On average, tumors carry [~]4 coding substitutions under positive selection, ranging from <1/tumor in thyroid and testicular cancers to >10/tumor in endometrial and colorectal cancers. Half of driver substitutions occur in yet-to-be-discovered cancer genes. With increasing mutation burden, numbers of driver mutations increase, but not linearly.
