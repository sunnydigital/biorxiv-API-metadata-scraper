    "abstract": "Theta rhythms govern rodent sniffing and whisking, and human language processing. Human psychophysics suggests a role for theta also in visual attention. Yet, little is known about theta in visual areas and its attentional modulation. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from areas V1, V2, V4 and TEO of two macaque monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. We found a {approx}4 Hz theta rhythm within both the V1-V2 and the V4-TEO region, and theta synchronization between them, with a predominantly feedforward directed influence. ECoG coverage of large parts of these regions revealed a surprising spatial correspondence between theta and visually induced gamma. Furthermore, gamma power was modulated with theta phase. Selective attention to the respective visual stimulus strongly reduced these theta-rhythmic processes, leading to an unusually strong attention effect for V1. Microsaccades (MSs) were partly locked to theta. Yet, neuronal theta rhythms tended to be even more pronounced for epochs devoid of MSs. Thus, we find an MS-independent theta rhythm specific to visually driven parts of V1-V2, which rhythmically modulates local gamma and entrains V4-TEO, and which is strongly reduced by attention. We propose that the less theta-rhythmic and thereby more continuous processing of the attended stimulus serves the exploitation of this behaviorally most relevant information. The theta-rhythmic and thereby intermittent processing of the unattended stimulus likely reflects the ecologically important exploration of less relevant sources of information.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare popular retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, such as regression of head motion parameters and mean white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with and without expansion terms), aCompCor, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 19 different pipelines. These pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in four independent datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls (HC); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent samples of schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time series against head motion parameters and WM/CSF signals (with or without expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) aCompCor pipelines may only be viable in low-motion data; (3) volume censoring performs well at minimising motion-related artefact but a major benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, ICA-AROMA performed well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data loss; and (5) group comparisons in functional connectivity between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline some simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation in the wild often involves standing genetic variation (SGV), which allows rapid responses to selection on ecological timescales. However, we still know little about how the evolutionary histories and genomic distributions of SGV influence local adaptation in natural populations. Here, we address this knowledge gap using the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. We extend the popular restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) method to produce phased haplotypes approaching 700 base pairs (bp) in length at each of over 50,000 loci across the stickleback genome. Parallel adaptation in two geographically isolated freshwater pond populations consistently involved fixation of haplotypes that are identical-by-descent. In these same genomic regions, sequence divergence between marine and freshwater stickleback, as measured by dXY, reaches ten-fold higher than background levels and structures genomic variation into distinct marine and freshwater haplogroups. By combining this dataset with a de novo genome assembly of a related species, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), we find that this habitat-associated divergent variation averages six million years old, nearly twice the genome-wide average. The genomic variation that is involved in recent and rapid local adaptation in stickleback has actually been evolving throughout the 15-million-year history since the two species lineages split. This long history of genomic divergence has maintained large genomic regions of ancient ancestry that include multiple chromosomal inversions and extensive linked variation. These discoveries of ancient genetic variation spread broadly across the genome in stickleback demonstrate how selection on ecological timescales is a result of genome evolution over geological timescales, and vice versa.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTAdaptation to changing environments requires a source of genetic variation. When environments change quickly, species often rely on variation that is already present - so-called standing genetic variation - because new adaptive mutations are just too rare. The threespine stickleback, a small fish species living throughout the Northern Hemisphere, is well-known for its ability to rapidly adapt to new environments. Populations living in coastal oceans are heavily armored with bony plates and spines that protect them from predators. These marine populations have repeatedly invaded and adapted to freshwater environments, losing much of their armor and changing in shape, size, color, and behavior.\\n\\nAdaptation to freshwater environments can occur in mere decades and probably involves lots of standing genetic variation. Indeed, one of the clearest examples we have of adaptation from standing genetic variation comes from a gene, eda, that controls the shifts in armor plating. This discovery involved two surprises that continue to shape our understanding of the genetics of adaptation. First, freshwater stickleback from across the Northern Hemisphere share the same version, or allele, of this gene. Second, the  marine and  freshwater alleles arose millions of years ago, even though the freshwater populations studied arose much more recently. While it has been hypothesized that other genes in the stickleback genome may share these patterns, large-scale surveys of genomic variation have been unable to test this prediction directly.\\n\\nHere, we use new sequencing technologies to survey DNA sequence variation across the stickleback genome for patterns like those at the eda gene. We find that every region of the genome associated with marine-freshwater genetic differences shares this pattern to some degree. Moreover, many of these regions are as old or older than eda, stretching back over 10 million years in the past and perhaps even predating the species we now call the threespine stickleback. We conclude that natural selection has maintained this variation over geological timescales and that the same alleles we observe in freshwater stickleback today are the same as those under selection in ancient, now-extinct freshwater habitats. Our findings highlight the need to understand evolution on macroevolutionary timescales to understand and predict adaptation happening in the present day.",

Here we examine relationships between local mutation rates and replication timing in three bacterial species whose genomes have multiple chromosomes: Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio cholerae, and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Following five evolution experiments with these bacteria conducted in the near-absence of natural selection, the genomes of clones from each lineage were sequenced and analyzed to identify variation in mutation rates and spectra. In lineages lacking mismatch repair, base-substitution mutation rates vary in a mirrored wave-like pattern on opposing replichores of the large chromosome of V. fischeri and V. cholerae, where concurrently replicated regions experience similar base-substitution mutation rates. The base-substitution mutation rates on the small chromosome are less variable in both species but occur at similar rates as the concurrently replicated regions of the large chromosome. Neither nucleotide composition nor frequency of nucleotide motifs differed among regions experiencing high and low base-substitution rates, which along with the inferred ~800 Kb wave period suggests that the source of the periodicity is not sequence-specific but rather a systematic process related to the cell cycle. These results support the notion that base-substitution mutation rates are likely to vary systematically across many bacterial genomes, which exposes certain genes to elevated deleterious mutational load.",

One remarkable difference with most other bacterial systems is that cell division in Streptomyces is positively controlled by the recruitment of FtsZ by SsgB. Here we show that deletion of ylmD (SCO2081) or ylmE (SCO2080), which lie in operon with ftsZ in the dcw cluster of actinomycetes, has major consequences for sporulation-specific cell division in Streptomyces coelicolor. Electron and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ylmE mutants have a highly aberrant phenotype with defective septum synthesis, and produce very few spores with low viability and high heat sensitivity. FtsZ-ring formation was also highly disturbed in ylmE mutants. Deletion of ylmD had a far less severe effect on sporulation. Interestingly, the additional deletion of ylmD restored sporulation to the ylmE null mutant. YlmD and YlmE are not part of the divisome, but instead localize diffusely in aerial hyphae, with differential intensity throughout the sporogenic part of the hyphae. Taken together, our work reveals a function for YlmD and YlmE in the control of sporulation-specific cell division in S. coelicolor, whereby the presence of YlmD alone results in major developmental defects.",

    "abstract": "Hemispheric lateralization is a fundamental organizing principle of nervous systems across taxonomic groups with bilateral symmetry. The mammalian hippocampus is lateralized anatomically, physiologically, and chemically; however, functional asymmetries are not yet well understood. Imaging studies in humans have implicated the left and right hippocampus in specialized processing. However, it is not clear if lateralized activity occurs in the rodent hippocampus. c-Fos imaging in animals provides a measure of neuronal activity with a resolution at the level of single cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether lateralized activity-dependent c-Fos expression occurs in the rodent hippocampus. To understand functional lateralization of hippocampal processing, we compared interhemispheric expression of c-Fos in the dentate gyrus (DG), a structure involved in encoding new experiences, in mice that ran on a wheel, encoded a novel object, or remained in home cages. We found that wheel running induced the greatest amount of DG c-Fos expression in both hemispheres, with no difference between hemispheres. Object exploration resulted in left-lateralized DG c-Fos expression, whereas control mice were not lateralized. We then sought to determine whether differential consideration of hemispheres might influence the conclusions of a study by simulating common cell quantification methods. We found that different approaches led to different conclusions. These data demonstrate lateralization of neuronal activity in the mouse DG corresponding to the experience of the animal and show that differentially considering hemisphere leads to alternative conclusions.",

Here, we explored an alternative deep neural network, variational auto-encoder (VAE), as a computational model of the visual cortex. We trained a VAE with a five-layer encoder and a five-layer decoder to learn visual representations from a diverse set of unlabeled images. Inspired by the \\\"free-energy principle\\\" in neuroscience, we modeled the brains bottom-up and top-down pathways using the VAEs encoder and decoder, respectively. Following such conceptual relationships, we found that the VAE was able to predict cortical activities observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from three human subjects watching natural videos. Compared to CNN, VAE resulted in relatively lower prediction accuracies, especially for higher-order ventral visual areas. On the other hand, fMRI responses could be decoded to estimate the VAEs latent variables, which in turn could reconstruct the visual input through the VAEs decoder. This decoding strategy was more advantageous than alternative decoding methods based on partial least square regression. This study supports the notion that the brain, at least in part, bears a generative model of the visual world.",

Di-mensionality reduction methods reveal a striking simplicity underlying such multi-neuronal data: they can be reduced to a low-dimensional space, and the resulting neural trajectories in this space yield a remarkably insightful dynamical portrait of circuit computation. This simplicity raises profound and timely conceptual questions. What are its origins and its implications for the complexity of neural dynamics? How would the situation change if we recorded more neurons? When, if at all, can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from measuring an infinitesimal fraction of task relevant neurons? We present a theory that answers these questions, and test it using physiological recordings from reaching monkeys. This theory reveals conceptual insights into how task complexity governs both neural dimensionality and accurate recovery of dynamic portraits, thereby providing quantitative guidelines for future large-scale experimental design.",

To make their detection easier, scientists have endeavored into deeper sequencing to mechanically increase the chances to detect weaker signals such as chromatin loops. Part of this mindset can be attributed to the limitations of existing software: the analysis of Hi-C experiments is both statistically and computationally demanding. Here, we devise a new way to represent Hi-C data, which leads to a more detailed classification of paired-end reads and, ultimately, to a new normalization and interaction detection method.

    "abstract": "Taxonomy assignment of freshwater microbial communities is limited by the minimally curated phylogenies used for large taxonomy databases. Here we introduce TaxAss, a taxonomy assignment workflow that classifies 16S rRNA gene amplicon data using two taxonomy reference databases: a large comprehensive database and a small ecosystem-specific database rigorously curated by scientists within a field. We applied TaxAss to five different freshwater datasets using the comprehensive Silva database and the freshwater-specific FreshTrain database. TaxAss increased the percent of the dataset classified compared to using only Silva, especially at fine-resolution family-species taxa levels, while across the freshwater test-datasets classifications increased by as much as 11-40 percent of total reads. A similar increase in classifications was not observed in a control mouse gut dataset, which was not expected to contain freshwater bacteria. TaxAss also maintained taxonomic richness compared to using only the FreshTrain across all taxa-levels from phylum to species. Without TaxAss, most organisms not represented in the FreshTrain were unclassified, but at fine taxa levels incorrect classifications became significant. We validated TaxAss using simulated amplicon data with known taxonomy and found that 96-99% of test sequences were correctly classified at fine resolution. TaxAss splits a datasets sequences into two groups based on their percent identity to reference sequences in the ecosystem-specific database. Sequences with high similarity to sequences in the ecosystem-specific database are classified using that database, and the others are classified using the comprehensive database. TaxAss is free and open source, and available at www.github.com/McMahonLab/TaxAss.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial communities drive ecosystem processes, but microbial community composition analyses using 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets are limited by the lack of fine-resolution taxonomy classifications. Coarse taxonomic groupings at phylum, class, and order level lump ecologically distinct organisms together. To avoid this, many researchers define operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustered sequences, sequence variants, or unique sequences. These fine-resolution groupings are more ecologically relevant, but OTU definitions are dataset-dependent and cannot be compared between datasets. Microbial ecologists studying freshwater have curated a small, ecosystem-specific taxonomy database to provide consistent and up-to-date terminology. We created TaxAss, a workflow that leverages this database to assign taxonomy. We found that TaxAss improves fine-resolution taxonomic classifications (family, genus and species). Fine taxonomic groupings are more ecologically relevant, so they provide an alternative to OTU-based analyses that is consistent and comparable between datasets.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression analysis provides genome-wide insights into the transcriptional activity of a cell. One of the first computational steps in exploration and analysis of the gene expression data is clustering. With a number of standard clustering methods routinely used, most of the methods do not take prior biological information into account. In this paper, we propose a new approach for gene expression clustering analysis. The approach benefits from a new deep learning architecture, Robust Autoencoder, which provides a more accurate high-level representation of the feature sets, and from incorporating prior biological information into the clustering process. We tested our approach on two distinct gene expression datasets and compared the performance with two widely used clustering methods, hierarchical clustering and k-means, as well as with a recent deep learning clustering approach. As a result, our approach outperformed all other clustering methods on the labeled yeast gene expression dataset. Furthermore we showed that it is better in identifying the functionally common clusters than k-means on the unlabeled human gene expression dataset. The results demonstrate that our new deep learning architecture could generalize well the specific properties of gene expression profiles. Furthermore, the results confirm our hypothesis that the prior biological network knowledge could be helpful in the gene expression clustering task.",

    "abstract": "The use of ultra-deep, next generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds great promise for early detection of cancer as well as a tool for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic responses. However, the low abundance of ctDNA in the bloodstream coupled with technical errors introduced during library construction and sequencing complicates mutation detection. To achieve high accuracy of variant calling via better distinguishing low frequency ctDNA mutations from background errors, we introduce TNER (Tri-Nucleotide Error Reducer), a novel background error suppression method that provides a robust estimation of background noise to reduce sequencing errors. It significantly enhances the specificity for downstream ctDNA mutation detection without sacrificing sensitivity. Results on both simulated and real healthy subjects data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms a current, state of the art, position-specific error polishing model, particularly when the sample size of healthy subjects is small.

    "abstract": "We show that nucleosomes can efficiently control the relative search times spent by transcription factors (TFs) on one- (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) diffusion routes towards locating their cognate sites on DNA. Our theoretical results suggest that the roadblock effects of nucleosomes are dependent on the relative position on DNA with respect to TFs and their cognate sites. Especially, nucleosomes exert maximum amount of hindrance to the 1D diffusion dynamics of TFs when they are positioned in between TFs and their cognate sites. The effective 1D diffusion coefficient ({chi}TF) associated with the dynamics of TFs in the presence of nucleosome decreases with the free energy barrier ({micro}) associated the sliding dynamics of nucleosomes as [Formula]. Subsequently the mean first passage time ({eta}L) that is required by TFs to scan L number of binding sites on DNA via 1D diffusion increases with  as [Formula]. When TFs move close to nucleosomes then they exhibit a typical sub-diffusive dynamics. Nucleosomes can enhance the search dynamics of TFs when TFs present in between nucleosomes and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). The level of enhancement effects of nucleosomes seems to be much lesser than the level of retardation effects when nucleosomes present in between TFs and their cognate sites. These results suggest that nucleosome depleted regions around the cognate sites of TFs is mandatory for an efficient site-specific interactions of TFs with DNA. Remarkably the genome wide positioning pattern of TFs shows maximum at their specific binding sites and the positioning pattern of nucleosome shows minimum at the specific binding sites of TFs under in vivo conditions. This seems to be a consequence of increasing level of breathing dynamics of nucleosome cores and decreasing levels of fluctuations in the DNA binding domains of TFs as they move across TFBS. Since the extent of breathing dynamics of nucleosomes and fluctuations in the DBDs of TFs are directly linked with their respective 1D diffusion coefficients, the dynamics of TFs becomes slow as they approach their cognate sites so that TFs form tight site-specific complex. Whereas the dynamics of nucleosomes becomes rapid so that they pass through the cognate sites of TFs. Several in vivo datasets on genome wide positioning pattern of nucleosomes as well as TFs seem to agree well with our arguments. We further show that the condensed conformational state of DNA can significantly decrease the retarding effects of nucleosome roadblocks. The retarding effects of nucleosomes on the 1D diffusion dynamics of TFs can be nullified when the degree of condensation of the genomic DNA is such that it can permit a jump size associated with the dynamics of TFs beyond k > 150 bps.",

Understanding the relationship between radiomic and genomic features is important for basic cancer research and future patient care. For Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), we perform a comprehensive study to discover the imaging-genomics associations and explore the potential of predicting tumor genomic alternations using radiomic features.\\n\\nMethodsOur retrospective study integrates whole-genome multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with matched computed tomography imaging data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) for the same set of 126 HNSCC patients. Linear regression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis are used to identify statistically significant associations between radiomic imaging features and genomic features. Random forest classifier is used to predict two key HNSCC molecular biomarkers, the status of human papilloma virus (HPV) and disruptive TP53 mutation, based on radiomic features.\\n\\nResultsWide-spread and statistically significant associations are discovered between genomic features (including miRNA expressions, protein expressions, somatic mutations, and transcriptional activities, copy number variations, and promoter region DNA methylation changes of pathways) and radiomic features characterizing the size, shape, and texture of tumor. Prediction of HPV and TP53 mutation status using radiomic features achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.71 and 0.641, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionOur analysis suggests that radiomic features are associated with genomic characteristics in HNSCC and provides justification for continued development of radiomics as biomarkers for relevant genomic alterations in HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "Interplay between apicobasal cell polarity modules and the cytoskeleton is critical for differentiation and integrity of epithelia. However, this coordination is poorly understood at the level of gene regulation by transcription factors. Here, we establish the Drosophila activating transcription factor 3 (atf3) as a cell polarity response gene acting downstream of the membrane-associated Scribble polarity complex. Loss of the tumor suppressors Scribble or Dlg1 induces atf3 expression via aPKC but independent of Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Strikingly, removal of Atf3 from Dlg1 deficient cells restores polarized cytoarchitecture, levels and distribution of endosomal trafficking machinery, and differentiation. Conversely, excess Atf3 alters microtubule network, vesicular trafficking and the partition of polarity proteins along the apicobasal axis. Genomic and genetic approaches implicate Atf3 as a regulator of cytoskeleton organization and function, and identify Lamin C as one of its bona fide target genes. By affecting structural features and cell morphology, Atf3 functions in a manner distinct from other transcription factors operating downstream of disrupted cell polarity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEpithelial cells form sheets and line both the outside and inside of our body. Their proper development and function require the asymmetric distribution of cellular components from the top to the bottom, known as apicobasal polarization. As loss of polarity hallmarks a majority of cancers in humans understanding how epithelia respond to a collapse of the apicobasal axis is of great interest. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the breakdown of epithelial polarity engages Activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3), a protein that directly binds the DNA and regulates gene expression. We demonstrate that many of the pathological consequences of disturbed polarity require Atf3, as its loss in this context results in normalization of cellular architecture, vesicle trafficking and differentiation. Using unbiased genome-wide approaches we identify the genetic program controlled by Atf3 and experimentally verify select candidates. Given the evolutionary conservation of Atf3 between flies and man, we believe that our findings in the Drosophila model will contribute to a better understanding of diseases stemming from compromised epithelial polarity.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing has fundamentally changed how molecular phylogenetic datasets are assembled, and phylogenomic datasets commonly contain 50-100-fold more loci than those generated using traditional Sanger-based approaches. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for building phylogenomic datasets using single tube, highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing, which we name HiMAP (Highly Multiplexed Amplicon-based Phylogenomics), and present bioinformatic pipelines for locus selection based on genomic and transcriptomic data resources and post-sequencing consensus calling and alignment. This method is inexpensive and amenable to sequencing a large number (hundreds) of taxa simultaneously, requires minimal hands-on time at the bench (<1/2 day), and data analysis can be accomplished without the need for read mapping or assembly. We demonstrate this approach by sequencing 878 amplicons in single reactions for 82 species of tephritid fruit flies across seven genera (384 individuals), including some of the most economically-important agricultural insect pests. The resulting dataset (>150,000 bp concatenated alignment) contained >40,000 phylogenetically informative characters, and although some discordance was observed between analyses, it provided unparalleled resolution of many phylogenetic relationships in this group. Most notably, we found high support for the generic status of Zeugodacus and the sister relationship between Dacus and Zeugodacus. We discuss HiMAP, with regard to its molecular and bioinformatic strengths, and the insight the resulting dataset provides into relationships of this diverse insect group.",

    "abstract": "Among the best studied interaction between soil phagocytic predators and a human pathogenic fungus is that of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Cryptococcus neoformans. The experimental conditions used in amoeba-fungal confrontation assays can have major effects on whether the fungus or the protozoan is ascendant in the interaction. In the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in PBS, C. neoformans was consistently killed when incubated with A. castellanii. A. castellanii survived better in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+, even when incubated with C. neoformans. In the absence of Mg2+ and Ca2+, C. neoformans survived when incubated with A. castellanii, and the percentage of dead amoeba was higher than when incubated without yeast cells. These results show that the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ can make a decisive contribution toward tilting the outcome of the interaction in favor of amoeba. Of the two metals Mg2+ had a stronger effect than Ca2+. Cations enhanced A. castellanii activity against C. neoformans through enhanced phagocytosis, which is the major mechanism for amoeba to kill fungal cells. We found no evidence that amoeba uses extracellular killing mechanisms in their interactions with C. neoformans. In summary, the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ enhanced cell adhesion on surface and motility of amoeba, thus increasing the chance for contact of C. neoformans and the frequency of phagocytosis. Our findings imply that divalent cation concentration in soils could be an important variable for whether amoeba can control C. neoformans in the environment.\\n\\nImportanceGrazing of soil organisms by phagocytic predators such as amoeba is thought to select for traits that allow some of them to acquire the capacity for virulence in animals. Consequently, knowledge about the interactions between amoeba and soil microbes, such as pathogenic fungi, is important for understanding how virulence can emerge. We show that the interaction between amoeba and the pathogenic fungus C. neoformans is influenced by the presence of magnesium and calcium in the assay, which potentiate amoeba. The results may also have practical applications since enriching soils with divalent cations may reduce C. neoformans numbers in contaminated soils.",

This is partly because currently available laboratory and in silico tools have not been calibrated to accurately identify all subspecies of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc). We here present the first such tool, SNPs to Identify TB ( SNP-IT). Applying SNP-IT to a collection of clinical genomes from a UK reference laboratory, we demonstrate an unexpectedly high number of M. orygis isolates. These are seen at a similar rate to M. bovis which attracts much health protection resource and yet M. orygis cases have not been previously described in the UK. From an international perspective it is possible that M. orygis is an underestimated zoonosis. As whole genome sequencing is increasingly integrated into the clinical setting, accurate subspecies identification with SNP-IT will allow the clinical phenotype, host range and transmission mechanisms of subspecies of the Mtbc to be studied in greater detail.",

    "abstract": "Non-typhoidal Salmonella disease contributes towards significant morbidity and mortality across the world. Host factors including IFN-{gamma}, TNF- and gut microbiota, significantly influence the outcome of Salmonella pathogenesis. However, the entire repertoire of host protective mechanisms contributing to Salmonella pathogenicity is not completely appreciated. Here, we have investigated the roles of receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) that is predominantly expressed in the intestine, and regulates intestinal cell proliferation and fluid-ion homeostasis. Mice deficient in GC-C (Gucy2c-/-) displayed accelerated mortality following infection via the oral route, in spite of possessing comparative systemic Salmonella infection burden. Survival following intra-peritoneal infection remained similar, indicating that GC-C offered protection via a gut-mediated response. Serum cortisol was higher in Gucy2c-/- mice, in comparison to wild type (Gucy2c+/+) mice, and an increase in infection-induced thymic atrophy, with loss in immature CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes, was observed. Accelerated and enhanced damage in the ileum, including submucosal edema, epithelial cell damage, focal tufting and distortion of villus architecture, was seen in Gucy2c-/- mice, concomitant with a larger number of ileal tissue-associated bacteria. Transcription of key mediators in Salmonella-induced inflammation (IL-22/Reg3{beta}) were altered in Gucy2c-/- mice in comparison to Gucy2c+/+ mice. A reduction in fecal Lactobacilli, which are protective against Salmonella infection, was observed in Gucy2c-/- mice. Gucy2c-/- mice cohoused with wild type mice continued to show reduced Lactobacilli and increased susceptibility to infection. Our study therefore suggests that receptor GC-C confers a survival advantage during gut-mediated S. Typhimurium pathogenesis, presumably by regulating Salmonella-effector mechanisms and maintaining a beneficial microbiome.",

Supporting theories suggest mechanistic links between the disruption of these processes and the generation of psychotic symptoms. However, it is not known at what stage in psychosis these impairments in prediction error signalling develop. One major confound in prior studies is the use of medicated patients with strongly varying disease durations. Our study aims to investigate the involvement of the meso-cortico-striatal circuitry during reward prediction error signalling in the earliest stages of psychosis. We studied patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and help-seeking individuals at risk for psychosis due to subthreshold prodromal psychotic symptoms. Patients with either FEP (n = 14), or at-risk for developing psychosis (n= 30), and healthy volunteers (n = 39) performed a reinforcement learning task during fMRI scanning. ANOVA revealed significant (p<0.05 family-wise error corrected) prediction error signalling differences between groups in the dopaminergic midbrain and right middle frontal gyrus (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC). Patients with FEP showed disrupted reward prediction error signalling compared to controls in both regions. At-risk patients showed intermediate activation in the midbrain that significantly differed from controls and from FEP patients, but DLPFC activation that did not differ from controls. Our study confirms that patients with FEP have abnormal meso-cortical signalling of reward prediction errors, whilst reward prediction error dysfunction in the at-risk patients appears to show a more nuanced pattern of activation with a degree of midbrain impairment but preserved cortical function.",

    "abstract": "In the G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle, a bi-stable steady state dynamics of the transcription factor E2F ensures that only a certain threshold level of the growth factor can induce a high expression level (on state) of E2F to initiate either normal or abnormal cellular proliferation or even apoptosis. A group of microRNAs known as the mir-17-92 cluster, which specifically inhibits E2F, can simultaneously influence the threshold level of growth factor required for E2F activation, and the corresponding expression level of E2F in the on state. However, mir-17-92 cluster can function as either oncogene or tumor suppressor in a cell-type specific manner for reasons that still remain illusive. Here we put forward a deterministic mathematical model for Myc/E2F/mir-17-92 network that demonstrates how the experimentally observed mir-17-92 mediated differential nature of the cellular proliferation can be reconciled by having conflicting steady state dynamics of E2F for different cell types. While a 2-D bifurcation study of the model rationalizes the reason behind the contrasting E2F dynamics, an intuitive sensitivity analysis of the model parameters predicts that by exclusively altering the mir-17-92 related part of the network, it is possible to experimentally manipulate the cellular proliferation in a cell-type specific fashion for therapeutic intervention.",

The mutant p53 reactivating compound APR-246 (PRIMA-1Met) has been successfully tested in a phase I/IIa clinical trial.

    "abstract": "The two strongest factors predicting a human cancers clinical behaviour are the primary tumours anatomic organ of origin and its histopathology. However, roughly 3% of the time a cancer presents with metastatic disease and no primary can be determined even after a thorough radiological survey. A related dilemma arises when a radiologically defined mass is sampled by cytology yielding cancerous cells, but the cytologist cannot distinguish between a primary tumour and a metastasis from elsewhere.\\n\\nHere we use whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the ICGC/TCGA PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project to develop a machine learning classifier able to accurately distinguish among 23 major cancer types using information derived from somatic mutations alone. This demonstrates the feasibility of automated cancer type discrimination based on next-generation sequencing of clinical samples. In addition, this work opens the possibility of determining the origin of tumours detected by the emerging technology of deep sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA in blood plasma.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9-Cytidine deaminase fusion enzymes - termed Base Editors - allow targeted editing of genomic deoxcytidine to deoxthymidine (C[-&gt;]T) without the need for double stranded break induction. Base editors represent a paradigm-shift in gene editing technology, due to their unprecedented efficiency to mediate targeted, single-base conversion; however, current analysis of base editing outcomes rely on methods that are either imprecise or expensive and time consuming. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simple, cost effective, and accurate program to measure base editing efficiency from fluorescence-based Sanger sequencing, termed EditR. We provide EditR as a free online tool or downloadable desktop application requiring a single Sanger sequencing file and guide RNA sequence (baseeditr.com). EditR is more accurate than enzymatic assays, and provides added insight to the position, type and efficiency of base editing. Collectively, we demonstrate that EditR is a robust, inexpensive tool that will facilitate the broad application of base editing technology, thereby fostering further innovation in this burgeoning field.",

    "abstract": "Kombucha is a sweetened tea fermented by bacteria and yeast into a carbonated, acidic drink, producing a surface biofilm pellicle (colloquially called a SCOBY) during the process. Typically, liquid and a biofilm pellicle from a previously fermented culture is used as a starter for new cultures; however, there is no standard protocol for growing kombucha in the laboratory. In order to establish a standard protocol with low variability between replicates, we tested whether we could begin a kombucha culture with only well-mixed liquid stock. We found that viable kombucha cultures can be grown from low percentages of initial inoculum stock liquid, that new pellicles can form from liquid alone (with no  starter pellicle), and that the variation in the pellicle characteristics is lower when only a liquid starter is used (p = 0.0004). We also found that blending the pellicle before including it significantly reduces the variation among replicates, though the final pellicle was abnormal. We conclude that growing kombucha from only liquid stock is viable and provides a greater degree of experimental control and reproducibility compared to alternatives. Standardizing methodologies for studying kombucha in the lab can facilitate the use of this system for exploring questions about the evolutionary, ecological and cooperative/competitive dynamics within this multi-species system including resource transfers, functional dependence, genetic divergence, collective defense, and ecological succession. A better understanding of kombucha and other fermented foods may eventually allow us to leverage their pathogen inhibitory properties to develop novel antibiotics and bacteriocins.",

    "abstract": "Emotions involve many cortical and subcortical regions, prominently including the amygdala. It remains unknown how these multiple network components interact, and it remains unknown how they cause the behavioral, autonomic, and experiential effects of emotions. Here we describe a framework for combining a novel technique, concurrent electrical stimulation with fMRI (es-fMRI), together with a novel analysis, inferring causal structure from fMRI data (causal discovery). We outline a research program for investigating human emotion with these new tools, and provide initial findings from two large resting-state datasets as well as case studies in neurosurgical patients with electrical stimulation of the amygdala. The overarching goal is to use causal discovery methods on fMRI data to infer causal graphical models of how brain regions interact, and then to further constrain these models with direct stimulation of specific brain regions and concurrent fMRI. We conclude by discussing limitations and future extensions. The approach could yield anatomical hypotheses about brain connectivity, motivate rational strategies for treating mood disorders with deep brain stimulation, and could be extended to animal studies that use combined optogenetic fMRI.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women worldwide. The standard histopathology of breast tissue, the primary means of disease diagnosis, involves manual microscopic examination of stained tissue by a pathologist. Because this method relies on qualitative information, it can result in inter-observer variation. Furthermore, for difficult cases the pathologist often needs additional markers of malignancy to help in making a diagnosis. We present a quantitative method for label-free tissue screening using Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM). By extracting tissue markers of malignancy based on the nanostructure revealed by the optical path-length, our method provides an objective and potentially automatable method for rapidly flagging suspicious tissue. We demonstrated our method by imaging a tissue microarray comprising 68 different subjects - 34 with malignant and 34 with benign tissues. Three-fold cross validation results showed a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 85% for detecting cancer. The quantitative biomarkers we extract provide a repeatable and objective basis for determining malignancy. Thus, these disease signatures can be automatically classified through machine learning packages, since our images do not vary from scan to scan or instrument to instrument, i.e., they represent intrinsic physical attributes of the sample, independent of staining quality.",
