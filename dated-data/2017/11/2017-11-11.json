    "abstract": "Habitat loss is the greatest threat to large carnivores around the world. Maintenance of functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes will be important for long-term species persistence. Here, we merge landscape genetics analyses and spatially-explicit simulations to understand future persistence and extinction of tigers (Panthera tigris) in Central India. Tigers in this landscape are restricted to Protected Areas (PAs) and forest fragments embedded within a mosaic of agricultural fields and human settlements. We examined current population connectivity of tigers across nine reserves (using 116 non-invasively sampled individuals and 12 microsatellites). Genetic data was used to infer resistance-to-movement. Our results suggest that dense human settlements and roads with high traffic are detrimental to tiger movement. We used landscape genetic simulations to model 86 different scenarios that incorporated impacts of future land-use change on inferred population connectivity and extinction. Our results confirm that genetic variability (heterozygosity) will decrease in the future and small and/or isolated PAs will have a high risk of local extinction. The average extinction risk of small PAs reduced by 23-70% on adding a 5 km buffer around exiting boundaries. Unplanned development results in 35% lower heterozygosity and 56% higher average extinction probability for tigers even within protected areas. Increasing tiger numbers in such a scenario decreases extinction probability just by 12 % (from 56% to 44%). Scenarios where habitat connectivity was enhanced and maintained, stepping-stone populations were introduced/maintained, and tiger numbers were increased, led to low overall extinction probability (between 3-21%). Our simulations provide a means to quantitatively evaluate the effects of different land-use change scenarios on connectivity and extinction, linking basic science to land-use change policy and planned infrastructure development.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (<http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100022>). Understanding Ebola Virus (EBOV) virulence evolution is not only timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures three transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio (CFR) on the scale of an outbreak and on the long term. Our major finding is that the viruss specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOVs high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains.\\n\\nImpact SummaryThe severe haemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola Virus (EBOV) usually kills more than one infected individual out of two in the absence of treatment, which makes this pathogen one of the most virulent known to humans. The recent outbreak in West Africa (2013-2016) revealed that the virus is able to spread and persist for months across countries. It is often thought that virulence could be due to the fact that the virus is adapted to its reservoir host. Given that microbes evolve rapidly, it is important to determine whether EBOV virulence is likely to decrease as the virus adapts to its human host. To address this problem, we developed a novel mathematical model tailored to EBOVs life cycle, notably by capturing its three main transmission routes (by regular contact, sexual contact and via dead bodies). We investigated the evolutionary trends of EBOVs virulence on different time scales (outbreak initiation, short term and long term). Our results reveal that the virulence of EBOV might not be due to the maladaptation of the virus, but could rather originate from its unique life cycle. These results are robust to the parameter values chosen. From a public health perspective, burial management stands out as the main leverage to fight the virulence of EBOV, both on the short and long terms.",

    "abstract": "Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and differential incorporation of variant and canonical histones into chromatin are central modes of epigenetic regulation. Despite similar protein sequences, histone variants are enriched for different suites of PTMs compared to their canonical counterparts. For example, variant histone H3.3 occurs primarily in transcribed regions and is enriched for \\\"active\\\" histone PTMs like Lys9 acetylation (H3.3K9ac), whereas the canonical histone H3 is enriched for Lys9 methylation (H3K9me), which is found in transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. To determine the functions of K9 modification on variant versus canonical H3, we compared the phenotypes caused by engineering H3.3K9R and H3K9R mutant genotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Whereas most H3.3K9R and a small number of H3K9R mutant animals are capable of completing development and do not have substantially altered protein coding transcriptomes, all H3.3K9R H3K9R combined mutants die soon after embryogenesis and display decreased expression of genes enriched for K9ac. These data suggest that the role of K9ac in gene activation during development can be provided by either H3 or H3.3. Conversely, we found that H3.3K9 is methylated at telomeric transposons, and this mark contributes to repressive chromatin architecture, supporting a role for H3.3 in heterochromatin that is distinct from that of H3. Thus, our genetic and molecular analyses demonstrate that K9 modification of variant and canonical H3 have overlapping roles in development and transcriptional regulation, though to differing extents in euchromatin and heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila ether-a-go-go (eag) is the founding member of a large family of voltage-gated K+ channels, the KCNH family, which includes Kv10, 11 and 12, (Ganetzky et al. 1999). Concurrent binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to N-and C-terminal sites inhibits mammalian EAG1 channels at sub-micromolar Ca2+ concentrations (Schonherr et al. 2000), likely by causing pore constriction (Whicher and MacKinnon 2016). Although the Drosophila EAG channel was believed to be Ca2+-insensitive (Schonherr et al. 2000), both the N-and C-terminal sites are conserved. Here we show that Drosophila EAG is inhibited by high Ca2+ concentrations that are only present at plasma membrane Ca2+ channel microdomains. To test the role of this regulation in vivo, we engineered mutations that block CaM-binding to the major C-terminal site of the endogenous eag locus, disrupting Ca2+-dependent inhibition. eag CaMBD mutants have reduced evoked release from larval motor neuron presynaptic terminals and show decreased Ca2+ influx in stimulated adult projection neuron presynaptic terminals, consistent with an increase in K+ conductance. These results are predicted by a conductance-based multi-compartment model of the presynaptic terminal in which some fraction of EAG is localized to the Ca2+ channel microdomains that control neurotransmitter release. The reduction of release in the larval neuromuscular junction drives a compensatory increase in motor neuron somatic excitability. This misregulation of synaptic and somatic excitability has consequences for systems-level processes and leads to defects in associative memory formation in adults.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyRegulation of excitability is critical to tuning the nervous system for complex behaviors. We demonstrate here that the EAG family of voltage-gated K+ channels exhibit conserved gating by Ca2+/CaM. Disruption of this inhibition in Drosophila results in decreased evoked neurotransmitter release due to truncated Ca2+ influx in presynaptic terminals. In adults, disrupted Ca2+ dynamics cripples memory formation. These data demonstrate that the biophysical details of channels have important implications for cell function and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been proposed as a tool to draw causal inferences on the role of oscillatory activity in cognitive functioning and has the potential to induce long-term changes in cerebral networks. However, the mechanisms of action of tACS are not yet clear, though previous modeling works have suggested that variability may be mediated by local and network-level brain states. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record brain activity from 17 healthy participants as they kept their eyes open (EO) or closed (EC) while being stimulated either with sham, weak, or strong alpha-tACS using a montage commonly assumed to target occipital areas. We reconstructed the activity of sources in all stimulation conditions by means of beamforming. The analysis of resting-state data revealed an interaction of the external stimulation with the endogenous alpha power difference between EO and EC in the posterior cingulate. This region is remote from occipital cortex, which showed strongest EC vs. EO alpha modulation, thus suggesting state-dependency long-range effects of tACS. In a follow-up analysis of this online-tACS effect, we find evidence that this dependency effect could be mediated by functional network changes: connection strength from the precuneus, a region adjusting for a measure of network integration in the two states (EC vs. EO during no-tACS), was significantly correlated with the state-dependency effect in the posterior cingulate (during tACS). No analogous correlation could be found for alpha power modulations in occipital cortex. Altogether, this is the first strong evidence to illustrate how functional network architectures can shape tACS effects.",

Here, we perform deep single-cell transcriptome sequencing of ~2,000 bone-marrow derived mouse hematopoietic progenitors enriched for lymphoid lineages. To resolve subtle transcriptome priming indicative of distinct lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias. FateID delineates domains of fate bias within progenitor populations and permits the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays. We expect that FateID will enhance our understanding of the process of cell fate choice in complex multi-lineage differentiation systems.",

    "abstract": "Packaging of pericentromeric DNA into heterochromatin is crucial for genome stability, development and health, yet its endogenous triggers remain poorly understood1. A defining feature of pericentromeric heterochromatin is histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me)2-4. In S. pombe, transcripts derived from the pericentromeric dg and dh repeat during S phase5-7 promote heterochromatin formation through two pathways: an RNAi-dependent mechanism involving recruitment of the Clr4 H3K9 methyltransferase complex (CLR-C) via the RITS complex8-13, and RNAi-independent mechanism involving an RNAPII-associated RNA-binding protein Seb1, the repressor complex SHREC, and RNA processing activities14-19. We show here that Seb1 promotes long-lived RNAPII pausing. Pause sites associated with sequence-specific Seb1 RNA binding events are significantly enriched in pericentromeric repeat regions and their presence correlates with the heterochromatin-triggering activities of the corresponding dg and dh DNA fragments. Remarkably, globally increasing RNAPII stalling by other means induces the formation of novel large ectopic heterochromatin domains. Such ectopic heterochromatin occurs even in cells lacking functional RITS, demonstrating that RNAPII pausing can be sufficient to trigger de novo heterochromatin independently of RNAi. These results uncover Seb1-mediated polymerase stalling as a new signal for nucleating heterochromatin assembly in repetitive DNA.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous plant pathogen genomes often display a bipartite architecture with gene sparse, repeat-rich compartments serving as a cradle for adaptive evolution. However, the extent to which this \\\"two-speed\\\" genome architecture is associated with genome-wide epigenetic modifications is unknown. Here, we show that the oomycete plant pathogens Phytophthora infestans and Phytophthora sojae possess functional adenine N6- methylation (6mA) methyltransferases that modulate patterns of 6mA marks across the genome. In contrast, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) could not be detected in the two Phytophthora species. Methylated DNA IP Sequencing (MeDIP-seq) of each species revealed that 6mA is depleted around the transcriptional starting sites (TSS) and is associated with low expressed genes, particularly transposable elements. Remarkably, genes occupying the gene-sparse regions have higher levels of 6mA compared to the remainder of both genomes, possibly implicating the methylome in adaptive evolution of Phytophthora. Among three putative adenine methyltransferases, DAMT1 and DAMT3 displayed robust enzymatic activities. Surprisingly, single knockouts of each of the 6mA methyltransferases in P. sojae significantly reduced in vivo 6mA levels, indicating that the three enzymes are not fully redundant. MeDIP-seq of the damt3 mutant revealed uneven patterns of 6mA methylation across genes, suggesting that PsDAMT3 may have a preference for gene body methylation after the TSS. Our findings provide evidence that 6mA modification is an epigenetic mark of Phytophthora genomes and that complex patterns of 6mA methylation by the expanded 6mA methyltransferases may be associated with adaptive evolution in these important plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a skeletal muscle disorder with no curative treatment. Although L-tyrosine administration has been indicated to provide benefit to patients, previous studies have been limited due to sample size or not testing for raised L-tyrosine levels. We evaluated the efficacy of L-tyrosine treatment to improve skeletal muscle function in three animal models of NM caused by skeletal muscle -actin (ACTA1) mutations. Firstly we determined the maximum safest L-tyrosine concentration for inclusion in the water of wildtype zebrafish. We then treated NM TgACTA1D286G-eGFP zebrafish from 24 hours post fertilization with the highest safe L-tyrosine dose (10 {micro}M). At 6 days post fertilization, no significant improvement was detected in skeletal muscle function (swimming distance). We also determined the highest safe L-tyrosine dose for dietary L-tyrosine supplementation to wildtype mice. Next we treated the NM TgACTA1D286G mouse model continuously from preconception with 2% L-tyrosine supplemented to regular feed. We examined skeletal muscles at 6-7 weeks using indicators of skeletal muscle integrity: bodyweight, voluntary running wheel and rotarod performance, all parameters previously shown to be reduced in TgACTA1D286G mice. The L-tyrosine treatment regime did not result in any improvement of these parameters, despite significant elevation of free L-tyrosine levels in sera (57%) and quadriceps muscle (45%) of treated TgACTA1D286G mice. Additionally, we assessed the effects of 4 weeks of 2% L-tyrosine dietary supplementation on skeletal muscle function of older (6-7 month old) NM TgACTA1D286G and KIActa1H40Y mice. This dosing regime did not improve decreased bodyweight, nor the mechanical properties, energy metabolism, or atrophy of skeletal muscles in these NM models. Together these findings demonstrate that with the treatment regimes and doses evaluated, L-tyrosine does not therapeutically modulate dysfunctional skeletal muscles in NM animal models with dominant ACTA1 mutations. Therefore this study yields important information on aspects of the clinical utility of L-tyrosine for ACTA1 NM.\\n\\nSummary statementDespite previous encouraging reports, this study utilising zebrafish and mouse models of nemaline myopathy shows no therapeutic benefit on skeletal muscle functionality in response to L-tyrosine supplementation.",

    "abstract": "Multiple promoters and inhibitors mediate angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and these factors represent potential targets for impeding vessel growth in tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor targeted in anti-angiogenic cancer therapies. In addition, thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a major endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, and TSP1 mimetics are being developed as an alternative type of anti-angiogenic agent. The combination of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, and ABT-510, a TSP1 mimetic, has been tested in clinical trials to treat advanced solid tumors. However, the patients responses are highly variable and show disappointing outcomes. To obtain mechanistic insight into the effects of this combination anti-angiogenic therapy, we have constructed a novel whole-body systems biology model including the VEGF and TSP1 reaction networks. Using this molecular-detailed model, we investigated how the combination anti-angiogenic therapy changes the amounts of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic complexes in cancer patients. We particularly focus on answering the question of how the effect of the combination therapy is influenced by tumor receptor expression, one aspect of patient-to-patient variability. Overall, this model complements the clinical administration of combination anti-angiogenic therapy, highlights the role of tumor receptor variability in the heterogeneous responses to anti-angiogenic therapy, and identifies the tumor receptor profiles that correlate with a high likelihood of a positive response to the combination therapy. Our model provides novel understanding of the VEGF-TSP1 balance in cancer patients at the systems-level and could be further used to optimize combination anti-angiogenic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Decoding the molecular basis of host seeking and blood feeding behavioral evolution/adaptation in the adult female mosquito may provide an opportunity to design new molecular strategy to disrupt human-mosquito interactions. However, despite the great progress in the field of mosquito olfaction and chemo-detection, little is known that how the sex-specific specialization of the olfactory system enables adult female mosquitoes to derive and manage complex blood feeding associated behavioral responses. A comprehensive RNAseq analysis of prior and post blood meal olfactory system of An. culicifacies mosquito revealed that a minor but unique change in the nature and regulation of key olfactory genes play a pivotal role in managing diverse behavioral responses. Age dependent transcriptional profiling demonstrated that adult female mosquitos chemosensory system gradually learned and matured to drive the host-seeking and blood feeding behavior at the age of 5-6 days. A zeitgeber time scale expression analysis of Odorant Binding Proteins (OBPs) unravels unique association with a late evening to midnight peak biting time. Blood meal-induced switching of unique sets of OBP genes and Odorant Receptors (ORs) expression coincides with the change in the innate physiological status of the mosquitoes. Blood meal follows up experiments provide enough evidence that how a synergistic and concurrent action of OBPs-ORs may drive  prior and post blood meal complex behavioral events. Finally, tissue-specific gene expression analysis and molecular modelling predicted two uncharacterized novel sensory appendages proteins (SAP-1 & SAP2) unique to An. culicifacies mosquito and may play a central role in the host-seeking behavior.\\n\\nSignificanceEvolution and adaptation of blood feeding behavior not only favored the reproductive success of adult female mosquito but also make them an important disease vectors. Immediately after emergence, an environmental exposure may favor the broadly tuned olfactory system of mosquitoes to derive complex behavioral responses. But, how these olfactory derived genetic factors manage female specific  pre and post blood meal associated complex behavioral responses are not well known. We unraveled synergistic actions of olfactory factors governs an innate to prime learning strategy to facilitate rapid blood meal acquisition and downstream behavioral activities. A species-specific transcriptional profiling and an in-silico analysis predict novel  sensory appendages protein, as a unique target to design disorientation strategy against the mosquito Anopheles culicifacies.",

    "abstract": "By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (Delphinium spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyers larkspur (D. geyeri). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Genomic data has revealed complex histories of colonization and repeated gene flow previously unrecognized in some of the most celebrated examples of sympatric speciation and radiation. However, much of the evidence for secondary gene flow into these radiations comes from genome-wide tests, which tells us little about how gene flow potentially influenced sympatric diversification. Here we investigated whole genomes of Barombi Mbo crater lake cichlids for fine-scale patterns of introgression between species with neighboring riverine cichlid populations. We did find evidence of secondary gene flow into the radiation scattered across < 0.24% of the genome; however, the functional and genetic diversity in these regions paint no clear picture of how that variation could have contributed to the ecological and morphological diversity found in the lake. Our results suggest that either variation in novel genetic pathways introduced during secondary gene flow contributed to the radiation, or that secondary gene flow was predominantly neutral with respect to the diversification processes. We also found evidence for differential assortment of ancestral polymorphism found in riverine populations between sympatric sister species, suggesting the presence of a hybrid swarm in the past. While the history of gene flow and colonization appears to be more complicated than once thought, the lack of compelling evidence for secondary gene flow influencing diversification suggests that we should not yet rule out one of the most celebrated examples of sympatric speciation in nature.",

However, the efficacy of lithium varies widely, with a non-response rate of up to 30%. Biological response markers and predictors are lacking.\\n\\nObjectiveGenetic factors are thought to mediate lithium treatment response, and the previously reported genetic overlap between BPD and schizophrenia (SCZ) led us to test whether a polygenic score (PGS) for SCZ could predict lithium treatment response in BPD. Further, we explored the potential molecular underpinnings of this association.\\n\\nDesignWeighted SCZ PGSs were computed at ten p-value thresholds (PT) using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36,989 SCZ cases, and genotype data for BPD patients from the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen). For functional exploration, we performed a cross-trait meta-GWAS and pathway analysis, combining GWAS summary statistics on SCZ and lithium treatment response.\\n\\nSettingInternational multicenter GWAS.\\n\\nParticipantsPatients with BPD who had undergone lithium treatment were genotyped and retrospectively assessed for long-term treatment response (n=2,586).\\n\\nMain outcome measuresClinical treatment response to lithium was defined on both the categorical and continuous scales using the ALDA score. The effect measures include odds ratios (ORs) and the proportion of variance explained (R2), and a significant association was determined at p<0.05.\\n\\nResultsThe PGS for SCZ was inversely associated with lithium treatment response in the categorical outcome (p=8x10-5), at PT <5x10-2. Patients with BPD who had low polygenic load for SCZ responded better to lithium, with ORs for lithium response ranging from 3.46 [95%CI: 1.42-8.41 at 1st decile] to 2.03 [95%CI: 0.86-4.81 at the 9th decile], compared to the patients in the 10th decile of SCZ risk. In the cross-trait meta-GWAS, 15 genetic loci that may have overlapping effects on lithium treatment response and susceptibility to SCZ were identified. Functional pathway and network analysis of these loci point to the HLA complex and inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-4, IFN{gamma}) as molecular contributors to lithium treatment response in BPD.\\n\\nConclusions and RelevanceThe study provides, for the first-time, evidence for a negative association between high genetic loading for SCZ and poor response to lithium in patients with BPD.

    "abstract": "Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare inherited cardiac arrhythmia associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). BrS is characterized by coved-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3) in the absence of structural heart disease. This pattern is spontaneous, or is unmasked by intravenous administration of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs. The SCN5A-encoded -subunit of the NaV1.5 cardiac sodium channel has been linked to BrS, and mutations in SCN5A are identified in 15-30% of BrS cases. Genetic testing of BrS patients generally involves sequencing of protein-coding portions and flanking intronic regions of SCN5A, according to recent international guidelines. This excludes the regulatory untranslated regions (5UTR and 3UTR) from the routine genetic testing of BrS patients. We here screened the coding sequence, the flanking intronic regions as well as the 5 and 3UTR regions of SCN5A gene and further five candidate genes (GPD1L, SCN1B, KCNE3, SCN4B, and MOG1) in a Tunisian family diagnosed with Brugada syndrome.\\n\\nA new Q1000K mutation was identified on the SCN5A gene along with two common polymorphisms (H558R and D1819). Furthermore, multiple genetic variants were identified on the SCN5A 3UTR, one of which is predicted to create additional microRNA (miRNAs) binding site for miR-1270. Additionally, we identified the hsa-miR-219a rs107822. No relevant coding sequence variant was identified in the remaining studied candidate genes. Although Q1000K is localized in the conserved binding site of MOG1 which predicts a functional consequence, this new mutation along with the additional variants were differentially distributed among the family members without any clear genotype-phenotype concordance. This gives extra evidences about the complexity of the disease and suggests that the occurrence and prognosis of BrS is most likely controlled by a combination of multiple genetic factors and exposures, rather than a single polymorphism/mutation. Most SCN5A polymorphisms were localized in non-coding regions hypothesizing an impact on the miRNA-target complementarities. In this regard, over-expression of miR-1270 led to a significant decrease of luciferase activity suggesting a direct role regulating SCN5A. Therefore, genetic variants that disrupt its binding affinity to SCN5A 3UTR and/or its expression might cause loss of normal repression control and be associated to BrS.",

Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, is antagonized by phages in the environment as well as in human hosts4,5. The lytic phage ICP1 has been recovered from cholera patient stool and water samples over at least 12 years in Bangladesh6-8 and is consequently considered a persistent predator of epidemic V. cholerae in this region. In previous work, we demonstrated that mobile genetic elements called phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements (PLEs) protect V. cholerae from ICP1 infection7,9. PLEs initiate their anti-phage response by excising from the chromosome, however, the mechanism and molecular specificity underlying this response are not known. Here, we show that PLE 1 encodes a large serine recombinase, Int, that exploits an ICP1-specific protein, PexA, as a recombination directionality factor (RDF) to sense and excise in response to ICP1 infection. We validate the functionality and specificity of this unique recombination system, in which the recombinase and RDF are encoded in separate genomes. Additionally, we show that PexA is also hijacked to trigger excision in PLEs found in V. cholerae isolates recovered decades ago. Our results uncover an aspect of the molecular specificity underlying the longstanding conflict between a single predatory phage and V. cholerae PLE and contribute to our understanding of the molecular arms race that drives long-term evolution between combatting phage and their bacterial hosts in nature.",

    "abstract": "Iron is essential for growth and development of Chlamydia. Its long-term starvation in cultured mammalian cells leads to production of aberrant non-infectious chlamydial forms, also known as persistence. Immediate transcriptional responses to iron limitation have not been characterized, leaving a knowledge gap of how Chlamydia regulates its response to changes in iron availability. We used the fast-chelating agent 2,2-Bipyridyl (BPDL) to homogeneously starve Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 of iron, starting at 6 or 12h post-infection. Immediate transcriptional responses were monitored after only 3 or 6h of BPDL-treatment, well before formation of aberrant Chlamydia. The first genome-wide transcriptional response of C. trachomatis to iron-starvation was subsequently determined utilizing RNA-sequencing. Only 7% and 8% of the genome was differentially expressed in response to iron-starvation at early and mid-stages of development, respectively. Biological pathway analysis revealed an overarching theme. Synthesis of macromolecular precursors (deoxynucleotides, amino acids, charged tRNAs, and acetyl-coA) was up-regulated, while energy-expensive processes (ABC transport and translation) were down-regulated. A large fraction of differentially down-regulated genes are involved in translation, including ribosome assembly, initiation and termination factors, which could be analogous to the translation down-regulation triggered by stress in other prokaryotes during stringent responses. Additionally, transcriptional up-regulation of DNA repair, oxidative stress, and tryptophan salvage genes reveals a possible coordination of responses to multiple antimicrobial and immunological insults. These responses of replicative-phase Chlamydia to iron-starvation indicate a prioritization of survival over replication, enabling the pathogen to \\\"stock the pantry\\\" with ingredients needed for rapid growth once optimal iron levels are restored.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBy utilizing an experimental approach that monitors the immediate global response of Chlamydia trachomatis to iron-starvation, clues to long-standing questions in Chlamydia biology are revealed, including how Chlamydia adapts to this stress. We determined that this pathogen initiates a transcriptional program that prioritizes replenishment of nutrient stores over replication, possibly in preparation for rapid growth once optimal iron levels are restored. Transcription of genes for biosynthesis of metabolic precursors was generally up-regulated, while those involved in multiple steps of translation were down-regulated. We also observed an increase in transcription of genes involved in DNA repair and neutralizing oxidative stress, indicating that Chlamydia employs an \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" strategy. Its small genome limits its ability to tailor a specific response to a particular stress. Therefore, the \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" strategy may be the most efficient way of surviving within the host, where the pathogen likely encounters multiple simultaneous immunological and nutritional insults.",

One domain of creativity comes from musical improvisation, in which individuals spontaneously create novel auditory-motor sequences that are aesthetically rewarding.

We compare jazz improvising musicians against classical (non-improvising) musicians and non-musician control subjects in musical performance and diffusion tensor imaging. Subjects improvised on short musical motifs and underwent DTI. Statistical measures of fluency and entropy for musical performances predicted expert ratings of creativity for each performance. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) showed higher Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in the cingulate cortex and corpus callosum in jazz musicians. FA in the cingulate also correlated with entropy. Probabilistic tractography from these mesial regions to lateral seed regions of the arcuate fasciculus, a pathway known to be involved in sound perception and production, showed mesial-to-lateral connectivity that correlated with improvisation training.

    "abstract": "We hypothesise a beneficial influence of sleep on the consolidation of the combinatorial mechanisms underlying incremental sentence comprehension. These predictions are grounded in recent work examining the effect of sleep on the consolidation of linguistic information, which demonstrate that sleep-dependent neurophysiological activity consolidates the meaning of novel words and simple grammatical rules. However, the sleep-dependent consolidation of sentence-level combinatorics has not been studied to date. Here, we propose that dissociable aspects of sleep neurophysiology consolidate two different types of combinatory mechanisms in human language: sequence-based (order-sensitive) and dependency-based (order-insensitive) combinatorics. The distinction between the two types of combinatorics is motivated both by cross-linguistic considerations and the neurobiological underpinnings of human language. Unifying this perspective with principles of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, we posit that a function of sleep is to optimise the consolidation of sequence-based knowledge (the when) and the establishment of semantic schemas of unordered items (the what) that underpin cross-linguistic variations in sentence comprehension. This hypothesis builds on the proposal that sleep is involved in the construction of predictive codes, a unified principle of brain function that supports incremental sentence comprehension. Finally, we discuss neurophysiological measures (EEG/MEG) that could be used to test these claims, such as the quantification of neuronal oscillations, which reflect basic mechanisms of information processing in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Human cognition requires the coordination of neural activity across widespread brain networks. Here we describe a new mechanism for large-scale coordination in the human brain: traveling waves of theta and alpha oscillations. Examining direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients performing a memory task, we found that contiguous clusters of cortex in individual patients showed oscillations at specific frequencies in the range of 2 to 15 Hz. These clusters displayed spatial phase gradients, indicating that individual oscillation cycles moved across the cortex at ~0.25-0.75 m/s. We found that traveling waves were relevant behaviorally because their propagation correlated with task events and was more consistent during good performance. Traveling waves showed a correlation between propagation speed and temporal frequency, which suggests that they propagate across the cortex following principles of phase-coupled oscillatory networks. By demonstrating that theta and alpha traveling waves are widespread and behaviorally relevant, our results suggest a broad role for brain oscillations in supporting cortical connectivity by organizing neural activity across space and time.",

A pervasive yet puzzling feature of cortical circuits is that despite their complex wiring, population-wide shared spiking variability is low dimensional with all neurons fluctuating en masse. Previous model cortical networks are at loss to explain this global variability, and rather assume it is from external sources. We show that if the spatial and temporal scales of inhibitory coupling match known physiology, model spiking neurons internally generate low dimensional shared variability that captures the properties of in vivo population recordings along the visual pathway. Shifting spatial attention into the receptive field of visual neurons has been shown to reduce low dimensional shared variability within a brain area, yet increase the variability shared between areas. A top-down modulation of inhibitory neurons in our network provides a parsimonious mechanism for this attentional modulation, providing support for our theory of cortical variability. Our work provides a critical and previously missing mechanistic link between observed cortical circuit structure and realistic population-wide shared neuronal variability and its modulation.",

Here, we report on place field reconfiguration in response to an innately aversive odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT). The advantage of TMT is the absence of learning curve required for associative fear conditioning. Our study investigated if CA1 place cells, recorded from behaving rats, remap randomly or if their reconfiguration depends on the location of the aversive stimulus perception. Exposure to TMT increased the amplitude of hippocampal beta oscillations in two arms of a maze (TMT arms). We found that a population of place cells with fields located outside the TMT arms increased their activity (extra-field spiking) in the TMT arms during the aversive episodes. These cells exhibited significant shift of the center of mass towards the TMT arms in the subsequent post-TMT recording. The induction of extra-field plasticity was mediated by the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Photostimulation of the BLA triggered aversive behavior, synchronized response of hippocampal local field oscillations, augmented theta rhythm amplitude and increased the spiking of place cells for the first 100ms after the light delivery. This occurred only for the extra-field-but not for intra-field spikes. Optogenetic BLA-triggered an increase in extra-field spiking activity correlated to the degree of place field plasticity in the post-ChR2 recording session. Our findings demonstrate that the increased extra-field activity during aversive episodes mediates the degree of subsequent field plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is a predominant tree-microbe interaction in forest ecosystems sustaining tree growth and health. Its establishment and functioning implies a long-term and intimate relationship between the soil-borne fungi and the roots of trees. Mycorrhiza-induced Small Secreted Proteins (MiSSPs) are hypothesized as keystone symbiotic proteins, required to set up the symbiosis by modifying the host metabolism and/or building the symbiotic interfaces.\\n\\nL. bicolor MiSSP8 is the third most highly induced MiSSPs in symbiotic tissues and it is also expressed in fruiting bodies. The MiSSP8-RNAi knockdown mutants are strongly impaired in their mycorrhization ability with Populus, with the lack of fungal mantle and Hartig net development due to a lack of hyphal aggregation. MiSSP8 C-terminus displays a repetitive motif containing a kexin cleavage site, recognized by KEX2 in vitro. This suggests MiSSP8 protein might be cleaved into small peptides. Moreover, the MiSSP8 repetitive motif is found in other proteins predicted secreted by both saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Thus, our data indicate that MiSSP8 is a small-secreted protein involved at early stages of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, likely by regulating hyphal aggregation and pseudoparenchyma formation.",
