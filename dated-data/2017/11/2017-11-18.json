    "abstract": "Mutualism describes the biological phenomenon where two or more species are reciprocally beneficial, regardless of their ecological intimacy or evolutionary history. Classic theory shows that mutualistic benefit must be relatively weak, or else it overpowers the stabilizing influence of intraspecific competition and leads to unrealistic, unbounded population growth. Interestingly, the conclusion that strong positive interactions lead to runaway population growth is strongly grounded in the behavior of a single model. This model [-] the Lotka-Volterra competition model with a sign change to generate mutualism rather than competition between species [-] assumes logistic growth of each species plus a linear interaction term to represent the mutualism. While it is commonly held that the linear interaction term is to blame for the models unrealistic behavior, we show here that a linear mutualism added to a{theta} -logistic model of population growth can prevent unbounded growth. We find that when density dependence is decelerating, the benefit of mutualism at equilibrium is greater than when density dependence is accelerating. Although there is a greater benefit, however, decelerating density dependence tends to destabilize populations whereas accelerating density dependence is always stable. We interpret these findings tentatively, but with promise for the understanding of the population ecology of mutualism by generating several predictions relating growth rates of mutualist populations and the strength of mutualistic interaction.",

    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate that CD8+ T cells are important in the control of HIV-1 (HIV) replication. However, CD8+ T cells induced by natural infection cannot eliminate the virus or reduce viral loads to acceptably low levels in most infected individuals. Understanding the basic quantitative features of CD8+ T-cell responses induced during the course of HIV infection may therefore inform us about the limits that HIV vaccines, which aim to induce protective CD8+ T-cell responses, must exceed. Using previously published experimental data from a cohort of HIV-infected individuals with sampling times from acute to chronic infection we defined the quantitative properties of CD8+ T-cell responses to the whole HIV proteome. In contrast with a commonly held view, we found that the relative number of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses (response breadth) changed little over the course of infection (first 400 days post-infection), with moderate but statistically significant changes occurring only during the first 35 symptomatic days. This challenges the idea that a change in the T-cell response breadth over time is responsible for the slow speed of viral escape from CD8+ T cells in the chronic infection. The breadth of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses was not correlated with the average viral load for our small cohort of patients. Metrics of relative immunodominance of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses such as Shannon entropy or the Evenness index were also not significantly correlated with the average viral load. Our mathematical-model-driven analysis suggested extremely slow expansion kinetics for the majority of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and the presence of intra- and interclonal competition between multiple CD8+ T-cell responses; such competition may limit the magnitude of CD8+ T-cell responses, specific to different epitopes, and the overall number of T-cell responses induced by vaccination. Further understanding of mechanisms underlying interactions between the virus and virus-specific CD8+ T-cell response will be instrumental in determining which T-cell-based vaccines will induce T-cell responses providing durable protection against HIV infection.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

In this study, we employed an ATCOPIA93 Long terminal repeats (LTR) promoter-GUS fusion to show that this retrotransposon behaves like an immune-responsive gene during plant defense in Arabidopsis. We also showed that the reactivation of the endogenous ATCOPIA93 copy \\\"EVD\\\", in the presence of bacterial stress, is not only negatively regulated by DNA methylation but also by Polycomb-mediated silencing--a mode of repression typically found at protein-coding and microRNA genes. Interestingly, one of the ATCOPIA93-derived soloLTRs is located upstream of the disease resistance gene RPP4 and is devoid of either DNA methylation or H3K27m3 marks. Through loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that this soloLTR is required for proper expression of RPP4 during plant defense, thus linking the responsiveness of ATCOPIA93 to biotic stress and the co-option of its LTR for plant immunity.",

Existing methods utilize genotypic data and summary statistics to identify putative disease genes, but cannot distinguish pleiotropy from causal mediation and are limited by overly strong assumptions about the data. To overcome these limitations, we develop Causal Multivariate Mediation within Extended Linkage disequilibrium (CaMMEL), a novel Bayesian inference framework to jointly model multiple mediated and unmediated effects relying only on summary statistics. We show in simulation that CaMMEL accurately distinguishes between mediating and pleiotropic genes unlike existing methods. We applied CaMMEL to Alzheimers disease (AD) and found 206 causal genes in sub-threshold loci (p < 10-4). We prioritized 21 genes which mediate at least 5% of local genetic variance, disrupting innate immune pathways in AD.",

    "abstract": "The platypus is an egg-laying mammal which, alongside the echidna, occupies a unique place in the mammalian phylogenetic tree. Despite widespread interest in its unusual biology, little is known about its population structure or recent evolutionary history. To provide new insights into the dispersal and demographic history of this iconic species, we sequenced the genomes of 57 platypuses from across the whole species range in eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania. Using a highly-improved reference genome, we called over 6.7M SNPs, providing an informative genetic data set for population analyses. Our results show very strong population structure in the platypus, with our sampling locations corresponding to discrete groupings between which there is no evidence for recent gene flow. Genome-wide data allowed us to establish that 28 of the 57 sampled individuals had at least a third-degree relative amongst other samples from the same river, often taken at different times. Taking advantage of a sampled family quartet, we estimated the de novo mutation rate in the platypus at 7.0x10-9/bp/generation (95% CI 4.1x10-9 - 1.2x10-8/bp/generation). We estimated effective population sizes of ancestral populations and haplotype sharing between current groupings, and found evidence for bottlenecks and long-term population decline in multiple regions, and early divergence between populations in different regions. This study demonstrates the power of whole-genome sequencing for studying natural populations of an evolutionarily important species.",

    "abstract": "Genetic changes causing dramatic brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia cells. Functional analysis reveals different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation. NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in typical cases of 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism, and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of hominin-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger hominin neocortex accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21. 1 locus and a resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorder.",

    "abstract": "Whole Genome Sequencing is increasingly used to identify Mendelian variants in clinical pipelines. These pipelines focus on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and also structural variants, while ignoring more complex repeat sequence variants. We consider the problem of genotyping Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs), composed of inexact tandem duplications of short (6-100bp) repeating units. VNTRs span 3% of the human genome, are frequently present in coding regions, and have been implicated in multiple Mendelian disorders. While existing tools recognize VNTR carrying sequence, genotyping VNTRs (determining repeat unit count and sequence variation) from whole genome sequenced reads remains challenging. We describe a method, adVNTR, that uses Hidden Markov Models to model each VNTR, count repeat units, and detect sequence variation. adVNTR models can be developed for short-read (Illumina) and single molecule (PacBio) whole genome and exome sequencing, and show good results on multiple simulated and real data sets. adVNTR is available at https://github.com/mehrdadbakhtiari/adVNTR",

    "abstract": "MotivationNext-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows the simultaneous sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, has revolutionized how we study genomics and molecular biology by generating genome-wide molecular maps of molecules of interest. For example, an NGS-based transcriptomic assay called RNA-seq can be used to estimate the abundance of approximately 190,000 transcripts together. As the cost of next-generation sequencing sharply declines, researchers in many fields have been conducting research using NGS. The amount of information produced by NGS has made it difficult for researchers to choose the optimal set of target genes (or genomic loci).\\n\\nResultsWe have sought to resolve this issue by developing a neural network-based feature (gene) selection algorithm called Wx. The Wx algorithm ranks genes based on the discriminative index (DI) score that represents the classification power for distinguishing given groups. With a gene list ranked by DI score, researchers can institutively select the optimal set of genes from the highest-ranking ones. We applied the Wx algorithm to a TCGA pan-cancer gene-expression cohort to identify an optimal set of gene-expression biomarker (universal gene-expression biomarkers) candidates that can distinguish cancer samples from normal samples for 12 different types of cancer. The 14 gene-expression biomarker candidates identified by Wx were comparable to or outperformed previously reported universal gene expression biomarkers, highlighting the usefulness of the Wx algorithm for next-generation sequencing data. Thus, we anticipate that the Wx algorithm can complement current state-of-the-art analytical applications for the identification of biomarker candidates as an alternative method.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/deargen/DearWX\\n\\nContactkangk1204@dankook.ac.kr\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at online.",

    "abstract": "Although we understand many aspects of how small proteins (number of residues less than about hundred) fold, it is a major challenge to understand how large proteins self-assemble. To partially overcome this challenge, we performed simulations using the Self-Organized Polymer model with Side Chains (SOP-SC) in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), using the Molecular Transfer Model (MTM), to describe the folding of the 110-residue PDZ3 domain. The simulations reproduce the folding thermodynamics accurately including the melting temperature (Tm), the stability of the folded state with respect to the unfolded state. We show that the calculated dependence of ln kobs (kobs is the relaxation rate) has the characteristic Chevron shape. The slopes of the Chevron plots are in good agreement with experiments. We show that PDZ3 folds by four major pathways populating two metastable intermediates, in accord with the kinetic partitioning mechanism. The structure of one of the intermediates, populated after polypeptide chain collapse, is structurally similar to an equilibrium intermediate. Surprisingly, the connectivities between the intermediates and hence, the fluxes through the pathways depend on the concentration of GdmCl. The results are used to predict possible outcomes for unfolding of PDZ domain subject to mechanical forces. Our study demonstrates that, irrespective of the size or topology, simulations based on MTM and SOP-SC offer a framework for describing the folding of proteins, mimicking precisely the conditions used in experiments.",

    "abstract": "Cytokinesis in most eukaryotic cells is orchestrated by a contractile actomyosin ring. While many of the proteins involved are known, the mechanism of constriction remains unclear. Informed by existing literature and new 3D molecular details from electron cryotomography, here we develop 3D coarse-grained models of actin filaments, unipolar and bipolar myosins, actin crosslinkers, and membranes and simulate their nteractions. Exploring a matrix of possible actomyosin configurations suggested that node-based architectures ike those presently described for ring assembly result in membrane puckers not seen in EM images of real cells. Instead, the model that best matches data from fluorescence microscopy, electron cryotomography, and biochemical experiments is one in which actin filaments transmit force to the membrane through evenly-distributed, membrane-attached, unipolar myosins, with bipolar myosins in the ring driving contraction. While at this point this model is only favored (not proven), the work highlights the power of coarse-grained biophysical simulations to compare complex mechanistic hypotheses.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn most eukaryotes, a ring of actin and myosin drives cell division, but how the elements of the ring are arranged and constrict remain unclear. Here we use 3D coarse-grained simulations to explore various possibilities. Our simulations suggest that if actomyosin is arranged in nodes (as suggested by a popular model of ring assembly), the membrane distorts in ways not seen experimentally. Instead, actin and myosin are more ikely uniformly distributed around the ring. In the model that best fits experimental data, ring tension is generated by interactions between bipolar myosins and actin, and transmitted to the membrane via unipolar myosins. Technologically the study highlights how coarse-grained simulations can test specific mechanistic hypotheses by comparing their predicted outcomes to experimental results.",

Here we identify the Golgi apparatus in Naegleria, the first description of an unstacked Golgi organelle in a non-parasitic eukaryote, other than fungi. We provide a comprehensive list of Golgi-associated membrane trafficking genes encoded in two separate species of Naegleria and transcriptomic support to show that nearly all are expressed in mouse-passaged N. fowleri cells. We then study distribution of the Golgi marker NgCOPB by fluorescence, identifying membranous structures that can be disrupted by Brefeldin A treatment consistent with Golgi localisation. Confocal and immuno-electron microscopy revealed that NgCOPB is localized to membranous structures consistent with tubules. Our data not only identify the Golgi organelle for the first time in this major eukaryotic lineage, but also provide the rare example of a tubular form of the organelle representing an important sampling point for the comparative understanding of Golgi organellar diversity.",

    "abstract": "Seabirds are known to be important indicators of marine ecosystems health. Procellariiformes are one of the most abundant seabird species distributed from warm tropical to cold temperate regions including Antarctica. With few long-term studies on breeding seabirds at the Antarctic continent, crucial biological parameters such as genetic variation, population genetic structure and past population demography is lacking for most of the commonly occurring species. Under the  Biology and Environmental Sciences component of the Indian Antarctic programme, long-term monitoring of Antarctic biodiversity is being conducted. In this paper, we describe a panel of 12 and 10 cross-species microsatellite markers for two relatively less studied seabird species in Antarctica, snow petrel Pagodroma nivea and Wilsons storm petrel Oceanites oceanicus, respectively. These loci showed high amplification success and moderate level of polymorphism in snow petrel (mean no. of alleles 7.08{+/-}3.01 and mean observed heterozygosity 0.35{+/-}0.23), but low polymorphism in Wilsons storm petrel (mean no. of alleles 3.9{+/-}1.3 and mean observed heterozygosity 0.28{+/-}0.18). The results demonstrate that these panels can unambiguously identify individuals of both species from various types of biological materials. This work forms a baseline for undertaking long-term genetic research of Antarctic seabird species and provides critical insights into their population genetics.",

    "abstract": "Identification of causal drivers behind regulatory gene networks is crucial in understanding gene function. We developed a method for the large-scale inference of gene-gene interactions in observational population genomics data that are both directed (using local genetic instruments as causal anchors, akin to Mendelian Randomization) and specific (by controlling for linkage disequilibrium and pleiotropy). The analysis of genotype and whole-blood RNA-sequencing data from 3,072 individuals identified 49 genes as drivers of downstream transcriptional changes (P < 7 x 10-10), among which transcription factors were overrepresented (P = 3.3 x 10-7). Our analysis suggests new gene functions and targets including for SENP7 (zinc-finger genes involved in retroviral repression) and BCL2A1 (novel target genes possibly involved in auditory dysfunction). Our work highlights the utility of population genomics data in deriving directed gene expression networks. A resource of trans-effects for all 6,600 genes with a genetic instrument can be explored individually using a web-based browser.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian gene promoters and enhancers share many properties. They are composed of a unified promoter architecture of divergent transcripton initiation and gene promoters may exhibit enhancer function. However, it is currently unclear how expression strength of a regulatory element relates to its enhancer strength and if the unifying architecture is conserved across Metazoa. Here we investigate the transcription initiation landscape and its associated RNA decay in D. melanogaster. Surprisingly, we find that the majority of active gene-distal enhancers and a considerable fraction of gene promoters are divergently transcribed. We observe quantitative relationships between enhancer potential, expression level and core promoter strength, providing an explanation for indirectly related histone modifications that are reflecting expression levels. Lowly abundant unstable RNAs initiated from weak core promoters are key characteristics of gene-distal developmental enhancers, while the housekeeping enhancer strengths of gene promoters reflect their expression strengths. The different layers of regulation mediated by gene-distal enhancers and gene promoters are also reflected in chromatin interaction data. Our results suggest a unified promoter architecture of many D. melanogaster regulatory elements, that is universal across Metazoa, whose regulatory functions seem to be related to their core promoter elements.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into a 3-dimensional structure in the nucleus of each cell. There are currently two distinct views of genome organization that are derived from different technologies. The first view, derived from genome-wide proximity ligation methods (e.g. Hi-C), suggests that genome organization is largely organized around chromosomes. The second view, derived from in situ imaging, suggests a central role for nuclear bodies. Yet, because microscopy and proximity-ligation methods measure different aspects of genome organization, these two views remain poorly reconciled and our overall understanding of how genomic DNA is organized within the nucleus remains incomplete. Here, we develop Split-Pool Recognition of Interactions by Tag Extension (SPRITE), which moves away from proximity-ligation and enables genome-wide detection of higher-order DNA interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known genome structures identified by Hi-C and show that the contact frequencies measured by SPRITE strongly correlate with the 3-dimensional distances measured by microscopy. In addition to known structures, SPRITE identifies two major hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are spatially arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles, respectively. We find that the majority of genomic regions exhibit preferential spatial association relative to one of these nuclear bodies, with regions that are highly transcribed by RNA Polymerase II organizing around nuclear speckles and transcriptionally inactive and centromere-proximal regions organizing around the nucleolus. Together, our results reconcile the two distinct pictures of nuclear structure and demonstrate that nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall 3-dimensional packaging of genomic DNA in the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "The ability of HIV to avoid recognition by humoral and cellular immunity (viral escape) is well documented but the strength of the immune response needed to cause such a viral escape remains poorly quantified. Several previous studies observed a more rapid escape of HIV from CD8 T cell responses in the acute phase of infection as compared to the chronic infection. With the help of simple mathematical models the rate of HIV escape was estimated and results were interpreted to suggest that CD8 T cell responses causing escape in acute HIV infection may be more efficient at killing virus-infected cells than responses that cause escape in chronic infection, or alternatively, early escapes occur in epitopes mutations in which there is minimal fitness cost to the virus. These conclusions, however, were challenged on several grounds, including linkage and interference of multiple escape mutations due to a low population size and because of potential issues associated with modifying the data to estimate escape rates. Here we use a parametric resampling method which does not require data modification to show that previous results on the decline of the viral escape rate with time since infection remain unchanged. However, using this method we also show that estimates of the escape rate are highly sensitive to the time interval between measurements with longer intervals biasing estimates of the escape rate downwards. Our results thus suggest that data modifications for early and late escapes were not the primary reason for the observed decline in the escape rate with time since infection. However, longer sampling periods for escapes in chronic infection strongly influence estimates of the escape rate. More frequent sampling of viral sequences in the chronic infection may improve our understanding of factors influencing the rate of HIV escape from CD8 T cell responses.",

    "abstract": "Transcription activation domains (ADs) are inherently disordered proteins that often target multiple coactivator complexes, but the specificity of these interactions is not understood. Efficient activation by yeast Gcn4 requires tandem Gcn4 ADs and four activator-binding domains (ABDs) on its target, the Mediator subunit Med15. Multiple ABDs are a common feature of coactivator complexes. We find that the large Gcn4-Med15 complex is heterogeneous, containing nearly all possible AD-ABD interactions. This complex forms using a dynamic fuzzy protein-protein interface where ADs use hydrophobic residues to bind hydrophobic surfaces of the ABDs in multiple orientations. This combinatorial mechanism allows individual interactions of low affinity and specificity to generate a biologically functional, specific, and higher affinity complex despite lacking a defined protein-protein interface. This binding strategy is likely representative of many activators that target multiple coactivators and allows great flexibility in combinations of activators that synergize to regulate genes with variable coactivator requirements.",

A line of studies suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) could be a potential hub for adaptive behaviors. For instance, an experimental study noted ACCs contribution to selecting motor responses for maximal rewards; it found 1) that ACC neurons were selectively activated when the reward was reduced and 2) that suppression of ACC activity impaired monkeys ability to change motor responses to obtain the maximal reward. To probe ACC functions in adaptive behaviors, we sought biologically-plausible mechanisms to account for the experimental findings mentioned above by utilizing a computational model. Our simulation results raise the possibility that ACC can correct behavioral responses by reading out and updating the motor plans (guiding future motor responses) stored in prefrontal cortex (PFC).",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe alpha rhythm (7-13 Hz) is the longest studied brain oscillation and has been theorized to play a key role in cognition. Still, substantial uncertainty remains over its physiology. In this study, we used micro and macro electrodes in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the human alpha rhythm. We first found that alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior cortex towards the lower-order occipital poles, consistent with alpha effecting top-down processing. This cortical alpha drives thalamic alpha, reversing prevailing theories of a thalamic alpha pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortex, contravening the popular conception of alpha as an infragranular rhythm. Together, these results demonstrate that the alpha rhythm reflects short-range supragranular feedback which propagates from higher-order to lower order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights explain how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.",

    "abstract": "Gibberellic acid (gibberellins, GA) controls key developmental processes in the life-cycle of land plants. By interacting with the GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor, GA regulates the expression of a wide range of genes through different pathways. Here we report the systematic identification and classification of GID1s in 52 plants genomes, encompassing from bryophytes and lycophytes, to several monocots and eudicots. We investigated the evolutionary relationship of GID1s using a comparative genomics framework and found strong support a previously proposed phylogenetic classification of this family in land plants. We identified lineage-specific expansions of particular subfamilies (i.e. GID1ac and GID1b) in different eudicot lineages (e.g. GID1b in legumes). Further, we found both, shared and divergent structural features between GID1ac and GID1b subgroups in eudicots, which provide mechanistic insights on their functions. Gene expression data from several species show that at least one GID1 gene is expressed in every sampled tissue, with a strong bias of GID1b expression towards underground tissues and dry legume seeds (typically with low GA levels). Taken together, our results support that GID1ac retained canonical GA signaling roles, whereas GID1b specialized in conditions of low GA concentrations. We propose that this functional specialization occurred initially at the gene expression level and was later fine-tuned by specific mutations that conferred greater GA affinity to GID1b, including a Phe residue in the GA-binding pocket. Finally, we discuss the importance of our findings to understand the diversification of GA perception mechanisms in land plants.",

    "abstract": "A community of genetically heterogeneous cells embedded in an unmixed medium allows for sophisticated operations by retaining spatial differentiation and coordinating division-of-labor. To establish the principles of engineering reliable cell-cell communication in a heterogeneous environment, we examined how circuit parameters and spatial placement affect the range of length and time scales over which simple communication circuits interact. We constructed several \\\"sender\\\" and \\\"receiver\\\" strains with quorum-sensing signaling circuits. The sender cell colony produces acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), which diffuse across the semisolid medium. The receiver cell colony detects these signal molecules and reports by fluorescence. We have found that a single colony of one sender variant is sufficient to induce receiver response at more than 1.5cm separation. Furthermore, AHL degradase expression in receiver colonies produces a signal threshold effect and reduces the response level in subsequent receiver colonies. Finally, our investigation on the spatial placement of colonies gave rise to the design of a multicellular long-range communication array consisting of two alternating colony types. Its signal response successfully propagated colony-by-colony along a six-colony array spanning 4.8cm at a transmission velocity of 12.8 hours per colony or 0.075cm per hour. In addition, we have developed a reaction-diffusion model that recreates the observed behaviors of the many performed experiments using data-informed parameter estimates of signal diffusion, gene expression, and nutrient consumption. These results demonstrate that a mixed community of colonies can enable new patterning programs, and the corresponding model will facilitate the rational design of complex communication networks.",
