    "abstract": "The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of ten thousand or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist where OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multiscale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings, and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOral polio vaccine (OPV) has played an essential role in the elimination of wild poliovirus (WPV). OPV contains attenuated yet transmissible viruses that can spread from person-to-person. When OPV transmission persists uninterrupted, vaccine-derived outbreaks occur. After OPV is no longer used in routine immunization, as with the cessation of type 2 OPV in 2016, population immunity will decline. A key question is how this affects the potential of OPV viruses to spread within and across communities. To address this, we examined the roles of immunity, sanitation, and social contact in limiting OPV transmission. Our results derive from an extensive review and synthesis of vaccine trial data and community epidemiological studies. Shedding, oral susceptibility to infection, and transmission data are analyzed to systematically explain and model observations of WPV and OPV circulation. We show that in high transmission rate settings, falling population immunity after OPV cessation will lead to conditions where OPV and WPV are similarly capable of causing outbreaks, and that this conclusion is compatible with the known safety of OPV prior to global cessation. Novel strategies will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication for all time.",

    "abstract": "Changes in environmental conditions can lead to rapid shifts in the state of an ecosystem (\\\"regime shifts\\\"), which, even after the environment has returned to previous conditions, subsequently recovers slowly to the previous state (\\\"hysteresis\\\"). Large spatial and temporal scales of dynamics, and the lack of frameworks linking observations to models, are challenges to understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to perturbations. The naturally-occurring microecosystem inside leaves of the northern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) exhibits oligotrophic and eutrophic states that can be induced by adding insect prey. Here, we further develop a model for simulating these dynamics, parameterize it using data from a prey addition experiment and conduct a sensitivity analysis to identify critical zones within the parameter space. Simulations illustrate that the microecosystem model displays regime shifts and hysteresis. Parallel results were observed in the plant itself after experimental enrichment with prey. Decomposition rate of prey was the main driver of system dynamics, including the time the system remains in an anoxic state and the rate of return to an oxygenated state. Biological oxygen demand in fluenced the shape of the systems return trajectory. The combination of simulated results, sensitivity analysis and use of empirical results to parameterize the model more precisely demonstrates that the Sarracenia microecosystem model displays behaviors qualitatively similar to models of larger ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster white-eyed w1118 line serves as a blank control, allowing genetic recombination of any gene of interest along with a readily recognizable marker. w1118 flies display behavioral susceptibility to environmental stimulation such as light. It is of great importance to characterize the behavioral performance of w1118 flies because this would provide a baseline from which the effect of the gene of interest could be differentiated. Little work has been performed to characterize the walking behavior in adult w1118 flies. Here we show that pulsed light stimulation increased the regularity of walking trajectories of w1118 flies in circular arenas. We statistically modeled the distribution of distances to center and extracted the walking structures of w1118 flies. Pulsed light stimulation redistributed the time proportions for individual walking structures. Specifically, pulsed light stimulation reduced the episodes of crossing over the central region of the arena. An addition of four genomic copies of mini-white, a common marker gene for eye color, mimicked the effect of pulsed light stimulation in reducing crossing in a circular arena. The reducing effect of mini-white was copy-number-dependent. These findings highlight the rhythmic light stimulation-evoked modifications of walking behavior in w1118 flies and an unexpected behavioral consequence of mini-white in transgenic flies carrying w1118 isogenic background.",

In this paper, we explore the effects of partial selfing on the equilibrium genetic variance Vg, mutation load L and inbreeding depression{delta} under stabilizing selection acting on a arbitrary number n of quantitative traits coded by biallelic loci with additive effects. Overall, our model predicts a decrease in the equilibrium genetic variance with increasing selfing rates; however, the relationship between self-fertilization and the variables of interest depends on the strength of associations between loci, and three different regimes are observed. When the U/n ratio is low (where U is the total haploid mutation rate on selected traits) and effective recombination rates are sufficiently high, genetic associations between loci are negligible and the genetic variance, mutation load and inbreeding depression are well predicted by approximations based on single-locus models. For higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, moderate genetic associations generated by epistasis tend to increase Vg, L and{delta} , this regime being well predicted by approximations including the effects of pairwise associations between loci. For yet higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, a different regime is reached under which the maintenance of coadapted gene complexes reduces Vg, L and{delta} . Simulations indicate that the values of Vg, L and{delta} are little affected by assumptions regarding the number of possible alleles per locus.",

However, their integration remains challenging. Here, we delineate a general approach for data-driven and unbiased identification of key TFs and dynamic GRNs, called EPIC-DREM. We generated time-series transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles during differentiation of mouse multipotent bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) towards adipocytes and osteoblasts. Using our novel approach we constructed time-resolved GRNs for both lineages. To prioritize the identified shared regulators, we mapped dynamic super-enhancers in both lineages and associated them to target genes with correlated expression profiles. We identified aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Glis family zinc finger 1 (GLIS1) as mesenchymal key TFs controlled by dynamic MSC-specific super-enhancers that become repressed in both lineages. AHR and GLIS1 control differentiation-induced genes and we propose they function as guardians of mesenchymal multipotency.",

In order to globally characterize activities of TFs in cells, we have developed a novel massively parallel protein activity assay, Active TF Identification (ATI) that measures DNA-binding activity of all TFs from any species or tissue type. In contrast to previous studies based on mRNA expression or protein abundance, we found that a set of TFs binding to only around ten distinct motifs display strong DNA-binding activity in any given cell or tissue type. Mass spectrometric identification of TFs revealed that within these highly active TFs, there were both housekeeping TFs, which were universally found in all cell types, and specific TFs, which were highly enriched in known factors that determine the fate of the analyzed tissue or cell type. The importance of a small subset of TFs for determining the overall accessible chromatin landscape of a cell suggests that gene regulatory logic may be simpler than what has previously been appreciated.",

Here, we examine the premise of this parallelization approach, which is that data acquired from different spots is uncorrelated. In particular, we measure the optical crosstalk characteristics of the two 48-SPAD arrays used in our recent SMFS studies, and demonstrate that it is negligible (crosstalk probability [&le;] 1.1 10-3) and is undetectable in cross-correlation analysis of actual single-molecule fluorescence data.",

    "abstract": "X-ray crystallographic studies of class I peptide-MHC molecules (pMHC) continue to provide important insights into immune recognition, however their success depends on generation of diffraction-quality crystals, which remains a significant challenge. While protein engineering techniques such as surface-entropy reduction and lysine methylation have proven utility in facilitating and/or improving protein crystallisation, they risk affecting the conformation and biochemistry of the class I MHC antigen binding groove. An attractive alternative is the use of noncovalent crystallisation chaperones, however these have not been developed for pMHC. Here we describe a method for promoting class I pMHC crystallisation, by exploiting its natural ligand interaction with the immunoregulatory receptor LILRB1 as a novel crystallisation chaperone. First, focussing on a model HIV-1-derived HLA-A2-restricted peptide, we determined a 2.4[A] HLA-A2/LILRB1 structure, which validated that co-crystallisation with LILRB1 does not alter conformation of the antigenic peptide. We then demonstrated that addition of LILRB1 enhanced the crystallisation of multiple pMHC complexes, and identified a generic condition for initial co-crystallisation. LILRB1 chaperone-based pMHC crystallisation enabled structure determination for class I pMHC previously intransigent to crystallisation, including both conventional and post-translationally-modified peptides, of diverse lengths. LILRB1 chaperone-mediated crystallisation should expedite molecular insights into the immunobiology of diverse immune-related diseases and immunotherapeutic strategies, particularly involving class I pMHC complexes that are challenging to crystallise. Moreover, since the LILRB1 recognition interface involves predominantly non-polymorphic regions of the MHC molecule, the approach we outline could prove applicable to a diverse range of class I pMHC.",

However, much of the evidence for secondary gene flow into these radiations comes from genome-wide tests, which tells us little about how gene flow potentially influenced sympatric diversification. Here we investigated whole genomes of Barombi Mbo crater lake cichlids for fine-scale patterns of introgression between species with neighboring riverine cichlid populations. We did find evidence of secondary gene flow into the radiation scattered across < 0.24% of the genome; however, the functional and genetic diversity in these regions paint no clear picture of how that variation could have contributed to the ecological and morphological diversity found in the lake. Our results suggest that either variation in novel genetic pathways introduced during secondary gene flow contributed to the radiation, or that secondary gene flow was predominantly neutral with respect to the diversification processes. We also found evidence for differential assortment of ancestral polymorphism found in riverine populations between sympatric sister species, suggesting the presence of a hybrid swarm in the past. While the history of gene flow and colonization appears to be more complicated than once thought, the lack of compelling evidence for secondary gene flow influencing diversification suggests that we should not yet rule out one of the most celebrated examples of sympatric speciation in nature.",

Moreover, TAMs have been shown to exert substantial influence on the efficacy of various cancer immunotherapy treatment strategies. Laboratory investigation into the behavior of TAMs has been limited by a lack of methods capable of resolving the in vivo distribution and dynamics of this cell population across wide fields of view. Recent studies have employed magnetic resonance imaging and intravital microscopy in conjunction with nanoparticle labeling methods to detect TAMs and observe their responses to therapeutic agents. Here we describe a novel method to enable high-resolution, wide-field, longitudinal imaging of leukocytes based on contrast-enhanced Speckle-Modulating Optical Coherence Tomography (SM-OCT), which substantially reduces imaging noise. We were able to specifically label TAMs and activated microglia in vivo with large gold nanorod contrast agents (LGNRs) in an orthotopic murine glioblastoma model. After labeling, we demonstrated near real-time tracking of leukocyte migration and distribution within the tumors. The intrinsic resolution, imaging depth, and sensitivity of this method may facilitate detailed studies of the fundamental behaviors of TAMs in vivo, including their intratumoral distribution heterogeneity and the roles they play in modulating cancer proliferation. In future studies, the method described herein may also provide the necessary means to characterize TAM responses to immunotherapeutic regimens in a range of solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between cholesterol and prostate cancer has been extensively studied for decades, where high levels of cellular cholesterol are generally associated with cancer progression and less favorable outcomes. However, the role of in vivo cellular cholesterol synthesis in this process is unclear, and data on the transcriptional activity of cholesterol synthesis pathway genes in tissue from prostate cancer patients are inconsistent. A common problem with cancer tissue data from patient cohorts is the presence of heterogeneous tissue which confounds molecular analysis of the samples. In this study we present a method to minimize systematic confounding from stroma tissue in seven patient cohorts consisting of 1713 prostate cancer and 230 normal tissue samples. When confounding was minimized, differential gene expression analysis over all cohorts showed robust and consistent downregulation of nearly all genes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Additional analysis also identified cholesterol synthesis as the most significantly altered metabolic pathway in prostate cancer. This surprising observation is important for our understanding of how prostate cancer cells regulate cholesterol levels in vivo. Moreover, we show that tissue heterogeneity explains the lack of consistency in previous expression analysis of cholesterol synthesis genes in prostate cancer.",

AML still remains difficult to treat, in particular in poor risk AML patients carrying TP53 mutations. Here, we identify the deubiquitinase USP7 as an integral member of non-canonical PRC1.1 and show that targeting of USP7 provides an alternative therapeutic approach for AML. USP7 inhibitors effectively induced apoptosis in (primary) AML cells, also independent of the USP7-MDM2-TP53 axis, whereby survival of both the cycling as well as quiescent populations was affected. MLL-AF9-induced leukemia was significantly delayed in vivo in human leukemia xenografts. We previously showed that non-canonical PRC1.1 is critically important for leukemic stem cell self-renewal, and that genetic knockdown of the PRC1.1 chromatin binding component KDM2B abrogated leukemia development in vitro and in vivo [1]. Here, by performing KDM2B interactome studies in TP53mut cells we identify that USP7 is an essential component of PRC1.1 and is required for its stability and function. USP7 inhibition results in disassembly of the PRC1.1 complex and consequently loss of binding to its target loci. Loss of PRC1.1 binding coincided with reduced H2AK119ub and H3K27ac levels and diminished gene transcription, whereas H3K4me3 levels remained unaffected. Our studies highlight the diverse functions of USP7 and link it to Polycomb-mediated epigenetic control. USP7 inhibition provides an efficient therapeutic approach for AML, also in the most aggressive subtypes with mutations in TP53.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LIUSP7 is a therapeutic target in leukemia, including poor risk TP53mut AML.\\nC_LIO_LIUSP7 is an essential component of non-canonical PRC1.1 and is required for its stability and function.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Behaviour is the ultimate output of an animals nervous system and choosing the right action at the right time can be critical for survival. The study of the organisation of behaviour in its natural context, ethology, has historically been a primarily qualitative science. A quantitative theory of behaviour would advance research in neuroscience as well as ecology and evolution. However, animal posture typically has many degrees of freedom and behavioural dynamics vary on timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, presenting both technical and conceptual challenges. Here we review 1) advances in imaging and computer vision that are making it possible to capture increasingly complete records of animal motion and 2) new approaches to understanding the resulting behavioural data sets. With the right analytical approaches, these data are allowing researchers to revisit longstanding questions about the structure and organisation of animal behaviour and to put unifying principles on a quantitative footing. Contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are leading to the emergence of a physics of behaviour and the prospect of discovering laws and developing theories with broad applicability. We believe that there now exists an opportunity to develop theories of behaviour which can be tested using these data sets leading to a deeper understanding of how and why animals behave.",

    "abstract": "Precise fluid height sensing in open-channel microfluidics has long been a desirable feature for a wide range of applications. However, performing accurate measurements of the fluid level in small-scale reservoirs (<1mL) has proven to be an elusive goal, especially if direct fluid-sensor contact needs to be avoided. In particular, gravity-driven systems used in several microfluidic applications to establish pressure gradients and impose flow remain open-loop and largely unmonitored due to these sensing limitations. Here we present an optimized self-shielded coplanar capacitive sensor design and automated control system to provide submillimeter fluid-height resolution (~250 m) and control of small-scale open reservoirs without the need for direct fluid contact. Results from testing and validation of our optimized sensor and system also suggest that accurate fluid height information can be used to robustly characterize, calibrate and dynamically control a range of microfluidic systems with complex pumping mechanisms, even in cell culture conditions. Capacitive sensing technology provides a scalable and cost-effective way to enable continuous monitoring and closed-loop feedback control of fluid volumes in small-scale gravity-dominated wells in a variety of microfluidic applications.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of bacterial toxins is a central question to understanding the origins of human pathogens and infectious disease. Through genomic data mining, we traced the evolution of the deadliest known toxin family, clostridial neurotoxins, comprised of tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT). We identified numerous uncharacterized lineages of BoNT-related genes in environmental species outside of Clostridium, revealing insights into their molecular ancestry. Phylogenetic analysis pinpointed a sister lineage of BoNT-like toxins in the gram-negative organism, Chryseobacterium piperi, that exhibit distant homology at the sequence level but preserve overall domain architecture. Resequencing and assembly of the C. piperi genome confirmed the presence of BoNT-like proteins encoded within two toxin-rich gene clusters. A C. piperi BoNT-like protein was validated as a novel toxin that induced necrotic cell death in human kidney cells. Mutagenesis of the putative active site abolished toxicity and indicated a zinc metalloprotease-dependent mechanism. The C. piperi toxin did not cleave common SNARE substrates of BoNTs, indicating that BoNTs have diverged from related families in substrate specificity. The new lineages of BoNT-like toxins identified by computational methods represent evolutionary missing links, and suggest an origin of clostridial neurotoxins from ancestral toxins present in environmental bacteria.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe origins of bacterial toxins that cause human disease is a key question in our understanding of pathogen evolution. To explore this question, we searched genomes for evolutionary relatives of the deadliest biological toxins known to science, botulinum neurotoxins. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis revealed a group of toxins in the Chryseobacterium piperi genome that are a sister lineage to botulinum toxins. Genome sequencing of this organism confirmed the presence of toxin-rich gene clusters, and a predicted C. piperi toxin was shown to induce necrotic cell death in human cells. These newly predicted toxins are missing links in our understanding of botulinum neurotoxin evolution, revealing its origins from an ancestral family of toxins that may be widespread in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Identifying significant causal agents among a large number of candidates is challenging. When experimental resources are limited, exhaustively screening a large number of agents for the desired effect could incur a large cost and take a substantial amount of time. However, in many large scale experiments, such as high-throughput screening (HTS), the ratio of causal to non-causal agents is usually very low.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce a group-screening strategy to efficiently screen causal agents by grouping them into treatments. Our analysis shows that when a large number of candidates factors are screened and true agent percentage is very low (less than 1%), even in the worst case we could save up to 80% of the experiment runs. In the case where experiments span many rounds, we provide an online version of the group-screening that can determine the best strategy automatically based on the existing results. We applied this method to a real HTS experiment with 50,000 candidates that would require 9 rounds to finish in an exhaustive case. Our analysis showed that by applying the online-group-screening method, in the worst case, we can use 3 rounds and 19.7% (9828/50000) total tests to identify all the agents.\\n\\nFinally, we show that with minor modifications, this framework extends to more complex agent discovery problems.",

Here, we use a coarse-grain approach to investigate the impact of structural changes on protein flexibility. More particularly, we focus our study on proteins presenting large-scale motions. We show how calculating directional force constants within residue pairs, and investigating their variation upon protein closure, can lead to the detection of a limited set of residues that form a structural lock in the proteins closed conformation. This lock, which is composed of residues whose side-chains are tightly interacting, highlights a new class of residues that are important for protein function by stabilizing the closed structure, and that cannot be detected using earlier tools like local rigidity profiles or distance variations maps, or alternative bioinformatics approaches, such as coevolution scores.",

    "abstract": "The major hallmark of cancer cells is uncontrollable growth on soft matrices (transformed growth), which indicates that they have lost the ability to properly sense the rigidity of their surroundings. Recent studies of fibroblasts show that local contractions by cytoskeletal rigidity sensor units block growth on soft surfaces and their depletion causes transformed growth. The contractile system involves many cytoskeletal proteins that must be correctly assembled for proper rigidity sensing. We tested the hypothesis that cancer cells lack rigidity sensing due to their inability to assemble contractile units because of altered cytoskeletal protein levels. In four widely different cancers, there were over ten-fold fewer rigidity-sensing contractions compared with normal fibroblasts. Restoring normal levels of cytoskeletal proteins restored rigidity sensing and rigidity-dependent growth in transformed cells. Most commonly, this involved restoring balanced levels of the tropomyosins 2.1 (often depleted by miR-21) and 3 (often overexpressed). Restored cells could be transformed again by depleting other cytoskeletal proteins including myosin IIA. Thus, the depletion of rigidity sensing modules enables growth on soft surfaces and many different perturbations of cytoskeletal proteins can disrupt rigidity sensing thereby causing transformed growth of cancer cells.",

Growth and Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15), secreted from the trophoblast and decidual stromal cells, is present at high levels in the blood of pregnant women. The receptor for GDF15 has recently been identified and is specifically expressed in the hindbrain where it transmits aversive signals including nausea and conditioned taste aversion. We explored the relationship between GDF15 concentrations in maternal serum during pregnancy and self-reported NVP. In a study of 791 women from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study maternal GDF15 concentrations were higher in women who reported vomiting in the 2nd trimester (geometric mean: 11,670 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval: 11,056-12,318) and were even higher in the eleven women who reported taking anti-emetics during pregnancy (13,376 (10,821-16,535) compared to those who reported no nausea or vomiting during pregnancy (10,657 (10,121-11,222); P=0.02 and P=0.04, respectively, adjusted for gestational age at sampling and maternal BMI). In conclusion serum GDF15 concentrations early in the second trimester of pregnancy are significantly and positively associated with second trimester vomiting and with maternal anti-emetic use. In the context of the recently revealed biology of GDF15 this data suggests that antagonism of GDF15 may have some potential for therapeutic benefit in NVP.",

    "abstract": "To fully understand human genetic variation, one must assess the specific distribution of variants between the two chromosomal homologues of genes, and any functional units of interest, as the phase of variants can significantly impact gene function and phenotype. To this end, we have systematically analyzed 18,121 autosomal protein-coding genes in 1,092 statistically phased genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project, and an unprecedented number of 184 experimentally phased genomes from the Personal Genome Project. Here we show that mutations predicted to functionally alter the protein, and coding variants as a whole, are not randomly distributed between the two homologues of a gene, but do occur significantly more frequently in cis-than trans-configurations, with cis/trans ratios of [~]60:40. Significant cis-abundance was observed in virtually all individual genomes in all populations. Nearly all variable genes exhibited either cis, or trans configurations of protein-altering mutations in significant excess, allowing distinction of cis- and trans-abundant genes. These common patterns of phase were largely constituted by a shared, global set of phase-sensitive genes. We show significant enrichment of this global set with gene sets indicating its involvement in adaptation and evolution. Moreover, cis- and trans-abundant genes were found functionally distinguishable, and exhibited strikingly different distributional patterns of protein-altering mutations. This work establishes common patterns of phase as key characteristics of diploid human exomes and provides evidence for their potential functional significance. Thus, it highlights the importance of phase for the interpretation of protein-coding genetic variation, challenging the current conceptual and functional interpretation of autosomal genes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and Archaea represent the base of the evolutionary tree of life and contain the vast majority of phylogenetic and functional diversity. Because these organisms and their traits directly impact ecosystems and human health, a focus on functional traits has become increasingly common in microbial ecology. These trait-based approaches have the potential to link microbial communities and their ecological function. But an open question is how, why, and in what order microorganisms acquired the traits we observe in the present day. To address this, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of microbial traits using genomic data to understand the evolution, selective advantage, and similarity of traits in extant organisms and provide insights into the composition of genomes and communities. We used the geological timeline and physiological expectations to provide independent evidence in support of this evolutionary history. Using this reconstructed evolutionary history, we explored hypotheses related to the composition of genomes. We showed that gene transition rates can be used to make predictions about the size and type of genes in a genome: generalist genomes comprise many evolutionarily labile genes while specialist genomes comprise more highly conserved functional genes. These findings suggest that generalist organisms do not build up and hoard an array of functions, but rather tend to experiment with functions related to environmental sensing, transport, and complex resource degradation. Our results provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary history of extant microorganisms, the origin and maintenanceof traits, and linking evolutionary relatedness and ecological function.",

    "abstract": "Colistin represents one of the very few available drugs for treating infections caused by carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). As such, the recent plasmid-mediated spread of the mobilized colistin resistance gene mcr-1 poses a significant public health threat requiring global monitoring and surveillance. In this work, we characterize the global distribution of mcr-1 using a dataset of 457 mcr-1 positive sequenced isolates consisting of currently publicly available mcr-1 carrying sequences combined with an additional 110 newly sequenced mcr-1 positive isolates from China. We find mcr-1 in a diversity of plasmid backgrounds but identify an immediate background common to all mcr-1 sequences. Our analyses establish that all mcr-1 elements in circulation descend from the same initial mobilization of mcr-1 by an ISApl1 transposon in the mid 2000s (2002-2008; 95% higher posterior density), followed by a dramatic demographic expansion, which led to its current global distribution. Our results provide the first systematic phylogenetic analysis of the origin and spread of mcr-1, and emphasize the importance of understanding the movement of mobile elements carrying antibiotic resistance genes across multiple levels of genomic organization.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the main DNA repair pathways that protect cells against genomic damage. Disruption of this pathway can contribute to the development of cancer and accelerate aging. Tumors deficient in NER are more sensitive to cisplatin treatment. Characterization of the mutational consequences of NER-deficiency may therefore provide important diagnostic opportunities. Here, we analyzed the somatic mutational profiles of adult stem cells (ASCs) from NER-deficient Ercc1-/{Delta} mice, using whole-genome sequencing analysis of clonally derived organoid cultures. Our results indicate that NER-deficiency increases the base substitution load in liver, but not in small intestinal ASCs, which coincides with a tissue-specific aging-pathology observed in these mice. The mutational landscape changes as a result of NER-deficiency in ASCs of both tissues and shows an increased contribution of Signature 8 mutations, which is a pattern with unknown etiology that is recurrently observed in various cancer types. The scattered genomic distribution of the acquired base substitutions indicates that deficiency of global-genome NER (GG-NER) is responsible for the altered mutational landscape. In line with this, we observed increased Signature 8 mutations in a GG-NER-deficient human organoid culture in which XPC was deleted using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing. Furthermore, genomes of NER-deficient breast tumors show an increased contribution of Signature 8 mutations compared with NER-proficient tumors. Elevated levels of Signature 8 mutations may therefore serve as a biomarker for NER-deficiency and could improve personalized cancer treatment strategies.",

Stark similarity in domain organization and structure between Hsp110s and Hsp70s, is easily discernible although the nature of domain communication and domain functions of Hsp110s are still puzzling. Here, we report atypical domain communication of yeast Hsp110, Sse1 using single molecule FRET, small angle X-ray scattering measurements (SAXS) and Molecular Dynamic simulations. Our data show that Sse1 lacks typical domain movements as exhibited by Hsp70s, albeit it undergoes unique structural alteration upon nucleotide and substrate binding. Hsp70-like domain-movements can be artificially salvaged in chimeric constructs of Hsp110-Hsp70 although such salvaging proves detrimental for the NEF activity of the protein. Furthermore, we show that substrate binding domain (SBD) of Hsp110, chaperones self, as well as foreign nucleotide binding domains (NBD). Interestingly, the substrate binding specificity of Hsp110 is largely determined by its NBD rather than SBD, the latter being the foremost substrate binding region for Hsp70s.",

    "abstract": "Western blotting is often considered a semi-quantitative or even qualitative assay for assessing changes in protein or protein post-translational modification levels. Fluorescence-based measurement enables acquisition of quantitative data in principal, but requires determining the linear range of detection for each antibody--a labor-intensive task. Here, we describe the use of a high-throughput western blotting technique called microwestern array to more rapidly evaluate suitable conditions for quantitative western blotting with particular antibodies. We can evaluate up to 192 antibody/dilution/replicate combinations on a single standard size gel with a seven-point, two-fold lysate dilution series (~100-fold range). Pilot experiments demonstrate a surprisingly high proportion of investigated antibodies (17/22) are suitable for quantitative use, and that lack of validity might often be a consequence of lysate composition rather than antibody quality. Linear range for all validated antibodies is at least 8-fold, and in some cases nearly two orders of magnitude. That range could be greater as the presented tests did not find a limit for many antibodies. We find that phospho-specific and total antibodies do not have discernable trend differences in linear range or limit of detection, but total antibodies generally required higher working concentrations, suggesting phospho-specific antibodies may be generally higher affinity. Importantly, we demonstrate that results from microwestern analyses scale to normal \\\"macro\\\" western for a subset of antibodies. These data indicate that with initial validation, many antibodies can be readily used quantitatively in a reproducible manner. Antibody validation data and standard operating procedures are available online (www.birtwistlelab.com/protocols and www.dtoxs.org).",

    "abstract": "Cellular membranes are heterogeneous planar lipid bilayers displaying lateral phase separation with the nanometer-scale liquid-ordered phase (aka \\\"lipid rafts\\\" or Lo) surrounded by the liquid-disordered phase (Ld). Many membrane-associated proteins were found to stably integrate in the rafts, which is critical for their biological function. Isoforms H and N of Ras GTPase possess a unique ability to switch their lipid domain preference depending on the type of bound guanine nucleotide (GDP or GTP). This behavior, however, has never been reproduced in vitro in model bilayers with recombinant proteins, and therefore has been attributed to action of other proteins binding Ras at the membrane surface. In this paper, we report the observation of the nucleotide-dependent switch of lipid domain preferences of the semisynthetic lipidated N-Ras in raft lipid vesicles in the absence of other proteins. To detect segregation of Ras molecules in raft and disordered lipid domains, we measured Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between the donor fluorophore, mant, attached to the protein-bound guanine nucleotides, and the acceptor, rhodamine-conjugated lipid, localized to the liquid-disordered domains. We demonstrated that N-Ras preferentially populated raft domains when bound to mant-GDP, while losing preference for rafts when it was associated with a GTP mimic, mant-GppNHp. At the same time, the isolated lipidated C-terminal peptide of N-Ras was found localized outside of the liquid-ordered rafts, most likely--in the bulk disordered lipid.",

Thus, co-expression clustering is a routine step in large-scale analyses of gene expression data.

Furthermore, these clusters can contain up to 50% unreliably assigned genes. Consequently, downstream analyses of these clusters (e.g. functional term enrichment analysis) suffer from high error rates. We present clust, an automated method that solves these problems by extracting clusters that match the biological expectations of co-expressed genes. Using 100 datasets from five model organisms we demonstrate that clusters generated by clust are better than those produced by other methods, both numerically and for use in functional analysis. Finally, we show that clust can simultaneously cluster multiple datasets, enabling users to leverage the large quantity of public expression data for novel comparative analysis.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are the most abundant pathogens affecting all forms of life. A major component of a virus is a protein shell, known as the viral capsid, that encapsulates the genomic material. The fundamental functions of the capsid are to protect and transport the viral genome, and recognize the host cell. Descriptions of this macromolecular complex have been proposed at different scales of approximation. Here, we introduce a methodology to generate a structured volumetric mesh of icosahedral viral capsids (CapsidMesh) based on the atomic positions of their constituents. Material properties of the capsid proteins can be set on every mesh element individually. Hence, we have control over all levels of protein structure (atoms, amino acids, subunits, oligomers,capsid). The CapsidMesh models are suitable for numerical simulations and analysis of a physical process using a third-party package. In particular, we used our methodology to generate a CapsidMesh of several capsids previously characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy experiments, and then simulated the mechanical nanoindentation through the Finite Element Method. By fitting to the experimental linear elastic response, we estimated the elastic modulus and mechanical stresses produced on the capsids. Our results show that the atomic detail of the CapsidMesh is sufficient to reproduce anisotropic properties of the particle.",

    "abstract": "The discovery and development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the past few years has made eukaryotic genome editing, and specifically gene knockout for reverse genetics, a simpler, efficient, and effective task. The system is directed to the genomic target site by a programmed single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that base-pairs with the DNA target, subsequently leading to site-specific double-strand breaks. However, many gene families in eukaryotic genomes exhibit partially overlapping functions and, thus, the knockout of one gene might be concealed by the function of the other. In such cases, the reduced specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which may lead to the cleavage of genomic sites that are not identical to the sgRNA, can be harnessed for the simultaneous knockout of multiple homologous genes. Here, we introduce CRISPys, an algorithm for the optimal design of sgRNAs that would potentially target multiple members of a given gene family. CRISPys first clusters all the potential targets in the input sequences into a hierarchical tree structure that specifies the similarity among them. Then, sgRNAs are proposed in the internal nodes of the tree by embedding mismatches where needed, such that the cleavage efficiencies of the induced targets are maximized. We suggest several approaches for designing the optimal individual sgRNA, and an approach that provides a set of sgRNAs that also accounts for the homologous relationships among gene-family members. We further show by in-silico examination over all gene families in the Solanum lycopersicum genome that our suggested approach outperforms simpler alignment-based techniques.\\n\\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMany genes in eukaryotic genomes exhibit partially overlapping functions.

We tested our method on a curated benchmark set of 1240 mutants, and found the method outperformed existing methods that sampled conformational space to a lesser degree. We observed considerable improvements with flex ddG over existing methods on the subset of small side chain to large side chain mutations, as well as for multiple simultaneous non-alanine mutations, stabilizing mutations, and mutations in antibody-antigen interfaces.

LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis. LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatin bridges are trapped at the cleavage plane. LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase. Strikingly, LEM-3 act cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity.

The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potential unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, quantified examples of a LOF over large spatial scales are lacking as is knowledge about the daily dynamics of a LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that a LOF is a static consequence of a predators mere presence. We tested the prediction that a LOF in a large-scale, free-living system is a highly-dynamic map with  peaks and  valleys that alternate across the diel (24-hour) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1000-km2 of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why a LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient homeostasis relates ambient stoichiometric conditions in an environment to the stoichiometry of living entities of the ecosystem. In wetland ecosystems, vegetation can be a large, highly variable and dynamic sink of nutrients. This study investigated stoichiometric homeostasis of dominant emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation (EAV and SAV, respectively) within two treatment flow-ways (FW) of Everglades Stormwater Treatment Area 2 (STA-2). These FW encompass a large gradient in plant nutrient availability. The hypotheses of this study is that wetland vegetation is non-homeostatic relative to ambient nutrients and consequently nutrient resorption will not vary along the nutrient gradient. We developed a framework to investigate how vegetation uptake and resorption of nutrients contribute separately to homeostasis. Overall, the wetland vegetation in this study was non-homeostatic with respect to differential uptake of nitrogen (N) vs. phosphorus (P). Resorption evaluated for EAV was high for P and moderate for N, resorption efficiency did not significantly vary along the gradient and therefore did not affect overall homeostatic status. Nutrient addition experiments may help to compensate for some of the limitation of our study, especially with respect to resolving the primary nutrient source (organic vs. inorganic sources, water vs. soil compartment) and nutrient utilization rates.",

This analysis examines the relationship between these two disease in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2015 and compares varicella rates before and after the reintroduction of scarlet fever. Analysis shows that scarlet fever and varicella have synchronous annual epidemic cycles, and a mathematical model of the relationship between scarlet fever and varicella is estimated.

    "abstract": "While it is appreciated that population size changes can impact patterns of deleterious variation in natural populations, less attention has been paid to how population admixture affects the dynamics of deleterious variation. Here we use population genetic simulations to examine how admixture impacts deleterious variation under a variety of demographic scenarios, dominance coefficients, and recombination rates. Our results show that gene flow between populations can temporarily reduce the genetic load of smaller populations, especially if deleterious mutations are recessive. Additionally, when fitness effects of new mutations are recessive, between-population differences in the sites at which deleterious variants exist creates heterosis in hybrid individuals. This can lead to an increase in introgressed ancestry, particularly when recombination rates are low. Under certain scenarios, introgressed ancestry can increase from an initial frequency of 5% to 30-75% and fix at many loci, even in the absence of beneficial mutations. Further, deleterious variation and admixture can generate correlations between the frequency of introgressed ancestry and recombination rate or exon density, even in the absence of other types of selection. The direction of these correlations is determined by the specific demography and whether mutations are additive or recessive. Therefore, it is essential that null models include both demography and deleterious variation before invoking reproductive incompatibilities or adaptive introgression to explain unusual patterns of genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Predicting evolution of expanding populations is critical to control biological threats such as invasive species and cancer metastasis. Expansion is primarily driven by reproduction and dispersal, but nature abounds with examples of evolution where organisms pay a reproductive cost to disperse faster. When does selection favor this  survival of the fastest? We searched for a simple rule, motivated by evolution experiments where swarming bacteria evolved into an hy-perswarmer mutant which disperses[~] 100% faster but pays a growth cost of [~] 10% to make many copies of its flagellum. We analyzed a two-species model based on the Fisher equation to explain this observation: the population expansion rate (v) results from an interplay of growth (r) and dispersal (D) and is independent of the carrying capacity: [Formula]. A mutant can take over the edge only if its expansion rate (v2) exceeds the expansion rate of the established species (v1); this simple condition (v2 > v1) determines the maximum cost in slower growth that a faster mutant can pay and still be able to take over. Numerical simulations and time-course experiments where we tracked evolution by imaging bacteria suggest that our findings are general: less favorable conditions delay but do not entirely prevent the success of the fastest. Thus, the expansion rate defines a traveling wave fitness, which could be combined with trade-offs to predict evolution of expanding populations.",

Pro-thermotolerance alleles at these mapped loci were required for the adaptive trait in S. cerevisiae and sufficient for its partial reconstruction in S. paradoxus. The emerging picture is one in which S. cerevisiae improved the heat resistance of multiple components of the fundamental growth machinery in response to selective pressure.

    "abstract": "The fates of genetic polymorphisms maintained by balancing selection depend on evolutionary dynamics at linked sites. While coevolution across linked, epigenetically-interacting loci has been extensively explored, such supergenes may be relatively rare. However, genes harboring adaptive variation can occur in close physical proximity while generating independent effects on fitness. Here, I present a model in which two linked loci without epistasis are both under balancing selection for unrelated reasons. Using forward-time simulations, I show that recombination rate strongly influences the retention of adaptive polymorphism, especially for intermediate selection coefficients. A locus is more likely to retain adaptive variation if it is closely linked to another locus under balancing selection, even if the two loci have no interaction. Thus, two linked polymorphisms can both be retained indefinitely even when they would both be lost to drift if unlinked. Such clusters of mutually reinforcing genes may underlie phenotypic variation in natural populations. Future studies that measure selection coefficients and recombination rates among closely linked genes will be fruitful for characterizing the extent of this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Family life forms an integral part of the life-history of species across the animal kingdom, and plays a crucial role in the evolution of animal sociality. Our current understanding of family life, however, is almost exclusively based on studies that (i) focus on parental care and associated family interactions (such as those arising from sibling rivalry and parent-offspring conflict), and (ii) investigate these phenomena in the advanced family systems of mammals, birds, and eusocial insects. Here, we argue that these historical biases have fostered the neglect of key processes shaping social life in ancestral family systems, and thus profoundly hamper our understanding of the (early) evolution of family life. Based on a comprehensive survey of the literature, we first illustrate that the strong focus on parental care in advanced social systems has deflected scrutiny of other important social processes such as sibling cooperation, parent-offspring competition and offspring assistance. We then show that accounting for these neglected processes - and their changing role in the course of evolution - could profoundly change our understanding of the evolutionary origin and subsequent consolidation of family life. Finally, we outline how this diachronic perspective on the evolution of family living could provide novel insights into general processes driving social evolution. Overall, we infer that the explicit consideration of thus far neglected facets of family life, together with their study across the whole diversity of family systems, are crucial to advance our understanding of the processes that shape the evolution of social life.",

    "abstract": "The platypus is an egg-laying mammal which, alongside the echidna, occupies a unique place in the mammalian phylogenetic tree. Despite widespread interest in its unusual biology, little is known about its population structure or recent evolutionary history. To provide new insights into the dispersal and demographic history of this iconic species, we sequenced the genomes of 57 platypuses from across the whole species range in eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania. Using a highly-improved reference genome, we called over 6.7M SNPs, providing an informative genetic data set for population analyses. Our results show very strong population structure in the platypus, with our sampling locations corresponding to discrete groupings between which there is no evidence for recent gene flow. Genome-wide data allowed us to establish that 28 of the 57 sampled individuals had at least a third-degree relative amongst other samples from the same river, often taken at different times. Taking advantage of a sampled family quartet, we estimated the de novo mutation rate in the platypus at 7.0x10-9/bp/generation (95% CI 4.1x10-9 - 1.2x10-8/bp/generation). We estimated effective population sizes of ancestral populations and haplotype sharing between current groupings, and found evidence for bottlenecks and long-term population decline in multiple regions, and early divergence between populations in different regions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudy of meta-transcriptomic datasets involving non-model organisms represents bioinformatic challenges. The production of chimeric sequences and our inability to distinguish the taxonomic origins of the sequences produced are inherent and recurrent difficulties in de novo assembly analyses. The study of holobiont transcriptomes shares similarities with meta-transcriptomic, and hence, is also affected by challenges invoked above. Here we propose an innovative approach to tackle such difficulties which was applied to the study of marine holobiont models as a proof of concept.\\n\\nResultsWe considered three holobionts models, of which two transcriptomes were previously assembled and published, and a yet unpublished transcriptome, to analyze their raw reads and assign them to the host and/or to the symbiont(s) using Short Read Connector, a k-mer based similarity method. We were able to define four distinct categories of reads for each holobiont transcriptome: host reads, symbiont reads, shared reads and unassigned reads. The result of the independent assemblies for each category within a transcriptome led to a significant diminution of de novo assembled chimeras compared to classical assembly methods. Combining independent functional and taxonomic annotations of each partners transcriptome is particularly convenient to explore the functional diversity of an holobiont. Finally, our strategy allowed to propose new functional annotations for two well-studied holobionts and a first transcriptome from a planktonic Radiolaria-Dinophyta system forming widespread symbiotic association for which our knowledge is limited. Conclusions\\n\\nIn contrast to classical assembly approaches, our bioinformatic strategy not only allows biologists to studying separately host and symbiont data from a holobiont mixture, but also generates improved transcriptome assemblies. The use of Short Read Connector has proven to be an effective way to tackle meta-transcriptomic challenges to study holobiont systems composed of either well-studied or poorly characterized symbiotic lineages such as the newly sequenced marine plankton Radiolaria-Dinophyta symbiosis and ultimately expand our knowledge about these marine symbiotic associations.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1-infected people who take medications that suppress viremia, preserve CD4+ T cells, and prevent AIDS, have chronic inflammation with increased cardiovascular mortality. To investigate the etiology of this inflammation, the effect of HIV-1 on innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and NK cells was examined. Homeostatic ILCs in blood and intestine were depleted permanently. NK cells were skewed towards a memory subset. Cytokines that are elevated during HIV-1 infection reproduced both abnormalities ex vivo. Pseudotime analysis of single NK cell transcriptomes revealed a developmental trajectory towards a subset with expression profile, chromatin state, and biological function like memory T lymphocytes. Expression of TCF7, a WNT transcription factor, increased over the course of the trajectory. TCF7 disruption, or WNT inhibition, prevented memory NK cell induction by inflammatory cytokines. These results demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines associated with HIV-1 infection irreversibly disrupt homeostatic ILCs and cause developmental shift towards TCF7+ memory NK cells.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIHIV-1 infection depletes homeostatic ILCs in blood and intestine and shifts NK cells towards a memory cell phenotype, irrespective of viremia or CD4 count\\nC_LIO_LIInflammatory cytokines recapitulate ILC and NK cell abnormalities ex vivo\\nC_LIO_LITCF7 expression correlates with a developmental trajectory that culminates in memory NK cells\\nC_LIO_LITCF7/WNT signaling is required for establishment of memory NK cells\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=172 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/221010v3_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (32K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ae82a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103b2b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c9585aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c7bb2d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Like most viral infections, ZIKV viremia varies over several orders of magnitude, with unknown consequences for transmission. To determine the effect of viral concentration on ZIKV transmission risk, we exposed field-derived Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to four doses (103, 104, 105, 106 PFU/mL) representative of potential variation in the field. We demonstrate that increasing ZIKV dose in the blood-meal significantly increases the probability of mosquitoes becoming infected and infectious, as well as the rate at which virus spreads to the saliva, but found no effect on dissemination efficiency or mosquito mortality. We also demonstrate that determining infection using RT-qPCR approaches rather than plaque assays potentially over-estimates key pathogen parameters, including the time at which mosquitoes become infectious and viral burden. Finally, using these data to parameterize an R0 model, we demonstrate that variation in viremia substantially affects transmission risk.",

    "abstract": "Defining the complex dynamics of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnancy and during transmission between vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors is critical for a thorough understanding of viral transmission, pathogenesis, immune evasion, and potential reservoir establishment. Within-host viral diversity in ZIKV infection is low, which makes it difficult to evaluate infection dynamics. To overcome this biological hurdle, we constructed a molecularly barcoded ZIKV. This virus stock consists of a \\\"synthetic swarm\\\" whose members are genetically identical except for a run of eight consecutive degenerate codons, which creates approximately 64,000 theoretical nucleotide combinations that all encode the same amino acids. Deep sequencing this region of the ZIKV genome enables counting of individual barcode clonotypes to quantify the number and relative proportions of viral lineages present within a host. Here we used these molecularly barcoded ZIKV variants to study the dynamics of ZIKV infection in pregnant and non-pregnant macaques as well as during mosquito infection/transmission. The barcoded virus had no discernible fitness defects in vivo, and the proportions of individual barcoded virus templates remained stable throughout the duration of acute plasma viremia. ZIKV RNA also was detected in maternal plasma from a pregnant animal infected with barcoded virus for 64 days. The complexity of the virus population declined precipitously 8 days following infection of the dam, consistent with the timing of typical resolution of ZIKV in non-pregnant macaques, and remained low for the subsequent duration of viremia. Our approach showed that synthetic swarm viruses can be used to probe the composition of ZIKV populations over time in vivo to understand vertical transmission, persistent reservoirs, bottlenecks, and evolutionary dynamics.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the complex dynamics of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy and during transmission to and from vertebrate host and mosquito vector is critical for a thorough understanding of viral transmission, pathogenesis, immune evasion, and reservoir establishment. We sought to develop a virus model system for use in nonhuman primates and mosquitoes that allows for the genetic discrimination of molecularly cloned viruses. This \\\"synthetic swarm\\\" of viruses incorporates a molecular barcode that allows for tracking and monitoring individual viral lineages during infection. Here we infected rhesus macaques with this virus to study the dynamics of ZIKV infection in nonhuman primates as well as during mosquito infection/transmission.

Here, using proteomics, confocal/super-resolution imaging, and infection under BSL-4 containment, we present the first report that this nucleolar DDR pathway is targeted by infectious pathogens. We find that Treacle has antiviral activity, but that matrix protein of Henipaviruses and P3 protein of rabies virus, highly pathogenic viruses of the order Mononegavirales, interact with Treacle and inhibit its function, thereby silencing rRNA biogenesis, consistent with mimicking NBS1-Treacle interaction during a DDR. These data identify a novel mechanism for viral modulation of host cells by appropriating the nucleolar DDR; this appears to have developed independently in different viruses, and represents, to our knowledge, the first direct intra-nucleolar function for proteins of any mononegavirus.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is central to a number of cognitive functions and brain disorders. Given the cost of neurochemical imaging in humans, behavioral proxy measures of dopamine have gained in popularity in the past decade, such as spontaneous eye blink rate (sEBR). Increased sEBR is commonly associated with increased dopamine function based on pharmacological evidence and patient studies. Yet, this hypothesis has not been validated using in vivo measures of dopamine function in humans. In order to fill this gap, we measured sEBR and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity using [18F]DOPA PET in 20 participants (9 healthy individuals and 11 pathological gamblers). Our results, based on frequentist and Bayesian statistics, as well as region-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses, argue against a positive relationship between sEBR and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. They show that, if anything, the evidence is in favor of a negative relationship. These results, which complement findings from a recent study that failed to observe a relationship between sEBR and dopamine D2 receptor availability, suggest that caution and nuance are warranted when interpreting sEBR in terms of a proxy measure of striatal dopamine.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders are characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction, and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in literature. To investigate this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning. These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by drug consumption. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted U-shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of haemodynamic (BOLD-fMRI) resting-state networks (RSNs) has brought about a fundamental shift in our thinking about the role of intrinsic brain activity. The electrophysiological underpinnings of RSNs remain largely elusive and it has been shown only recently that electrophysiological cortical rhythms are organized into RSNs. Most electrophysiological studies into RSNs use magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG), which limits the spatial scale on which RSNs can be investigated. Due to their close proximity to the cortical surface, electroencephalographic (ECoG) recordings can potentially provide a more detailed picture of the functional organization of resting-state cortical rhythms. In this study we propose using source-space independent component analysis for identifying generators of resting-state cortical rhythms as recorded with ECoG and reconstructing their network structure. Their network structure is characterized by two kinds of connectivity: instantaneous correlations between band-limited amplitude envelopes and oscillatory phase-locking. Using simulated data, we find that the reconstruction of oscillatory phase-locking is more challenging than that of amplitude correlations, particularly for low signal-to-noise levels. Specifically, phase-lags can both be over- and underestimated as a consequence of first-order and higher-order volume-conduction effects, which troubles the interpretation of interaction measures based on imaginary phase-locking or coherence. The methodology is applied to resting-state beta (15-30 Hz) rhythms within the motor system of a macaque monkey and leads to the identification of a functional network of seven cortical generators that are distributed across the sensorimotor system. The spatial extent of the identified generators, together with consistent phase-lags, suggests that these rhythms can be viewed as being spatially continuous with complex dynamics including traveling waves. Our findings illustrate the level of spatial detail attainable with source-projected ECoG and motivates wider use of the methodology for studying resting-state as well as event-related cortical dynamics in macaque and human.",

FXN is involved in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis in mitochondria, its deficiency causes multiple Fe-S protein deficiencies, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Primary sensory neurons (PSNs) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are the most vulnerable cells in FRDA, whose abnormal development and degeneration leads to the onset and early progression of ataxia. We generated PSNs from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from FRDA patients and showed that they recapitulate the key pathogenic events in FRDA, including low FXN levels, loss of Fe-S proteins and impaired antioxidant responses. We also showed that FXN deficiency in these cells may be partially corrected by a pimelic benzamide histone deacetylase inhibitor, a class of potential therapeutics for FRDA. We generated and validated a cellular model of the most vulnerable neurons in FRDA, which can be used for further studies on pathogenesis and treatment approaches.",

Although early clinical, behavioral, and modeling data suggested that such computations are performed pre-attentively, recent neurophysiological evidence suggests that surface filling-in is influenced by attention. In the present study we developed a variant of the classical Kanizsa illusory triangle to investigate whether voluntary attention modulates perceptual filling-in. Our figure consists of \\\"pacmen\\\" positioned at the tips of an illusory 6-point star and alternating in polarity such that two illusory triangles are implied to compete with one another within the figure. On each trial, observers were cued to attend to only one triangle, and then compared its lightness with a matching texture-defined triangle. We found that perceived lightness of the illusory shape depended on the polarity of pacmen framing the attended triangle, although the magnitude of this effect was weaker than when all inducers were of the same polarity. Our findings thus reveal that voluntary attention can influence lightness filling-in, and provide important data linking neurophysiological effects to phenomenology.",

    "abstract": "Animal studies support the hypothesis that in slow-wave sleep, replay of waking neocortical activity under hippocampal guidance leads to memory consolidation. However, no intracranial electrophysiological evidence for replay exists in humans. We identified consistent sequences of population firing peaks across widespread cortical regions during complete waking periods. The occurrence of these Motifs were compared between sleeps preceding the waking period (Sleep-Pre) when the Motifs were identified, and those following (Sleep-Post). In all subjects, the majority of waking Motifs (most of which were novel) had more matches in Sleep-Post than in Sleep-Pre. In rodents, hippocampal replay occurs during local sharp-wave ripples, and the associated neocortical replay tends to occur during local sleep spindles and down-to-up transitions. These waves may facilitate consolidation by sequencing cell-firing and encouraging plasticity. Similarly, we found that Motifs were coupled to neocortical spindles, down-to-up transitions, theta bursts, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. While Motifs occurring during cognitive task performance were more likely to have more matches in subsequent sleep, our studies provide no direct demonstration that the replay of Motifs contributes to consolidation. Nonetheless, these results confirm a core prediction of the dominant neurobiological theory of human memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "In studies of voluntary movement, a most elemental quantity is the reaction time (RT) between the onset of a visual stimulus and a saccade toward it. However, this RT demonstrates extremely high variability, which in spite of extensive research remains unexplained. It is well established that, when a visual target appears, oculomotor activity gradually builds up until a critical level is reached, at which point a saccade is triggered. Here, we further characterize the dynamics of this rise-to-threshold process based on computational work and single-neuron recordings from the frontal eye field (FEF) of behaving monkeys. We find that the baseline activity, build-up rate, and threshold level show strong, nonlinear co-dependencies that explain the distinct RT distributions observed experimentally. The results indicate that intrinsic randomness contributes little to saccade variance, which results mainly from an intricate, fundamentally deterministic mechanism of motor conflict resolution that has subtle yet highly characteristic manifestations.",

To faithfully convey feature-specific information from retina to cortex, thalamic relay cells must receive inputs from only a small number of functionally similar retinal ganglion cells. However, recent studies challenged this by revealing substantial levels of retinal convergence onto relay cells. Here, we sought to identify mechanisms responsible for the assembly of such convergence. Using an unbiased transcriptomics approach and targeted mutant mice, we discovered a critical role for the synaptic adhesion molecule Leucine Rich Repeat Transmembrane Neuronal 1 (LRRTM1) in the emergence of retinothalamic convergence. Importantly, LRRTM1 mutant mice display impairment in visual behaviors, suggesting a functional role of retinothalamic convergence in vision.",

However, before eye-opening, HD cell responses in rat pups carry low directional information content and are directionally unstable. Using Bayesian decoding, we characterise this instability and identify its source: despite the directional signal being internally coherent, it consistently under-signals angular head velocity (AHV), incompletely shifting in proportion to head turns. We find evidence that geometric cues (corners) can be used to mitigate this under-signalling, and stabilise the directional signal even before eye-opening. Crucially, even when directional firing cannot be stabilised, ensembles of unstable HD cells show short-timescale (1-10 sec) temporal and spatial couplings consistent with an adult-like HD network, through which activity drifts unanchored to landmark cues. The existence of fixed spatial and temporal offsets across co-recorded cells and of an AHV-responsive signal, even before HD responses become spatially stable, suggests that the HD circuit is assembled through internal, self-organising processes, without reference to external landmarks. The HD network is widely modelled as a continuous attractor whose output is one coherent activity peak, updated during movement by angular head velocity (AHV) signals, and anchored by landmark cues. Our findings present strong evidence for this model, and demonstrate that the required network circuitry is in place and functional during development, independent of reference to landmark information.",

    "abstract": "Principles derived from recent studies have begun to converge and point to a consensus for the neural basis of economic choice. These principles include the idea that evaluation is limited to the option within the focus of attention and that we accept or reject that option relative to the entire set of alternatives. Rejection leads attention to a new option, although it can later switch back to a previously rejected one. The referent of a value-coding neuron is dynamically determined by attention and not stably by labeled lines. Comparison results not from explicit competition between discrete representations, but from value-dependent changes in responsiveness. Consequently, comparison can occur within a single pool of neurons rather than by competition between two or more neuronal populations. Comparison may nonetheless occur at multiple levels (including premotor levels) simultaneously through a distributed consensus. This framework suggests a solution to a set of otherwise unresolved neuronal binding problems that result from the need to link options to values, comparisons to actions, and choices to outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of loci linked to hundreds of traits in many different species. However, because linkage equilibrium implicates a broad region surrounding each identified locus, the causal genes often remain unknown. This problem is especially pronounced in non-human, non-model species where functional annotations are sparse and there is frequently little information available for prioritizing candidate genes.\\n\\nResultsTo address this issue, we developed a computational approach called Camoco (Co-Analysis of Molecular Components) that systematically integrates loci identified by GWAS with gene co-expression networks to prioritize putative causal genes. We applied Camoco to prioritize candidate genes from a large-scale GWAS examining the accumulation of 17 different elements in maize seeds. Camoco identified statistically significant subnetworks for the majority of traits examined, producing a prioritized list of high-confidence causal genes for several agronomically important maize traits. Two candidate genes identified by our approach were validated through analysis of mutant phenotypes. Strikingly, we observed a strong dependence in the performance of our approach on the type of co-expression network used: expression variation across genetically diverse individuals in a relevant tissue context (in our case, maize roots) outperformed other alternatives.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates that co-expression networks can provide a powerful basis for prioritizing candidate causal genes from GWAS loci, but suggests that the success of such strategies can highly depend on the gene expression data context. Both the Camoco software and the lessons on integrating GWAS data with co-expression networks generalize to species beyond maize.",

Here, we compared the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats (NMRs) and the phylogenetically closely related, shorter-lived, guinea pigs using an integrated omic approach. We found that NMRs livers display a unique expression pattern of mitochondrial proteins that result in distinct metabolic features of their mitochondria. For instance, we observed a generally reduced respiration rate associated with lower protein levels of respiratory chain components, particularly complex I, and increased capacity to utilize fatty acids. Interestingly, we show that the same molecular networks are affected during aging in both NMR and humans, supporting a direct link to the extraordinary longevity of both species. Finally, we identified a novel longevity pathway and validated it experimentally in the nematode C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Comparing models facilitates testing different hypotheses regarding the computational basis of perception and action. Effective model comparison requires stimuli for which models make different predictions. Typically, experiments use a predetermined set of stimuli or sample stimuli randomly. Both methods have limitations; a predetermined set may not contain stimuli that dissociate the models whereas random sampling may be inefficient. To overcome these limitations, we expanded the psi-algorithm (Kontsevich & Tyler, 1999) from estimating the parameters of a psychometric curve to distinguishing models. To test our algorithm, we applied it to two distinct problems. First, we investigated dissociating sensory noise models. We simulated ideal observers with different noise models performing a 2-afc task. Stimuli were selected randomly or using our algorithm. We found using our algorithm improved the accuracy of model comparison. We also validated the algorithm in subjects by inferring which noise model underlies speed perception. Our algorithm converged quickly to the model previously proposed (Stocker & Simoncelli, 2006), whereas if stimuli were selected randomly model probabilities separated slower and sometimes supported alternative models. Second, we applied our algorithm to a different problem; comparing models of target selection under body acceleration. Previous work found target choice preference is modulated by whole body acceleration (Rincon-Gonzalez et al., 2016). However, the effect is subtle making model comparison difficult. We show that selecting stimuli adaptively could have led to stronger conclusions in model comparison. We conclude that our technique is more efficient and more reliable than current methods of stimulus selection for dissociating models.\\n\\nData AvailabilityAll data and code will be posted on our institutional repository system following acceptance.

As impaired energy metabolism is an important hallmark of AD progression, we tested whether it could trigger phosphorylation of human tau protein in a transgenic C. elegans model of AD. We found that suppression or inhibition of a mitochondrial enzyme of energy metabolism, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) either by RNAi or 2-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (MICA) respectively, resulted in elevated whole-body glucose levels as well as increased phosphorylation of tau. Although the calcium ionophore A23187 could reduce tau phosphorylation induced by either chemical inhibition or genetic suppression of DLD, it was unable to reduce tau phosphorylation induced by hyperglycemia. While inhibition of the dld-1 gene or treatment with MICA partially reversed the inhibition of acetylcholine neurotransmission by tau, neither treatment affected tau inhibited mobility.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering how brains generate behavior depends critically on an accurate description of behavior. If distinct behaviors are lumped together, separate modes of brain activity can be wrongly attributed to the same behavior. Alternatively, if a single behavior is split into two, the same neural activity can appear to produce different behaviors [1]. Here, we address this issue in the context of acoustic communication in Drosophila. During courtship, males utilize wing vibration to generate time-varying songs, and females evaluate songs to inform mating decisions [2-4]. Drosophila melanogaster song was thought for 50 years to consist of only two modes, sine and pulse, but using new unsupervised classification methods on large datasets of song recordings, we now establish the existence of at least three song modes: two distinct, evolutionary conserved pulse types, along with a single sine mode. We show how this seemingly subtle distinction profoundly affects our interpretation of the mechanisms underlying song production, perception and evolution. Specifically, we show that sensory feedback from the female influences the probability of producing each song mode and that male song mode choice affects female responses and contributes to modulating his song amplitude with distance [5]. At the neural level, we demonstrate how the activity of three separate neuron types within the flys song pathway differentially affect the probability of producing each song mode. Our results highlight the importance of carefully segmenting behavior to accurately map the underlying sensory, neural, and genetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Sleep spindles are a cardinal feature in human slow wave sleep and may be important for memory consolidation. We studied the intracortical organization of spindles in humans by recording spontaneous sleep spindles from different cortical layers using linear microelectrode arrays. Two patterns of spindle generation were identified using visual inspection, and confirmed with factor analysis. Spindles were largest and most common in upper and middle channels, with limited involvement of deep channels. Many spindles were observed in only upper or only middle channels, but about half occurred in both. In spindles involving both middle and upper channels, the spindle envelope onset in middle channels led upper by [~]25-50ms on average. The phase relationship between spindle waves in upper and middle channels varied dynamically within spindle epochs, and across individuals. Current source density analysis demonstrated that upper and middle channel spindles were both generated by an excitatory supragranular current sink while an additional deep source was present for middle channel spindles only. Only middle channel spindles were accompanied by deep gamma activity. These results suggest that upper channel spindles are generated by supragranular pyramids, and middle channel by infragranular. Possibly, middle channel spindles are generated by core thalamocortical afferents, and upper channel by matrix. The concurrence of these patterns could reflect engagement of cortical circuits in the integration of more focal (core) and distributed (matrix) aspects of memory. These results demonstrate that at least two distinct intracortical systems generate human sleep spindles.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBursts of [~]14Hz oscillations, lasting about a second, have been recognized for over 80 years as cardinal features of mammalian sleep. Recent findings suggest that they play a key role in organizing cortical activity during memory consolidation. We used linear microelectrode arrays to study their intracortical organization in humans. We found that spindles could be divided into two types. One mainly engages upper layers of the cortex, which are considered to be specialized for associative activity. The other engages both upper and middle layers, including those devoted to sensory input. The interaction of these two spindle types may help organize the interaction of sensory and associative aspects of memory consolidation.",
