    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100039). The efficiency of plant resistance to fungal pathogen populations is expected to decrease over time, due to its evolution with an increase in the frequency of virulent or highly aggressive strains. This dynamics may differ depending on the scale investigated (annual or pluriannual), particularly for annual crop pathogens with both sexual and asexual reproduction cycles. We assessed this time-scale effect, by comparing aggressiveness changes in a local Zymoseptoria tritici population over an eight-month cropping season and a six-year period of wheat monoculture. We collected two pairs of subpopulations to represent the annual and pluriannual scales: from leaf lesions at the beginning and end of a single annual epidemic, and from crop debris at the beginning and end of a six-year period. We assessed two aggressiveness traits - latent period and lesion size - on sympatric and allopatric host varieties. A trend toward decreased latent period concomitant with a significant loss of variability was established during the course of the annual epidemic, but not over the six-year period. Furthermore, a significant cultivar effect (sympatric vs. allopatric) on the average aggressiveness of the isolates revealed host adaptation, arguing that the observed patterns could result from selection. We thus provide an experimental body of evidence of an epidemiological trade-off between the intra- and inter-annual scales in the evolution of aggressiveness in a local plant pathogen population. More aggressive isolates were collected from upper leaves, on which disease severity is usually lower than on the lower part of the plants left in the field as crop debris after harvest. We suggest that these isolates play little role in sexual reproduction, due to an Allee effect (difficulty finding mates at low pathogen densities), particularly as the upper parts of the plant are removed from the field, explaining the lack of transmission of increases in aggressiveness between epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Primary dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder linked to altered dopaminergic signaling and synaptic plasticity in regions of the brain involved in motor control. Mutations in HPCA, encoding the neuronal calcium sensor Hippocalcin, are associated with primary dystonia, suggesting a function for Hippocalcin in regulating the initiation and/or maintenance of activity. However, such a role for Hippocalcin or Hippocalcin homologs has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. Here we investigate the cellular and organismal functions of the Drosophila Hippocalcin homolog Neurocalcin (NCA), and define a role for NCA in promoting sleep by suppressing nighttime hyperactivity. We show that NCA acts in a common pathway with the D1-type Dop1R1 dopamine receptor and facilitates sleep by inhibiting neurotransmitter release from a multi-component activity-promoting circuit. Our results suggest conserved roles for Hippocalcin homologs in modulating motor control through dopaminergic pathways, suppressing aberrant movements in humans and inappropriate nighttime locomotion in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Side-streams in wastewater treatment plants can serve as concentrated sources of nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) to support the growth of photosynthetic organisms that ultimately serve as feedstock for production of fuels and chemicals. However, other chemical characteristics of these streams may inhibit growth in unanticipated ways. Here, we evaluated the use of liquid recovered from municipal anaerobic digesters via gravity belt filtration as a nutrient source for growing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. The gravity belt filtrate (GBF) contained high levels of complex dissolved organic matter (DOM), which seemed to negatively influence cells. We investigated the impact of GBF on physiological parameters such as growth rate, membrane integrity, membrane composition, photosystem composition, and oxygen evolution from photosystem II. At 37{degrees}C, we observed an inverse correlation between GBF concentration and membrane integrity. Radical production was also detected upon exposure to GBF at 37{degrees}C. However, at 27{degrees}C the dose dependent relationship between GBF concentration and lack of membrane integrity was abolished. Immediate resuspension of strains in high doses of GBF showed markedly reduced oxygen evolution rates relative to the control. Together, this suggests that one mechanism responsible for GBF toxicity to Synechococcus is the interruption of photosynthetic electron flow and subsequent phenomena. We hypothesize this is likely due to the presence of phenolic compounds within the DOM.\\n\\nIMPORTANCECyanobacteria are viewed as promising platforms to produce fuels and/or high-value chemicals as part of so-called \\\"bio-refineries\\\". Their integration into wastewater treatment systems is particularly interesting because removal of the nitrogen and phosphorus in many wastewater streams is an expensive but necessary part of wastewater treatment. In this study, we evaluated strategies for cultivating Synechococcus strain PCC 7002 on media comprised of two wastewater streams; treated secondary effluent supplemented with the liquid fraction extracted from sludge following anaerobic digestion. This strain is commonly used for metabolic engineering to produce a variety of valuable chemical products and product precursors (e.g. lactate). However, initial attempts to grow PCC 7002 under otherwise standard conditions of light and temperature failed. We thus systematically evaluated alternative cultivation conditions and then used multiple methods to dissect the apparent toxicity of the media under standard cultivation conditions.",

The relative risks for RSV-related hospitalization associated with a prior diagnosis of asthma in age groups under 5y ranged between 3.1(2.1,4.7) (age <1y) to 6.7(4.2,11.8) (age 2y); the corresponding risks for influenza-related hospitalization ranged from 2.8(2.1,4) (age <1y) to 4.9(3.8,6.4) (age 3y).\n\nConclusionsRSV-associated hospitalization rates in young children are high and decline rapidly with age. Young children with an asthma diagnosis should be target groups for RSV and influenza-related mitigation efforts, possibly including RSV prophylaxis for the youngest children.",

    "abstract": "The cohesin complex topologically encircles chromosomes and mediates sister chromatid cohesion to ensure accurate chromosome segregation upon cell division. Cohesin also participates in DNA repair and gene transcription. The Nipped-B - Mau2 protein complex loads cohesin onto chromosomes and the Pds5 - Wapl complex removes cohesin. Pds5 is also essential for sister chromatid cohesion, indicating that it has functions beyond cohesin removal. The Brca2 DNA repair protein interacts with Pds5, but the roles of this complex beyond DNA repair are unknown. Here we show that Brca2 opposes Pds5 function in sister chromatid cohesion by assaying precocious sister chromatid separation in metaphase spreads of cultured cells depleted for these proteins. By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation we find that Pds5 facilitates SA cohesin subunit association with DNA replication origins and that Brca2 inhibits SA binding, mirroring their effects on sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin binding is maximal at replication origins and extends outward to occupy active genes and regulatory sequences. Pds5 and Wapl, but not Brca2, limit the distance that cohesin extends from origins, thereby determining which active genes, enhancers and silencers bind cohesin. Using RNA-seq we find that Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl influence the expression of most genes sensitive to Nipped-B and cohesin, largely in the same direction. These findings demonstrate that Brca2 regulates sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression in addition to its canonical role in DNA repair and expand the known functions of accessory proteins in cohesins diverse functions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe cohesin protein complex has multiple functions in eukaryotic cells. It ensures that when a cell divides, the two daughter cells receive the correct number of chromosomes. It does this by holding together the sister chromatids that are formed when chromosomes are duplicated by DNA replication. Cohesin also helps repair damaged DNA, and to regulate genes important for growth and development. Even minor deficiencies in some proteins that regulate cohesin cause significant human birth defects. Here we investigated in Drosophila cells how three proteins, Pds5, Wapl and Brca2, determine where cohesin binds to chromosomes, control cohesins ability to hold sister chromatids together, and participate in gene expression. We find that Pds5 and Wapl work together, likely during DNA replication, to determine which genes bind cohesin by controlling how far cohesin spreads out along chromosomes. Pds5 is required for cohesin to hold sister chromatids together, and Brca2 counteracts this function. In contrast to the opposing roles in sister chromatid cohesion, Pds5 and Brca2 work together to facilitate control of gene expression by cohesin. Brca2 plays a critical role in DNA repair, and these studies expand the known roles for Brca2 by showing that it also regulates sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression. BRCA2 mutations in humans increase susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, and these findings raise the possibility that changes in chromosome segregation or gene expression might contribute to the increased cancer risk associated with these mutations.",

Cortical hierarchy is conventionally informed by invasive measurements of long-range projections, creating the need for a principled proxy measure of hierarchy in humans. Moreover, cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in patterns of gene expression, yet organizing principles of its transcriptional architecture remain unclear. We hypothesized that functional specialization of human cortical microcircuitry involves hierarchical gradients of gene expression. We found that a noninvasive neuroimaging measure, the MRI-derived myelin map, reliably indexes hierarchy and closely resembles the dominant pattern of transcriptomic variation across human cortex. We found strong hierarchical gradients in expression profiles of genes related to microcircuit function and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings suggest that hierarchy defines an axis shared by the transcriptomic and anatomical architectures of human cortex, and that hierarchical gradients of microscale properties contribute to macroscale specialization of cortical function.",

To elucidate how capsids maintain stability under harsh conditions, we investigated the capsid components of a hyperthermophilic virus, phage P74-26. We determined the structure of a capsid protein gp87 and show that it has the same fold as trimeric decoration proteins that enhance the structural stability of capsids in many other phage, despite lacking significant sequence homology. We also find that gp87 is significantly more stable than its mesophilic homologs, reflecting the high temperature environment in which phage P74-26 thrives. Our analysis of the gp87 structure reveals that the core domain of the decoration protein is conserved in trimeric capsid components across numerous dsDNA viruses, including human pathogens such as Herpesviruses. Moreover, this core {beta}-barrel domain is found in the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIC1, which suggests a mechanism for the evolution of this broad spectrum Cas9 inhibitor. Our work illustrates the principles for increased stability of a thermophilic decoration protein, and extends the evolutionary reach of the core trimeric decoration protein fold.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the efficacy of applying one class classifiers (OCCs) to the problem of abnormal beat detection in ECG. It also proposes a novel OCC called Quadratic Programming Dissimilarity representation based Data Descriptor (QPDDD). A comparison of the proposed classification technique with existing classifiers over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is presented. Results show that OCCs coupled with wavelet domain features present a practical, robust and scalable solution for handling inter-individual variability in ECG patterns of different types of cardiac beats. An equal error rate of 90-95% was obtained for the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database depending upon the amount of training data used. A major advantage of the proposed scheme is that it requires only normal beats during its training. Another advantage is that it is able to handle inter-individual differences in ECG morphologies as the training takes place separately for each individual.",

    "abstract": "Genome instability is a characteristic of most cancers, contributing to the acquisition of genetic alterations that drive tumor progression. One important source of genome instability is linked to telomere dysfunction in cells with critically short telomeres that lack p53-mediated surveillance of genomic integrity. Here we research the probability that cancer emerges through an evolutionary pathway that includes a telomere-induced phase of genome instability. To implement our models we use a hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach, which allows us to perform large numbers of simulations using biologically realistic population sizes and mutation rates, circumventing the traditional limitations of fully stochastic algorithms. The hybrid methodology should be easily adaptable to a wide range of evolutionary problems. In particular, we model telomere shortening and the acquisition of two mutations: Telomerase activation and p53 inactivation. We find that the death rate of unstable cells, and the number of cell divisions that p53 mutants can sustain beyond the normal senescence setpoint determine the likelihood that the first double mutant originates in a cell with telomere-induced instability. The model has applications to an influential telomerase-null mouse model and p16 silenced human cells. We end by discussing algorithmic performance and a measure for the accuracy of the hybrid approximation.",

    "abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) is known to be involved in stomatal closure. However, its role in stomatal response to rapid increases in the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is unclear. To study this issue, we generated guard cell (GC)-specific ABA-insensitive Arabidopsis plants (GC-specific abi1-1; GCabi). Under normal conditions, the stomatal conductance (gs) and apertures of GCabi plants were greater than those of control plants. This supports GC ABA role as limiting maximal stomatal aperture under non-stressful conditions. When there was a rapid increase in VPD (0.15 to 1 kPa), the gs and stomatal apertures of GCabi decreased in a manner similar that observed in the WT control, but different from that observed in WT plants treated with fusicoccin. Low VPD increased the size of the stomatal apertures of the WT, but not of GCabi. We conclude that GC ABA does not play a significant role in the initial, rapid stomatal closure that occurs in response to an increase in VPD, but is important for stomatal adaptation to ambient VPD. We propose a biphasic angiosperm VPD-sensing model that includes an initial passive-hydraulic, ABA-independent phase and a subsequent ABA-dependent steady-state phase in which stomatal behavior is optimized for ambient VPD conditions.\\n\\nHighlightGuard-cell ABA does not play a significant role in the immediate closure of stomata following an increase in the VPD, but is important for stomatal adaptation to ambient VPD.",

CFTR belongs to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, and gating is controlled by phosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis. Recent ATP-free and ATP-bound structures of zebrafish CFTR revealed an unwound segment of transmembrane helix (TM) 8, which appears to be a unique feature of CFTR not present in other ABC transporter structures. Here, by means of 1 s long molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the interactions formed by this TM8 segment with nearby helices, in both ATP-free and ATP-bound states. We highlight the structural role of TM8 in maintaining the functional architecture of the pore and we describe a distinct membrane defect that is found near TM8 only in the ATP-free state. The results of the MD simulations are discussed in the context of the gating mechanism of CFTR.",

This amazing property is the source of major difficulties in natural language processing. Given the constant increase in published literature, its curation and information extraction would strongly benefit by efficient automatic processes, for which, corpora of sentences evaluated by experts is a valuable resource. Given our interest in applying such approaches to the benefit of curation of the biomedical literature, specifically about gene regulation in microbial organisms, we decided to build a corpus with graded textual similarity evaluated by curators, and designed specifically oriented to our purposes. Based on the predefined statistical power of future analyses, we defined features of the design including sampling, selection criteria, balance, and size among others. A non-fully crossed-design was performed for each pair of sentences by 3 evaluators from 7 different groups, adapting the SEMEVAL scale to our goals in four successive iterative sessions with a clear improvement in the consensuated guidelines and inter-rater-reliability results. Alternatives for the corpus evaluation are widely discussed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first similarity corpus in this domain of knowledge.

    "abstract": "Tumors are heterogeneous - a tumor sample usually consists of a set of subclones with distinct transcriptional profiles and potentially different degrees of aggressiveness and responses to drugs. Understanding tumor heterogeneity is therefore critical for precise cancer prognosis and treatment. In this paper, we introduce BayCount, a Bayesian decomposition method to infer tumor heterogeneity with highly over-dispersed RNA sequencing count data. Using negative binomial factor analysis, BayCount takes into account both the between-sample and gene-specific random effects on raw counts of sequencing reads mapped to each gene. For the posterior inference, we develop an efficient compound Poisson based blocked Gibbs sampler. Simulation studies show that BayCount is able to accurately estimate the subclonal inference, including number of subclones, the proportions of these subclones in each tumor sample, and the gene expression profiles in each subclone. For real-world data examples, we apply BayCount to The Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer and kidney cancer RNA sequencing count data and obtain biologically interpretable results. Our method represents the first effort in characterizing tumor heterogeneity using RNA sequencing count data that simultaneously removes the need of normalizing the counts, achieves statistical robustness, and obtains biologically/clinically meaningful insights. The R package BayCount implementing our model and algorithm is available for download.",

In vertebrates, MCC differentiation critically depends on the synthesis and release of numerous centrioles by specialized structures called deuterosomes. Little is known about the composition, organization and regulation of deuterosomes. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that human deuterosome-stage MCCs are characterized by the expression of many cell cycle-related genes. We further investigated the uncharacterized vertebrate-specific cell division cycle 20B (CDC20B) gene, the host gene of microRNA-449abc. We show that the CDC20B protein associates to deuterosomes and is required for the release of centrioles and the subsequent production of cilia in mouse and Xenopus MCCs. CDC20B interacts with PLK1, which has been shown to coordinate centriole disengagement with the protease Separase in mitotic cells. Strikingly, over-expression of Separase rescued centriole disengagement and cilia production in CDC20B-deficient MCCs. This work reveals the shaping of a new biological function, deuterosome-mediated centriole production in vertebrate MCCs, by adaptation of canonical and recently evolved cell cycle-related molecules.",

The study was terminated early due to loss of equipoise: 63% (21) controls received genomic sequencing as standard tests. Nevertheless, intention to treat analysis showed the rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days to be higher in cases (31%, ten of 32) than controls (3%, one of 33; difference, 28% [95% CI, 10% to 46%]; p=0.003).

It consists of a series of events including the resumption and completion of meiosis, initiation of translation of some maternal mRNAs and destruction of others, and changes to the vitelline envelope.

Despite the importance of this transition in cell and developmental state, it has been difficult to find many of its regulators. We hypothesize that phosphorylation state changes between oocyte and early embryo regulate the activities of proteins that are necessary during or after this transition, and thus that the set of phospho-regulated proteins would be an enriched source for finding critical players in the egg-to-embryo transition. To test this, we used germline-specific RNAi to examine the function of 189 maternal proteins that are phospho-regulated during egg activation in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 53 genes whose knockdown reduced or abolished egg production, as well as 50 genes for which maternal knockdown led to significant impairment or abolishment of the eggs ability to hatch (hatchability). We observed different stages of developmental arrest in the embryos with impaired hatchability and several distinct categories of abnormalities in the maternal knockdown embryos that arrest early in development, suggesting potential roles of the candidates in egg activation and early embryogenesis. Our results, validated by our detection of multiple genes with previously-documented maternal-effect phenotypes among the proteins we tested, revealed 15 genes with new roles in egg activation and early embryogenesis. Given that protein phospho-regulation also occurs during this transition in other organisms, we suggest that the phospho-regulated proteins may provide an enriched dataset for identifying important players in the egg-to-embryo transition.",

    "abstract": "During development, cells must coordinate their differentiation with their growth and organization to form complex multicellular structures such as tissues and organs. Healthy tissues must maintain these structures during homeostasis. Epithelia are packed ensembles of cells from which the different tissues of the organism will originate during embryogenesis. A large barrier to the analysis of the morphogenetic changes in epithelia is the lack of simple tools that enable the quantification of cell arrangements. Here we present EpiGraph, an image analysis tool that quantifies epithelial organization. Our method combines computational geometry and graph theory to measure the degree of order of any packed tissue. EpiGraph goes beyond the traditional polygon distribution analysis, capturing other organizational traits that improve the characterization of epithelia. EpiGraph can objectively compare the rearrangements of epithelial cells during development and homeostasis to quantify how the global ensemble is affected. Importantly, it has been implemented in the open-access platform FIJI. This makes EpiGraph very user friendly, with no programming skills required.",

    "abstract": "Division of labor within and between the worker and queen castes is thought to underlie the tremendous success of social insects. Colonies might benefit if subsets of nurse workers specialize further in caring for larvae of a certain stage or caste, given that larval nutritional requirements depend on stage and caste. We used short- (<1 hr) and long-term (ten days) behavioral observations to determine whether nurses of the pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis) exhibit such specialization. We found that nurses were behaviorally specialized based on larval instar but not on larval caste. This specialization was widespread, with 56% of nurses in the short-term and between 22-27% in the long-term showing significant specialization. Additionally, we identified [~]200 genes that were differentially expressed in nurse head and abdominal tissues between nurses feeding young versus old larvae. These included 18 genes predicted to code for secreted proteins, which may be passed from nurses to larvae via trophallaxis, as well as vitellogenin and major royal jelly protein-1, which have previously been implicated in the transfer of nutrition from nurse to larvae and the regulation of larval development and caste in social insects. Altogether, our results provide the first evidence in any social insect for a division of labor among nurse workers based on larval stage, and our study begins to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this specialization.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor ligand amphiregulin (AREG) is a potent growth factor implicated in proliferative skin diseases and in primary and metastatic epithelial cancers. AREG in vitro, synthesized as a pro-peptide, requires conversion to an active peptide by metalloproteases by a process known as ectodomain shedding. Although, (Adam17) a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 is implicated in ectodomain shedding of AREG, it remains to be established in vivo whether ADAM17 contributes to AREG shedding. In the present study, using a curly bare (Rhbdf2cub) mouse model that shows loss-of-hair, enlarged sebaceous glands, and rapid cutaneous wound-healing phenotypes mediated by enhanced Areg mRNA and protein levels, we sought to identify the principal ectodomain sheddase of AREG. To this end, we generated Rhbdf2cub mice lacking ADAM17 specifically in the skin and examined the above phenotypes of Rhbdf2cub mice. We find that ADAM17 deficiency in the skin of Rhbdf2cub mice restores a full hair coat, prevents sebaceous-gland enlargement, and impairs the rapid wound-healing phenotype observed in Rhbdf2cub mice. Furthermore, in vitro, stimulated shedding of AREG is abolished in Rhbdf2cub mouse embryonic keratinocytes lacking ADAM17. Thus, our data demonstrate that ADAM17 is the major ectodomain sheddase of AREG.",

Here, we evaluate whether PheWAS can inform target validation during drug development. We selected 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to 19 candidate drug targets for common disease therapeutic indications. We independently interrogated these SNPs through PheWAS in four large \\\"real-world data\\\" cohorts (23andMe, UK Biobank, FINRISK, CHOP) for association with a total of 1,892 binary endpoints. We then conducted meta-analyses for 145 harmonized disease endpoints in up to 697,815 individuals and joined results with summary statistics from 57 published GWAS. Our analyses replicate 70% of known GWAS associations and identify 10 novel associations with study-wide significance after multiple test correction (P<1.8x10-6; out of 72 novel associations with FDR<0.1). By leveraging directionality and point estimate of the effect sizes, we describe new associations that may predict ADEs, e.g., acne, high cholesterol, gout and gallstones for rs738409 (p.I148M) in PNPLA3; or asthma for rs1990760 (p.T946A) in IFIH1. We further propose how quantitative estimates of genetic safety/efficacy profiles can be used to help prioritize candidate targets for a specific indication.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlycosylphosphatidylinositol Biosynthesis Defects (GPIBDs) cause a group of phenotypically overlapping recessive syndromes with intellectual disability, for which pathogenic mutations have been described in 16 genes of the corresponding molecular pathway. An elevated serum activity of alkaline phosphatase (AP), a GPI-linked enzyme, has been used to assign GPIBDs to the phenotypic series of Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation Syndrome (HPMRS) and to distinguish them from another subset of GPIBDs, termed Multiple Congenital Anomalies Hypotonia Seizures syndrome (MCAHS). However, the increasing number of individuals with a GPIBD shows that hyperphosphatasia is a variable feature that is not ideal for a clinical classification.\\n\\nMethodsWe studied the discriminatory power of multiple GPI-linked substrates that were assessed by flow cytometry in blood cells and fibroblasts of 39 and 14 individuals with a GPIBD, respectively. On the phenotypic level, we evaluated the frequency of occurrence of clinical symptoms and analyzed the performance of computer-assisted image analysis of the facial gestalt in 91 individuals.\\n\\nResultsWe found that certain malformations such as Morbus Hirschsprung and Diaphragmatic defects are more likely to be associated with particular gene defects (PIGV, PGAP3, PIGN). However, especially at the severe end of the clinical spectrum of HPMRS, there is a high phenotypic overlap with MCAHS. Elevation of AP has also been documented in some of the individuals with MCAHS, namely those with PIGA mutations. Although the impairment of GPI-linked substrates is supposed to play the key role in the pathophysiology of GPIBDs, we could not observe gene-specific profiles for flow cytometric markers or a correlation between their cell surface levels and the severity of the phenotype. In contrast, it was facial recognition software that achieved the highest accuracy in predicting the disease-causing gene in a GPIBD.\\n\\nConclusionsDue to the overlapping clinical spectrum of both, HPMRS and MCAHS, in the majority of affected individuals, the elevation of AP and the reduced surface levels of GPI-linked markers in both groups, a common classification as GPIBDs is recommended. The effectiveness of computer-assisted gestalt analysis for the correct gene inference in a GPIBD and probably beyond is remarkable and illustrates how the information contained in human faces is pivotal in the delineation of genetic entities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicroRNAs proceeds through the different canonical and non-canonical pathways; the most frequent of the non-canonical ones is the splicing-dependent biogenesis of mirtrons. We compare the mirtrons and non-mirtrons of human and mouse to explore how their maturation appears in the precursor structure around the miRNA.\\n\\nResultsWe found the coherence of the overhang lengths what indicates the dependence between the cleavage sites. To explain this dependence we suggest the 2-lever model of the Dicer structure that couples the imprecisions in Drosha and Dicer. Considering the secondary structure of all animal pre-miRNAs we confirmed that single-stranded nucleotides tend to be located near the miRNA boundaries and in its center and are characterized by a higher mutation rate. The 5' end of the canonical 5' miRNA approaches the nearest single-stranded nucleotides what suggests the extension of the loop-counting rule from the Dicer to the Drosha cleavage site. A typical structure of the annotated mirtron pre-miRNAs differs from the canonical pre-miRNA structure and possesses the 1- and 2nt hanging ends at the hairpin base. Together with the excessive variability of the mirtron Dicer cleavage site (that could be partially explained by guanine at its ends inherited from splicing) this is one more evidence for the 2-lever model. In contrast with the canonical miRNAs the mirtrons have higher snp densities and their pre-miRNAs are inversely associated with diseases. Therefore we supported the view that mirtrons are under positive selection while canonical miRNAs are under negative one and we suggested that mirtrons are an intrinsic source of silencing variability which produces the disease-promoting variants. Finally, we considered the interference of the pre-miRNA structure and the U2snRNA:pre-mRNA basepairing. We analyzed the location of the branchpoints and found that mirtron structure tends to expose the branchpoint site what suggests that the mirtrons can readily evolve from occasional hairpins in the immediate neighbourhood of the 3' splice site.\\n\\nConclusionThe miRNA biogenesis manifests itself in the footprints of the secondary structure. Close inspection of these structural properties can help to uncover new pathways of miRNA biogenesis and to refine the known miRNA data, in particular, new non-canonical miRNAs may be predicted or the known miRNAs can be re-classified.",

In contrast to conventional B-2 cells they have a receptor repertoire that is biased towards bacterial and self-antigens, promoting a rapid response to infection and clearing of apoptotic cells. Although B-1a cells are known to primarily originate from fetal tissues the mechanisms by which they arise has been a topic of debate for many years. Here we show that in the fetal liver (FL) versus bone marrow (BM) environment, reduced IL-7R/STAT5 levels promote immunoglobulin kappa (Igk) recombination at the early pro-B cell stage. As a result, B cells can directly generate a mature B cell receptor (BCR) and bypass the requirement for a pre-BCR and pairing with surrogate light chain (SLC). This  alternate pathway of development enables the production of B cells with self reactive, skewed specificity receptors that are peculiar to the B-1a compartment. Together our findings connect seemingly opposing models of B-1a cell development and explain how these cells acquire their unique properties.",

However, metabolic reprogramming of TH17 cells in vivo and its regulation during autoimmunity and host defence is unknown. Here we report that TH17 cells derived in vivo show discrete metabolic states. Metabolic states of TH17 cells in vivo were controlled at the epigenetic level, with conserved regulatory region of key metabolic regulators show distinct chromatin accessibility as demonstrated by chromatin landscape profiling. TGF-{beta}1 signaling was further shown to be crucial for remodeling of TH17 cell chromatin states, Ahr and miR-21 were identified as essential metabolic regulators for TH17 cells. Understanding metabolic reprogramming of TH17 cells in vivo may therefore provide more defined therapeutic intervention to TH17 cell mediated autoimmune diseases and insights into TH17 cell mediated host defence.",

    "abstract": "Influenza pseudotypes represent an alternative to wild type virus for serological assays. To date, pseudotypes (PV) have predominantly been used as surrogates for wild type viruses in microneutralisation assays, where the surface glycoprotein of interest and a reporter gene (such as Luciferase) are used to assess if virus entry into target cells could be inhibited by serum antibodies. The influenza neuraminidase (NA) has the ability to bud and release new virions with or without the contribution of Haemagglutinin (HA). Influenza pseudotypes expressing NA alone, or with HA, were produced to evaluate the antibody response against NA using the enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). The expression of an avian HA with human NAs has enabled the detection of specific antibody reponses against the human circulating subtypes of NA. Within this study a PV-based ELLA assay has been investigated with a pilot panel of sera prepared for an international CONSISE study. Preliminary results have confirmed that the assay is sensitive and could potentially represent a valid alternative to the classical ELLA assay, which requires the employment of reassortant viruses.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of desertification across our planet is accelerating as the result of human activity and global climate change. In hyper-arid deserts, endolithic microbial communities colonize the rocks interior as a survival strategy. Yet, the composition of these communities and the drivers promoting their assembly are still poorly understood. Using a sampling strategy that minimized climate regime and biogeography effects, we analyzed the diversity and community composition of endoliths from four different lithic substrates - calcite, gypsum, ignimbrite and granite - collected in the hyper-arid zone of the Atacama Desert, Chile. By combining microscopy, mineralogy, and high throughput sequencing, we found these communities to be highly specific to their lithic substrate, although they were all dominated by the same four main phyla, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria. This finding indicates a fine scale diversification of the microbial reservoir driven by substrate properties. Our data suggest that the overall rock chemistry is not an essential driver of community structure and we propose that the architecture of the rock, i.e. the space available for colonization and its physical structure, linked to water retention capabilities, is ultimately the driver of community diversity and composition at the dry limit of life.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementIn this study, we demonstrated that endolithic microbial communities are highly specific to their substrates, suggesting a fine scale diversification of the available microbial reservoir. By using an array of rock substrates from the same climatic region, we established, for the first time, that the architecture of the rock is linked to water retention and is ultimately the driver of community diversity and composition at the dry limit for life.",

    "abstract": "Haloarchaea in their natural environment are exposed to hyper-salinity, intense solar radiation, and desiccation, all of which generate high levels of oxidative stress. Previous work has shown that Haloarchaea are an order of magnitude more resistant to oxidative stress than most mesophilic organisms. Despite this resistance, the pathways Haloarchaea use to respond to oxidative stress damage are similar to that of non-resistant organisms suggesting that regulatory processes might be key to their robustness. Recently, small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) were discovered in Archaea under a variety of environmental conditions. We report here the transcriptional landscape and functional roles of sRNAs in the regulation of the oxidative stress response of the model haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. Thousands of sRNAs, both intergenic and antisense, were discovered using strand-specific sRNA-seq, comprising around 30% of the transcriptome during non-challenged and oxidative stress conditions. We identified hundreds of differentially expressed sRNAs in response to hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress in H. volcanii. Targets of antisense sRNAs decreased in expression when sRNAs were up-regulated indicating that sRNAs are likely playing a negative regulatory role on mRNA targets at the transcript level. Target enrichment of these antisense sRNAs included mRNAs involved in transposons mobility, chemotaxis signaling, peptidase activity, and transcription factors.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWhile a substantial body of experimental work has been done to uncover functions of sRNAs in gene regulation in Bacteria and Eukarya, the functional roles of sRNAs in Archaea are still poorly understood. This study is the first to establish the regulatory effects of sRNAs on mRNAs during the oxidative stress response in the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. Our work demonstrates that common principles for the response to a major cellular stress exist across the 3 domains of life while uncovering pathways that might be specific to the Archaea. This work also underscores the relevance of sRNAs in adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.",

Clinical isolates were monitored via the hospital laboratory. Colonizing and clinical isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\\n\\nResultsK. pneumoniae throat carriage prevalence was 4.1%, rectal carriage 10.8% and ESBL carriage 1.7%. K. pneumoniae infection incidence was 1.2%. The isolates were diverse, and most patients were colonized or infected with a unique phylogenetic lineage, with no evidence of transmission in the wards. ESBL strains carried blaCTX-M-15 and belonged to clones associated with hospital-acquired ESBL infections in other countries (ST29, ST323, ST340).\\n\\nOne also carried the carbapenemase blaIMP-26.

    "abstract": "Bacterial binary division requires the accurate placement of the division machinery. FtsZ, the vital component of the division machinery, can assemble into filaments and self-organize into a ring structure (Z-ring) at the proper site for cell division. Thus, understanding how bacteria control the spatiotemporal formation of the FtsZ ring is crucial for small molecule and nanoparticle antibacterial drug discovery. MapZ, a recently identified FtsZ regulator in Streptococcaceae, has been found to localize at the mid-cell and position the FtsZ ring. However, the mechanism is still unclear. Here, by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution imaging, and single molecule tracking, we investigated the mechanism by which MapZ regulates the FtsZ ring position. The results show that FtsZ exhibites dynamic treadmilling motion in S. mutans. Importantly, depletion of MapZ leads to an unconstrained movement of treadmilling FtsZ filaments and a shorter lifetime of the constricting FtsZ ring. Furthermore, by revealing that MapZ forms an immobile ring-like nanostructure at the division site, our study suggests that MapZ forms a stable ring that acts as a nanotrack to guide and restrict treadmilling FtsZ filaments in S. mutans, representing a novel way in which bacteria control the division.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAssociations between dopamine receptor levels and pro- and antisocial behavior have previously been demonstrated in human subjects using positron emission tomography (PET) and self-rated measures of personality traits. So far, only one study has focused on the D1-dopamine receptor (D1-R), [fi]nding a positive correlation with the trait social desirability, which is characterized by low dominant and high af[fi]liative behavior, while physical aggression showed a negative correlation. The aim of the present study was to replicate these previous [fi]ndings using a new independent sample of subjects.\\n\\nMethodsTwenty-six healthy males were examined with the radioligand [11C]SCH-23390, and completed the Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP) which includes measures of social desirability and physical trait aggression. The simpli[fi]ed reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region was used to calculate BPND values in the whole striatum and limbic striatum. The two regions were selected since they showed strong association between D1-R availability and personality scores in the previous study. Pearsons correlation coef[fi]cients and replication Bayes factors were then employed to assess the replicability and robustness of previous results.\\n\\nResultsThere were no signi[fi]cant correlations (all p values > 0.3) between regional BPND values and personality scale scores. Replication Bayes factors showed strong to moderate evidence in favor no relationship between D1-receptor availability and social desirability (striatum BF01 = 12.4; limbic striatum BF01 = 7.2) or physical aggression scale scores (limbic striatum BF01 = 3.3), compared to the original correlations.\\n\\nDiscussionWe could not replicate the previous [fi]ndings of associations between D1-R availability and either pro- or antisocial behavior as measured using the SSP. Rather, there was evidence in favor of failed replications of associations between BPND and scale scores. Potential reasons for these results are restrictive variance in both PET and personality outcomes due to high sample homogeneity, or that the previous [fi]ndings were false positives.",

    "abstract": "The Bayesian model of confidence posits that confidence is the observers posterior probability that the decision is correct. It has been proposed that researchers can gain evidence in favor of the Bayesian model by deriving qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence, i.e., patterns that one would expect to see if an observer was Bayesian, and looking for those signatures in human or animal data. We examine two proposed qualitative signatures, showing that their derivations contain hidden assumptions that limit their applicability, and that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for Bayesian confidence. One signature is an average confidence of 0.75 for trials with neutral evidence. This signature only holds when class-conditioned stimulus distributions do not overlap and internal noise is very low. Another signature is that, as stimulus magnitude increases, confidence increases on correct trials but decreases on incorrect trials. This signature is also dependent on stimulus distribution type. There is an alternative form of this signature that has been applied in the literature; we find no indication that it is expected under Bayesian confidence, which resolves an ostensible discrepancy. We conclude that, to determine the nature of the computations underlying confidence reports, there may be no shortcut to quantitative model comparison.",

We provide evidence for context dependent switching by NE that is analogous to this explore/exploit strategy in the vocal system of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Stimulation of the locus coeruleus, the major source of norepinephrine in the brain, decreases song trial-to-trial variability transforming the variable, exploratory \\\"undirected\\\" song into song that resembles the more stereotyped, exploitative \\\"directed\\\" song males sing to females. This behavioral switch is mediated by NE acting directly on a cortical motor nucleus that integrates inputs from a premotor cortical nucleus and a basal ganglia circuit necessary for vocal motor learning.

    "abstract": "Atypical sensory processing is a core characteristic in autism spectrum disorders1 that negatively impacts virtually all activities of daily living. Sensory symptoms are predictive of the subsequent appearance of impaired social behavior and other autistic traits2, 3. Thus, a better understanding of the changes in neural circuitry that disrupt perceptual learning in autism could shed light into the mechanistic basis and potential therapeutic avenues for a range of autistic symptoms2. Likewise, the lack of directly comparable behavioral paradigms in both humans and animal models currently limits the translational potential of discoveries in the latter. We adopted a symptom-to-circuit approach to uncover the circuit-level alterations in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) that underlie atypical visual discrimination in this disorder4, 5. Using a go/no-go task and in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging in primary visual cortex (V1), we find that impaired discrimination in Fmr1-/- mice correlates with marked deficits in orientation tuning of principal neurons, and a decrease in the activity of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in V1. Restoring visually evoked activity in PV cells in Fmr1-/- mice with a chemogenetic (DREADD) strategy was sufficient to rescue their behavioral performance. Finally, we found that human subjects with FXS exhibit strikingly similar impairments in visual discrimination as Fmr1-/- mice. We conclude that manipulating orientation tuning in autism could improve visually guided behaviors that are critical for playing sports, driving or judging emotions.",

Phenotypic differences between leopard and longfin zebrafish were exploited in order to elucidate the role of phasic serotonin in aggressive displays on this species. The present study revealed differences in aggressive display between leopard and longfin zebrafish, and a discrepant effect of acute fluoxetine in both populations. In mirror-induced aggression, leopard animals showed higher display latencies than longfin, as well as lower display duration and frequency (Experiment 1). Moreover, 2.5 mg/kg fluoxetine decreased the duration and frequency of display in longfin, but not leopard; and 5 mg/kg fluoxetine increased display frequency in leopard, but not longfin (Experiment 2). It is suggested that zebrafish from the longfin phenotype show more aggressive motivation and readiness in the mirror-induced aggression test that leopard, and that acute fluoxetine increases aggression in leopard and decreased it in longfin zebrafish.",

In the first study, we implemented a fully automated closed-loop system that allows for user-friendly recording environments. Subjects were presented online with visual feedback on their ongoing AAD performance. Following these results we implemented a longitudinal case study in which two subjects were presented with AAD sessions during four weeks. The results prove the feasibility of a fully working online (neuro)feedback system for AAD decoding. The detected changes in AAD for the feedback subject during and after training suggest that changes in AAD may be achieved via training. This is early evidence of such training effects and needs to be confirmed in future studies to evaluate training of AAD in more detail. Finally, the large number of sessions allowed to examine the correlation between the stimuli (i.e. acoustic stories) and AAD performance which was found to be significant. Future studies are suggested to evaluate their acoustic stimuli with care to prevent spurious associations.",

The diverse postulated mechanisms by which TDP43 mutations cause the disease are not fully understood. Human wildtype and TDP43 S393L and G294V mutant spinal motor neuron cultures were differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs. Mutant hTDP43 and wildtype motor neuron cultures did not differ in neuron differentiation capacity during early maturation stage. During aging we detected a dramatic neurodegeneration including neuron loss and pathological neurofilament abnormalities in TDP43 mutant cultures only. Additionally mitochondria and lysosomes of aging spinal motor neurons revealed robust TDP43 mutation dependent abnormal phenotypes in size, shape, speed and motility which all appeared without TDP43 mislocalization or aggregation formation. Furthermore, D-sorbitol - known to induce stress granules and cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP43 - rescued axonal trafficking phenotypes without any signs of TDP43 mislocalization or aggregation formation. Our data indicate TDP43 mutation-dependent but cytosolic aggregation-independent mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in TDP43 ALS.",

    "abstract": "Statins are generally well-tolerated, but can induce myopathy. Statins are associated with impaired expression of PGC-1{beta} in human and rat skeletal muscle. The current study was performed to investigate the relation between PGC-1{beta} expression and function and statin-associated myopathy. In WT mice, atorvastatin impaired mitochondrial function in glycolytic, but not in oxidative muscle. In PGC-1{beta} KO mice, atorvastatin induced a shift from oxidative type IIA to glycolytic type IIB myofibers mainly in oxidative muscle and mitochondrial dysfunction was observed in both muscle types. In glycolytic muscle of WT and KO mice and in oxidative muscle of KO mice, atorvastatin suppressed mitochondrial proliferation and oxidative defense, leading to apoptosis. In contrast, mitochondrial function was maintained or improved and apoptosis decreased by atorvastatin in oxidative muscle of WT mice. In conclusion, PGC-1{beta} has an important role in preventing damage to oxidative muscle in the presence of a mitochondrial toxicant such as atorvastatin.",

    "abstract": "Early pathogen exposure detection allows better patient care and faster implementation of public health measures (patient isolation, contact tracing). Existing exposure detection most frequently relies on overt clinical symptoms, namely fever, during the infectious prodromal period. We have developed a robust machine learning based method to better detect asymptomatic states during the incubation period using subtle, sub-clinical physiological markers. Starting with high-resolution physiological waveform data from non-human primate studies of viral (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Nipah viruses) and bacterial (Y. pestis) exposure, we processed the data to reduce short-term variability and normalize diurnal variations, then provided these to a supervised random forest classification algorithm and post-classifier declaration logic step to reduce false alarms. In most subjects detection is achieved well before the onset of fever; subject cross-validation across exposure studies (varying viruses, exposure routes, animal species, and target dose) lead to 51h mean early detection (at 0.93 area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUCROC]). Evaluating the algorithm against entirely independent datasets for Lassa, Nipah, and Y. pestis exposures un-used in algorithm training and development yields a mean 51h early warning time (at AUCROC=0.95). We discuss which physiological indicators are most informative for early detection and options for extending this capability to limited datasets such as those available from wearable, non-invasive, ECG-based sensors.",

    "abstract": "Despite the continuous renewal and turnover of the small intestinal epithelium, the intestinal stem cell niche maintains a  soccer ball-like, alternating pattern of stem and Paneth cells in the crypt. To study the robustness of the niche pattern, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in mice with fluorescently-labeled Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells and precisely perturbed the mosaic pattern with femtosecond laser ablation. Ablation of one to three cells initiated rapid motion of niche cells that restored the alternation in the crypt pattern within about two hours without any cell proliferation. Crypt cells then performed a coordinated dilation of the crypt lumen, which resulted in peristalsis-like motion that forced damaged cells out of the niche. Crypt cell motion was reduced with inhibition of the ROCK pathway and attenuated with old age, and both resulted in incomplete pattern recovery. This suggests that in addition to proliferation and self-renewal, motility of stem cells is critical for maintaining homeostasis. Reduction of this novel behavior of stem cells could contribute to disease and age-related changes.",

This problem is frequently faced when assessing whether a cell synchronization experiment was successful or not. In this case the goal is to determine whether the DNA content is best represented by a unimodal, indicating successful synchronization, or bimodal, indicating unsuccessful synchronization, distribution. This choice of bin size can greatly affect the interpretation of the results; however, it can be avoided by fitting the data to a cumulative distribution function (CDF). Fitting data to a CDF removes the need for bin size selection. The sorted data can also be used to reconstruct an approximate probability density function (PDF) without selecting a bin size. A simple CDF-based approach is presented and the benefits and drawbacks relative to usual methods are discussed.",

Using large-scale genomic data, the complexity in several viruses was compared. Interestingly, the co-evolutionary relations were primarily intra-protein in avian influenza and inter-protein in HIV-1. The network degree distributions showed two universality classes: a power-law with exponent -1 in HIV-1 and avian-influenza, random co-evolutionary behavior in human flu and dengue, suggesting the co-evolution as one way to statistically classify the complexity in viruses. The observed correlation between the network densities and the strengths on virus Richter scale raises interesting questions on whether it is possible to define the complexity of viruses using their evolutionary networks.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the regulation of gene expression has been strongly benefited by the availability of high throughput technologies that enable questioning the whole genome for the binding of specific transcription factors and expression profiles. In the case of genome models, such as Escherichia coli K-12, this knowledge needs to be integrated with the legacy of accumulated genetics and molecular biology pre-genomic knowledge in order to attain deeper levels in the understanding of their biology. In spite of the several repositories and curated databases, there is no effort, nor electronic site yet, to comprehensively integrate the available knowledge from all these different sources around the regulation of gene expression of E. coli K-12. In this paper, we describe a first effort to expand RegulonDB, the database containing the rich legacy of decades of classic molecular biology experiments supporting what we know about gene regulation and operon organization in E. coli K-12, to include the genome-wide data set collections from 25 ChIP and 18 gSELEX publications, respectively, in addition to around 60 expression profiles used in their curation. Three essential features for the integration of this information coming from different methodological approaches are; first, a controlled vocabulary within an ontology for precisely defining growth conditions, second, the criteria to separate elements with enough evidence to consider them involved in gene regulation from isolated sites, and third, an expanded computational model supporting this knowledge. Altogether, this constitutes the basis for adequately gathering and enabling the comparisons and integration strongly needed to manage and access such wealth of knowledge. This version of RegulonBD is a first step toward what should become the unifying access point for current and future knowledge on gene regulation in E. coli K-12. Furthermore, this model platform and associated methodologies and criteria, can well be emulated for gathering knowledge on other microbial organisms.",

In this study, we identify numerous TE-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) by conducting Argonaute2 RNA Immunoprecipitation followed by small RNA sequencing (AGO2 RIP-seq) on human brain tissue. Many of these miRNAs originated from LINE-2 (L2) elements, which entered the human genome around 100-300 million years ago. We found that L2-miRNAs derive from the 3 end of the L2 consensus sequence and thus share very similar sequences, indicating that they could target transcripts with L2s in their 3UTR. In line with this, we found that many protein-coding genes carry fragments of L2-derived sequences in their 3UTR, which serve as target sites for L2-miRNAs. L2-miRNAs and targets were generally ubiquitously expressed at low levels in multiple human tissues, suggesting a role for this network in buffering transcriptional levels of housekeeping genes. Interestingly, we also found evidence that this network is perturbed in glioblastoma. In summary, our findings uncover a TE-based post-transcriptional network that shapes transcriptional regulation in human cells.",

Identification and isolation of HSCs for study has depended on the expression of combinations of surface markers on HSCs that reliably distinguish it from other cell types. However, the increasing number of markers required to isolate HSCs has made it tedious, expensive, and difficult for newcomers, suggesting the need for a simpler panel of HSC markers. We previously showed that phenotypic HSCs could be separated based on expression of CD11a, and that only the CD11a negative fraction contained true HSCs. Here, we show that CD11a and another HSC marker, EPCR, can be used to effectively identify and purify HSCs. We introduce a new two-color HSC sorting method that can highly enrich for HSCs with efficiencies comparable to the gold standard combination of CD150 and CD48. Our results demonstrate that adding CD11a and EPCR to the HSC biologists toolkit improves the purity of and simplifies isolation of HSCs.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe study of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their purification for transplantation requires a panel of surface markers that can be used to distinguish HSCs from other cell types. The number of markers necessary to identify HSCs continues to grow, making it increasingly difficult to identify HSCs by flow cytometry. In this study, we identified a combination of two surface markers, CD11a and EPCR, to enrich for HSCs in the mouse bone marrow without the need for additional markers. This simplified panel could aid HSC research by reducing the number of markers necessary to identify and isolate HSCs.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the vaginal microbiome, including both the presence of pathogens involved in sexually transmitted infections (STI) as well as commensal microbiota, has been shown to have important associations for a womans reproductive and general health. Currently, healthcare providers cannot offer comprehensive vaginal microbiome screening, but are limited to the detection of individual pathogens, such as high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), the predominant cause of cervical cancer. There is no single test on the market that combines HPV, STI, and microbiome screening. Here, we describe a novel inclusive womens health assay that combines self-sampling with sequencing-based HPV detection and genotyping, vaginal microbiome analysis, and STI-associated pathogen detection. The assay includes genotyping and detection of 14 hrHPV types, 5 low-risk HPV types (lrHPV), as well as the relative abundance of 32 bacterial taxa of clinical importance, including Lactobacillus, Sneathia, Gardnerella, and 4 pathogens involved in STI, with high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. For each of these taxa, healthy ranges were determined in a group of 50 self-reported healthy women. The hrHPV portion of the test was evaluated against the Digene High-Risk HPV HC2 DNA test with vaginal samples obtained from 185 women. Results were concordant for 181/185 of the samples (overall agreement of 97.83%, Cohens kappa = 0.93), with sensitivity and specificity values of 94.74% and 98.64%, respectively. Two discrepancies were caused by the Digene assays known cross-reactivity with low-risk HPV types, while two additional samples were found to contain hrHPV not detected by Digene. This novel assay could be used to complement conventional cervical cancer screening, because its self-sampling format can expand access among women who would otherwise not participate, and because of its additional information about the composition of the vaginal microbiome and the presence of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "X-ray crystallography is experiencing a renaissance as a method for probing the protein conformational ensemble. The inherent limitations of Bragg analysis, however, which only reveals the mean structure, have given way to a surge in interest in diffuse scattering, which is caused by structure variations. Diffuse scattering is present in all macromolecular crystallography experiments. Recent studies are shedding light on the origins of diffuse scattering in protein crystallography, and provide clues for leveraging diffuse scattering to model protein motions with atomic detail.",

    "abstract": "Allostery is an inherent feature of proteins and provides alternative routes to regulating function. Small-molecule allosteric inhibitors are often desirable; however, it remains challenging to identify surface sites in proteins which can bind small molecules and modulate function. We identified new allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by combining multiple-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments and structure determination from hundreds of individual small-molecule fragment soaks. New modeling approaches reveal \\\"hidden\\\" low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands. Our results converge on a new allosteric site that is conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop, a hotspot for fragment binding, not conserved in the closest homolog, and distinct from other recently reported allosteric sites in PTP1B. Targeting this site with covalently tethered molecules allosterically inhibits enzyme activity. Overall, this work demonstrates how the ensemble nature of macromolecular structure revealed by multitemperature crystallography can be exploited for developing allosteric modulators.",

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that during economic decisions, striatal neurons represent the values associated with different actions. This hypothesis is based on a large number of studies, in which the neural activity of striatal neurons was measured while the subject was learning to prefer the more rewarding action. Here we show that these publications are subject to at least one of two critical confounds and that most are subject to both. First, we show that even weak temporal correlations in the neuronal data may result in an erroneous identification of action-value representations. We demonstrate this by erroneously identifying action-value representations, both in simulations and in the neural activity recorded in unrelated experiments. Second, we show that the experiments and analyses designed to dissociate action-value representation from the representation of other decision variables cannot do so. Specifically, we show that neurons representing policy may be erroneous identified as representing action-values. We suggest different solutions to identifying action-value representation that are not subject to these confounds. Applying one of these solutions to previously identified action-value neurons in the basal ganglia we fail to detect action-value representations there. Thus, we conclude that the claim that striatal neurons encode action-values must await new experiments and analyses.",
